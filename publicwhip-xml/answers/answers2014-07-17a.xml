The regulation of the electricity and gas markets, including the retail segments of these markets, is the responsibility of the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). The Electricity Regulation Act, 1999 provided for the establishment of the CER as an independent statutory regulator. Since its establishment, there have been a number of changes to the regulatory framework, and CER&rsquo;s functions, in line with the continually evolving energy policy landscape and partly as a result of EU obligations.</p><p>  The CER has a statutory responsibility to regulate the supply and purchase of electricity in both the wholesale and retail electricity markets. Any person or company who intends to supply electricity to a final customer, including to a local authority, requires a supply licence from the CER. The CER grants a licence to supply electricity under section 14(1) of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999.</p><p>  The supply and purchase of heat is not a regulated matter and local authorities and others are free to purchase heat as they see fit, whether the producer is a microgenerator or not.</p><p>It is important to note that the procurement of energy supplies by local authorities is not a matter in which I, as Minister, have any role or function. Rather, public sector procurement is generally a matter for the Office of Government Procurement (OGP). The current Framework Agreement for the supply of electricity to the Irish public sector runs to 20 October 2014. Matters pertaining to the OGP are the responsibility of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  </p></reply>

The 2009 Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our overall energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. In order to meet this overall target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heating and 10% of transport power from renewable sources. At the end of 2012, 19.6% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity requirements came from renewable sources with 5.2% of our heat requirements and 2.4% of energy in transport coming from renewables. This equated to 7.1% of overall energy from renewables. </p><p>  In order to support development of renewable electricity generation, policy interventions are designed to incentivise the market to deliver the necessary renewable generation capacity. The choice of technology is ultimately a commercial decision for individual project developers. Currently the REFIT schemes are the primary means through which electricity from renewable sources is supported in Ireland. These schemes support electricity generated from a range of renewable sources including hydro, biomass combustion, biomass combined heat and power, landfill gas and onshore wind and are paid for by electricity customers through the Public Service Obligation.</p><p>  To date wind energy has proved to be the most commercial technology in the Irish market and provisional figures for 2013 indicate that 16.4% of energy demand in the electricity sector was met from wind. Nevertheless, diversification of the renewable generation portfolio in the longer term will be important for creating a sustainable, carbon free, electricity system. In this regard, biomass will have a role to play and, depending on electricity demand, the full implementation of current policies could mean that up to 5% of electricity may be generated from biomass in 2020.</p><p>Biomass, however, is likely to have a more significant role in the heat and transport sectors where fewer alternative technologies exist. Furthermore, estimates by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland show that current policies on their own will not deliver 12% renewable energy in the heat sector. The analysis underpinning the draft Bioenergy Plan, recently approved by Government, is that an additional bioenergy-focused measure in the heat sector would be a cost effective means of meeting Ireland's renewable energy targets. The Plan, therefore, recommends, subject to State Aid clearance and further Government approval, that a scheme be introduced that would incentivise larger heat users to convert to biomass heating solutions. My Department is progressing these outstanding issues and I will revert to Government with a fuller proposal in due course.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-07-17a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/997" speakername="Joe McHugh" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014071700041#WRA01600"><p>Since the 1960s, exploration activity in the Irish Offshore has yielded four commercial gas fields and no commercial oil discoveries. Exploration offshore Ireland is expensive due to its remoteness and water depths. The cost of drilling a single deep-water well in the Atlantic can be in excess of &euro;100 million. Limited infrastructure, such as pipelines, terminals and platforms, pushes up the cost of development and negatively affects the commerciality of oil and gas discoveries. As a consequence, exploration for oil and gas in the Irish offshore is both a costly and high risk investment.    The recent Wood Mackenzie Report on Ireland&rsquo;s oil and gas fiscal terms considered, as alternatives to the current concession system, the establishment of a state hydrocarbon exploration company and of introducing production sharing contracts. Wood Mackenzie identify the potential benefits and risks associated with both models and concludes that at this time Government should not introduce a mandatory State participation in future licences, nor should Government change to a production sharing system. </p><p>  While Wood Mackenzie recognise that an efficient State hydrocarbon exploration company could be a helpful partner to industry, the report includes a discussion of a series of risks related to issues of governance, funding, potential conflicts of interest and commercial efficiency.</p><p>  It is evident from the discussion and analysis in the report that Wood Mackenzie recognise that the process of fully investigating the options and issues associated with establishing a national hydrocarbon exploration company would be a very complex process that would need to involve a broad range of stakeholders and would take a considerable time. It would have to adequately address fundamental questions such as how the cost of resourcing all of the functions would be met and in particular how the State would finance a share of any future field development costs. As a consequence, there are no plans to establish a State hydrocarbons exploration company at this juncture.</p></reply>

The draft Plan sets out the broader context for the development of Ireland&rsquo;s bioenergy sector and the current status with regard to the range of policy areas that must be coordinated in order to create the conditions to underpin the development of the sector. The Plan recognises that improved coordination will allow the sector to contribute to a number of policy objectives ranging from the achievement of renewable energy targets, complementing waste management policies, supporting sustainable agriculture and forestry and stimulating economic activity. The Plan also identifies the necessary next steps to be taken by various government departments, agencies and State bodies to support the sustainable development of the sector. </p><p>  In terms of bioenergy's role in meeting Ireland's renewable energy targets, the Plan recommends the continuation of the two most significant bioenergy policies currently in place which are the REFIT schemes and the Biofuels Obligation Scheme.</p><p>  Furthermore, the analysis underpinning the Plan is that an additional bioenergy-focused measure in the heat sector represents the most cost effective means of meeting a number of different policy goals. Therefore, the Plan also recommends the introduction of a renewable heat incentive for larger heat users, who currently use oil, to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources. </p><p>  Meeting this demand through indigenously sourced biomass could deliver significant economic benefits. Consequently, the Plan also contains measures to stimulate and support the supply of Irish biomass. In this regard the key recommendations include: the continued support for the Afforestation Programme; the continuation of the Bioenergy Scheme for energy crops; and the establishment of Bioenergy Ireland, a joint venture between Bord na Mona and Coillte. </p><p>  In terms of developing new sources of biomass, the Plan provides that the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government will endeavour to optimise the availability of waste for energy and that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will continue its support for innovative energy uses for animal by-products. </p><p>  A further recommendation set out in the Plan is the continued support, on a cross-Government basis, for Research, Development and Demonstration in bioenergy including conducting an economic assessment of the costs and benefits of biogas and biomethane.</p><p>I look forward to the publication of the draft Plan shortly and to preparation of the Strategic Environmental and Appropriate Assessments which will clear they way for the Plan's full implementation.  </p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This is being achieved through measures designed to accelerate commercial investment and the development of a State-led intervention for non-commercial areas.</p><p>  Since publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector have accelerated with commercial operators investing, or committing to invest, approximately &euro;2.5 billion in networks and services. I understand that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out 59 fibre-based broadband networks in County Donegal by July 2016. In addition the recent announcement of a joint venture between ESB and Vodafone includes a proposal to provide high speed broadband in Letterkenny.</p><p>  The Government has committed to an ambitious plan which involves ensuring the delivery of broadband services to those parts of rural Ireland that will not be served by the commercial sector. Services will be delivered over a network, with fibre at its foundation, which is sustainable and guarantees a quality broadband service to rural consumers into the future. This will be the key element of an intervention strategy that will ensure that all citizens and businesses can access high speed broadband services regardless of where they live. </p><p>  Under EU State Aid Guidelines Member States cannot intervene where commercial investors have plans to roll out services. A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department, to identify those areas that require a State intervention. An initial list has already been identified and includes 78 areas in County Donegal. </p><p>  A stakeholder consultation on the implementation of the State-led intervention has recently been launched and will feed into the mapping exercise, which I expect to conclude in the autumn. It is my intention to conduct a full public consultation on the outcome of the mapping process and the proposed intervention strategy. EU State aid clearance will also be required. This will be followed by a detailed procurement process with a view to commencing the roll out of high speed broadband services as quickly as possible.</p><p>It is my intention to progress this complex and ambitious project as a key priority. I believe that it will address current connectivity challenges in a sustainable and meaningful way and will ensure that rural Ireland can enjoy comparable levels of quality and service as those experienced in urban areas.  </p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s affordable energy strategy &ldquo;Warmer Homes&rdquo; identified three key interlinking factors which determine whether a person falls into energy poverty, namely energy costs, incomes and thermal efficiency. </p><p>  Our high dependence upon imported fossil fuels limits our ability to control energy costs. However, we can promote and facilitate competition in the energy market through appropriate regulation and consumer awareness. Energy customers can choose between multiple energy suppliers and can shop around to seek a deal that best suits their needs and circumstances.</p><p>  The Government will continue to ensure that those on low incomes are supported and treated with dignity through the household benefits package and specifically through the fuel allowance.</p><p>  The the most meaningful measure that can be taken is to continue to improve the thermal efficiency of people&rsquo;s homes and protect them from the effects of rising energy costs. The Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to low income households that meet defined eligibility criteria and are vulnerable to energy poverty. The scheme is managed by the SEAI (Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland) and delivered through a range of Community Based Organisations, augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage. Recipients of the scheme do not receive grants but have energy efficiency measures installed free of charge. Since the commencement of the scheme in 2000, over 105,000 homes around the country have received energy efficiency measures under the Warmer Homes scheme, with a total spend of over &euro;116 million. The Warmer Homes scheme is expected to upgrade another 12,000 households in energy poverty this year.</p><p>  In addition, late last year a taskforce was established to examine the specific issue of consumer disconnections in the electricity and gas market. The taskforce has developed a number of new measures that will have a significant impact in this area. The CER (Commission for Energy Regulation) has published a consultation paper on debt management and has provided guidance that allows suppliers to make more Pay-As-You-Go meters available to customers. The network companies (ESB Networks and Bord Gais Networks) are running a number of pilot programmes which should ensure more customers get the opportunity to avoid a disconnection and energy suppliers for their part, have launched a new code of practice, &quot;The Energy Engage Code&quot;, which guarantees that no customer engaging with them will be cut off. The CER will be monitoring and reporting on disconnection statistics on a monthly basis.</p><p>  On the launch of the Energy Green Paper in May, the holding of a number of workshops on the paper was signalled. One of these workshops will be on empowering energy citizens, with energy affordability an integral part of this workshop. </p><p>Finally, the Government intends to review the affordable energy strategy and I anticipate releasing a consultation paper this autumn to commence the process.   </p></reply>

As identified in the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP), which was published earlier this year, the ocean energy sector holds real potential for growth in the green economy and jobs in our coastal communities. The OREDP sets out policy actions and enablers to realise this ambition. </p><p>  Supporting developers in bringing their devices from prototype to full scale commercial viability requires a broad range of policies. To that end, the ocean energy development budget, administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), provides support to developers in various ways. &euro;6.5 million is available from the budget during 2014. Initial device development and testing is supported through the Prototype Fund. Developers must satisfy a range of technical criteria to indicate potential viability in order to receive funding. The &euro;6.5m also includes funding for the development of the Atlantic Marine Energy Test Site (AMETS) off County Mayo. From 2016, this facility will provide a grid connected test site with some of the best conditions for wave energy development in the world. Currently SEAI and the Marine Institute provide quarter size test facilities off the Galway coast. </p><p>  The Irish Maritime and Energy Research Centre (IMERC) provides initial device testing facilities and critical research and development capacity. My Department is contributing &euro;3 million in co-funding to the IMERC between 2013 and 2016. In total, my Department has allocated &euro;26.3 million for ocean energy in the period 2013 to 2016. This funding, which will benefit from increased cross government coordination through the implementation of the OREDP, is vital if the ocean energy sector is to reach its full potential in Ireland. The fact that this level of funding has been retained for ocean energy despite the budgetary constraints of recent years indicates the level of Government commitment to realising the potential of our abundant, indigenous, offshore energy resources.  </p></reply>

The Plan identifies the opportunity for the sustainable development of Ireland's bioenergy resources and will be implemented through a number of policy and enabling actions.</p><p>  The Plan recommends the continuation of the REFIT3 scheme which is designed to incentivise the addition of 310 MW of renewable electricity capacity to the Irish electricity grid. The scheme was designed, inter alia, to complement the Bioenergy Scheme by offering a premium tariff for electricity generated from energy crops. The Plan also recommends, subject to State Aid clearance and further Government approval, the introduction of a renewable heat incentive for larger heat users to change to renewable heating solutions. The introduction of such a scheme would further increase the demand for biomass.</p><p>  Furthermore, the Plan also contains a range of measures to underpin the supply of Irish biomass including the continued support for the Bioenergy Scheme and the Afforestation Programme, both of which are administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. </p><p>Reflecting the cross-sectoral nature of bioenergy, implementation of the actions arising from the Plan will be coordinated by a Bioenergy Steering Group which will draw on the relevant government departments, including the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, agencies and stakeholders as appropriate.  </p></reply>

In addition to the income that would accrue to the Exchequer through the oil and gas fiscal terms and the security of supply benefits that would result from an increased indigenous supply, there would also be considerable economic benefits generated by the associated development and production activity.    While Ireland has only enjoyed limited experience of successful exploration to date, the potential wider economic impacts have been clearly evidenced. For example, the Kinsale field was the trigger for the development of Ireland's natural gas industry, which has had a very considerable economic impact. In more recent years the Corrib gas field development has had a very positive economic impact and has given rise to significant employment opportunities, including much local employment. Recently, the Corrib partners reported that more than 900 people from Erris and Mayo have been employed on the project, over 300 Irish contracting companies have been engaged and over &euro;1 billion has been spent with Irish companies.</p><p>  While the benefits to the economy that result from successful exploration are obvious, the challenge is to create the conditions that will encourage an increase in exploration investment and exploration activity in the Irish offshore, so that more commercial discoveries are made.</p></reply>

A well balanced fuel mix that provides reliable energy, minimises costs, and protects against supply disruptions and price volatility, is essential to Irish consumers and businesses.</p><p>  The SEAI publication, Renewable Energy in Ireland 2012, noted the that oil and gas are a critical component of our energy mix, providing 76% of primary energy requirement in 2012. While Ireland has made considerable progress with regard to the use of renewable energy, it is the case that fossil fuels will continue to provide the lion's share of the energy mix well into the future. </p><p>  The contribution of renewable energy to overall energy demand is rising steadily. It rose from 2.3% to 7.1% between 1990 and 2012, with renewable electricity contributing 4.1% to the overall energy demand in 2012. Ireland has committed to a target of 16% of all energy from renewable sources by 2020, through 40% from renewable electricity, 12% from renewable heat, and 10% from renewable transport. The ambition to have 40% of electricity consumed from renewable sources by 2020 is one of the most demanding in the world.</p><p>  The Government is continuing to develop policies and actions aimed at increasing our security of supply, addressing our dependence on imported fossil fuels and achieving a more secure energy mix, while capitalising on indigenous renewable and conventional energy sources. The exploitation of indigenous gas supplies, and possible oil supplies, are important components of these policies.</p><p>  The SEAI publication &lsquo;Energy Forecasts for Ireland to 2020&rsquo; projects annual primary fuel requirement through to 2020, assuming that Ireland meets current renewable energy and energy efficiency targets set by the EU. These projections, which are available on the SEAI website, show that Ireland will remain dependent on fossil fuels well into the future. Oil and gas will remain central to the economy, particularly in the heating and transport sectors, until affordable, secure and viable alternatives become available.</p></reply>

The Government has agreed that overall responsibility for implementing the decision is to be given to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. </p><p>The Government has also recently agreed the national Bioenergy Plan. Bioenergy will be an essential element in contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s future energy needs. It has the potential to provide significant economic and environmental benefits. Our available resource &ndash; derived from forests, energy crops, animal by-products, and waste &ndash; can rapidly increase through policies and actions across energy, forestry, agriculture, waste, and research, development and deployment. The Bioenergy Plan will provide a mechanism to inform and coordinate policy and implementation across these policy areas and includes a role for Bioenergy Ireland in optimising the supply of biomass.</p></reply>

That publication noted that the contribution of renewable energy to meeting overall energy demand rose from 2.3% to 7.1% between 1990 and 2012, with renewable electricity contributing 4.1% to the overall energy demand in 2012. The publication is available on the SEAI website at .</p><p>Provisional figures for 2013 indicate that 16.4% of electricity demand was met by wind generation. At the end of 2013, the total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid was 2,300 MW. It has been estimated that between 3,000 and 4,000 megawatts of installed wind generation will be required to meet Ireland&rsquo;s renewable targets, in addition to hydro generation, bio-energy, and renewable combined heat and power generators. Currently, over 3,000 MW of additional renewable generation has taken up connection offers under the Gate 3 grid connection programme.</p><p>There are a number of economic benefits that arise from onshore and offshore wind development, some of which are already being realised. The economic benefits include employment from the construction and maintenance of generation infrastructure as well as from component manufacturing. Analysis undertaken by the ESRI (Economic and Social Research Institute) and Trinity College Dublin (2013) estimated direct and indirect employment under various realistic scenarios. The report, which estimates multiple thousands of jobs depending on the scenario, is available on the ESRI's website at . Additional flows of income to local economies would arise from rates, rent to land owners and local community funds. </p><p>I should also highlight the additional benefits in terms of enhanced security and sustainability of energy provided by the increased use of indigenous renewable energy.</p></reply>

In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources. The primary support mechanisms for renewable electricity, including electricity generated from wind, are the Renewable Energy Feed-In-Tariff (REFIT) scheme and the Alternative Energy Requirement (AER) scheme, both of which are funded from the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy.</p><p>  The estimates for the cost of the PSO levy for each year since 2003 are published in the annual PSO decision by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). While the bulk of subsidies for renewable electricity generation paid under these schemes have been for wind, the CER has initiated a project to generate a report on the annual and cumulative costs to date in relation to AER and REFIT support schemes for each technology supported.</p><p>  The CER determines the PSO levy which is a charge on all electricity customers without exception. The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation are set out in Regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999 (S.I. No. 217 of 2002). The cost of the PSO varies from year to year depending on a number of factors including the wholesale market price of electricity.</p><p>  The proposed PSO levy amount for the levy period 2014/2015 has been calculated by the CER to be &euro;327,712,890 and the draft decision is on its website. In terms of the cost to the PSO of renewable energy, AER is expected to cost &euro;2,269,000 and the cost of REFIT is estimated to be &euro;84,346,555 which together would amount to an average charge of approximately &euro;16.65 per domestic customer for the year. Although a breakdown of the PSO cost by technology is not available, wind makes up almost 95% of the renewable electricity supported in the two schemes. </p><p>A final decision on the PSO levy for the 2014/15 period will issue by 1 August 2014 and will be available on the CER website.</p></reply>

However, for certain once-off or short-duration projects, it is more productive and cost-effective to re-engage retired staff who already have the relevant expertise and experience than to go through a time-consuming and relatively expensive recruitment, induction and training process.  Where it occurs, retired staff are usually re-engaged on a pension abatement basis, which means in effect that they continue to receive their pensions and are paid correspondingly reduced salaries by the Department.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Development Cooperation Division also occasionally engages a small number of retired staff for short duration specialist consultancy projects connected with the activities of Irish Aid.</p><p>The temporary Clerical Officers were recruited through an open competition organised by the Public Appointments Service (PAS).   It is not possible in the time scale to identify if other retired officials were re-hired as temporary Clerical Officers during the period in question.  However, under the provision of the Public Service Pensions (Single Schemes &amp;amp; Other Provisions) Act 2012, new employees are required to declare if they are in receipt of, or entitled to, a pension from previous service in the public sector.</p></reply>

The Government has condemned this verdict, which amounts to the criminalisation of the legitimate activities of a free press, and represents an unacceptable restriction on freedom of expression and fundamentally undermines the credibility of the Egyptian judicial system. I raised our concerns directly with Egyptian Foreign Minister Shoukry in a phone conversation I had with him on Monday 14 July, indicating the widespread concerns raised by this case, and which we fully share, in respect of upholding of basic rights such as the freedom of expression and the rights of a free press. I also raised the passing of mass death sentences by the court in Minya earlier this year. I urged that any possible steps to appeal or review these sentences should be adopted as a matter of importance. I also set out our strong concerns in respect of the case of Ibrahim Halawa.   Egypt&rsquo;s new constitution provides guarantees for the fundamental rights of its people which the Egyptian courts, regrettably, do not appear to have fully recognized and vindicated in a number of recent verdicts, including that of the Al Jazeera journalists. This is deeply worrying to those of us who wish to support Egypt and the Egyptian people in their ongoing difficult transition to democracy.</p><p>  These concerns have been clearly communicated in our ongoing contacts with the Egyptian authorities, both here and through our Embassy in Cairo, most recently by senior officials in my Department at a meeting with the Egyptian Embassy two weeks ago which specifically conveyed the Government&rsquo;s concerns over the recent Al Jazeera verdicts as well as the continued detention of Ibrahim Halawa.</p></reply>

The Government has issued two public statements clearly deploring the upsurge of violence, calling for an end to firing by both sides, and a return to the truce which had previously been observed. These views have also been conveyed directly to the Israeli and Palestinian Ambassadors. At EU level, High Representative Ashton has made similar calls on behalf of the European Union, as have other EU partners.   Further to those replies, the EU Heads of State and Government meeting in Brussels yesterday issued the following statement in relation to the situation in Gaza:</p><p>  &quot;The European Council is following with great concern the continued violence in Israel and Gaza. The European Council condemns the firing of rockets from Gaza into Israel and the indiscriminate targeting of civilians. Israel has the right to protect its population from this kind of attacks. In doing so, it must act proportionately and ensure the protection of civilians at all times. It deeply deplores the loss of innocent lives and the high number of wounded civilians in the Gaza Strip as a result of Israeli military operations and is deeply concerned about the rapid and dramatic deterioration of the humanitarian situation. The European Council calls on both sides to de-escalate the situation, to end the violence, to end the suffering of the civilian populations notably by allowing access to humanitarian assistance, and return to calm. The European Council welcomes on-going efforts by regional partners, and in particular the initiative launched by Egypt, to establish a cease-fire and calls on Hamas to agree on such cease-fire. The European Union stands ready to provide the necessary support to this end. The European Union continues to call for the full implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1860 (2009).</p><p>  The tragic events of the past days highlight the urgent need for all parties to work towards a resumption of the diplomatic process and to pursue a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  The European Union reiterates its offer to both parties of a package of European political and economic support and of a Special Privileged Partnership with the European Union in the event of a final peace agreement.</p><p>  Israelis and Palestinians need to make the strategic choice of peace in order to allow their future generations to live lives freed from past conflicts and to enjoy the stability, security and prosperity which they are currently being denied.&quot;</p><p>  Finally, this issue will be further discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council next week, on 22 July, which I will attend.</p></reply>

I have been fully briefed on his discussions with key influencers in Congress and in the Administration, as well as his meetings with Irish-American community leaders, with whom the Government works closely on this issue.   That visit was very worthwhile and an important element of the Government&rsquo;s ongoing lobbying work in this area, but the matter is still far from resolved. The recent unexpected electoral defeat the Republican House Majority Leader represented a real setback for legislative immigration reform in the life-time of the current Congress. Furthermore the situation on the ground at the southern US border has become more acute, particularly with regard to unaccompanied minors from Central America seeking to enter the United States.</p><p>  In the context of there being little prospect of immigration reform legislation being enacted before the mid-term elections in November, President Obama announced on June 30th that he intends to address certain immediate immigration-related matters via his executive powers within existing U.S. law. </p><p>  The extent and nature of the administrative action that the U.S. Administration will take remain to be seen. The political and legal terrain involved is highly complex and there is clearly no guarantee that the steps to be taken will accommodate Ireland&rsquo;s concerns and priorities in the area of immigration reform.</p><p>We are continuing to press our case at all levels, in close cooperation with the Irish American community groups who are active in this area.  I will take every opportunity to progress this issue, as will the Minister of State with Special Responsibility for the Diaspora, Mr Jimmy Deenihan T.D., and our Embassy is in regular and ongoing communication with the relevant decision makers in Washington. We are lobbying actively to ensure that the needs of Irish citizens will be reflected to the greatest extent possible in the scope of the executive action being considered by the President. Our continuing objective is to ensure that the undocumented Irish will have the freedom to work and travel and that there will be pathways for future legal migration from Ireland to the US for those wishing to avail of it.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-07-17a.110.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014071700042#WRB03700"><p>I refer the Deputy to the Annual Report on the Programme for Government and the related statements in the D&aacute;il in March which set out the progress on an extensive number of the Department&rsquo;s commitments. These include increasing exports, promoting Ireland abroad, overseas development aid, humanitarian crises response, civilian corps, implementing the Good Friday Agreement and St. Andrew&rsquo;s Agreement, economic co-operation to support jobs, review of the North- South bodies and Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU.  In terms of the crucial priority of economic recovery, we have achieved very significant progress in restoring Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation through our continued emphasis on economic diplomacy. My Department and our Embassy network, working closely with the State agencies, use every opportunity to highlight Ireland&rsquo;s economic strengths and potential to international audiences. The impact of this work is clear. Ireland&rsquo;s successful implementation of, and exit from, the EU IMF bailout without a precautionary credit line was successfully communicated in international media, to policy-makers, and contacts worldwide via the Embassy network. In June, the yields on Irish 10 year bonds reached historic lows and the ratings agency Standard and Poors upgraded Ireland to an A rating in June. A number of international business rankings also reflect the positively changed analysis of the Irish economy: e.g. Ireland has moved from 47<sup>th</sup>place globally in 2011 to 3<sup>rd</sup>in 2014 in the influential IMD World Competitiveness Rankings and Forbes magazine has named Ireland the Best Country in the World to do Business.   International media coverage and commentary, while reflecting ongoing domestic and international economic challenges, is notably more positive on Ireland&rsquo;s achievements and prospects than at the time of the formation of the Government. Export levels are now higher than they were before the economic crisis. Net job creation from inward investment and by our small and medium sized exporting companies was higher in 2013 than it has been for ten years.</p><p>We are also following up on the implementation of the recommendations in the Government Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy to actively develop cultural and diplomatic links with emerging markets. In February 2014 my Department published a short, focused review of the Strategy, adding an additional seven &lsquo;Exploratory and High Potential Markets&rsquo; and in January 2014 we announced that five new Embassies and three new Consulates General will be opened in key locations across South East Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas. These Embassies and Consulates will provide a platform for further promotion of Irish exports, investment, tourism and education. The implementation of th<font color="#004080">e </font>Strategy will continue to be overseen by the Export Trade Council whose role is to strengthen cooperation and coordination across all Government Departments and State agencies involved in the international promotion and development of trade, tourism and investment.</p><p>In relation to Northern Ireland, the Government&rsquo;s approach is guided by the principles and values of the Good Friday Agreement and its related Agreements, which are essential to peace and reconciliation in Ireland and across these islands. Their key elements include partnership government in Northern Ireland; agreement on sovereignty; human rights; parity of esteem; and support for the rule of law. The continued shared responsibility of the two governments is to guarantee these principles and to support the implementation of the Agreements.  The Irish Government is determined to realise their full potential.</p><p>Against that background, we continue to work intensively with the parties in the Executive and with the British Government in support of an agreement on a comprehensive and balanced framework for dealing with parades, flags and contending with the past.  British-Irish relations, already strong, have benefitted further from the recent State Visit by President Higgins to the United Kingdom.  We will work to ensure that all opportunities for North South and East West cooperation are harnessed in support of job creation and economic growth on the island.</p><p>At its Plenary meeting in November 2013, the North South Ministerial Council agreed to focus on new priorities for practical economic cooperation that can help economic recovery, job creation, the optimal use of public money and the most effective delivery of public services.  Ministers have been examining opportunities in this area for the past six months with their Northern Ireland counterparts and there will be a further discussion on this at the next Plenary of the North South Ministerial Council.</p><p>Despite the very severe economic and budgetary situation we have faced, the Government has clearly demonstrated its determination since coming into office to maintain and stabilise the budget for Official Development Assistance (ODA) to the maximum possible extent.  In the three years 2011 through 2013, a total of over &euro;1.9 billion has been provided for ODA.  This is an enormous achievement in the circumstances.  For 2014, the Government has again managed to allocate almost &euro;600 million to ODA, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to helping the poor of the world.  Our new policy clearly states that the Government remains committed to the UN target of providing 0.7% of GNP in ODA, and to making further progress towards achieving it as soon as economic circumstances permit.</p></reply>

Under this act a person must be an Irish citizen before the Department can lawfully issue a passport to that person. As the applicant was born in Dublin on 19 October, 2007 to parents, who are citizens of India, his entitlement to Irish citizenship is subject to section 6A(1) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956. This provides that a person born in the State after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction, may claim citizenship by birth in the State only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for 3 of the 4 years preceding his/her birth. Additionally section 6B(4)(b) of the 1956 Act specifically rules out certain residence as reckonable for this purpose.    The person in question was first issued a passport in 2007. This was subsequently renewed in 2010 and 2013.  However, the Passport Service recently had cause to review the application for the issued passport and determined that the period of the parent&rsquo;s residence in Ireland was insufficient to entitle the applicant to Irish citizenship. Therefore, as the person concerned was not an Irish citizen, the Department has informed the applicant&rsquo;s parents that the issued passport would be revoked and invalidated.</p></reply>

The further development of the all-island economy and political stability in Northern Ireland are high priorities for this Government. The Government is working with the British Government, with the Northern Ireland Executive and with civil society actors, North and South, to advance implementation of the Good Friday and Saint Andrews Agreements, to take forward North South cooperation, and to foster an inclusive approach towards commemorating the centenary of historical events making up the Decade of Commemorations. Through my Department&rsquo;s Reconciliation Fund we will offer support to community initiatives that aim to repair those issues which lead to division, conflict and barriers to a deeply reconciled and peaceful society; and to build a strong civil society that encompasses all communities, and promotes respect for all. In the North South Ministerial Council, the Government will continue to work with the Northern Ireland Executive to advance areas of practical North South cooperation which are of mutual benefit.  The vital work of restoring our international reputation and promoting our economic recovery are at the heart of the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, with our mission network playing a particular crucial role. An ongoing priority is the implementation of the February review of the Government Trade Tourism and Investment which focuses on how we co-ordinate our work abroad to provide the best possible platform for the Embassy network, the State agencies and the private sector to win business overseas, to attract greater levels of foreign direct investment, and create jobs at home. I look forward to taking this work forward, together with a number of my Cabinet colleagues, in my capacity as chair of the Export Trade Council.</p><p>I am acutely conscious of the need for Ireland to adapt to the global shifts in economic and political power towards the east and south. Ireland has a strategic interest in broadening and deepening our relationships with the countries in Asia to ensure that we can benefit from the opportunities that will arise as the continent continues to develop, as well as having influence in a region that will help shape global developments in the decades to come.  We will also continue to develop our relationship with the Latin American and Caribbean region which, like Asia, includes a number of exploratory and high potential markets for Ireland, as identified in the review of the Government Trade Tourism and Investment Strategy.</p><p>Engagement with our EU partners and the broader region will remain a priority for promoting and protecting our interests. Ireland will continue to be a strong supporter of the EU Enlargement policy, which is one of the Union&rsquo;s most powerful tools in pursuing our strategic objective of promoting peace, stability, democracy and prosperity throughout Europe. My Department will continue to coordinate with other Government Departments in identifying and promoting issues of national interest in the EU&rsquo;s negotiations with enlargement countries.</p><p>Improving the effectiveness of the Eastern Partnership will be a key challenge for the EU in the period ahead and Ireland will support initiatives aimed at achieving this objective. In this context, we will prioritise the ratification by Ireland of the EU Association Agreements with Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine which were signed at the June European Council.</p><p>In my new role, I am deeply conscious of Ireland&rsquo;s proud tradition in international affairs as a country which seeks to promote and share its values. I am determined to continue to advance long-standing priorities in areas of key importance to Ireland and to ensure that we seek at every opportunity, to make a direct and significant contribution to the promotion of global peace and stability, notably through our membership of the United Nations, the European Union, the Council of Europe and the OSCE, as well as through bilateral action.</p><p>The crisis in Ukraine, coupled with the profound implications for the EU&rsquo;s relations with Russia, will remain an important priority on the international agenda for some time. We will continue to engage closely with our EU partners in supporting international efforts aimed at de-escalating the crisis and finding a peaceful, inclusive and negotiated settlement.</p><p>Ireland will also remain actively engaged in promoting a more active EU role in relation to the Middle East Peace Process and in sustaining the viability of a negotiated, two-State solution. Ireland will also seek to maintain the strong profile it has in addressing the appalling humanitarian situation arising from the conflict in Syria and will support all efforts to promote a political resolution both in Syria and Iraq which is now also experiencing serious internal conflict.</p><p>In the area of human rights we will use the remainder of our Human Rights Council term to prioritise national initiatives on promoting and protecting the operating environment for civil society and preventable mortality and morbidity of children under five. 2015 will be a crucial year in the sphere of disarmament and non-proliferation with Ireland actively involved in preparations for the Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and supporting progress towards the entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty.</p><p>Our development aid programme with its overall aim of reducing poverty and hunger, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, gives expression to the best of Ireland&rsquo;s values and will continue to be a major priority. Over the next 18 months, the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s 2013 policy <i>One World, One Future</i>will inform much of our work in this area. The Policy sets out three guiding principles for our international aid programme: reduced hunger and stronger resilience; sustainable development and inclusive economic growth; and better governance, human rights and accountability.  Ireland will also continue to be centrally engaged in the Post 2015 development framework that will succeed the Millennium Development Goals. Throughout this work we will maintain our commitment to the highest standards of openness, transparency and accountability to the Irish people and to our development partners and maintain our strong focus on achieving real and sustainable development results in order to maximise the impact and effectiveness of our programme.</p><p>The provision of an excellent and efficient service to our citizens will of course remain a central focus in my Department.  Ongoing work on the reform of the passport service is a particular priority as it is providing opportunities for new and improved services for passport customers; more secure and efficient processes for the Passport Service; increasing staffing efficiencies and providing financial savings for the Department.</p><p>My Department will also develop and publish a Government strategy on Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with our Diaspora and emigrant communities.  Consultations with these communities are already under way, and this work will be carried forward by the Minister of State with Special Responsibility for the Irish Abroad.   In terms of our relations with the United States, we will maintain our ongoing efforts to secure an outcome on Immigration Reform that will serve the needs of undocumented Irish citizens in the US and also provide legal pathway for Irish citizens wishing to live and work in the US in the future.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy is an essential element of Government. It is the means by which we promote our values and pursue our interests abroad. Through it, we pursue Ireland&rsquo;s economic prosperity, ensure the well-being of the Irish people, and promote peace and security, both at home and in the wider world. Our foreign policy is also a statement of who we are as a people.</p><p>I intend shortly to bring forward a comprehensive review of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy. The purpose of the review, which was initiated in 8 October 2013 and has involved a broad-based process of consultation including Government Departments, State Agencies, the Oireachtas, civil society and members of the public, is to provide an updated statement of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and external relations, and to identify a series of recommendations for its conduct.</p></reply>

These include representing and advancing government policies with other States and in international organisations, in particular the EU and the UN; economic, trade and cultural promotion; front-line consular and passport services to Irish citizens overseas; engaging with Irish communities and harnessing the resource they offer in assisting economic recovery; and programme management, particularly in Irish Aid priority countries.   The figures in the tables below include expenditure charged to mission budgets. Salary and related costs of staff posted from Ireland are not included as they are a charge on the overall budget of the Department rather than on a specific mission. Local staff salaries in missions abroad are reflective of the prevailing labour market conditions in the host country. Capital expenditure is not included as such expenditure does not form part of the Mission&rsquo;s budget. For ease of reference, the figures provided have been separated into Vote 28 Foreign Affairs and Trade and Vote 27 International Cooperation.      The costs of a number of missions that manage significant programmes on behalf of Irish Aid are charged to Vote 27.

This multi-faceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and within the country.</p><p>Interception of illicit tobacco products, alcohol and fuel is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages, as appropriate. Revenue officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.</p><p>Action against the illicit trade in mineral oils includes measures to detect and shut down plants illegally laundering marked mineral oil, to detect illicit products in transit and seize both the products and the vehicles transporting them, and to prevent the sale of illicit products.</p><p>There is extensive cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating these illicit trades, and the relevant agencies in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through cross-border groups on tobacco and oils enforcement, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for large proportions of these illicit markets. In addition, cooperation takes place with other revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, in the ongoing programmes at international level to tackle these forms of crime.</p><p>Considerable success is being achieved in Revenue's action against the illicit trades. Seizures of cigarettes in 2013 and in the current year to the end of June amounted to 40.8 million and 41.1 million respectively. Seizures this year include one of some 32.2 million cigarettes, as well as 4.5 tonnes of water pipe tobacco, from a vessel at Drogheda Port. This was the largest seizure to date in Europe this year, and was the result of an intelligence-led operation targeting the activities of an international organised crime group headed up by Irish and UK nationals and based in Europe. Action against the illicit oil trade in the period since 2011 has led to the detection and shutting down of 30 oil laundries and to seizure of some 3 million litres of illicit fuel. In addition, more than 120 filling stations were closed, for trading without a licence or for breach of licence conditions.</p><p>Action is taken on an ongoing basis to ensure that the Revenue Commissioners have the most effective means of acting against these forms of criminal activity. The total seizures of illicit cigarettes, alcohol products and mineral oils, in each of the years from 2004 to 2013, are as set out in the following table.<table><tr><th><b>Year</b></th><th><b>Cigarettes</b></th><th></th><th><b>Alcohol</b></th><th></th><th><b>Oil</b></th></tr><tr><td><b></b><br /><br /></td><td>Quantity<br /><br /><br />(Million)</td><td>Value<br /><br /><br />(&euro;m)</td><td>Quantity<br /><br /><br />(Litres)</td><td>Value<br /><br /><br />(&euro;m)</td><td>Quantity<br /><br /><br />(Litres)</td></tr><tr><td><b>2013</b></td><td>40.8</td><td>18.9</td><td>55,755</td><td>1.5</td><td>874,882</td></tr><tr><td><b>2012</b></td><td>95.6</td><td>43.3</td><td>33,059</td><td>0.7</td><td>1,113,142</td></tr><tr><td><b>2011</b></td><td>109.1</td><td>46</td><td>34,040</td><td>0.5</td><td>1,044,830</td></tr><tr><td><b>2010</b></td><td>178.4</td><td>75.2</td><td>44,276</td><td>0.6</td><td>289,484</td></tr><tr><td><b>2009</b></td><td>218.5</td><td>92</td><td>96,759</td><td>1</td><td>283,817</td></tr><tr><td><b>2008</b></td><td>135.2</td><td>54.4</td><td>83,037</td><td>0.7</td><td>100,470</td></tr><tr><td><b>2007</b></td><td>74.5</td><td>25.6</td><td>22,820</td><td>0.3</td><td>118,417</td></tr><tr><td><b>2006</b></td><td>52.3</td><td>18</td><td>57,754</td><td>0.6</td><td>164,157</td></tr><tr><td><b>2005</b></td><td>51.3</td><td>15.6</td><td>328,649</td><td>2.2</td><td>466,180</td></tr><tr><td><b>2004</b></td><td>60.9</td><td>18.6</td><td>79,593</td><td>1</td><td>409,916</td></tr></table>The table shows also the estimated value of the seizures of cigarettes and alcohol products. That information is not available in respect of mineral oil products.</p><p>A breakdown of this information by Garda districts is not available.</p><p>The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for the detection and detention of counterfeit and pirated goods, including CDs and DVDs, at points of entry to the State, and responsibility for acting against goods of that kind that are in circulation in the State rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Data in respect of CDs and DVDs seized or detained by the Revenue Commissioners in the years 2004 to 2013 is being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that estimating the scale of any illegal activity is difficult. The extent of the illicit trade in cigarettes is, however, estimated through annual surveys of smokers, carried out for the Revenue Commissioners and the National Tobacco Control Office of the Health Services Executive by Ipsos MRBI. The 2013 survey indicates that some 11% of cigarettes consumed were illicit. This represents a loss to the Exchequer of some &euro;212 million in excise duty and VAT, assuming that the illicit cigarettes consumed displaced the equivalent full tax paid quantity of cigarettes. Comparable data are not available in respect of alcohol or oil products.</p><p>Legislative action has been taken over recent years to ensure that Revenue has the requisite powers to respond effectively to the problem of the illegal tobacco trade. The Finance Act 2012 clarified the legal basis for Revenue officers to open and examine the contents of postal and courier packets that are reasonably believed to contain untaxed excise products. The Finance Act 2013 introduced new offence and forfeiture measures relating to the illicit production of tobacco, including offences of involvement with illicit tobacco production, knowingly dealing in or delivering any illicit tobacco product and keeping materials and equipment for the purposes of illicit production. Provision was made also for the forfeiture of any equipment or materials, including unmanufactured tobacco, used for illicit production. That Act also strengthened the offence provisions relating to the sale or delivery of unstamped tobacco products. The Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 provided that a person suspected of an offence of dealing in, or with, unstamped tobacco products must provide information to a Revenue Officer or a Garda and may be required to present any tobacco product concerned for examination, and makes provision for search by a Revenue Officer or Garda of any bag or other receptacle that he or she reasonably believes to contain tobacco products that are concerned in the offence.</p><p>As well as those changes to primary law Ireland, in accordance with EU Directive 2008/118/EU, introduced a quantitative restriction, with effect from 1 January 2014, on the number of cigarettes that may be brought into the State for personal use by individuals travelling from Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. The Excise Duty on Cigarettes (Quantitative Restrictions) Order 2013 (S.I. No. 553 of 2013) provides that the number of tax-paid cigarettes that may be brought into Ireland for personal use by individuals travelling from those Member States, without payment of further excise duty in Ireland, is restricted to 300. Anyone with cigarettes in excess of that quantity must declare them to a Revenue Officer and pay the appropriate excise duty. This restriction will remain in place until 31 December 2017 or until such time as the particular Member State has achieved the required EU minimum tax levels, whichever is the earlier.</p><p>In response to illicit fuel trading, Revenue has implemented a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem through enhanced supply chain controls, the acquisition of a more effective fuel marker and continued robust enforcement action.</p><p>Supply chain controls have been enhanced progressively since 2011 with the objective of reducing the capacity of criminals to source marked diesel for laundering or to get laundered fuel onto the market. The supply chain controls introduced include new licensing conditions for all fuel traders and the introduction from January 2013 of a requirement that all licensed fuel traders, whether dealing in road fuel or marked fuel, make detailed monthly electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions. Revenue is using this data to identify suspicious transactions and patterns of distribution for investigation. Revenue has also intensified its targeting, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, of enforcement action against suspected fuel laundering operations.</p><p>To support further the integrity of the distribution system and minimise the risk of fraud, I introduced a provision in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 that will make a supplier who is reckless in supplying rebated fuel for a use connected with excise fraud liable for the duty at the standard rate of tax. This new provision will strengthen Revenue's hand in dealing with those traders supplying rebated fuel recklessly to dubious customers and will provide a further disincentive to such activity.</p><p>Revenue has published guidelines for mineral oil traders which will assist them in identifying and avoiding such transactions.</p><p>In addition to the measures implemented to date, Revenue and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in the UK completed an Invitation to Make Submissions process to identify a new fuel marker and it is expected that a new marker will be introduced in both jurisdictions early in 2015, following consultation with the oil industry and other stakeholders.</p><p>Revenue works very closely with fuel sector representative bodies in tackling the problem and they have been very supportive of the measures introduced to combat fuel laundering.  The evidence available to Revenue, in terms of feedback from the legitimate trade and increased consumption of road diesel, indicates that this strategy has been very effective.</p><p>The Revenue Commissioners will maintain their commitment to acting against all stages of the supply chains for illicit oil and tobacco products and will continue to make every effort to ensure that those involved in them are brought to account before the Courts for their criminal activities.</p><p>I understand that the Revenue Commissioners continuously review their methodologies and their legislative requirements and where necessary I will of course, give careful consideration to any proposal that might be put to me in that regard.</p></reply>

The decision to retain the 9% VAT rate for tourism services was in recognition of the importance of the tourism sector to the overall economy and as a major source of jobs.  This initiative has proven to be a success, helping to create many new jobs, as well as protecting existing jobs.  The cost to the Exchequer of this measure was estimated at the time of its introduction to be &euro;350 million in a full year.</p><p>A stamp duty levy on pension fund assets was introduced in the Finance (No.2) Act 2011 as a measure to fund the Jobs Initiative.  This was estimated to yield &euro;470 million a year for 4 years. The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that receipts amounted to &euro;463 million in 2011 and &euro;483 million in 2012. This is broadly in line with the amounts anticipated to be collected in those years.  &euro;535 million was collected in 2013, due to an increase in the capital value of pension funds.</p><p>Furthermore, as the Deputy will be aware, in Budget 2014, I confirmed that the 0.6% pension levy introduced in the Jobs Initiative in 2011 will be abolished from 31 December 2014.  However, I introduced an additional levy on pension funds at 0.15% in order to continue to help fund the Jobs Initiative and to make provision for potential State liabilities which may emerge from pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties. The levy within the existing legal frame work will apply to pension fund assets in 2014 and 2015.  It is estimated that the additional levy will yield &euro;135 million in a full year.</p><p>I should also point out that the Jobs Initiative included a number of current and capital expenditure measures, among which there a number of measures aimed at retraining the workforce.   The detail of these measures are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr. Brendan Howlin, T.D.</p><p>Notwithstanding the strong success of the Jobs Initiative, the Government decided that more could and should be done.  To this end, the Government introduced the Actions Plan for Jobs and the Pathways to Work scheme in 2012.  In effect, the Jobs Initiative has been subsumed into these two key annual Government Strategies.</p></reply>

However, I have been advised by the Central Bank that there are two such investigations in relation to issues arising from the banking crisis, of which one investigation is currently underway and one investigation is suspended.</p><p>  In relation to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) (formerly Anglo), I have been informed by the Central Bank that the investigation is currently suspended. The Garda&iacute; informed the Central Bank in May 2011, following consultation with the Director of Public Prosecutions, that to proceed with the Central Bank's examinations at that time may prejudice any future criminal prosecutions. Accordingly, the Central Bank decided to defer its examination into IBRC. Given the seriousness and sensitivity of criminal proceedings and the strength of the sanctions available to the Garda&iacute; and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE), the Central Bank considered this to be the most appropriate approach to take where there is a reasonable possibility of multiple proceedings. The Central Bank has informed me that it continues to keep this decision under review and regular liaison with the Garda&iacute; and ODCE is continuing.</p><p>  In relation to the Irish Nationwide Building Society (INBS), I have been informed by the Central Bank that the investigation is currently ongoing.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-07-17a.185.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014071700043#WRC04100"><p>There are a number of reasons why, under existing policies, pre-retirement access to the main benefits from pension plans or schemes is not permitted, the principal one being that these arrangements (and the associated tax reliefs on contributions and pension fund growth that are available to encourage them) are designed to be long term savings vehicles based on the principle that the benefits will be locked away to help fund an adequate income in retirement.</p><p>  Retirement lump sums can be taken tax-free at retirement up to a life-time limit of &euro;200,000. It is not clear from the question whether the tax-free lump sum the Deputy envisages is all or part of an individual s retirement lump sum or whether it is simply a proportion of the individual s overall pension fund at the point of drawdown. Neither is it evident what if any limits would apply to the lump sum that could be drawn down early or the conditions that would attach to such a facility. </p><p>  In any event, the tax-free retirement lump sum is a significant part of an individual s core retirement benefits which is generally only available in pension schemes approved by the Revenue Commissioners at normal retirement age although Revenue approval may also provide for voluntary early retirement from age 50 where scheme rules allow and with the employer s consent. In such situations, however, retirement benefits would be restricted. </p><p>  For many individuals with limited pension savings the tax-free lump sum may well be the major pension benefit at retirement. In my view, it is preferable not to encourage early withdrawals of core pension benefits of whatever kind, as the inevitable result is to divert the savings initially intended to finance retirement to meet short term financial crises. This clearly poses retirement income adequacy issues and, in that regard, the impact of the early withdrawal of pension savings on the ultimate value of the pension pot at retirement should not be underestimated. Allowing access to all, or even to a proportion, of an individual s retirement lump sum before retirement would undermine core benefits in the long term to the detriment of the individual in his retirement years. </p><p>  As to the economic benefit of an early access scheme, in other jurisdictions where pre-retirement access to pension savings have been allowed (e.g. Denmark and Iceland), there are doubts about the extent to which the gains in consumption have been attributable to the schemes in those countries. </p><p>  I gave consideration to all of these issues in my decision to introduce Section 782A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which provides members of occupational pension schemes with a once-off opportunity to access their Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs), pre-retirement. The option is available for a three year period from 27 March 2013, the date that the Finance Act 2013 was passed into law.</p><p>  The pre-retirement access to a portion of AVCs which I introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2013 is allowed on a tax-neutral basis   the contributions were tax-relieved at the individual s marginal rate on the way in and are taxed at the individual s marginal rate on withdrawal. The take-up of the measure to date has not been particularly significant. The measure is, however, designed to enable rather than incentivise individuals to access part of their pension savings beyond their regular or compulsory pension contributions. It is important that individuals continue to provide for their retirement and, it would appear, most individuals with AVCs have to date decided to preserve their AVC pension savings. For these various reasons, I have no plans to extend pre-retirement access to pension savings beyond what is provided for in relation to AVCs.</p></reply>

The funds are collected by the Revenue Commissioners and transferred to the ICF on a monthly basis. Since the reintroduction of the ICF levy in January 2012 approximately &euro;142.8m was collected.</p><p>  In 2010 Joint Administrators were appointed by the High Court at the request of the Central Bank of Ireland because of concerns about the solvency position of Quinn Insurance Limited (QIL).  The ICF has been used in accordance with the legislation to allow the QIL Administrators to meet their financial obligations as they arise.  High Court approval is required to be obtained by QIL Administrators each time before any funds can be withdrawn from the ICF. To date, a total of &euro;1,118m has been drawn down from the Insurance Compensation Fund by the Joint Administrators. </p><p>The Joint Administrators, when presenting their 10th report to the High Court in July 2012, indicated that the potential call on the ICF could be up to &euro;1.65bn. The Joint Administrators pointed out in their report that if they were to remove most of the accounting adjustments and use a &quot;best estimate&quot; calculation, then the losses at the former company and therefore the call on the fund is likely to be in the range of &euro;1.1bn to &euro;1.3bn rather than the &euro;1.65bn for which they have provided. </p><p>  The latest update from the Joint Administrators to officials from my Department indicates that they are increasingly confident that the total drawdown will be in that lower range.</p><p>  Under Section 6 of the Insurance Act 1964 the responsibility for deciding whether the ICF has sufficient funds available to it at any particular time is a matter for the Central Bank.

I am informed by the CSO that statisticians use any available data that can produce a repeatable, consistent estimate for these activities over time.   The fact that they are illegal makes them particularly difficult to estimate as the actors involved are operating outside of the law and consequently outside of any regulatory or official systems. Consequently, the estimation methods used can only be expected to deliver approximations of the actual levels of activity.</p><p>  The extension of the coverage of illegal activities in Ireland's most recent GDP estimates related only to prostitution and aspects of the drugs trade. </p><p>  Estimates for fuel and cigarette smuggling have been included for several years.  I am also informed by the CSO that estimates of unrecorded construction activity have been included in the GDP estimates for Ireland for many years. Other items such as sales of counterfeit CDs and DVDs are estimated using the Household Budget Survey as a basis for estimating the overall demand for these products. Consequently, there is no particular impact on the latest estimates of GDP.</p></reply>

The main aim of the HFCS is to provide structural information on households' assets and liabilities, based on a representative sample of households. This will address gaps in knowledge about the economic well-being of households, the distribution and type of wealth and liabilities among households and individuals, as well as the factors that affect financial planning by households and individuals.  Such information may be relevant to the formulation of tax policy and I look forward to seeing the results of the HFCS. </p></reply>

These have been most pronounced in urban areas, particularly Dublin. This is most likely driven by a supply-demand mismatch in these urban areas. The current level of new builds is very low by reference to historical norms as well as estimates of medium-term housing demand. </p><p>In order to address the current inadequacies in the market, the recently published Construction 2020 strategy sets out a range of actions to be taken in the immediate future which aim to address, among other issues: housing supply, with a particular focus on planning issues and appropriate and sustainable development financing; transparent and sustainable mortgage lending; as well as the application of the tax code to the construction and property sectors.</p><p>Action 1 of the Strategy provides a National Framework for Housing Supply is to be established on a statutory footing with an annual National Statement of Projected Housing Supply and Demand to be published every June. The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government (DECLG) has advised me that the Housing Agency has been asked to take the lead in implementing this Action. </p><p>The proper management of all State land is critical; accordingly, both lands that have been transferred to the Housing Agency and lands held by local authorities which are suitable for development will be the first sites considered in any future targeted social housing building programme. DECLG's annual Housing Land Availability Survey (HLAS) gathers information from local authorities to inform the publication of the amount of zoned residential land in their areas that is currently serviced. It is currently estimated that there are in excess of 25,000 hectares of undeveloped residentially-zoned land nationally, which equates to a capacity for over 500,000 new homes (based on a national average of 20 units per hectare). This capacity is considered to be sufficient to meet total housing requirements nationally for more than the next ten years. In line with the commitments under the Construction 2020 strategy, a Housing Supply Co-ordination Task Force for Dublin has been established with an immediate focus on addressing supply-related issues in the capital. </p><p>Under Action 8 of Construction 2020, a Social Housing Strategy is to be published by the end of the third quarter of 2014. To assist in the development of the Social Housing Strategy, the Housing Agency has invited submissions by 31 July 2014. This invitation for submissions is available at the following weblink: . </p><p>Regarding the recent rise in rents, the Private Residential Tenancies Board has been asked to carry out a focused piece of research that will explore options to address the difficulties being experienced in segments of the private rented sector and to report back to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government with policy recommendations in the coming weeks. With regard to broader social housing policy, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014 will provide for the introduction of the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme.  HAP will provide a new framework for the provision of rental assistance and will, in as much as it can, facilitate the removal of existing barriers to employment by allowing HAP recipients remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment.  It is expected that the Bill will be enacted by the summer, following which the commencement date and the detailed terms of the scheme will be prescribed. </p><p>DECLG expects the final output across all social housing programmes for 2014 to be in the region of 6,000 new housing units. The number and method of delivery of social housing units in future years is determined in the course of the annual Estimates process and will be informed by the Social Housing Strategy which is currently in preparation and which will set out clear objectives in respect of delivery over the next five years.</p></reply>

This forecast projected that the primary general government balance will be &euro;3.3 billion in 2015 (1.9% of GDP). The macroeconomic forecasts underpinning the SPU have been endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC).   </p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the SPU forecast did not take into account the recently revised estimates of GDP by the Central Statistics Office.  This will be taken into account along with the most up-to-date macroeconomic and fiscal data when deciding on the adjustment package necessary closer to Budget time. </p><p>  Furthermore, I should point out that a different quantum of consolidation would change the outlook for economic activity and revenue growth.

There was an interest holiday on the IBRC promissory note repayments in 2011 and 2012 and thus zero interest was payable for these years. In 2013 promissory note interest of &euro;214 million was payable up to the date of IBRC's liquidation. General government interest is also payable on the EBS promissory note for all years with an average of &euro;12 million payable between 2012 and 2014. Under the terms of the promissory note an annual payment &euro;3.085 billion was to be made to the beneficiary banks. This payment was made in cash in 2011, and the IBRC element (&euro;3.06 billion) was paid by way of a government bond in 2012. Both these payments impacted the national debt and incurred general government interest costs of approximately &euro;0.3 billion in each of the years 2012 to 2014.  The IBRC promissory notes were cancelled and replaced with a portfolio of eight floating rate Government bonds for a total amount of &euro;25 billion. The bonds pay interest every six months (June and December) based on the six month Euribor interest rate plus an interest margin. The margin averages 2.63% across the eight issues. This gave rise to payments of &euro;0.65 billion in 2013 and an estimated &euro;0.8 billion in 2014. The Deputy should note that these payments contribute significantly to the surplus income of the Central Bank, up to 80% of which is paid to the Central Fund in the following year.</p><p>(3) By the end of 2013, &euro;10 billion (net of the sale of Bank of Ireland equity in 2011, the sale of Irish Life and the sale of contingent capital notes in 2013) is estimated to have been paid through direct payments from the Exchequer account to the banking sector.Although no specific borrowing was made in the cases of interventions paid through the Exchequer, the impact can be estimated using the average rate of interest on government debt.</p><p>This figure excludes fees paid to the Minister under the Credit Institutions Financial Support and Eligible Liabilities Guarantee schemes amounting to &euro;4.4 billion from 2008 to 2014.</p></reply>

As a result of the change, farmers in this position would have lost their farm payment entitlements and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine advised those farmers to transfer those entitlements to active farmers by 15 May last (the deadline by which the change takes effect and after which the payment entitlements in the hands of the affected lessor farmers would be worthless).</p><p>  On 1 May last, I announced my intention, based on the case made to me, to provide for an exemption from CGT on any chargeable gains arising from the disposal by the owners of payment entitlements under the Single Payment Scheme where all of those entitlements were leased out in 2013 and where the owners, because of the change in CAP regulations, were advised by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to transfer their entitlements to an  active  farmer by 15 May 2014.  I propose to include appropriate provisions to give effect to the CGT exemption in Finance Bill 2014 which will be published shortly after Budget 2015 in the Autumn.</p><p>  I support the principle of ex-ante and ex-post economic impact assessments, including cost benefit analysis in formulating and evaluating tax policy and, since coming into office, I have instructed my Department to carry out a range of significant economic assessments of various tax expenditure measures. I do not, however, automatically follow this course in every tax change I have made or put forward, as circumstances and common sense also have a bearing on the decisions to be made in this regard. I did not have a cost benefit analysis carried out in this instance.</p><p>  Among the reasons for this is that the CGT exemption will apply on a  once-off  basis only and to a specified number of affected farmers who would not have disposed of their leased farm payment entitlements if it were not for a change to EU regulations which was outside of their control. Moreover, I was persuaded that, since the Department of Agriculture had advised affected farmers involved in leasing to dispose of their leased payment entitlements in circumstances where they would not otherwise have done so, significant damage would be done to the critical policy of encouraging longer term leasing in the absence of the CGT tax concession. Encouraging land mobility through long-term leasing has been one of the main drivers in agri-taxation  policy. Long-term leasing provides the certainty required to encourage lessees to invest and improve land and encourages progressive and competitive farmers to enlarge their farm holdings. Finally, since a decision had to be made in this matter within a relatively short period before 15 May last, there was insufficient time to conduct any meaningful impact analysis.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-07-17a.282.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014071700044#WRD02700"><p>I am advised by the NTMA that the position on the interest rates for Ireland's programme loans is as follows.</p><p>  In relation to the EFSF, &euro;7.2 billion of Ireland's EFSF loans are at fixed interest rates which were based on a matched EFSF bond/loan structure. As a result of changes to the EFSF's structure which removed the direct link between specific bond issues and programme countries, the balance of Ireland's disbursed EFSF loans, currently &euro;11.2 billion, are part of a pooled system whereby all programme countries pay the same interest rate. The pooled interest rate is calculated daily and is based on the EFSF's cost of funds in managing the pool. This can be characterised as the weighted average cost of its bond and bill issuance.  As at 31 March 2014 the blended effective interest rate on Ireland's EFSF loans was 2.31%. </p><p>  The effective interest rate on Ireland's EFSM loans is based on the EFSM's cost of funds when it issues bonds. As at 31 March 2014 the blended interest rate on Ireland's EFSM loans was 3.06%.</p><p>  The interest rate on the United Kingdom's bilateral loan to Ireland is fixed and is based on the weighted gross redemption yield on all UK Debt Management Office (DMO) gilt issuances to the market in the six month period up to the date of the disbursement of each portion of the loan, plus a service fee of 18 basis points. As at 31 March 2014 the estimated blended euro equivalent interest rate on Ireland's UK loans including hedging costs was 1.78%.</p><p>  The interest rate on both bilateral loans from the Kingdom of Sweden and Kingdom of Denmark is floating and is based on 3-month euribor plus a margin of 100 basis points. As at 31 March 2014 the interest rates on these loans were 1.34% and 1.33% respectively.</p><p>  The interest rate on the IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) is tied to the IMF's market-related interest rate, known as the basic rate of charge. As the IMF loan is provided in Special Drawing Rights, which is composed of a basket of four currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY), the interest rate is constructed from 3-month Eurepo, US and UK Treasury Bills and Japanese Government Discount Notes' rates plus a margin of 100 basis points. Borrowings of up to three times a country's IMF quota are subject to the basic rate of charge. Borrowings above three times quota attract a surcharge of 200 basis points which is in addition to the 100 basis points margin which forms part of the basic rate of charge. This surcharge increased to 300 basis points in mid-January 2014 per the IMF rules as the loan size exceeded three times the quota for more than three years after the date of the first disbursement. As at 31 March 2014 the overall estimated blended euro equivalent interest rate on Ireland's IMF loan, including hedging costs, was 4.99%.</p><p>  The Deputy should note that the mixture of floating and fixed interest rates across facilities and, in the case of the EFSF within a facility, makes it difficult to compare one facility directly against another as they contain different interest rate risk profiles, currencies and maturities.  In addition, the floating interest rates quoted are at a point in time and are, therefore, subject to change depending on movements in market rates. </p></reply>

Overall, it is estimated by the Commissioners that around 25% of taxpayers pay neither Income Tax or USC.</p><p>I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, estimated by reference to 2014 incomes, the number of income earners with earnings less than &euro;32,800 and more than &euro;32,800 is 1,267,600 and 922,600 respectively. In addition, 266,500 one-income married couples have earnings of less than &euro;41,800. </p><p>Regarding a reduction in the marginal tax rate, it is assumed that the Deputy refers to a reduction in the 41% Income Tax rate. On this basis the Revenue Commissioners estimate that, a reduction of that rate would affect approximately 392,000 (18%) income earners. </p><p>The figures quoted above are estimates from the Revenue tax forecasting model for 2014, using the latest actual data for the year 2011 adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim.

However, based on personal Income Tax returns filed by non-PAYE taxpayers for the year 2012, the latest year for which this information is available, and making certain assumptions about the data, it is estimated that the revenue that could be raised from reducing the level at which individuals can claim interest repayments against tax for residential rental properties from 75% to 60% may be in the region of &euro;57 million.</p><p>  It should be noted that the above estimates do not include returns by some PAYE taxpayers. However, a PAYE taxpayer with non-PAYE income greater than &euro;3,174 is required to complete an Income Tax return Form 11. This return is the source of the figures provided in this reply in respect of individuals.</p><p>  Rental income of companies is returned as net of interest on borrowings and the figures for interest are not separately distinguished in Corporation Tax returns. There is, therefore, no basis for an estimate of the cost of reducing the tax relief for corporate landlords.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated cost of interest relief on residential properties is based on assuming that tax relief is allowed at the Income Tax rate of 41% and the figures provided could therefore be regarded as the maximum Exchequer cost in respect of those taxpayers. This figure is subject to adjustment in the event of late returns being filed or where returns already filed are subsequently amended. </p></reply>

However, removal of the marker from rebated fuel represents a significant threat to the exchequer and therefore Revenue has made action against this illegal activity one of its priorities and is implementing a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem through enhanced supply chain controls, the acquisition of a more effective fuel marker and continued robust enforcement action. </p><p>  Supply chain controls have been enhanced progressively since 2011 with the objective of reducing the capacity of criminals to source marked diesel for laundering or to get laundered fuel onto the market. The supply chain controls introduced include new licensing conditions for all fuel traders and the introduction from January 2013 of a requirement that all licensed fuel traders, whether dealing in road fuel or marked fuel, make detailed monthly electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions. Revenue is using this data to identify suspicious transactions and patterns of distribution for investigation. Revenue has also intensified its targeting, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, of enforcement action against suspected fuel laundering operations. </p><p>  To support further the integrity of the distribution system and minimise the risk of fraud, I introduced a provision in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 that will make a supplier who is reckless in supplying rebated fuel for a use connected with excise fraud liable for the duty at the standard rate of tax. This new provision will strengthen Revenue's hand in dealing with those traders supplying rebated fuel recklessly to dubious customers and will provide a further disincentive to such activity. Revenue has published guidelines for mineral oil traders which will assist them in identifying and avoiding such transactions.</p><p>  Revenue works very closely with fuel sector representative bodies in tackling the problem and they have been very supportive of the measures introduced to combat fuel laundering.  The evidence available to Revenue, in terms of feedback from the legitimate trade and increased consumption of road diesel, indicates that this strategy has been very effective. </p><p>  In addition to the measures implemented to date, Revenue and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in the UK completed an Invitation to Make Submissions process to identify a new fuel marker and it is expected that a new marker will be introduced in both jurisdictions early in 2015, following consultation with the oil industry and other stakeholders.</p></reply>

All borrowing undertaken for this purpose is included within the overall debt figure.</p><p>No specific borrowing was undertaken in order to fund the recapitalisation of Irish banks and therefore it is not possible to quantify the precise impact to government debt. However, as detailed in a previous response to parliamentary question (PQ 23246/14) regarding the interest cost of the capital injections from 2009 to 2011 I outlined that they can be separated into three categories;</p><p>(1) Capital injections that were made under Ministerial direction by the NPRF Commission amount to &euro;18.8 billion (net of the sale of Bank of Ireland preference shares in 2013). There is no debt implications as they did not require borrowing. </p><p>(2) The promissory notes to IBRC and EBS added &euro;30.85 billion to the general government debt, but not the national debt, in 2010. There was an interest holiday on the IBRC promissory note repayments in 2011 and 2012 and thus zero interest was payable for these years. In 2013 promissory note interest of &euro;214 million was payable up to the date of IBRC's liquidation. General government interest is also payable on the EBS promissory note for all years with an average of &euro;12 million payable between 2012 and 2014. Under the terms of the promissory note an annual payment &euro;3.085 billion was to be made to the beneficiary banks. This payment was made in cash in 2011, and the IBRC element (&euro;3.06 billion) was paid by way of a government bond in 2012. Both these payments impacted the national debt and incurred general government interest costs of approximately &euro;0.3 billion in each of the years 2012 to 2014.  The IBRC promissory notes were cancelled and replaced with a portfolio of eight floating rate Government bonds for a total amount of &euro;25 billion. The bonds pay interest every six months (June and December) based on the six month Euribor interest rate plus an interest margin. The margin averages 2.63% across the eight issues. This gave rise to payments of &euro;0.65 billion in 2013 and an estimated &euro;0.8 billion in 2014. The Deputy should note that these payments contribute significantly to the surplus income of the Central Bank, up to 80% of which is paid to the Central Fund in the following year. </p><p>(3) By the end of 2013, &euro;10 billion (net of the sale of Bank of Ireland equity in 2011, the sale of Irish Life and the sale of contingent capital notes in 2013) is estimated to have been paid through direct payments from the Exchequer account to the banking sector. Although no specific borrowing was made in the cases of interventions paid through the Exchequer, the impact can be estimated using the average rate of interest on government debt.</p><p>The average rate of interest on general government debt for 2013 is given as 4% in my Department's Stability Programme Update, 2014 published last month. Using this interest rate to estimate the impact of injections into the banking sector from the Exchequer account gives estimated interest costs of &euro;0.45 billion in 2012, &euro;0.5 billion in 2013 and &euro;0.4 billion in 2014.</p><p>This figure excludes fees paid to the Minister under the Credit Institutions Financial Support and Eligible Liabilities Guarantee schemes amounting to &euro;4.4 billion from 2008 to 2014.</p></reply>

The estimated structural budget deficit in 2013 was 6.2 per cent of GDP, which was projected to fall to 4.7 per cent in 2014. The 2014 estimate comprised the headline general government deficit of -4.8 per cent of GDP, less temporary measures amounting to 0.2 per cent of GDP. To arrive at the structural balance from this, the component of the deficit which related to the position on the economic cycle - the cyclical component - was removed. This component amounts to 0.3 per cent of GDP. This cyclical budgetary component is derived as a function of the output gap. These estimates are based on the harmonised European approach which combines budget semi-elasticities (the responsiveness of the budget balance to changes in the output gap) with the estimated output gap.</p><p>  Estimates of both the headline fiscal aggregates and the output gap are sensitive to data revisions. This is particularly so in the case of Ireland.  The next set of projections will incorporate the impact of the ESA 2010 statistical changes which are currently being implemented across all European Member States. </p></reply>

One element of the process is the inclusion of extended estimates for illegal economic activities   defined as including prostitution, the production and trafficking of drugs, and alcohol and tobacco smuggling. This illegal economic activity is estimated by CSO at 0.72% of GDP or &euro;1.26 billion in 2013. Furthermore, these estimates suggest that illegal activity has been relatively stable since 2010 (varying between 0.70% and 0.73% over the period).</p><p>  It is important to note the new CSO estimates do no represent an increase in illegal activity, but merely reflect the inclusion in GDP, for the first time, by the CSO of an estimate for illegal activities. By their nature, when instances of such activity are identified and confronted by law enforcement agencies, those instances cease. Accordingly the question of tax foregone is theoretical and no measure of its quantum is available. </p></reply>

Retail credit firms are a regulated category of entities which are authorised to provide credit (in the form of cash loans) directly to individuals. Some firms authorised in this category are mortgage lenders. Retail credit firms have been subject to regulation by the Central Bank since 1 February 2008. A register of all Retail Credit Firms is available on the Central Bank website at the following link: </p><p>I am informed by the Central Bank that, at end-March 2014, six of these firms had a total of 17,789 primary dwelling (PDH) mortgage accounts of which 4,554 were classified as restructured;  four had a total of 739 buy to let (BTL) mortgage accounts of which 88 were classified as restructured.  Regarding the level of outstanding debt on these accounts, there was a total of &euro;3.316bn in outstanding PDH debt and a further &euro;0.158bn in outstanding in BTL mortgage debt.  Of that outstanding debt, mortgage accounts amounting to &euro;1.880bn (PDH) and &euro;0.083bn (BTL) respectively were in arrears of over 90 days.  The Central Bank has advised that it does not publish the interest rates applied by regulated entities.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Central Bank's Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) announced in March 2013 set time bound and measurable targets for the 6 main banks requiring them to systematically address their arrears book.  The Central Bank has informed me that retail credit firms are not subject to the prudential standards set out in the Central Bank's MART. However, the same consumer protection framework applies to retail credit lenders as to other regulated lenders including the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA). As such the Central Bank engages with these firms in relation to their treatment of borrowers under the mortgage arrears resolution process as provided for in the CCMA. In particular, the CCMA sets out requirements for all mortgage lenders, including retail credit firms, dealing with borrowers facing or in arrears on a mortgage secured on a primary home and provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their co-operating borrowers in mortgage difficulty.  </p><p>The Central Bank has informed me that retail credit firms were also included in the scope of the Central Bank's recent review of the 'Implementation of the Revised CCMA' by mortgage lenders, the purpose of which was to ensure that mortgage lenders achieved full implementation of the requirements of the revised CCMA by end December 2013.</p><p>The Central Bank has advised that during 2012, non-bank lenders reported that 59 properties were repossessed following a court order, accounting for 24% of total properties repossessed following court orders. During 2013, non-bank lenders reported that 53 properties were repossessed following a court order, accounting for 15% of the total.  In Quarter 1 of 2014, non-bank lenders reported that 9 properties were repossessed following a court order, accounting for 12% of total properties repossessed following court orders</p><p>The Central Bank continues to engage with all mortgage lenders, including retail credit firms, in relation to lenders' mortgage arrears resolution strategies and approaches to dealing with borrowers in or facing arrears.  Early and effective engagement between borrowers and lenders is key to resolving cases of mortgage difficulty.  Where there is effective and meaningful engagement regarding a mortgage difficulty, the data shows that an increasing number of durable long term mortgage restructures is being put in place.</p></reply>

It is envisaged that the new rules for the Safekeeping of Client Assets will be in place before the end of the year.</p><p>New rules in respect of key management positions </p><p>I have brought forward a very wide range of statutory powers under the Central Bank Reform Act 2010, which sets out a far-reaching regime for the Central Bank to set out and enforce standards of fitness and probity   across the financial service sector.</p><p>Enhanced monitoring and enforcement powers for the Central Bank </p><p>The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 also sets out a number of new provisions that are relevant. The fitness and probity provisions are reinforced by the whistleblower protections. The Act also provides for the Central Bank to commission, as part of the proper and effective regulation of financial service providers, an independent expert report at the cost of the financial service provider. It strengthens the authorised officer regime, enables the Central Bank to secure assurances from auditors of regulated financial service providers.  It also strengthens the enforcement powers of the Central Bank and provides for a substantial increase in monetary penalties  . The Central Bank also has the power to suspend or revoke a regulated entity's authorisation following an Inquiry. </p></reply>

This strategy maximises tax recoveries and reduces the regulatory and administrative burden placed on largely compliant customers. Cases are selected in a number of ways including the use of REAP which is Revenue's electronic risk analysis system, the use of advanced analytics to support real-time risk models for VAT and PAYE and debt recovery to identify risky cases in realtime through enhanced third party information like supply chain data on fuel oil movements, merchant acquirer data on credit and debit card transactions and Government payments data.</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware from questions that he has raised previously in the House that specific programmes are currently ongoing in Revenue relating to compliance with Local Property Tax obligations, Household Charge Arrears and the National Contractors project to which he has received comprehensive replies.</p><p>It is clear to me that Revenue is very much a compliance focussed tax administration.  The various strategies and approaches they adopt to maximise compliance are regularly reviewed by the Commissioners and their ensuing programmes take account of the emerging risks and challenges.  I am also aware that Revenue monitors international developments for new ways of tackling all forms of non-compliance using a risk-based approach while ensuring that compliant taxpayers are not unduly burdened with unnecessary costs and administrative overheads.  </p><p>Over the last number of Finance Acts, I have introduced various measures to facilitate tax and duty compliance.  I will continue to respond positively through the Finance Bill to well designed proposals from the Commissioners that tackle non-compliance and support legitimate trade.  </p></reply>

This Government has taken steps to ensure that the Irish financial market is accessible to any financial institution considering establishing in Ireland. In seeking to reduce the barriers to entry which are specific to the Irish banking market, Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act, as amended, which provides for the regulation of bank fees and charges has been disapplied for the first three years in the case of new financial service providers setting up in Ireland.  This arrangement was provided for in the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013.</p></reply>

Quotas are denominated in Special Drawing Rights, the IMF's unit of account.</p><p>Ireland's IMF quota is currently SDR 1,257.6 million, or 0.528% of the total quota share of the IMF. This has been the case since 4 March, 2011, when the 2008 Quota Review came into force.   Details of transactions on the Central Bank's IMF accounts are set out in the Annual Report on Ireland's Participation in the IMF and the World Bank (available at ).</p><p>Ireland's quota is due to increase to SDR 3,449.9 million, or 0.724% of the total quota share of the IMF, once the latest proposed Quota changes, agreed in 2010, are implemented.   The 2010 Quota increases are part of an overall package of reforms of quotas and of the Executive Board of the IMF. However, while the increases to the quotas themselves have since been approved, the proposed changes to the Executive Board have not yet received the required level of consent of members. As a result, the overall package of reforms   including the quota increase   has not yet been implemented.  </p></reply>

In its recently published 'Credit Union PRISM Risk Assessments: Supervisory Commentary', the Central Bank has highlighted that the majority of credit unions visited have been required to implement actions to remediate risk and substantially improve their lending and credit risk management standards and practices.  Where required, risk mitigation has included the Central Bank imposing lending restrictions until fundamental weaknesses are addressed. These lending restrictions have been put in place in credit unions where there are regulatory concerns about the operation of these individual credit unions and the potential risk to members' savings. </p><p>  Currently about 59% of all credit unions are subject to lending restrictions. Almost all credit unions with a lending restriction in place have a maximum individual loan size restriction. Of the credit unions with lending restrictions, approximately 70% currently can lend &euro;20,000 or more to an individual member, which is a sizeable monetary amount and should cover most individual  circumstances.</p><p>  The Central Bank advises that it sees restrictions, in most cases, as short term in nature, to be lifted when risks have been addressed satisfactorily and necessary corrective measures embedded. The Registrar of Credit Unions informs me that lending restrictions are reviewed on a regular basis. I have introduced legislative changes so that lending restrictions are now subject to an independent appeals process. </p><p>  I have, on a number of occasions, highlighted the Governments' recognition of the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement in this country and also the importance of getting lending going in the economy. However, the issue of lending needs to be constructively considered in order to ensure a viable credit union sector into the future. </p></reply>

As Irish Water was established as a subsidiary of Bord Gais &Eacute;ireann, the Minister for Communications Energy and Natural Resources also has statutory functions in relation to Irish Water.    As with all public expenditure policies involving public funds or semi-states, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has an oversight role.  In relation to water charging, the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 makes the Commission for Energy Regulation responsible for decisions on the charging structure for water supply.  The Government's intention is that following the sale of the Generation assets by Bord Gais &Eacute;ireann, the establishment of Eirvia and the placement of NewEra on a statutory footing,  there will be a future examination and rationalisation of the shareholding structure in Irish Water. This will be the subject to a Government decision in the autumn.  It is envisaged that this will not impact on the policy roles for the various Government Departments as outlined above. </p></reply>

The risk of smuggling (including drug smuggling) using unscheduled flights is fully appreciated by Revenue and is the subject of continuous assessment and risk analysis. The decision on whether or not to search a private aircraft is based on risk analysis, profiling, evaluation of national and international smuggling trends, journey frequency, routes and other risk indicators. It can also be a result of specific intelligence.  Flights with origins and destinations with a high-risk rating attract particular attention. </p><p>  While private aircraft are boarded from time to time at the Airport to check for any excisable products or prohibited items including drugs, it is not appropriate for the Revenue Commissioners to publish precise details of such enforcement activities as this could prejudice current or future operations. The Commissioners further advise me that passengers and crew from private aircraft who enter the State are subject to the same checks as any other arrivals, including individual profiling, and are liable to be checked by Revenue Customs staff and screened by the drug detector dog.</p><p>  In line with best practice in customs administrations globally, Revenue regards the development and management of information and intelligence as critical to the detection of evasion and smuggling, including drug smuggling.  This is very important in the case of Ireland and other EU Member States where the operating environment for Customs has been shaped to a significant degree by the introduction of the Internal Market and the related principals of freedom of movement within the EU. Of specific relevance are the abolition of routine and systematic Customs checks on goods and passengers moving within any part of the EU. The approach has, of necessity, been to balance the freedom of movement principle in regard to people and goods with the need to control smuggling.</p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that the Revenue Commissioners attach the highest priority to combating the smuggling of controlled drugs and are committed to playing an active role, in conjunction with other relevant agencies, in working against this criminal activity and those responsible for it.</p></reply>

I have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions passing on the European Central Bank interest rate change or to the mortgage interest rates charged.  It is a commercial matter for each institution concerned.  The ECB marginal lending facility rates from November 2011 are as follows:<table><tr><th>Date</th><th>ECB rate reductions</th></tr><tr><td>09/11/2011</td><td>=   2.00%</td></tr><tr><td>14/12/2011</td><td>=   1.75%</td></tr><tr><td>11/07/2012</td><td>=   1.50%</td></tr><tr><td>08/05/2013</td><td>=   1.00%</td></tr><tr><td>13/11/2013</td><td>=   0.75%</td></tr><tr><td>11/06/2104</td><td>=   0.40%</td></tr></table></p><p>The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations.  The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned.  This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors, including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution's overall funding.</p><p>The Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by financial institutions, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997.   However, as part of the Central Bank s work on mortgage arrears, lenders were asked to consider all avenues to help customers in arrears, including interest rate reductions. </p><p>Since the meeting in November 2011, I have had further meetings with the various banks at senior level at which this issue would have been one of many issues discussed. It would also be discussed at regular meetings between my officials and the banks. However, it should be noted that the Relationship Frameworks specifically reference decisions regarding pricing as being commercial decisions for the banks.</p></reply>

In the first instance a harmonised set of EU rules on capital requirements for credit institutions and investment firms was agreed early last year. These rules apply to all 28 EU Member States and were transposed into Irish law earlier this year. The rules set stronger prudential requirements for banks, requiring them to keep sufficient capital reserves and liquidity. They aim to strengthen the effectiveness of the regulation of credit institutions and investment firms in the EU and enhance financial stability. A further objective is to contain the pro-cyclicality of the financial system which in turn will ensure a high level of protection for investors and depositors and will benefit of the operators in these markets. </p><p>  These rules are an important part of the Single Rulebook which is the foundation of the banking union. The Single Rulebook consists of a set of legislative texts which all financial institutions in the EU must comply with. The Single Rulebook also contains improved rules on depositor protection and rules for managing failing banks.</p><p>  In addition to this Single Rulebook the Deputy will recall that further integration of the banking system was considered necessary for Member States within the currency union and on this basis Eurozone Member States agreed to the creation of a banking union. In a supervision context the banking union will include a Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) which creates a new system of financial supervision comprising of the ECB and national supervisory authorities of the participating Member States. Under this new system of supervision the ECB will directly supervise significant credit institutions and will work closely with national supervisors to supervise other credit institutions under the general oversight of the ECB. </p><p>  With regard to implementation of this common system of supervision, the ECB will take over its supervisory responsibilities on 4 November of this year. I understand that ECB's preparations for this are well under way at this stage. Ms Danielle Nouy was appointed Chair of the Supervisory Board of the SSM in December 2013. Ms Sabine Lautenschlager was appointed Vice-Chair in February of this year and a further three appointments to the Board were made in March. The ECB recently confirmed that it has largely completed the establishment of the SSM governance structures. The Supervisory Board adopted its Rules of Procedure on 31 March 2014 and they entered into force on 1 April 2014. </p><p>  In relation to staffing of the SSM I understand this is proceeding and is taking place in a top-down fashion. The SSM has also confirmed that preparatory work is well advanced in areas such as IT infrastructure, HR and legal services. </p><p>  In April of this year the ECB published its framework regulation which lays down the main procedures governing cooperation between the ECB and national supervisors. </p><p>  Furthermore, the Deputy will be aware that the ECB is performing a comprehensive assessment of the banks balance sheets, including an asset quality review and a stress test, prior to it assuming full responsibility under the SSM in November. I understand this process is on track and final results should be published by the end of October. </p><p>  In summary the process of putting in place a European system of banking supervision is well underway. It is expected that the momentum behind this project will continue at a steady pace over the next few months with a view to the SSM being fully operational by November of this year.</p></reply>

Following the publication I requested that the three banks in which the State is a shareholder make savings in total remuneration costs of 6% to 10%.  The three banks responded with their individual strategies, designed to achieve the required savings, by the due date of 30 April as requested. I was not prescriptive in how this was to be achieved respecting their differing State ownership and investment and paths to profitability. I reviewed the plans submitted and in light of the various industrial relations developments during 2013 I was satisfied that the banks' plans would meet my direction.</p><p>  It is worth noting in this context that in their respective 2013 annual results,  AIB reported a 16% year-on-year decline in costs while ptsb reported a 13% decline in staff costs. Including a one-off pension related gain of c&euro;400m, Bank of Ireland's total costs reduced by 28% year-on-year.  Despite this momentum it is imperative that all the banks make every effort to hold down costs in the coming years and particularly staff related costs which form the majority of total costs.</p></reply>

Instead, the regime addresses the problem of pension overfunding and excessive pension accrual by imposing a much higher effective tax charge on the value of retirement benefits above set limits when they are drawn down, thus discouraging the building up through contributions of large pension funds in the first place or the unwinding of the tax advantage of such overfunding excessive pension accrual by way of the higher effective tax charge.</p><p>  The yield from the changes made to the SFT regime is estimated at &euro;120 million in 2014 and in a full year and is expected to arise in two main ways: firstly, from the cessation of tax-relieved contributions to pension saving from those employees and individuals in the private sector affected in the short to medium term by the changes and, secondly, by the conversion, to some degree, of employer pension contributions and pension promises in respect of those employed individuals into compensatory current taxable remuneration. In addition, some of the yield will also arise from affected individuals who remain in pension arrangements and continue to contribute to them or accrue benefits under them, and will take the form of chargeable excess tax payable at retirement where their SFT or Personal Fund Threshold (PFT), as appropriate, is exceeded. This increased tax will effectively claw back any tax subsidy which helped fund the excess over the SFT or PFT.</p><p>  These savings and additional tax revenues would mainly impact on the yield from income tax but it would not be possible (except through the imposition of significant additional administrative burden and cost on employers and pension administrators) to separately identify the total yield from the changes to the SFT regime from the general income tax yield. The Deputy will be aware that the yield from income tax in the first half of 2014 is marginally ahead of target for the period.</p></reply>

This is the maximum allowable variation that can be applied by any local authority and is referred to as the &quot;local adjustment factor&quot; (LAF).</p><p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a reduction in the LPT rates by 15% in 2015 would result in a corresponding reduction of 15% in the amount of LPT payable for that year per local authority. In relation to the Deputy's request for an estimate of the loss of revenue based on 2014 data, I am advised that compliance data in relation to LPT is available broken down by city and county councils nationally and the most up to date figures for LPT collected in 2013 and 2014 were published on 16 April 2014 on the Commissioners' website at: . The Commissioners have confirmed that more up-to-date data and analysis will be published shortly. </p><p>I am further advised that the 2014 yield figure set out in these published statistics includes payments received from some local authorities for their 2013 LPT liability (payment was due on 1 January 2014), payment of arrears in relation to 2013 LPT and Household Charge payments made as a result of compliance activity by the Revenue Commissioners. As most of these amounts will be non-recurring, the projected annual yield from LPT alone is estimated to be in the region of &euro;500m. Consequently, the Commissioners have confirmed that a 15% reduction in the basic LPT rate in 2015 by each city and county council would reduce the estimated LPT yield by &euro;75m nationally.  Precise details of how this estimated &euro;75m reduction would be spread across the local authorities are not currently available but the Deputy will be able to arrive at a reasonable approximation using the published data, which has also been made available to local authorities for their information.</p></reply>

Over 400 institutions are currently covered by the DGS.  This number includes all credit unions in Ireland. </p><p>  While the total deposits in the financial sector in Ireland at end February 2014 was &euro;465bn, the Central Bank advises me that this includes deposits such as interbank deposits which are not eligible for coverage under the DGS scheme. The total amount for the purposes of DGS scheme is much lower at approximately &euro;185bn. The level of deposits actually covered would be lower again as only amounts up to &euro;100,000 per eligible depositor per credit institution are covered. The Central Bank is currently working with credit institutions to extract data on the actual amount in such accounts covered under the Deposit Guarantee Scheme.</p><p>  The new EU Directive on Deposit Guarantee Schemes which will come into effect in mid 2015 requires that all credit institutions mark deposits in such a way that allows for the immediate identification of deposits that are eligible for protection under the Deposit Guarantee Scheme. The Central Bank is currently working with credit institutions to meet the requirements of the Directive.</p></reply>

However, I understand that many restructures are proposed on a trial basis during which the payment capability of the borrower is tested before the offer counts as a permanent restructure.</p><p>As statutory regulator of credit institutions, the Central Bank has the power to require banks to meaningfully address mortgage arrears cases on their books.  As the Deputy is aware, the Central Bank has set specific targets, which the six main banks are required to meet on a quarterly basis, in terms of offering and concluding sustainable solutions for those in mortgage arrears of greater than 90 days.  The Central Bank's latest 'Residential Mortgage Arrears and Repossessions Statistics' publication for the end of Q1 2014 (), shows that 92,442 principal dwelling houses (PDH) mortgage accounts were categorised as restructured at the end of March 2014, an increase of 10 per cent from the stock of restructured accounts reported at the of December 2013. </p><p>The monthly mortgage restructures and arrears data for the six main lenders (about 90% of the market) published by my Department also provides an impetus for those MART banks to increase the pace of provision of mortgage restructures.  The latest publication, in respect of the end of May, shows that some progress has been made in putting permanent mortgage restructures in place.  For example, the total number of permanent restructures of principal dwelling houses (PDH) mortgages has risen from around 51,000 in December to over 69,000 in May 2014.  </p><p>This data, as well as the Central Bank quarterly mortgage arrears publications, would appear to demonstrate some success by the lenders in addressing the accounts in arrears as well as measures to prevent borrowers from going into arrears.  Taken together, the framework is in place to enable banks to work with distressed homeowners to reach sustainable solutions for dealing with their personal indebted situations.  However, early and effective engagement between borrowers and lenders is key to resolving the cases of mortgage difficulty.  Where there is effective and meaningful engagement by all parties regarding a mortgage difficulty, the data shows that an increasing number of durable long term mortgage restructures is being put in place.</p></reply>

Borrowers also have the right to appeal to the lender's Appeals Board if they are not happy with the alternative repayment arrangement offered or where a lender declines to offer an alternative repayment arrangement or if they believe they have been wrongly classified as not co-operating.  If the borrower is still unhappy with the outcome of the appeal, or the complaint made to the lender, they can refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman.</p><p>The Central Bank's latest 'Residential Mortgage Arrears and Repossessions Statistics' publication for the end of Q1 2014 (), shows that the number of mortgage accounts for PDH in arrears, fell for the third consecutive quarter.  A total of 132,217 PDH accounts were in arrears at end March 2014 which is a decline of 3.2 per cent relative to end Q4 2013.  The publication also shows that a total of 29,801 new restructure arrangements were agreed during the first quarter of 2014 which reflects a 25.3 per cent increase on the number of new arrangements agreed during the previous quarter.  </p><p>Early and effective engagement between borrowers and lenders is key to resolving the cases of mortgage difficulty.  Where there is effective and meaningful engagement by all parties regarding a mortgage difficulty, the data shows that an increasing number of durable long term mortgage restructures is being put in place.  However, it is accepted that it will be necessary for lenders and borrowers to continue to build on this.</p></reply>

Building on the commitments of the Programme for Government and the Medium Term Economic Strategy, the following key priorities were set out:</p><p>- Strengthening the Domestic Economy and Prioritising New Jobs for the Unemploye</p><p>- Delivering Better Living and Working Standards</p><p>- Improving Housing Availability and Affordability</p><p>- Responsible and Sustainable Management of the Public Finances</p><p>- Rebuilding Trust in Politics and Public Institutions</p><p>- Protecting and Enhancing Peace in Northern Ireland</p><p><b>1.   Strengthening the Domestic Economy and Prioritising New Jobs for the Unemployed</b></p><p>In relation to the first priority, some of the specific actions relevant to my Department include:</p><p>- Enacting legislation to establish the Strategic Banking Corporation. By 2018 this will make up to &euro;4 billion in low-cost funding available to small and medium-sized businesses.</p><p>- Enacting legislation to establish the &euro;6 billion Irish Strategic Investment Fund to make commercial investments in Irish enterprise and infrastructure.</p><p>- Using the same legislation to establish NewERA on a statutory footing to support higher investment levels and better returns from our commercial semi-states.</p><p>- Continuing to support the development of Dublin as an international city region that will have positive economic benefits for the entire country.</p><p>As well as these specific actions, my Department will continue to examine the use of its policy levers to assist sectoral economic growth as reflected in policies already introduced to support tourism, agriculture, SMEs etc. My Department will also play a leadership role in developing the Construction 2020 Strategy and actively engaging with the Retail Consultation Forum.</p><p><b>2. Delivering Better Living and Working Standards</b></p><p>Consistent with the measures to be taken to create more jobs and reduce unemployment, Government has committed to delivering a new deal on living standards to ensure that the economic recovery is felt by low- and middle-income working families. Through the budgetary process, I will work with my Ministerial colleague, Brendan Howlin TD to:</p><p>- Introduce measures to assist low-income families by improving the system of child income supports such that those moving from welfare to work will retain payments for children to ensure that people are better off in work.</p><p>- Increase access to subsidised childcare and afterschool places by extending eligibility and rebalancing parental contributions for families making their way into employment.</p><p>- Announce a tax reform plan to be delivered over a number of budgets to reduce the 52% tax rate on low- and middle-income earners in a manner that maintains the highly progressive nature of the Irish tax system.</p><p>- Increase the Household Benefits Package by &euro;100, in part to compensate older people and other vulnerable groups for the introduction of water charges. </p><p>My Department will also assist in completing, by end-2014, a review of the implementation of the Central Bank's mortgage arrears targets set for the banks and the operation of the Insolvency Service to ensure that both bodies have the powers needed to support families willing to work their way through their debt problems.</p><p><b>3. Improving Housing Availability &amp;amp; Affordability </b></p><p>My Government colleagues and I recognise that adequate supply of housing for all sectors is fundamental to a healthy society and a vibrant economy. The Department of Finance is playing a leading role in implementing the Construction 2020 strategy. A key policy objective is to ensure that home ownership remains an attainable ambition for young families. My Department will be centrally involved in:</p><p>- Assessing the merits of a new 'Help to Build' funding schemes for the development of affordable housing in the private sector, and the merits of a new &quot;New Buy&quot; scheme to ensure availability of adequate, affordable mortgage finance for first-time buyers when new housing output comes on-stream in advance of Budget 2015.</p><p>- Working with national and European competition authorities to encourage and support new mortgage lenders into the market in order to put downward pressure on interest rates for variable rate mortgage customers, both new and existing.</p><p>- Liaising with NAMA to ensure the timely and coherent delivery of a successful Strategic Development Zone to maximise the delivery of residential housing units, as well as to deliver commercial space in Dublin's Central Business District.</p><p>- Sourcing significant new sources of finance from, e.g. the EIB, ISIF, pension funds and the private market to assist the Social Housing Strategy.</p><p><b>4. Responsible and Sustainable Management of the Public Finances</b></p><p>A central pillar of Government strategy since it took office is to return the public finances to a sustainable position and introduce safeguards that will ensure past mistakes are not repeated. In this respect:</p><p>- Our Medium Term Economic Strategy commits us in the first instance to cutting the deficit to 3% of GDP by 2015.</p><p>- The state's investment in Bank of Ireland shows that the careful management and disposal of our bank holdings can result in good returns for the taxpayer. The Government will continue to work through diplomatic channels to build international support for measures that will reduce Ireland's debt. The disposal of the remaining bank assets will reduce this sector's contribution to the State's excessive debt levels.</p><p>- NAMA was an agency born out of the banking crisis and the Government is determined to ensure it concludes its work as quickly as possible. The ongoing review of NAMA strategy will be published in the coming weeks and it will support an accelerated disposal strategy that will mean at least 80% of the assets will be disposed of by end 2016.</p><p>- As Europe emerges from the financial crisis, the Union must focus on issues that will make a real difference to the daily lives of its citizens. The Government remains committed to ensuring that the European Union prioritises the key themes which were central to Ireland's presidency   Jobs, Stability and Growth. Both government parties will work through their membership of the largest European political families   the EPP and PES   to ensure that growth and job creation are at the heart of EU's agenda. I will further this agenda through Eurogroup and ECOFIN and its relevant agencies. My Department plays a very significant role in representing Ireland at European and International institutions and we intend to use all of our interactions to ensure these institutions are focused on increasing global economic growth.  </p><p><b>5. Rebuilding Trust in Politics &amp;amp; Public Institutions </b></p><p>In relation to rebuilding trust in politics and public institutions, greater transparency in budgetary policy through the publication of the Medium Term Budgetary Framework along with the independent oversight of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council reinforces the integrity of the budgetary process. Enhanced engagement with the Oireachtas at Ministerial and official level also illustrates my Department's commitment to rebuilding trust in public institutions. For example, I now engage with the Oireachtas Committee on a quarterly basis ahead of ECOFIN to assess Ireland's views on European policy.Over the remaining term of this Government, my Department will continue to further this agenda through:</p><p>- Legislating to give NewERA, which manages the State's shareholder function in relation to commercial semi-state companies, the responsibility to provide advice to the relevant Minister on appointments to the semi-state boards.</p><p>- Assisting in systemically publishing details of all appointments to State Boards by providing details of appointments to boards under the aegis of the Department of Finance.</p><p>- Facilitating the retention by local authorities of 80% of the proceeds of  the local property tax from 2015, with the option to vary the rate by up to 15%. This will be done in a manner that ensures that no local authority will be worse off as a result of the funding reforms, and that some local authority areas where property values and property tax bills are higher than average will be better off. It will be up to the new councils to decide whether to use any surplus funds to cut the rate of property tax or to fund additional services. </p><p>To conclude, we have achieved a great deal over the past 3 years but we must not become complacent. We will continue to place job creation and economic growth at the heart of all our economic policies. As we return to more normal times the Statement of Priorities, that builds on the programme for Government and the Medium term Economic Strategy (as a blueprint to sustain a competitive economy that can pay its own way, serve society, and that can survive and thrive in a reformed Eurozone and an increasingly globalised international economy) offers a roadmap on how we intend to help working families and low and middle income workers. My Department remains fully committed to delivering on these priorities.</p></reply>

This may include an interest only or other temporary solution for a period if it is likely that full repayment of the original or revised principal will be achieved over time, or where there is a payment plan to return the account to sustainability through the clearance of arrears.</p><p>A personal insolvency arrangement effected under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012; or</p><p>If an arrangement could not be reached or is not appropriate, that the PDH and BTL property securing the loan has been voluntarily sold or, failing that, any situation where a Specified Credit Institution takes possession of the property including by way of voluntary agreement with the borrower or by Court Order or otherwise&quot;.</p><p>The Central Bank has informed me that a range of sustainable solutions have been utilised by each of the lenders to date. These include but are not limited to the following:</p><p>- Term Extensions</p><p>- Split Mortgages</p><p>- Permanent Interest Rate Reductions</p><p>- Voluntary Solutions</p><p>The Central Bank has advised that each sustainable solution impacts the outstanding loan balance and arrears in different ways. For example, an arrears capitalisation involves adding the outstanding arrears to the loan balance which is then repaid over the duration of the loan term whereas a split mortgage involves splitting the loan balance (including the arrears) into affordable and warehoused portions. Additionally, the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) sets out requirements for mortgage lenders dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears. The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers.  The CCMA sets out how mortgage lenders must treat borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears, with due regard to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits.   The CCMA sets out a list of options for alternative repayment arrangements that may be offered by lenders. Provision 39 of the CCMA requires lenders to explore all of the options for alternative repayment arrangements offered by that lender.  Under the CCMA, where an alternative repayment arrangement is offered by a lender, the lender must provide the borrower with a clear explanation, on paper or another durable medium, of how the alternative repayment arrangement works, including:</p><p>a) the reasons why the alternative repayment arrangement(s) offered is considered to be appropriate and sustainable for the borrower as documented by the lender in compliance with Provision 40 of the CCMA, including demonstrating, by reference to the borrower's individual circumstances, the advantages of the offer for the borrower and explaining any disadvantages; </p><p>b) the new mortgage repayment amount; </p><p>c) the term of the alternative repayment arrangement; </p><p>d) the implications arising from the alternative repayment arrangement for the existing mortgage including the impact on: </p><p>the mortgage term, </p><p>the balance outstanding on the mortgage loan account, and </p><p>the existing arrears on the account, if any; </p><p>e) a statement that the alternative repayment arrangement may impact on the borrower's mortgage protection cover; </p><p>f) the frequency with which the alternative repayment arrangement will be reviewed in line with Provision 43, the reason(s) for the reviews and the potential outcome of the reviews, where: </p><p>circumstances improve, </p><p>circumstances disimprove, and </p><p>circumstances remain the same; </p><p>g) details of any residual mortgage debt remaining at the end of an alternative repayment arrangement and owed by the borrower; </p><p>h) how interest will be applied to the mortgage loan account as a result of the alternative repayment arrangement; </p><p>i) how the alternative repayment arrangement will be reported by the lender to the Irish Credit Bureau or any other credit reference agency or credit register and the anticipated impact of this on the borrower's credit rating; and </p><p>j) the timeframe within which the borrower must accept or decline the offer. </p><p>A lender must also advise the borrower to take appropriate independent legal and/or financial advice.  </p><p>The framework is in place to enable banks to work with distressed homeowners to reach sustainable solutions for dealing with their personal indebted situations.  However, early and effective engagement between borrowers and lenders is key to resolving the cases of mortgage difficulty. </p></reply>

The non-pay grant to each ETB, to meet the costs of its schools and administrative offices, is determined having regard to pupil enrolment variations, an estimate of the ETB's receipts, various programmes being run by the Board and the amount available for distribution. ETBs are given a high level of autonomy in the management and appropriation of this grant and each may distribute it in line with its priorities and perceptions of need. </p><p>My Department is engaged in a project to devise future complementary organisational designs for ETBs and SOLAS in order to reflect their new roles.

The Statement should identify potential hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and put appropriate provision in place to safeguard the safety and health of employees and pupils. The Health and Safety Authority in conjunction with the Kilkenny Education Centre issued guidance to all primary schools in relation to managing safety, health and welfare.

SEAI and the DCENR have developed an online energy monitoring &amp;amp; reporting (M&amp;R) system to satisfy the reporting requirements of both S.I. 542 of 2009 and the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan.</p><p>  An online Monitoring and Reporting system is being developed and tested at present so public bodies, including schools, can report their energy consumption for all fuel types (e.g. electricity, gas, and oil).  Testing and pilot project with schools has been completed in 2014.</p><p>  To ensure the process is as simple and concise as possible SEAI will: Invite feedback on the monitoring and reporting system from organisations in the education sector; Roll-out to all schools will commence in January 2015.  As well as enabling schools to report and track their energy data annually, the system will generate, for each school, its own a scorecard that will present a powerful snapshot of both the school's progress to date and its performance compared to its peers.  It will be a powerful tool for tracking, benchmarking and improving energy performance and will assist schools in targeting energy savings.  The savings which each school will make will depend on factors specific to the school including the level of expenditure on energy which will vary from school to school.  It is not possible, at this time, to express such savings as a percentage of the capitation funding which will be available to schools in 2015 and 2016.</p></reply>

They will continue to be a feature of our education landscape.  As part of the Budget 2012 decisions, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools is being gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014.  In these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement.  The phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible.  If amalgamations do take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by the Department.</p><p>How best to sustain provision for widely dispersed and small Protestant communities does present as a particular challenge especially in any locality where enrolment in their schools is declining to single figures and amalgamation is not an option because there is no other school nearby.  The Government is intent in fostering pluralism in school provision.  Supporting minority churches in maintaining their schools is part of that policy.</p><p>Our current configuration of small primary schools has been examined by the Department in a value for money (VFM) review.  This review took account of the ethos of schools and the locations of small schools relative to other schools of a similar type.  I will be considering this review in consultation with my Government colleagues and I intend to publish the report on completion of this consideration process.</p><p>It should also be noted that my Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the schools that are affected by the budget measure.  In this regard small schools will not lose their classroom post if they are projecting sustainable increased enrolments in September 2014 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term.  </p><p>The detailed arrangements in relation to the appeals process are set in the Department's Staffing Circular 0007/2014.  The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p></reply>

Normal deductions from salary continue to be made.  </p><p>Teachers on secondment to the European Schools also receive an additional salary from the European Schools which will be linked to the level of their salary in Ireland.

The grant is divided between pay and non-pay.</p><p>The pay grant covers the cost of sanctioned posts directly on an ETB's payroll at authorised rates of pay, and it is broken down by teacher pay, special needs assistant pay, administrative staff pay and maintenance staff pay. Both teaching and non-teaching staff allocations are approved on an ETB basis and it is a matter for each ETB to distribute the staffing allocations concerned within its scheme. </p><p>The non-pay grant (standard expenditure) to each ETB is determined having regard to pupil enrolment variations, certain other costs, an estimate of the ETB's receipts (mainly receipts from night classes) and the amount available for distribution.  The grant is to meet costs associated with the ETB's administrative offices, certain other administrative costs and costs associated directly with schools. ETBs are given a high level of autonomy in the management and appropriation of the grant in respect of standard expenditure, and each ETB is allowed to distribute the grant in line with its priorities and perceptions of need. The non-pay grant also includes provision for, inter alia, the schools services support fund (SSSF), DEIS schools, the book grant, programme grants (e.g. transition year programme) and special class grants (known collectively as associated expenditure). Associated expenditure grants are determined on a per capita basis.</p><p>The total pay grant in 2014 amounts to some &euro;710m. Of this, the Department's allocation for teacher pay is &euro;572m approximately, for SNA pay is &euro;25m, for administrative pay is &euro;47m approximately and some &euro;24m for maintenance pay. Pay costs across all headings are also funded by receipts retained by the ETBs of &euro;41m, comprised principally of retained superannuation contributions.</p><p>The total non-pay grant in 2014 amounts to some &euro;69m. This is comprised primarily of Department funding of &euro;61m approximately and by non-pay receipts retained by the ETBs which, it is projected, will be of the order of &euro;8m.</p><p>Capital funding is available to the ETB sector in respect of approved capital projects.  Any ETB with such a project draws down funding as the project progresses.A number of large scale school projects are devolved to the ETB sector for delivery and appropriate funding arrangements are in place in such instances. The current status of all schools on the school building programme may be viewed on my Department's website at www.education.ie </p><p>There are currently a total of 256 ETB post primary schools. Details of the number of post primary schools in each ETB are set out on the attached table</p><p><table><tr><th>ETB</th><th>Post Primary Schools </th></tr><tr><td>Cavan and Monaghan</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>City of Dublin</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin and Dun Laoghaire</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Galway and Roscommon</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare and Wicklow</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny and Carlow</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Laois and Offaly</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick and Clare</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Longford and Westmeath</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Louth and Meath</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo and Sligo and Leitrim</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary </td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford and Wexford</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>256</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This funding is now allocated by SOLAS as appropriate to the relevant ETBs managing those training centres. All major assets of SOLAS (Training Centres, Equipment and Machinery) were transferred to the Education and Training Boards in line with legislation.  </p><p>While there is no dedicated capital budget for further education (former VEC) programmes, a small amount of funding is allocated annually to ETBs in response to applications for funding for emergency works. In 2013 a total of &euro;736,000 in such funding was allocated.</p><p>  The recent FET strategy suggested that a dedicated capital funding provision should be a feature of allocations to the ETBs in order to support changes set out in the strategy and the development of further education and training services to learners. This will be considered in the context of the overall capital funding needs of the education and training sector.</p></reply>

These include intensive literacy and numeracy programmes, out-of-school, after school and holiday time supports as well as special needs supports provided to assist young people at risk. It should be noted that there has been a substantial expansion of these initiatives since the establishment of this facility by the Christian Brothers in 1996. </p><p>  The major budgetary pressures within my Department place significant constraints on its capacity to support existing programmes and, consequently, given the significant range of educational disadvantage interventions already supported by my Department, there is no scope to meet a request for addition funding for this organisation beyond the level of support currently allocated.</p><p>The Educational Welfare Services of the Child and Family Agency, TUSLA, which has a statutory remit in relation to school attendance, can provide assistance to parents or guardians in finding appropriate educational placements for all children including those currently in the centre which is the subject of this question.</p></reply>

The clear measure on which the delivery of the Haddington Road Agreement must be judged, therefore, is the impact that the various measures have on the overall Public Service Exchequer Pay and Pensions Bill, while facilitating the maintenance and provision of necessary public services in a period of intense resource constraint.</p><p>It is clear that the Agreement has facilitated, and will continue to facilitate, significant reductions in the Public Service Exchequer Pay and Pensions Bill. This is evident from the fact that the net Public Service Exchequer Pay Bill reduced by &euro;210 million in 2013. This reduction was enabled, in large part, by the implementation of various measures in the first 6 months of the Haddington Road Agreement. The underlying savings have also allowed some recruitment to frontline services, particularly in the Health and Education Sector. More generally, it should be noted that the Public Service Exchequer Pay Bill will have been reduced by 22% from &euro;17.5 billion gross in 2009 to an estimated &euro;14.6 billion gross, or &euro;13.6 billion net, by the end of 2014.  </p><p>The savings arising from the implementation of various measures in the Agreement are incorporated in advance in the context of the Estimates process each year. It is then the responsibility of Public Service Management and each Department's Accounting Officer to deliver the required level of savings through complete implementation of the various reforms and workplace changes which the Agreement enables to ensure that their respective Pay Bill targets are met. </p><p>In 2013, the total amount of allocated savings arising from the implementation of measures under the Agreement was almost &euro;300 million. Of this total, approximately &euro;251 million was allocated to Exchequer pay savings with further savings of &euro;46 million arising from pensions and a number of other non-Exchequer sources (e.g. Local Authorities, Central Bank). </p><p>In 2014, a further &euro;465 million in savings arising from the implementation of measures under the Agreement was incorporated into the budgetary arithmetic. This reflects the full year impact of various measures implemented in 2013, as well as measures which are to be implemented in 2014, such as the deferral of incremental progression.  This brings the total amount of savings allocated to date under the Agreement to &euro;762 million.   </p><p>Specifically, the pay reduction to those earning over &euro;65,000, will deliver approximately &euro;210 million of the targeted &euro;1 billion in savings over the lifetime of the Agreement. Other central measures, including pension reductions and increment pauses, will deliver in the order of &euro;130 million, bringing the total amount of savings from central measures to over &euro;340 million by 2016.</p><p><b>Summary of savings from Central measures </b></p><p><table><tr><th></th><th>Full year</th></tr><tr><td>Reduction in higher pay</td><td>&euro;210 million</td></tr><tr><td>Increment deferrals</td><td>&euro;60 million</td></tr><tr><td>Other measures - including pensions</td><td>&euro;72 million</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>&euro;342 milllion</td></tr></table></p><p>With approximately two years remaining in the lifetime of the Agreement, over 75% (&euro;762 million) of the &euro;1 billion reduction targeted has been incorporated into the relevant Votes. The Agreement has also facilitated additional recruitment in front line posts. In relation to further savings to be delivered under the Agreement, these savings will be reflected in the various Vote allocations as appropriate, in the context of the overall Estimates process.</p></reply>

PSPR is an actual reduction of pension, rather than a levy or deduction from pension. This means there is no actual flow of funds to the Exchequer or to the public finances generally from PSPR, and therefore there is no annual time series of PSPR inflows.</p><p>  In each of the years 2011 and 2012, PSPR saved an estimated &euro;100 million for the public finances in the shape of reduced public service pension outgo. The saving in the year 2013 is estimated to have been about &euro;113 million, reflecting in particular increased PSPR rates and wider PSPR application from 1 July 2013 under the terms of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013.  The projected saving in each of the years 2014 and 2015 is &euro;125 million.</p><p>  Pensioners with public service pension income below &euro;12,000 are in all cases exempt from PSPR. A higher exemption threshold of &euro;32,500 applies to pension awards to persons who have retired since the end of February 2012. In overall terms PSPR is estimated to affect the pensions of about 90,000 persons.</p><p>  Under section 12 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, I am required to review the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2009-2013 annually and cause a written report of my findings to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. As part of that review I am required to consider whether the various measures, including the PSPR, continue to be necessary, having regard to the purposes of the legislation. My last such report was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in June 2014. In that report I concluded, inter alia, that PSPR continued to be necessary, and I have no plans to amend it at present.</p></reply>

As can be seen from this update significant progress has been made in my Department.</p><p>The progress identified to date clearly shows that the Government has focused its attention on the decisions and reforms needed to achieve economic and financial stability, which provide a platform for economic recovery. My Department is determined to continue to implement our Programme for Government commitments to restore the public's confidence in our economy and to achieve a strong and sustainable economy.</p><p>Many of the reforms in the Programme are ambitious and need careful sequencing and expertly executed delivery plans.

The plan will be based on a comprehensive study of Ireland's public investment priorities over that period. </td><td>Completed </td></tr><tr><td>In the initial years, when resources will be most heavily constrained, we will prioritise investment in school building, non-national roads, healthcare, and in job-creation. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will insist that major capital projects are subjected to proper cost-benefit analysis and evaluation, improving future productivity and growth prospects, and that the value-for-money obtained is significantly enhanced compared to the most recent period. </td><td>Completed </td></tr><tr><td>The new NDP will be based on traditional exchequer capital spending, plus other resources to be invested from the National Pension Reserve Fund, on the basis of obtaining a return on investment and that does not impact the Government Balance Sheet. </td><td>In Progress </td></tr><tr><td>In developing the new NDP, we will re-examine the investment programmes of the semi-state companies to ensure that they are in line with new economic circumstances. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>In order to ensure that public enterprise plays a full role in Ireland's economic recovery, we will create a holding company to manage the state's holdings of the semi-states, and to co-ordinate investment in key priority areas identified by the Government, including energy, water and forestry. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Over time, we also propose to finance the investment programme from the sale of certain state assets. We will target up to &euro;2 billion in sales of non-strategic state assets drawing from the recommendations of the McCarthy Review Group on State Assets when available.

Politics must be about service to the public, not financial gain for politicians.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Amend the Constitution to Give D&aacute;il committees Full Powers of Investigation: The Abbeylara Supreme Court decision currently limits the ability of D&aacute;il committees to hold investigations into crucial issues of public concern, such as the banking crisis.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>A statutory duty on anybody established by or under statute, or with a majority ownership or funding by the State, to submit to the same parliamentary questions regime as applies to Government departments.

Annual reports of departments and agencies will include output statements and audited financial accounts prepared on generally accepted accounting principles. The performance information provided in output and outcome-focused measurement will feed into the decision making process for future plans at political and senior management level. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>The reform process will provide for increased delegation of budgets, subject to detailed plans, relevant performance reporting and audited accounts compiled in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. </td><td>In Progress/Ongoing Implementation</td></tr><tr><td>Detailed business cases will be required for major projects, with review and reporting requirements built in to the plan. Sanctions will be imposed at an early stage for significant overruns. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will change the current emphasis on performance reporting to performance management. All medium to long-term projects that involve significant public spending will be subject to cost benefit analysis, and to on-going evaluation. The results of programme evaluations will be published and programmes not meeting their objectives will be wound down. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Performance and progress will be published in a new, audited annual Public Service Delivery Reports. Oireachtas Committees will expose any failure to hit milestones and targets. Each sectoral Committee will take on new powers, similar to those wielded by Public Accounts Committee, to hold Ministers and public servants to account for value for money. This will feed into Oireachtas consideration of the next Budget. </td><td>In Progress/Ongoing Implementation </td></tr><tr><td>Where appropriate, agency boards will be scrapped and agency managers will be accountable directly to Ministers.</td><td>Action Required </td></tr><tr><td>We will bring forward the annual Estimates cycle, so that it becomes more timely and relevant.

We will give the Comptroller and Auditor General and Oireachtas Committees the extra powers needed to carry out value-for-money audits of State programmes. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Public bodies will be required to openly compete for budget resources by publishing pre-budget spending requests, and what they would deliver in return for such allocations to help deliver Programme for Government. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will conduct a Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) to examine all areas of public spending, based on the Canadian model, and to develop multi-annual budget plans with a three-year time horizon. This plan will be presented to the D&aacute;il for debate. It will assess effectiveness in achieving desired outcomes, and value for money.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>The CSR will examine the number, range and activities of bodies funded significantly from public purse, including at local government level, and reduce numbers where appropriate. In future, when proposing a new agency, it will be necessary to prove that the proposed new functions cannot be carried out within the existing framework. </td><td>Completed </td></tr><tr><td>We will, subject to there being no compulsory redundancies and to the protection of front line services: Reduce the total number of public sector employees by between 18,000 and 21,000 by 2014, compared to the total number at the end of 2010. Reduce this number by a further 4,000 by 2015. </td><td>Completed/Ongoing </td></tr><tr><td>We will extend the remit of Ombudsman to third level institutions.</td><td>Completed </td></tr><tr><td>Review existing tendering processes for legal services by Government and State and semi-State agencies to ensure value for money and end anti-competitive practices. <br /><br />The Government directed that a robust analysis be carried out to evaluate how to give effect to a beneficial merger of Coillte with Bord na Mona to create a streamlined and refocused commercial state company operating in the bio-energy and forestry sectors</td><td>In Progress<br /><br />In Progress<br /><br /><br /></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The LEOs support the indigenous micro-enterprise sector in the start-up and expansion phases and stimulate enterprise potential at local level. They are the first port of call in terms of advice and guidance for anyone who wishes to start or expand a business. </p><p>The LEOs are required to give priority to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector, which over time can develop into strong export entities and graduate to the Enterprise Ireland portfolio. </p><p>In addition, any start-up can use the LEOs as a gateway to accessing finance from Micro Finance Ireland, which offers support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks. The Fund has a significant entrepreneurship focus and is open to anyone with a viable business proposal. Applications for the Microfinance Fund can be channelled through the local LEO. </p><p>Also, locally trading businesses, including start-ups, can avail of non-financial assistance from their LEO in the form of a wide range of business advice and information services, management capability training and development programmes, e-Commerce training initiatives etc. Training courses include such topics as internet marketing, ideas generation and negotiation skills. The LEO service also includes a referral service to the range of supports available from other State organisations, such as Revenue, Department of Social Protection, Skillnets, etc. </p><p>The LEOs are also running a new competition to find Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur. The competition has a &euro;2m investment fund and targeted business supports on offer and each Local Enterprise Office has an investment fund of up to &euro;50,000 with an overall national winner&rsquo;s fund of up to &euro;100,000.</p><p>There are three categories to the competition;</p><p>- best new idea (not yet established)</p><p>- best start-up business (up to 18 months)</p><p>- best established business with new add-on (over 18 months)</p><p>The competition is open to anybody under 30 with an idea/commercial venture for a start-up or existing business in any sector and the aim of the initiative is to encourage and support a culture of entrepreneurship among young people in Ireland, to promote entrepreneurship as a career choice, and to encourage the establishment and development of new innovative businesses by Ireland&rsquo;s young entrepreneurs. The closing date for receipt of applications is 31 July 2014.

To this end, the enterprise agencies and other relevant players have been tasked with working to enhance the competitiveness of manufacturing in Ireland by working with companies and implementing the recommendations in the strategy. That sector lost 50,000 jobs in the years up to 2010 but at the end of 2013, there were a total of 215,900 people directly employed in the sector, which was an increase of 10,000 on the numbers identified at the time the Strategy was published.  This sector also supports a similar number of jobs indirectly. </p><p>In order to progress the recommendations contained in the Forf&aacute;s Strategy, I established a Manufacturing Development Forum, comprising industry practitioners.  One of the key results from the work of the Forum is a <i>National Step Change</i>initiative aimed at strengthening Ireland&rsquo;s manufacturing base across all firms and sub sectors, redressing perceptions of the sector as a career choice and removing barriers to the competitiveness of the sector in Ireland.  </p><p>The Strategy does not identify specific locations around the country for the expansion of the sector.  However, a particularly attractive feature of manufacturing in Ireland is the fact that many of the present jobs are not in the main urban areas, but dispersed into regional locations, thereby providing a valuable employment focus in areas where alternative jobs are scarce. The further development of the sector will, of course, build on this key feature. </p><p>The<i>Action Plan for Jobs </i>contains a series of actions to develop the manufacturing sector including a commitment to develop a framework for a <i>Regional Enterprise Strategy</i>to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprises.  I intend that the framework will be developed on a pilot basis initially, focusing on the Midlands region, and involving the agencies under the remit of this Department &ndash; Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs). The objective is to enhance synergies between the agencies and their client companies and build on the competitive strengths of the region to maximise the potential for job creation.  </p><p>The work of the enterprise agencies already focuses on developing the manufacturing sector.  Enterprise Ireland runs many initiatives to help sustain existing jobs and to create new jobs in the Midlands and provides funding to the Institute of Technology in Athlone to build the research capabilities in the Region. Enterprise Ireland offers a suite of grants to companies to uplift their technological capacities, innovation and skills capabilities and export potential. The recently established LEOs are required to give priority to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector which, over time, can develop into strong export entities and graduate to the Enterprise Ireland portfolio. </p><p>In addition, IDA Ireland positions the Midlands as having a strong cluster in Medical Technologies and Life Sciences with big names such as Abbott, Covidien and recently Jazz Pharmaceuticals in Monksland, outside Athlone and American Medical Systems in Athlone announcing significant investments in their manufacturing facilities.</p><p>I believe that the Forf&aacute;s Strategy actions and the agency activities outlined above will serve to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and help create good quality, sustainable jobs in manufacturing. </p></reply>

Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Competitive Start fund is aimed at accelerating the development of High Potential Start-Up companies (HPSUs) and creating a strong pipeline of HPSUs.  Enterprise Ireland piloted the Competitive Start Fund in 2011 which aims to provide early stage companies with critical funds to test the market for their products and services and progress their business plans for the global marketplace.</p><p>  Under the terms of the Competitive Start Fund, start-ups receive an equity investment of &euro;50,000 for a 10% ordinary equity stake by Enterprise Ireland matched by &euro;5,000 of promoter&rsquo;s equity.  In addition to funding, each start-up is provided with an experienced business mentor to provide support. The application process has been designed and improved to be fast and efficient to allow the new start-ups to concentrate on validating their business concept and getting to market entry stage as quickly as possible.</p><p>  The Competitive Start Fund is an early stage proof of concept fund and is designed to help companies reach key commercial and technical milestones, for example, it allows companies to:</p><p>  - Build prototypes and develop market entry plans or identify suitable channels to international markets.</p><p>  - Evaluate overseas market opportunities and reach firm conclusions regarding the viability of the proposed business.</p><p>  - Secure partnership deals or strategic alliances.</p><p>  - Get to &ldquo;product-market-fit&rdquo; stage by validating the sustainability of the business proposition.</p><p>  - Get to &ldquo;investor ready&rdquo;, stage where the company is in a position to secure third party investment through, for example, Seed Fund, Venture Capital and business angels. </p><p>  Of the 237 projects supported through the Competitive Start Fund to date, five are from County Westmeath but there has not been a successful project from County Longford as yet.  Because projects supported under this fund are at a very early stage and, in many cases, still have to prove that there is a scalable business opportunity Enterprise Ireland does not track the number of jobs supported.  When projects reach the next stage of development and are designated as &ldquo;High Potential Start-ups&rdquo; Enterprise Ireland then collects data on the number of jobs supported.</p></reply>

Any change to that principle would alter fundamentally the conduct of industrial relations. Mandatory attendance at conciliation would clearly affect potential for agreed outcomes compared to situations where the parties attend voluntarily.</p><p>  I understand that, as part of its process of engagement with stakeholders, the expert panel established to examine issues relating to the Aer Lingus/DAA pensions dispute met with representatives of pensioner members as represented by the Retired Aviation Staff Association, as well as representatives of the IASS Deferred Pensioners Committee.</p><p>  In this context, I understand that the panel explained to both parties that the process was an industrial relations one, consistent with their terms of reference, and that the responsibility for dealing with both the pensioner members and deferred members of the scheme rested with the IASS Trustees.</p><p>  Active members of pension schemes (through their Trade Unions) regularly engage with the employer to attempt to reach a common position as regards changes to pension schemes whether as a result of a crisis in the scheme or otherwise. In all such cases the outcome of that engagement can only be a collective agreement which cannot, of itself, change the pension scheme. Changes to the scheme are effected via the mechanisms set out in the trust deeds and rules of the scheme and are at the discretion of the parties so designated in the rules/deeds of the scheme.</p><p>  Any consideration of a restructure of pension scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act must comply with the provisions in the Pensions Act and with guidance issued by the Pensions Board. This guidance makes provision for the notification of all pensioners in advance of any application to the Pensions Board to restructure scheme benefits. In such circumstances a pensioner will have at least one month to make a submission to the trustees of the scheme in relation to such a proposal. The Pensions Board must be satisfied that all the provisions in the guidance are complied with before the Board will consider issuing a notice to restructure scheme benefits.</p><p>  It should be pointed out that the trustees of the scheme are required by law to act in the best interests of all the members. On that basis the trustees have to take account of the interests of the deferred and pensioner members in any proposals they make.</p></reply>

Appointments and reappointments were also allocated under legislation to Department representatives, social partners, nominees of other Ministers, nominees of prescribed bodies and appointments on an ex officio basis and were not appropriate, therefore, for public advertisement. </p><p>Of the 41 new appointments made at my discretion, 28 (68%) were selected from those who sent an Expression of Interest in response to a publicly advertised process administered by the Public Appointments Service in conjunction with the personnel unit in my Department.  Since coming to Office, the Public Appointments Service has administered this process eleven times in response to vacancies that have arisen across a variety of agencies within my Department&rsquo;s remit.  The processes generated a very strong response in terms of both the number and quality of the Expressions of Interest received.</p><p>Towards the end of 2013, I adopted what I believe is a more efficient approach to the public invitation of Expressions of Interest.  To avoid duplication of effort and to ensure the timely availability of a pool of suitably qualified candidates, I asked the Public Appointments Service to administer a single Expressions of Interest process in respect for vacancies arising in 2014 on the Boards of <i>all</i>agencies under my Department&rsquo;s remit.

IDA Ireland has strong relationships with all these companies and works closely with them to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and continuing re-investment in their sites.  The primary opportunity for regional locations is in respect of the existing client base and potential further investment opportunities from same.  Approximately 70% of all FDI investments won by IDA Ireland are from the existing client base.  IDA Ireland works closely with third level educational institutions in the region so that the skill-sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the Region are being developed.</p><p>When marketing Kerry for new inward investment IDA Ireland particularly focuses on the ICT (incl. software), International Financial Services and Globally Traded Business sectors. </p><p>The Action Plan for Jobs 2014 includes a commitment to develop a framework for a Regional Enterprise Strategy to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprises.  My intention is that the framework will be developed on a pilot basis initially, focusing on the Midlands region, and involving the agencies under the remit of my own Department &ndash; Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices.  The objective is to enhance synergies between the agencies and their client companies and build on the competitive strengths of the region to maximise the potential for job creation.  The role which other public bodies in the region can play in working towards this objective will also be examined as the project develops.  The aim is that this framework will serve as a model for other regions of the country.</p><p>IDA Ireland has assured me that it will continue to promote Kerry as part of its marketing efforts, in response to specific client queries and also on an opportunistic basis for the purpose of winning FDI projects for the county.  We must also remember that it is the investor in all cases who decides where to invest and an investment win for Ireland regardless of the location has to be seen as a plus for the country as a whole.</p></reply>

The position in relation to progress under each commitment, within the remit of my Department, is set out in the table.</p><p><b>Commitments in Programme for Government</b><table><tr><th><div>Ref.</div></th><th><div>Commitment</div></th><th><div>Progress to Date</div></th></tr><tr><td>1.2.4</td><td>Reverse the cut in the minimum wage</td><td>Cut reversed on July 1st 2011</td></tr><tr><td>1.2.6</td><td>Implement a number of sectoral initiatives in areas that will create employment in the domestic economy</td><td>Through the Action Plan for Jobs (APJ), a number of sectoral initiatives have been developed or are in progress, including in the following areas:<br /><br />-Green Economy<br /><br />-Manufacturing<br /><br />-Construction<br /><br />-Retail<br /><br />-Health/Life Sciences<br /><br />-Digital Games<br /><br />Details of progress on each of these initiatives are contained in the quarterly progress reports on the APJ which are published on the Department's website .  Progress is ongoing in relation to each of these sectors.  </td></tr><tr><td>1.4.2</td><td>We will create a new &lsquo;Home to Export&rsquo; programme to share the expertise of exporting companies with firms currently reliant on domestic markets. </td><td>Commitment Met.<br /><br /><br />Enterprise Ireland has an ongoing range of services to encourage new exporters, including online support and mentoring. In 2012, Enterprise Ireland established the Potential Exporters Division. Its role is to stimulate greater activity within companies across all regions and to reorient those demonstrating growth potential from the domestic to the international marketplace. </td></tr><tr><td>1.4.3</td><td>A &lsquo;Source Ireland&rsquo; portal will be developed to market Irish goods and services abroad</td><td>Commitment Met. <br /><br /><br />A &lsquo;Source Ireland&rsquo; portal has been developed to market Irish goods and services abroad.  It is continuously updated and expanded.</td></tr><tr><td>1.5.2</td><td>We will support our indigenous digital game industry by reforming R&amp;amp;D supports available to the industry, setting aside funding from Innovation Fund Ireland for a seed capital scheme for Irish digital gaming start-ups, introduce a digital media component to Transition Year programmes and promote Ireland as digital gaming hub </td><td>The Department has been working with the Digital Games Clustering Development Team for the purpose of assessing the suitability of the existing R&amp;amp;D tax Credit to the digital games sector. From this work a number of R&amp;amp;D supports workshop to promote awareness about available R&amp;amp;D supports  were held. An enterprise friendly guide on R&amp;amp;D tax credits to include examples of relevance to games companies was also produced. The Department is also assessing the case for a new financial instrument/relief to incentives creative content development in the games sector. The intention is to complete this work in the timeframe for Budget 2014.<br /><br /><br />Enterprise Ireland continues to invest seed and follow-on money in a range of software related projects including businesses in the digital game space. Enterprise Ireland has confirmed that a number of the existing venture capital funds, along with those new funds coming on stream, have and will continue to invest in a range of software related projects including businesses in the digital game space. <br /><br /><br />EI&rsquo;s Competitive Start Fund (&euro;50K Equity) has had a significant impact on the early stage indigenous games sector since December 2010. Over this period, EI has completed 21 calls which have funded 24 Games companies. <br /><br /><br />In addition Enterprise Ireland and the National Pensions Reserve Fund have made available up to &euro;250m  in equal amounts to attract investment by international venture capital funds in Ireland under the Innovation Fund Ireland .  A number of Funds have received investment under the Innovation Fund Ireland Scheme. To date 5 Funds have been established and launched Polaris, DFJ Esprit, Soffinova, Highland, and Lightstone. 3 of these funds have investment strategies that will allow them invest in opportunities from the Digital Gaming Sector.<br /><br /><br />The Department of Education and Skills has explained that schools design their own programmes for TY and, consequently, may be providing courses that address digital media.</td></tr><tr><td>1.5.5</td><td>We will develop a National Intellectual Property (IP) protocol to give predictability about the terms on which business can access IP created in Higher Education Institutions and the wider digital sector</td><td>The IP Protocol was published in June 2012, the purpose of which is to help the enterprise sector to access the research undertaken in Ireland&rsquo;s universities, institutes of technology and other public research institutions.<br /><br />A key recommendation of the report centres around the establishment of a central Technology Transfer Office (ctto) to provide an effective interface between industry and the research community and to drive a world class technology transfer system in Ireland, ensuring it is responsive to the needs of both industry and academia. The ctto branded &lsquo;Knowledge Transfer Ireland&rsquo; , was launched on 28 May 2014 along with a website offers businesses a searchable database of research and expertise available in Irish HEIs and access to opportunities to license new technologies and IP as well as access to a range of  practical guides and model agreements all of which will help businesses to engage with the research sector.</td></tr><tr><td>1.5.6</td><td>We will promote and support investment in technology research, development and commercialisation beyond basic research supported by Science Foundation Ireland, as well as removing barriers to innovation and accelerate exploitation of new technologies. </td><td>The IP Protocol and Knowledge Transfer Ireland, referred to above, will support both industry parties and research performing organisations in making their commercial negotiations on the exploitation of new technologies and ideas faster, more consistent and more transparent. In 2013 SFI&rsquo;s legal remit was extended to include applied research in areas of importance to Ireland&rsquo;s economy to complement with its original mandate of funding oriented basic research. Extending the remit of SFI to fund applied research will also help bring the outcomes of research funded since the establishment of SFI closer to market.</td></tr><tr><td>1.5.7</td><td>We will target key technology areas and sectors where innovation can be applied including but not limited to high value manufacturing, advanced materials, nanotechnology, bioscience, electronics, photonics and electrical systems and information and communication technology. <br /><br /></td><td>The report of the Research Prioritisation Steering Group recommended 14 areas of opportunity as well as underpinning technologies and infrastructure to support these priority areas which should receive the majority of competitive public investment in STI over the coming 5 years. <br /><br />Following publication of the report on 1st March 2012, the Prioritisation Action Group (PAG) was established, under the chairmanship and political leadership of the Minister for Research and Innovation Sean Sherlock TD, to drive implementation of research prioritisation under the broader authority of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Jobs. Action Plans to drive implementation have been developed for each priority area and were approved by Government in June 2013 along with  a detailed Framework of Metrics and Targets  drawn up  to measure the outputs and impact of public investment in STI including the impact of research prioritisation. The first annual report tracking progress on implementation of research prioritisation was published on 4 July 2014.</td></tr><tr><td>1.5.8</td><td>We will also focus on the application of technological innovation in established sectors of the economy like energy generation and supply, transport, creative industries, high-value services and architecture and construction by identifying challenges, establishing priorities and developing strategies which specify necessary actions to transition to more innovative approach.</td><td>See 1.5.7 above in relation to Research Prioritisation</td></tr><tr><td>1.5.9</td><td>We will promote Ireland&rsquo;s full engagement with the &lsquo;Innovative Union&rsquo; proposals issued by the European Commission in October 2010 as one of the seven flagship initiatives under EU2020 Strategy, with the specific aim of refocusing R&amp;amp;D and innovation policy on major challenges and at turning inventions into products.</td><td>The Irish EU Presidency completed negotiations on a political agreement on Horizon 2020, the next EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation which will focus EU research funding from 2014-2020 on major societal challenges. <br /><br /><br />The Irish EU Presidency also focused on measures to progress the European Research Area, a key component of Innovation Union.<br /><br /><br />Ireland will continue to engage fully with initiatives proposed by the European commission in support of the Innovation Union strategy.</td></tr><tr><td>1.5.10</td><td>We will establish a network of Technology Research Centres focused on applied technological research in specific areas, to be linked to appropriate higher-education institutions. The centres will accelerate exploitation of new technologies by providing infrastructure that bridges gap between research and technology commercialisation. We will initially establish 3 additional centres focusing on biotechnology, nanotechnology and high value manufacturing. Further centres from a number of other areas will be selected at a later time. </td><td>Enterprise Ireland have established a network of 15 Technology Centres across a range of areas of direct relevance to enterprise research needs covering manufacturing &amp;amp; materials, cloud, analytics &amp;amp; learning technologies, energy, business processes &amp;amp; financial services as well as food &amp;amp; health. Over 300 companies are directly engaged with these 15 Technology Centres.   </td></tr><tr><td>1.5.11</td><td>We will support the development of an International Content Services Centre to make Ireland world leader in managing intellectual property.  </td><td>A Feasibility Study was commissioned and finalised in January 2013. The study is still part of the deliberative process and consideration is being given to the findings and recommendations of the study in the context of development of broader FDI and Intellectual Property policy generally.</td></tr><tr><td>1.5.12</td><td>We will pioneer within the EU a model of &lsquo;fair use&rsquo; in European Copyright Law, like in the USA, which effectively permits the use of portions of a copyrighted work so long as the normal economic exploitation of the originating work is not undermined. This will allow internet companies and other digital innovators to bring their services to market. </td><td>The Independent Copyright Review Committee published their report &ldquo;Modernising Copyright&rdquo; at the end of October 2013 and the principle of &quot;fair use&quot; is addressed in the report.  The report, aimed at identifying any barriers for innovation in the digital environment and developing proposals for reducing them, is currently being analysed by Government with a view to bringing forward legislative proposals in this area in 2014.  </td></tr><tr><td>1.6.3</td><td>We will reform the Joint Labour Committee structure, beginning with the appointment of independent chairpersons to JLCs, who will retain a casting vote. Reform options will examine the rate of pay for atypical hours. </td><td>Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 came into effect on 1st August 2012*. The Act provided for a reform of the statutory wage setting mechanisms (JLCs and REAs), <br /><br /><br />The Act provides, inter alia, that a review of each Joint Labour Committee be carried out by the Labour Court. That Review was completed in April 2013 and published in October 2013. In January 2014 Ministerial Orders to give effect to the recommendations were signed. Industrial Relations Officers of the Labour Relations Commission have been appointed to the positions of Chairpersons and Deputy Chairpersons of the JLCs.<br /><br /><br /><br />*  The Supreme Court judgment of May 9th 2013 in the McGowan case found Part III of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 to be unconstitutional thereby invalidating the registration of all REAs that were previously registered under the 1946 Act. Minister will bring proposals to Government shortly for a revised legislative framework to address matters arising from the Supreme Court ruling.</td></tr><tr><td>1.6.6</td><td>We will reduce the cost of Government imposed red-tape on business, in part by streamlining regulatory enforcement activities out of a merger and rationalisation of existing structures. We will create a Business Inspection and Licensing Authority that absorbs the existing business inspection activities of the Health and Safety Authority, and the National Consumer Agency. </td><td>My Department coordinated the cross-Government 25% target for administrative burden reduction. To date, the Department, the CSO, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Transport have met or exceeded the 25% target.  The overall reduction across Government is 20.4%; (&euro;317m per annum).<br /><br /><br />The Workplace Relations Reform Programme will deliver a simplified two-tiered structure, amalgamating the existing five Bodies and providing for a single body of first instance, the Workplace Relations Commission, and a single body of appeal, in effect an enhanced Labour Court. The Reform Programme will also provide a more efficient and effective framework for dealing with complaints and disputes and for enforcement and compliance generally. Significant progress has also been achieved to date in so far as the legislative, technological, structural, administrative and staffing changes required are concerned to underpin the workplace relations reform programme. The Government, at its meeting on 8th July, 2014, approved the publication of the enabling legislation while a single contact portal, e-complaint facility, staffing and structures plan, workplace relations website, early resolution service, adjudicator training and recruitment plans and enhanced technologies and processes are already in place.<br /><br /><br />One of the Disruptive Reforms in the Action Plan for Jobs relates to the development of an Integrated Licensing Application System to help reduce the regulatory burden on the enterprise sector through the provision of a single portal for applying for, and renewing, a multiplicity of licences.  The new licensing system will be developed for the retail sector in the first instance and rolled out to other sectors of the economy thereafter.  A Request for Tender was issued through eTenders and in the EU Official Journal.  The tender evaluation process is ongoing.  Subject to the successful awarding of the services contract to an appointed provider, the System should be delivered in the Autumn 2014.<br /><br /><br />Another initiative to help reduce the regulatory burden on business is , a portal where business can find relevant information on regulatory requirements quickly.  This makes it easier for them to comply.  Further, my Department has instituted a series of free business communication events called Taking Care of Business (TCOB), where business people can hear short presentations on regulation and available supports and interact with personnel from up to 30 agencies.  Four events have been held to date and 1,150 business people have participated.<br /><br /><br />Further, the Health &amp;amp; Safety Authority (HSA) has developed and launched a single licensing portal for occupational health &amp;amp; safety and chemicals licensing requirements. See  -  <br /><br /><br />It has  also developed &ldquo;BeSMART&rdquo; &ndash; a free online tool  developed to help reduce costs for and the administrative burden on small business of meeting their legal obligations to prepare Risk Assessments and a Safety Statement under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 .  Current estimates put potential savings for the SME sector as a whole in the region of &euro;60-&euro;65m. See <br /><br /><br />Registered user numbers for BeSMART at end 2013 were ahead of predictions and this trend has continued with registrations expected to exceed 30k by end 2016. The work areas covered by BeSMART continues to expand with construction and agriculture to be included in the near future.</td></tr><tr><td>1.6.8</td><td>We will develop a Unique Business Identifier for use by all government departments and agencies that will facilitate the sharing of information within Government and reduce repetitive information requests from businesses. </td><td>This will be considered in the context of legislation to facilitate data sharing.</td></tr><tr><td>1.6.10</td><td>We will introduce new legally binding voluntary commercial debt plan structures to allow small businesses to restructure debts without recourse to expensive court procedures. </td><td>The Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 amends existing examinership provisions to provide the option for small private companies to apply directly to the Circuit Court to have an examiner appointed instead of having to apply to the High Court.  This should lower costs and provide greater accessibility for small private companies to the examinership process.</td></tr><tr><td>1.7.1</td><td>We will implement a temporary, partial credit guarantee scheme that will provide a level of insurance to banks against losses on qualifying loans to job-creating firms to get banks&rsquo; lending again to industry and entrepreneurs. </td><td>Fully implemented in Oct 2012.<br /><br />As take-up of the Scheme has not been as high as was initially planned for, the Minister commissioned an independent review of the Scheme which was submitted in Q3 2013.  Since then the Department has worked with the Review Steering Group to determine the changes that can be made to the Credit Guarantee Act 2012, and the contents of a new Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS), on foot of this review. <br /><br />The Minister will ensure that these changes to CGS are made in 2014 through the Action Plan for Jobs and the Department will implement the review recommendations, as appropriate, with a view to enhancing the up-take and impact of the Scheme as soon as possible.  </td></tr><tr><td>1.7.2</td><td>We will construct a &euro;100 million Microfinance Start-Up Fund that will provide start-up loans and equity that draws funding from the NPRF and private institutional funds. </td><td>Fully implemented in Oct 2012.<br /><br />The operation of the Microenterprise Loan Fund Act 2012 will be reviewed in 2014 pursuant to a legislative commitment. Under the Action Plan for Jobs 2014 this review has commenced with a view to enhancing the take-up and impact of the Scheme</td></tr><tr><td>1.7.3</td><td>We will support the development of a more dynamic, venture capital industry in Ireland by seeking to attract top tier venture financing and investment companies to Ireland, such as Silicon Valley Bank. </td><td>The Seed and Venture Capital Scheme, the Development Capital Scheme, and Innovation Fund Ireland all form part of the suite of finance measures put in place through the Action Plan for Jobs to increase the availability of funding for SMEs.  <br /><br />The Budget 2013 commitment of &euro;175 million under the Seed and Venture Capital Scheme 2013-2018 will leverage a further &euro;525 million from the private sector, for investment in high potential start-up and scaling companies.  The launch of the first call for expressions of interest under the Seed and Venture Capital Scheme 2013-2018 was a key Action Plan for Jobs target for 2013 and was announced on May 31st 2014. The original timing of this call was designed to align with the end of the majority of investment periods of Funds supported under Seed &amp;amp; Venture Capital Scheme 2007 &ndash; 2012.  <br /><br />The Government through Enterprise Ireland has made commitments of &euro;99.5m to a number of fund managers under the Seed and Venture Capital Scheme 2013-2018. These funds are currently in the market raising money. Further calls for expressions of interest will be made under this Scheme in the near term targeting various sectors. <br /><br />The Development Capital Scheme was established to create funds that would invest between &euro;2 million and &euro;5 million in medium sized established companies by way of equity, quasi equity and/or debt. In 2013, a number of funds were launched under the Development Capital Scheme to provide a total of &euro;225 million in funding to mid-sized indigenous firms, to target the development of a strong indigenous sector. The amount of leveraged capital far exceeded the initial targets (&euro;375m was secured against an initial target of &euro;150m).  Each of these funds is actively engaging with the market to source investment opportunities. <br /><br /><br />The Government through Enterprise Ireland and the National Pension Reserve Fund (NPRF) also established Innovation Fund Ireland (IFI). The objective of IFI is to attract international VCs to establish a presence in Ireland. A number of VC firms have established a presence in the Irish market and commenced investing with the most recent fund announcement being that of Lightstone Ventures which are establishing a presence in Ireland. </td></tr><tr><td>1.7.4</td><td>We will work to promote a greater appreciation of the co-operative model as a distinct form of organisation, ensure a level playing field between co-operatives and the other legal options for structuring enterprise activities, and provide a conductive framework for the full potential of the co-operative model to be realised, including in areas such as childcare, education, housing, energy retrofitting, environmental protection, transport and healthcare. This commitment goes across a number of Departments. </td><td>The Friendly Societies and Industrial and Provident Societies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill was  published in July 2013.The Bill introduces a number of regulatory improvements for co-operative societies (Industrial and Provident Societies) and it also makes other changes. <br /><br /><br />The main purpose of the Bill insofar as co-operatives are concerned is to ease the regulatory burden on co-operative societies and to make it easier to start up and run a co-operative as an alternative form of enterprise organisation, thereby making the co-operative model more attractive for those wishing to use it.  <br /><br /><br />By introducing these legislative changes the Government is recognising the value of the co-operative business model to our economy, particularly at the present time.  The primary objective of these legislative changes is to provide a regulatory environment that is supportive of the co-operative movement and of its capacity to contribute to economic and social well-being into the future.  <br /><br /><br />The Bill completed all Stages in the Oireachtas on 9 July 2014.<br /><br /><br />The responsibility of my Department lies in the legislative provision for co-operatives in general.  Any initiatives to facilitate or promote the development of co-operatives in particular sectors, for example group water schemes, renewable energy or agricultural co-operatives, would be a matter for colleagues in the respective Government Departments.  </td></tr><tr><td>1.8.7</td><td>We will legislate to ban a number of unfair trading practices in the retail sector, such as &lsquo;hello money&rsquo; from food suppliers. </td><td>Legislation to give effect to this commitment will take the form of enabling provisions in the Consumer Protection and Competition Bill 2014 to regulate certain practices in the grocery goods sector. <br /><br /><br />The Bill completed Report and Final Stages in the D&aacute;il on 2 July 2014 and completed Report and Final Stages in the Seanad on 15 July 2014.</td></tr><tr><td>1.8.25</td><td>We will seek to establish Ireland as a renewable manufacturing hub to attract international and domestic investment. </td><td>In November 2012, the Government published a Policy Statement on Growth and Employment in the Green Economy which has the objective of attracting investment in the Green Economy in Ireland.  A Consultative Committee on Jobs in the Green Economy has also been established to identify emerging opportunities for Ireland in the Green Economy, which I Chair.</td></tr><tr><td>1.9.1</td><td>The Government will promote the development of a vibrant and effective social enterprise sector. We will instruct agencies to view social enterprises as important stakeholders in rejuvenating local economies. We will continue support for social innovation projects for young people trough (sic) education, community and voluntary structures. </td><td>In 2013, Forf&aacute;s published a report on the potential of the Social Enterprise Sector in Ireland.  <br /><br /><br />Following publication of the report, an inter-departmental group was established to provide a coordinated Government approach to the development of social enterprise in Ireland and to examine the recommendations of the Forf&aacute;s report in greater detail.  A number of actions have been identified by the Group and are being progressed.   </td></tr><tr><td>2.3.19</td><td>We will make good corporate governance the law, not an optional extra, and enact legislation to provide for binding code of practice for corporate governance, which will be obligatory for companies wishing to be listed on Irish stock exchange. DJEI is the lead only in relation to companies.</td><td>The Companies Bill 2012 will consolidate and modernise the Companies Acts 1963-2013 into a single Act. One of the main provisions in that Bill is a consolidation and clarification of the duties of directors of companies. As the existing duties come from common law, case law and Statute, this will be the first time that all existing duties are clearly stated in one legislative instrument, making it clearer and easier for directors to know their obligations. Other aspects of corporate governance will be provided for too. The Bill has completed all Stages in the D&aacute;il and completed Committee Stage in the Seanad on 17 June 2014.

In the region as a whole, there are currently 36 IDA Ireland client companies employing almost 4,000 people.  The main FDI clusters which have emerged in the North East Region are in international business services, mainly Financial Services, and consumer goods and manufacturing.  While IDA Ireland always seeks to influence the client decisions on where to visit or where to locate, the final decision in all cases is made by the investor.  </p><p>At the end of 2013 there were 7 IDA Ireland supported companies in Cavan<font color="#FF0000"> </font>employing 1,135 people with 6 IDA Ireland supported companies in Monaghan employing 365 people.  IDA Ireland has formed strong relationships with these companies and, having regard to the fact that 70% approximately of all FDI investments won by IDA Ireland is from the existing client base, the agency continues to work closely with them in order to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and continuing re-investment in their sites.  IDA Ireland works closely with third level educational institutions in the region so that the skill-sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the Region are being developed.</p><p>During 2012, as part of its marketing activities, IDA Ireland began an online marketing initiative, &ldquo;Connect &amp;amp; Invest&rdquo;, to showcase the unique attributes of individual regions to international clients and this initiative continues to be implemented in 2014. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland works with and supports local entrepreneurs with commercial business plans and also provides preferential funding for entrepreneurs and companies, with detailed export plans, who are expanding or establishing a business in the County as part of the BMW Region.</p><p>Payments of over &euro;1.8 million were made to companies in Cavan in 2013 and to date in 2014 over &euro;9.9 million has been approved to Cavan companies.  Similarly, payments of over &euro;2.2 million were made to companies in Monaghan in 2013 and to date in 2014 over &euro;6.2 million has been approved to Monaghan companies.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland works with both Cavan and Monaghan local enterprise offices in enhancing economic development within the County.</p><p>Innovation vouchers give small companies access to the vast knowledge available in Irish Institutes of Technology, Universities and other public research bodies. These vouchers worth &euro;5,000 can be used by the average small Irish company to bring in knowledge that is new to the company. Since the programme began in 2007, 71 vouchers to the value of &euro;355,000 have been approved for companies in Monaghan and 62 vouchers to the value of &euro;310,000 have been approved for companies in Cavan.  </p><p>The Action Plan for Jobs 2014 includes a commitment to develop a framework for a Regional Enterprise Strategy to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprises.  My intention is that the framework will be developed on a pilot basis initially, focusing on the midlands region, and involving the agencies under the remit of my own Department &ndash; Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices.  The objective is to enhance synergies between the agencies and their client companies and build on the competitive strengths of the region to maximise the potential for job creation.  The role which other public bodies in the region can play in working towards this objective will also be examined as the project develops.  The aim is that this framework will serve as a model for other regions of the country.</p></reply>

In addition to normal grant aid funding, the 2014 Capital allocation is being used to fund the innovative Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur (IBYE) competition, which was recently launched by the Taoiseach, and a new LEO Graduate Recruitment Programme.</p></reply>

The APJ is working towards the creation of 100,000 jobs by 2016 (as compared to 2012), which will make a significant contribution to Government&rsquo;s aim of returning Ireland to full employment (2.1 million people) by 2020. This will be achieved by focussing on Government&rsquo;s priority of strengthening the domestic economy, and prioritising new jobs for the unemployed.</p><p>  In recognition of the vital importance of jobs to every aspect of the economic recovery, my Department will prioritise its role in delivering policies that support jobs in every county, town and village, with a particular focus on sectors, for example retail, that support balanced regional development. Central to this will be realising the full potential of the new network of 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs), which are based in every local authority area, and which will support entrepreneurship and small business activity throughout the country.</p><p>  Indeed, reinforcing the importance of entrepreneurship in this context, my Department will publish a new Entrepreneurship Policy aimed at achieving a 25% increase in start-ups over the next five years, and to deliver a doubling of the jobs impact of start-ups over five years.</p><p>  To enable new and existing businesses to operate more efficiently, my Department will continue to lead on cutting down on the amount of red-tape, for example through the introduction of the new Integrated Licensing Application system.</p><p>  In conjunction with creating more jobs and reducing unemployment, I will also prioritise the delivery of better working standards. My Department will lead the work of the Low Pay Commission, to make appropriate recommendations regarding the appropriate level of the minimum wage and related matters, and will prioritise the enactment of the Collective Bargaining legislation that has already been approved by Government.</p><p>  I will also ensure completion of the programme of reform and modernisation of the Workplace Relations Bodies, including the enactment of the Workplace Relations Bill, to deliver, for employees and employers, streamlined advisory, conciliation, adjudication, inspection and enforcement mechanisms through the new two-tier structure of the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.</p><p>  I will continue to prioritise the successful work by the enterprise agencies under my Department in the context of the continued delivery of investment, export, and jobs targets. Further, I will maintain our focus on important science, research and innovation issues, for example by working to maximise Ireland&rsquo;s drawdown of EU Research funding (including &euro;1.25bn targeted under Horizon 2020) and building on the industry-relevant science base to ensure economic and jobs dividends from that investment through FDI, industry collaboration and direct commercial outputs.</p><p>  In addition, I will ensure that Ireland continues to derive the maximum benefits from the negotiation of, and our participation in, international trade agreements, and from trade missions led by my Department and the enterprise agencies. I will also work to ensure that the development of EU policies on employment and growth most appropriately reflect Ireland&rsquo;s interests.</p></reply>

In this region IDA prioritises the marketing of the linked Gateway of Athlone/Tullamore/Mullingar.</p><p>  I have been informed by IDA Ireland that the agency successfully secured 44 agency sponsored site visits by potential investors to the Midlands Region in the last three years.  These site visits were from new companies visiting the location for the first time and from senior executives of existing companies.  Data on site visits is maintained on a county basis only. </p><p>  There are many complex factors influencing investor location decision-making such as the increasing preference of investors globally for cities of scale with 1 million plus population, significant challenges from lower cost locations in the UK and Eastern Europe and attractive regional aid. </p><p>  In the region as a whole, there are currently 43 IDA Ireland client companies employing 4,812 people.  IDA Ireland has formed strong relationships with these companies and, having regard to the fact that 70% approximately of all FDI investments won by IDA Ireland is from the existing client base, the agency continues to work closely with them in order to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and continuing re-investment in their sites.  IDA Ireland works closely with third level educational institutions in the region so that the skill-sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the Region are being developed.</p><p>  As part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2014, we are bringing a particular focus to regional job creation and are delivering a range of measures to support this goal.  One such measure is that IDA Ireland will commence building new advanced manufacturing facilities in Waterford and Athlone and office space in Letterkenny.  The Athlone building will provide an enhanced platform to attract FDI to the Midlands Region.  The other IDA Parks in the Midlands, including Mullingar Business Park are essential infrastructure to provide for FDI clients and also for indigenous companies interested in developing their business in the Midlands Region.</p><p>  With the improved infrastructure that is now in place, a significant number of people commute within the Midlands Region. Indeed, a project win in one Midlands location has a positive impact on the other surrounding areas due to the close proximity of all main locations. </p><p>  The Agency has also explained that they have invested in specific marketing materials for the Midlands Region to support their marketing effort and launched the digital Connect and Invest site earlier this year.  This is proactively used by IDA Ireland regional and overseas teams to market and promote the Midlands to overseas clients wishing to invest in the Region and covers all aspects such as the clusters of companies, infrastructure, talent, lifestyle and the overall business environment offered by the region.</p><p>  We must also remember that it is the investor in all cases who decides where to invest and an investment win for Ireland regardless of the location has to be seen as a plus for the country as a whole.</p></reply>

Where the mother of the child in a non-marital birth attends alone to register the birth she is required to provide contact details for the father and the registrar will make all reasonable efforts to contact the father.</p><p>  The Bill further provides that a mother may make a statutory declaration stating clearly that there are compelling reasons to exempt her from her duty to provide details of the father. The registrar shall examine the evidence presented in the declaration and if satisfied that a compelling reason exists, register the birth without father&rsquo;s details. </p><p>  The fundamental objective of the provision is to ensure that a father&rsquo;s details are included in the record of the child&rsquo;s birth.

Where weekly earnings exceed &euro;352, employees become liable for PRSI which is charged at 4% on all earnings.  While the effect of paying PRSI on all earnings once the &euro;352 employee threshold is exceeded, is an issue, the yield from those paying PRSI contributes to keeping workers on lower earnings (below the threshold) outside of the PRSI net.</p><p>  Family Income Supplement (FIS) is available for lower paid workers with families, whose income falls below the relevant thresholds.  The level of FIS entitlement is based on net income after all relevant deductions, including the deduction of PRSI.

The financial gain from the transition from welfare to work can be quantified by replacement rates, which measure the ratio of out-of-work income to take home income from work.  Departmental analysis supported by ESRI research demonstrates that the great majority of people on the Live Register have a strong financial incentive to work and significant numbers leave the Live Register each year for employment.</p><p>  High replacement rates are generally associated with a relatively large number of dependent children and/or receipt of rent or mortgage supplement. To address high replacement ratios associated with dependent children, my Department provides family income supplement (FIS) to support the income of working parents on low earnings. FIS is currently paid to some 44,000 families in respect of some 99,000 children, with an estimated expenditure of over &euro;280 million in 2014. FIS is an in-work benefit for families who might otherwise lose child welfare benefits when taking up work. In addition, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs provides subsidised childcare for low paid families, including after-school options. </p><p>The Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016   contains a commitment to introduce measures to improve the system of child income supports in Budget 2015 so that those moving from welfare to work will retain child payments and ensure they are better off in work. This will be informed by the work of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on cost-effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes, particularly child poverty outcomes.  The Group is currently progressing its final module of work on the issue of working age income supports. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-07-17a.883.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014071700051#WRL04400"><p>The State pension (contributory) is a very valuable benefit and is the bedrock of the Irish pension system.  Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  This is particularly important given the challenges in relation to the future sustainability of the State pension, with increased numbers of older people living longer.   </p><p>  When assessing whether an individual is entitled to a State pension (contributory), and to ensure that they can maximise such entitlement, all contributions (paid or credited) from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account.</p><p>  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is taken as the date used for averaging purposes in order to qualify for a State pension (contributory). </p><p>  To qualify for a state pension a person must &ndash; </p><p>  - have at least 520 paid contributions and </p><p>  - satisfy a yearly average condition (a yearly average of 48 contributions paid or credited is required for a full rate pension, and reduced rates of payment may be payable for pensioners with lower averages).</p><p>  The yearly average test has been in existence since 1961 when contributory pensions were first introduced. The scheme was designed with a view to ensuring that people could qualify for contributory pensions immediately and to suit a system where social insurance coverage was limited. </p><p>  For those with insufficient contributions to qualify for a full or partial State pension (contributory), the social protection system already provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated people to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes. </p><p>  In addition, persons who have insufficient contributions to qualify for a full State pension (contributory), may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory).  Furthermore, some affected persons may be entitled to a qualified adult increase on their spouse&rsquo;s/partner&rsquo;s pension payment.  This increase is paid directly to the qualified adult. </p><p>  The success of all of these measures across the entire State pension system, in ensuring equality of outcomes for men and women, is evidenced by the poverty statistics, which show that women over the age of 65 are less likely to be in poverty than men of the same age. </p><p>  The most recently published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund confirms that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.   It found that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories will continue to obtain the best value from their contributions. </p><p>  A total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) in 2020, although that date is subject to change.  Under this approach, the level of pension paid will be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life. Issues such as equality of outcomes for women and men, including those who spend some years outside the labour market on caring duties, will be considered carefully in the context of that reform.</p></reply>

These officers were employed on a part time basis as Appeals Officers and their contracts terminated at the end of December 2011.  One of the Department&rsquo;s Medical Assessors was retained beyond the normal retirement age on a temporary contract which ended in January 2012.  The acting Deputy Chief Medical Advisor was retained beyond his normal retirement age on a temporary contract which ended in December 2012.  The Chief Medical Advisor in the Department was also retained beyond his retirement date of February 2012 and is currently employed on a temporary contract.  The Department held a competition to recruit a new Chief Medical officer in late 2013, however, no candidate was deemed suitable at interview.</p><p>  The decision to re-employ or retain this small number of staff was taken due to their specific skills, the difficulty and long lead-in time for replacing such skills, and the critical importance of ensuring continuity and a high level of service to customers of the Department.  As an exception to the current moratorium on recruitment, the Department has limited sanction to recruit temporary clerical officers to cover some critical staff absences, shorter working year leave, and to assist with the roll-out of the new Public Service Card.  Between 2011 and to date in 2014, 3 Temporary Clerical Officers were recruited who were former civil servants.  They were recruited on foot of open competitions run by the Public Appointments Service.  Abatement of pension applies, if applicable, for the duration of all of these temporary contracts.</p></reply>

The incentive is payable, on a monthly basis, over a two year period if the employee is retained in full-time employment for two years.  JobsPlus is biased in favour of those who are longer term unemployed.  The value of the aggregate monthly payments is &euro;7,500 for employing a jobseeker 12 to 24 months on the Live Register and &euro;10,000 if the jobseeker was on the Live Register for over 24 months.</p><p>  Since its launch in July 2013 to the end of June 2014, JobsPlus has supported 2,634 jobseekers in full-time employment with 2,007 employers nationally. Around 60% of jobseekers being supported had been on the Live Register for over 24 months at the time of recruitment.  Up to the end of June 2014, payments under the JobsPlus scheme have amounted to just over &euro;4.4 million.  Overall, payments under the scheme have amounted to &euro;5.5 million since the first payments were made in August 2013.</p><p>  In line with Pathways to Work, jobseekers on the Live Register are a particular focus for intervention and the JobsPlus Incentive is, therefore, exclusively targeted at this cohort. As a result, a person in receipt of a farm assist payment is not considered eligible.  The Department is completing a review of the initial phase of implementation of JobsPlus and this will inform any proposals for its development and expansion.  The review will consider a range of matters, including uptake, costs and benefits, eligibility requirements, and if changes are needed to improve access and administration.  Any changes will, of course, be subject to budgetary considerations.</p></reply>

The purpose of the report was to gather information on pension charges levied to assess whether charges are reasonable and transparent, and make recommendations.  The report highlighted a wide range of issues in relation to pension charges and identified a number of problems.  While the provision of pension schemes cannot be cost free, it is clear that there are major challenges to be addressed in the two main areas of reasonableness and transparency of charges.</p><p>  Following the Report&rsquo;s publication and a consultation with stakeholders, it was agreed by Government in April 2013 that the recommendations contained in the report would be implemented.  A group comprising the Department of Social Protection, the Pensions Authority and the Central Bank is in place to initiate actions that follow up on these recommendations.  Each has a core role to play in delivering on the recommendations contained in the report and work is progressing in this regard.</p><p>  In line with the report&rsquo;s recommendation to monitor the implementation of the Consumer Protection Code, the Central Bank recently published findings of a review of annual pension statements.  This review found the vast majority of firms were in compliance with the code.  Where the Bank identified a small number of firms where the format of annual statements were not as required, the firms concerned were required to submit implementation timelines for full compliance.  Work is also ongoing in relation to other recommendations of the report such as consideration of a single standard measure that would assess all charges as well as investigation of the drivers behind take up of PRSAs.</p><p>  In parallel, my Department is involved in complementary EU negotiations in relation to a review of the IORPs (Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision) Directive which lays down basic requirements for occupational pensions and their supervision.  It is anticipated that agreement would result in improvements for consumers in the areas of member information regarding charges, trustee competencies, scheme governance and risk management.  In addition, progress on the issue of charges will be supported by recent actions to restructure the Pensions Authority and strengthen governance and regulation and give consumer representatives a greater input into pensions policy.  I have previously highlighted that the first task of the new Pensions Council will be to monitor the implementation of the recommendations in the Report on Pension Charges and advise if further actions are needed.</p></reply>

To support the delivery of these essential services, the ring-fencing and prioritisation of places for childcare was introduced on CE in 2002.  Total CE expenditure on childcare amounted to &euro;24.8m in 2013. In order to support the delivery of community childcare services, places on CE are dedicated to childcare.  These places support community and voluntary organisations in the provision of childcare services.  In 2012, there were 1,696 childcare places taken up on CE and over the intervening period, this increased to 2,007 as of June of this year.</p><p>  The Department introduced a new CE Childcare Strand at the beginning of 2013 under which there is a dedicated childcare educational programme at FETAC Level 5 for CE participants who work directly with children.  This programme has led to the re-structuring of CE childcare provision and it will improve the career path for participants who wish to pursue a career in childcare.  These improvements provide a more tailored and valuable support to the provision of community childcare.  The FETAC Major 5 Award is the entry level requirement to work as a basic practitioner in childcare.</p><p>  The take-up of CE childcare places has become more challenging due to the impact of the removal of the dual payment for one parent families and persons with disabilities introduced in January, 2012.  However, every effort is being made by the Department to encourage take-up of these places. </p></reply>

The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes.  The Department&rsquo;s role with regard to persons who are homeless is mainly income maintenance.  Under the social welfare system, homeless people have entitlements to the full range of social welfare schemes, including SWA subject to the normal qualifying conditions.</p><p>  Under the SWA scheme, the Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  Assistance through ENPs may be provided towards rent deposits.  This form of assistance is very important to those on low incomes who are at risk of, or who are homeless, or who rely on the private rented market to meet their housing needs.  If the Deputy has a particular case where homeless families have been refused social welfare they should forward details to the Department for follow up.</p></reply>

Kildare County Council have staff and arrangements in place to provide emergency support to persons who find themselves homeless.  The Community Welfare Service and Mid-Leinster rents unit work closely with County Council staff in these situations to ensure all necessary service and entitlements are provided in each instance to ensure a process that is as seamless as possible.</p><p>  The range of emergency supports is broadly similar in all areas. Because of the scale of homelessness in Dublin, services are organised centrally.  Similar emergency supports are available to homeless people within Kildare and other areas outside of Dublin, though accessed differently.  In instances where persons present as homeless they are normally referred to the Homeless Service of Kildare County Council where an assessment of their accommodation need is made and emergency accommodation provided where necessary.  The Department&rsquo;s role with regard to persons who are homeless is mainly income maintenance which is considered by departmental staff in liaison with the Kildare County Council homeless officers.</p></reply>

It should be noted that processing times vary by scheme reflecting the differing requirements to satisfy conditions such as income/means limits and medical eligibility.  The processing times provided in the table also incorporate the impact of overall processing times of the appeals process.</p><p>The average processing time for an appeal of all social welfare payments paid on a weekly basis in cases where the appeal is decided by summary decision, and for those appeals decided following an oral hearing, is given in Table 2.</p><p>Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period, including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.</p><p>There has been a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2009.  Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the number of appeals received peaked at 35,484, reducing to 32,777 appeals in 2013.  In parallel, the number of appeals finalised in the appeals office  increased from 17,787 in 2009 to 38,421 in 2013.  An additional 5,863 appeals were finalised in 2013 compared to 2012.  Good progress has also been made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 10,586 at 14<sup>th</sup>July 2014.</p><p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.</p><p>Table 1: Average time to award Claims June 2014<table><tr><th><div>Scheme</div></th><th>Average time to Award Claims<br /><br />(Weeks)</th></tr><tr><td>Jobseekers Benefit</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseekers Allowance</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>One-Parent Family Payment</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension Contributory (Domestic)</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension Transition (Domestic)</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Widow(er)'s Contributory Pension </td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension Non-Contributory</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Household Benefits</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Free Travel</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Supplementary Welfare Allowance</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Bereavement Grant - Sligo</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit (Domestic &amp;amp; Formerly Resident Abroad)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit (EU Regulation)</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Family Income Supplement (New Claims)</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Carer's Allowance*</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance*</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension*</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit</td><td>1</td></tr></table>* The average time to award disability allowance, carers' allowance and invalidity pension applications at the end of June was 30, 35 and 25 weeks respectively.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-07-17a.1037.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014071700053#WRN02600"><p>The figures requested by the Deputy relating appeals received for each social welfare payment, the average completion time for these appeals, and the percentage of appeals, in respect of each payment, which were upheld by the Appeals Office are provided in Tables 1-3 below. </p><p>Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period, including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.</p><p>There has been a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2009 which has placed extraordinary pressure on the office.  Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the number of appeals received peaked at 35,484, reducing to 32,777 appeals in 2013.  In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office.  A major programme of process redesign and modernisation is also under way in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.</p><p>In addition to the improvements in processing times mentioned above, these measures have also led to a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised in the appeals office from 17,787 in 2009 to 38,421 in 2013.  An additional 5,863 appeals were finalised in 2013 compared to 2012.  Good progress has also been made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 11,569 at 30<sup>th</sup>June 2014.</p><p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.</p><p><b>Table 1:  Appeals on Hands at 30</b><b><sup>th</sup></b><b>June 2014</b><table><tr><th>Scheme</th><th>No. of Appeals on Hands</th></tr><tr><td>Adoptive Benefit</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Blind Pension</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Carers Allowance</td><td>1,409</td></tr><tr><td>Carers Benefit</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit</td><td>304</td></tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance</td><td>1,900</td></tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit</td><td>612</td></tr><tr><td>Partial Capacity Benefit</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Domiciliary Care Allowance</td><td>357</td></tr><tr><td>Deserted Wives Allowance</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Deserted Wives Benefit</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Farm Assist</td><td>152</td></tr><tr><td>Bereavement Grant</td><td>58</td></tr><tr><td>Family Income Supplement</td><td>269</td></tr><tr><td>Homemaker</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension</td><td>1,120</td></tr><tr><td>Liable Relatives</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>One Parent Family Payment</td><td>300</td></tr><tr><td>Maternity Benefit</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-retirement Pension</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Contributory)</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Non-Cont)</td><td>149</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Transition)</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Occupational Injury Benefit</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Occupational Injury Benefit (Medical)</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Disablement Pension</td><td>194</td></tr><tr><td>Incapacity Supplement</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Con)</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Non-con)</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance (Means)</td><td>1,332</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance</td><td>1,160</td></tr><tr><td>JA/JB Fraud Control</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Benefit</td><td>409</td></tr><tr><td>Respite Care Grant</td><td>53</td></tr><tr><td>Insurability of Employment</td><td>121</td></tr><tr><td>Supplementary Welfare  Allowance</td><td>1,272</td></tr><tr><td>Survivor's Pension (Con)</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>Survivor's Pension (Non-Con)</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Widowed Parent Grant</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>11,569</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 2: Appeals processing times by scheme 01/01/2014 &ndash;

In addition, the term of office of the Placenames Commission expired in October 2012 and was replaced by an Expert Committee which also operates on a <i>pro bono</i>basis. </p><p>Furthermore, a formal Framework for Co-operation and Improved Services between the National Gallery of Ireland, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Crawford Art Gallery was developed and endorsed by Government.  Arising from that, the three Galleries signed a formal Service Level Agreement outlining a number of specific measures to share a number of services across the three Institutions.  Legislation has been prepared to give effect to these changes and to reduce the number on boards, enshrine <i>pro bono</i>service and also gender equality on each board.</p><p>In December 2013, a new Human Resources Shared Services Unit was established in my Department to provide HR support to the National Museum of Ireland.  Work is continuing between the National Museum of Ireland, the National Library of Ireland and the National Archives of Ireland to improve co-operation between these institutions and to progress shared services.  Legislation to formally enact these changes and changes to board structure is being progressed.</p><p>I am satisfied that this programme of change has made a significant contribution to achieving the savings targets set out in the Public Service Reform Plan, while at the same time enhancing the operations of the bodies concerned.</p><p>No agencies or State bodies funded from my Department's Vote group have been established since 2011.  For completeness, however, the Deputy may wish to note that responsibility for the Censorship of Publications Board and the Censorship of Publications Appeals Board transferred from the Department of Justice and Equality to my Department in June 2013.  </p></reply>

Subsequently, a decision was taken on 10 July 2013 to dispose of the airstrips in view of the economic downturn, the ongoing cost of maintaining the airstrips and the position that my Department is unlikely, at any time in the near future, to have the resources required to subsidise a regular air service between the island and the mainland.  My Department is currently examining the disposal options that are available to it, namely, to sell the airstrips or to lease them long-term.  The Deputy can be assured that whichever disposal option is selected, it will be carried out by means of a public procurement process.  To date, there have been some informal contacts with my Department by various interested parties regarding the disposal of the airstrips.  My Department is open to representations from other interested parties in that context.</p></reply>

These will form theunderlying basis of the work of my Department for the remainder of this Government's term of office. The <i>Statement of Government Priorities</i>identifies 6 key priorities for the coming period. I believe that my Department will have a particular contribution to make in relation to 3 of these priorities: </p><p>-  Strengthening the domestic economy and prioritising new jobs for the unemployed; </p><p>-  Rebuilding trust in politics and public institutions; and</p><p>-  Protecting and enhancing peace in Northern Ireland.</p><p>It will remain a key objective for my Department to maximise the economic and employment creation potential of the arts, heritage and Gaeltacht sectors. In this context, it will seek to continue to develop synergies between the arts, cultural, heritage and Gaeltacht sectors, most notably in the area of tourism product development and cultural tourism.</p><p>The <i>Statement of Government Priorities</i>makes specific reference to the coordination and organisation events and commemorations related to Ireland's path to independence that are respectful to the different traditions and communities on the island of Ireland. In that context, I will continue to advance plans for the programme of commemorative events in the context of the Decade of Centenaries 2012-2022, including the centenary of the Easter Rising in 2016.</p><p>I also look forward to working for the promotion of North/South co-operation in the context of the remit of my Department and, in particular, through the work of the North South Implementation Bodies that my Department co-funds &ndash; Waterways Ireland and An Foras Teanga.</p><p>Other key issues in the context of the <i>Programme for Government</i>will be the continuation of efforts with stakeholders to implement the National Peatlands Strategy and the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language.</p></reply>

There is no contract with any external service provider for such services, and therefore the matter of renewing or not renewing such a contract does not arise.  My Department is always looking at ways to improve the tourism and education dimensions and visitor services at national parks and I am pleased to acknowledge that the bus service in operation at Glenveagh National Park has proven to be a success over many years.</p><p>  Due to the success of the scheme, and as a result of a significant and welcome increase in coach tour bookings and a general increase in visitor numbers to Glenveagh this year, the demand for the service currently exceeds that which has been provided by the staff at Glenveagh National Park.  Accordingly, my Department gave consideration to tendering for a private service operator to augment the bus service currently provided at Glenveagh at peak times, on a day-to-day basis.  However, following a recent review of the position, arrangements have been agreed with the staff concerned on foot of which it is expected that there will not now be any need to engage private operators to augment the service.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses.  This is being achieved through measures designed to accelerate commercial investment and the development of a State-led intervention for non-commercial areas.</p><p>  Since publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector have accelerated with commercial operators investing, or committing to invest, approximately &euro;2.5 billion in networks and services.  I understand that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out 28 fibre-based broadband networks in County Wicklow by July 2016.  In addition the recent announcement of a joint venture between ESB and Vodafone includes a proposal to provide high speed broadband in 4 locations in County Wicklow.</p><p>  The Government has committed to an ambitious plan which involves ensuring the delivery of broadband services to those parts of rural Ireland that will not be served by the commercial sector.  Services will be delivered over a network, with fibre at its foundation, which is sustainable and guarantees a quality broadband service to rural consumers into the future.  This will be the key element of an intervention strategy that will ensure that all citizens and businesses can access high speed broadband services regardless of where they live.</p><p>  Under EU State Aid Guidelines Member States cannot intervene where commercial investors have plans to roll out services.  A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department, to identify those areas that require a State intervention.  An initial list has already been identified and includes 15 areas in County Wicklow.  Further areas may also be identified as part of the ongoing mapping process which is ongoing.</p><p>  A stakeholder consultation on the implementation of the State-led intervention has recently been launched and will feed into the mapping exercise, which I expect to conclude in the autumn.  It is my intention to conduct a full public consultation on the outcome of the mapping process and the proposed intervention strategy.  EU State aid clearance will also be required.  This will be followed by a detailed procurement process with a view to commencing the roll out of high speed broadband services as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

In order to meet this overall target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources.  Provisional figures indicate that, in 2013, 20.5% of Ireland's electricity requirements were met by renewable technologies such as wind energy, hydropower and biomass with 16.4% of electricity demand being met by wind generation.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland on <i>Quantifying Ireland&rsquo;s Fuel and CO2 Emissions Savings from Renewable Electricity in 2012 </i>estimated that renewable electricity generation resulted in CO2 emissions being reduced by 1.94 million tonnes in 2012.</p><p>Achieving these renewable energy targets requires investment in generating capacity and at the end of 2013, the total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid was 2,300 MW with over 3,000 MW of renewable generation having taken up connection offers under the Gate 3 grid connection programme.  It is estimated that a total of around 4,000 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target.</p><p>Although achieving our renewable energy targets will be challenging, it has been established that Ireland has sufficient onshore renewable energy resources to do so.  Intensive discussions took place over the last year with the UK to establish if it would be possible to export renewable energy in order to allow the UK meet its 2020 target.  While this work established that, with the appropriate policy and regulatory framework, renewable energy trading could deliver benefits to both Ireland and the UK, the complexities involved and the decisions yet to be taken by the UK, make post 2020 delivery more realistic given project lead times.  Nevertheless, given the move towards an Internal Market for Energy, I am of the view that trade in renewable electricity is likely to happen after 2020.  Any such trading would require infrastructure that would be separate from Ireland's transmission grid and would be funded by private developers without any impact on the Irish consumer.</p><p>It is also clear that there is potential to increase the diversity of our renewable generation portfolio in the period beyond 2020.  To that end, the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP), published earlier this year, identifies the sustainable economic opportunity for Ireland in the period to 2030 of realising the potential of our indigenous offshore wind, wave and tidal energy resources.  The Strategic Environmental Assessment carried out for the OREDP found that 4,500 MW of offshore wind and 1,500 MW of wave and tidal generation could be sustainably developed in Irish waters.</p><p>In terms of European targets for the period beyond 2020, the EU Commission published its 2030 Climate and Energy Package in January this year.  Work is underway on a cross-Departmental basis to establish the appropriate national position for Ireland in relation to greenhouse gas reduction and renewable energy targets in the context of an overall level of ambition set by the Commission for a 40% greenhouse gas reduction and 27% renewable energy target at EU level for 2030.  The contribution of the various sectors to meeting the national targets will be considered as part of developing a national position over the coming months.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-07-17a.1147.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014071700054#WRO05500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 438 and 443 together.</p><p>A comparison report, the &ldquo;State of Broadband&rdquo; published by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in September 2013 ranks Ireland 35<sup>th</sup>of 183 countries for fixed line broadband penetration per 100 inhabitants; 19<sup>th</sup>of 170 countries for mobile broadband penetration per 100 inhabitants and 31<sup>st</sup>of 192 countries with 79% of the population accessing the internet using broadband.</p><p>The most recent OECD comparison report on retail fixed broadband speeds marketed, ranks Ireland 11<sup>th</sup>highest, equal with countries such as Australia, France, Germany, Switzerland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom for the highest marketed download speed available of 100 Mbps in 2012.  In the case of mobile broadband access, the OECD ranks Ireland 14<sup>th</sup>highest of the 34 countries surveyed.</p><p>These comparisons provide useful evidence of global trends in customer access to high speed broadband and mobile services.  They do not however measure the proportion of the populations which can access the high speed services within the states compared.  The broadband market in Ireland has changed considerably since the last OECD survey.  The highest market retail broadband speed offered by one service provider has increased from 100Mbps to 200Mbps in that period.  Another service provider is rolling out a fibre based network passing 1.4m premises and offering speeds of up to 100mbps.  This trend towards higher broadband speeds is expected to continue as service providers roll out new high speed services.  The recent announcement of a joint venture between Vodafone and ESB to provide fibre-to-the-premises services passing 500,000 premises initially should further improve Ireland&rsquo;s international ranking over time.  I am confident therefore that Ireland will continue to improve its relative placing with those countries surveyed in the current OECD table.  According to ComReg statistics, at the end March 2014, the proportion of all fixed broadband subscriptions equal to or greater than 10Mbps in Ireland increased from 32% to 57% in the last year.  38% of all such subscriptions were equal to or greater than 30Mbps up from 21% in the same period.  In addition to fixed line services, mobile services providers are rolling out next generation 4G networks following ComReg&rsquo;s multi-band spectrum auction in 2012.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s Statement of Priorities for the period 2014 to 2016 reaffirms our commitment to delivering a State-led broadband intervention in those areas the commercial market will not serve.  The National Broadband Plan aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses.  This will be achieved using a State-led intervention in non-commercial areas to ensure the delivery of high speed broadband services to those parts of rural Ireland that will not be served by the commercial sector.  I have commented in more detail on this market intervention today in responding to other questions on the National Broadband Plan.  It is my intention to progress this project as a key priority. I believe that it will address current connectivity challenges in a sustainable and meaningful way and will ensure that rural Ireland can enjoy comparable levels of broadband quality and service as those experienced in urban areas.</p></reply>

It is too early, however, to determine whether these results will lead to the identification of commercially viable deposits or to estimate the economic benefits that might accrue.  An agreement was reached in December 2013 with Boliden Tara Mines Ltd on the terms for new State Mining Leases, allowing for the extension of operations at the mine.  There have been no commercial discoveries of oil or gas within the territory of the State in the last three years.  Ireland, however, now has the highest number of petroleum exploration authorisations in place since exploration began in our offshore more than four decades ago.  This demonstrates that exploration in the Irish offshore is moving in the right direction.</p></reply>

The Internet Content Governance Advisory (ICGA) Group was established within my Department in December of last year to ensure our national policy represents best practice in offering the same online protections to our citizens as those available in the offline world.</p><p>  The Group&rsquo;s report was approved by Cabinet and published last month and makes several recommendations aimed at protecting children and young people without unduly limiting their opportunities and rights online.  Along with changes to institutional, administrative and legal structures, the report makes four specific recommendations on cyberbullying aimed at providing stronger supports for tackling this issue through primary and post-primary curricula and additional training and awareness measures.</p><p>  In terms of the prevention and tracking of cyberbullying, our most immediate and important task now is to help educate children, young people and parents as to the risks that can be found online, to support parents and teachers in explaining these issues to children and to identify the optimal technical solution to protect children.  In this regard, there are a range of tools available online to assist parents in managing internet access.  The ISPs themselves have a variety of measures and resources already in place, with software and other tools available to help parents ensure online safety for their children.</p></reply>

This is being achieved through measures designed to accelerate commercial investment and the development of a State-led intervention for non-commercial areas.</p><p>  Since publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector have accelerated with commercial operators investing, or committing to invest, approximately &euro;2.5 billion in networks and services. </p><p>  The Government has committed to an ambitious plan which involves ensuring the delivery of broadband services to those parts of rural Ireland that will not be served by the commercial sector.

In doing so we need to be cognisant of energy cost competitiveness, while anchoring Irish energy policy in the three pillars of EU Energy policy. In the area of broadband, the National Broadband Plan aims to ensure that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses, irrespective of location. Significant commercial investment is already underway and will be complemented by State investment aimed at addressing those areas where there is no commercial case for investment. To help create jobs and growth in small to medium enterprises, an online trading voucher scheme has been launched and is targeting support to over 2,000 SMEs over a two year period. </p><p>Over the coming months I will engage with my Department in the preparation of a new Statement of Strategy which will set out the key objectives, outputs and related strategies for my Department for the next three years. While I would not attempt to anticipate the full scope of the Statement, or list all the priority areas for action at this stage, I expect that it will include:</p><p>- A legislative programme that will include new Broadcasting, Minerals and Fisheries legislation;</p><p>- The development of an Energy White Paper which takes account, inter alia, of energy and climate change objectives and targets over the medium and long term, specific obligations to 2020 in relation to renewable energy deployment and energy efficiency, and the need to ensure security of supply and competitiveness in our energy system;</p><p>- Further development of the National Broadband Plan; </p><p>-Continued roll-out of the National Digital Strategy;</p><p>- supporting a diverse and financially stable broadcasting sector;</p><p>- the roll-out the National Postcode project; and</p><p>- Overseeing the 2015 offshore Oil and Gas licensing Round.</p><p>When complete, I will be happy to present a copy of the Statement of Strategy to the House.</p></reply>

During 2013, officials in my Department carried out a review of the scheme, which found that it has fulfilled its main objective of providing multi-annual funding to national organisations towards core costs associated with the provision of services. The review recommended that organisations be required to demonstrate clearly the added value of the work proposed.</p><p>  A new round of funding was advertised for applications earlier this year.  Pobal was asked to undertake an assessment of the applications received, given that organisation's significant experience and expertise of both the design of assessment criteria and completion of assessment functions.  Two well-attended information sessions were hosted by the Department and Pobal during the application process to outline the requirements of the new Scheme. Application Guidelines were also issued, which outlined the scoring process which included capacity of the organisation, strategic fit, demonstration of need, achievability of the proposal and value for money.  Organisations were provided with support in the application process, including a dedicated email address as a preferred contact method to deal promptly with queries, and enquiries were also dealt with by telephone.</p><p>  My predecessor was anxious to make funding available to as many organisations as possible within the prevailing resource constraints and he approved 55 applications for funding for the two-year period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016.  The Irish Deaf Society and the Neurological Association of Ireland were not approved for funding on this occasion. </p><p>  Pobal has put in place a dedicated team to deal with any inquiries from applicants and to provide detailed feedback. There is also a scheme appeals process and applicants have been provided with detailed information in that regard.  As that process is now live, it would not be appropriate for me to make any further comment on the funding process or on the application of any particular organisation.</p></reply>

An exemption from the Local Property Tax applies to developments listed in the Schedule to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013.

The Guidelines provide advice to planning authorities on catering for wind energy development through the development plan and development management processes. They are also intended to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country in the identification of suitable locations for wind energy development and the treatment of planning applications for such developments. Guidance is provided on issues such as natural and built heritage, proximity to residential communities, noise, shadow flicker and aesthetic considerations in siting and design including landscape impact.</p><p>  It is unclear which European best practice guidelines the Deputy is referring to in his question. The 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines take account of European Union legislation on matters such as Environmental Impact Assessment and the protection of Habitats. As part of a focussed review of the 2006 Guidelines, Marshall Day Acoustics were commissioned during 2013 to carry out research relating to wind turbine noise including an examination of current EU and international practice.  This research was an important input into proposed draft revisions to the Guidelines, which were put out for public consultation in December 2013. </p><p>  These draft revisions propose;</p><p>  -  The setting of a more stringent day and night noise limit of 40 decibels for future wind energy developments, </p><p>  -  A mandatory minimum setback of 500 metres between a wind turbine and the nearest dwelling for amenity considerations, and</p><p>-  The complete elimination of shadow flicker between wind turbines and neighbouring dwellings.</p><p>  My Department received submissions from some 7,500 organisations and members of the public during the public consultation period, which are currently being considered. These public submissions will be an important input into the final version of the guidelines which I intend to issue to planning authorities later this year.</p></reply>

Similarly, where an estate has not been completed to the standard outlined in the planning permission and the planning authority has not taken enforcement action within seven years of the expiry of the permission authorising the development, section 180 also provides that the planning authority must initiate taking in charge procedures if requested to do so by the owners of the units concerned.  The decision as to whether an estate should be taken in charge is ultimately one for the elected members of the planning authority.</p><p>  Section 180 was amended in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 to provide that a local authority may take in charge an unfinished estate, at the request of the owners of the housing units, at any time after the expiration of the planning permission, in situations where enforcement actions have commenced or where the local authority considers that enforcement action will not result in the satisfactory completion of the estate by the developer.  Planning authorities have also been empowered to take in charge part of an estate or some, but not all, of the facilities in an estate.</p><p>  The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides for the transfer of responsibility for the provision of public water services from local authorities to Irish Water. In addition, it provides a mechanism whereby water services infrastructure may be transferred by Ministerial Order to Irish Water.  Contrary to certain misunderstandings that may exist, there is no specific legal impediment to the taking in charge of water services infrastructure by local authorities. The potential to streamline this process for the future is currently under review.    </p><p>  In Circular Letter PL 21/13 issued by my Department to planning authorities on 30 December 2013 in the light of the transfer of certain statutory water services functions from local authorities to Irish Water with effect from 1 January 2014, it was stated that legislative amendments to further clarify the existing provisions on the taking in charge of housing estates would be made in 2014.  As part of this process, my Department will also consider, in consultation with local authorities, whether it is appropriate to make further amendments to section 180 of the Planning and Development Act in relation to the taking in charge provisions generally in the context of the forthcoming Planning Bill, for instance in relation to the time limits for the taking in charge of estates. </p><p>  In order to clarify the current up-to-date position with regard to the taking in charge of estates, my Department will shortly issue a further circular letter to planning authorities with a view to clearing up any misunderstandings that may exist in this regard. </p><p>  My Department has no responsibility for, or role to play in, the day to day management, maintenance or operation of water or waste water infrastructure.  However, it is aware of problems with some water services infrastructure that was provided by developers and which is not connected to the public network. My Department is currently considering what long-term solutions might be appropriate in such cases.</p></reply>

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies. The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group and assigned the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake this metering programme.</p><p>  Irish Water has confirmed to my Department that it was always anticipated that in the course of installing meters, pre-existing leaks and other latent defects due to the age or condition of the water pipes would be discovered.  It is not accurate to assume that these leaks are caused by Irish Water&rsquo;s contractors.  The meter installation programme gives Irish Water a strong starting point for mains rehabilitation by enabling the discovery of pre-existing leaks and helping to target more effective investment in leak repair.</p><p>  The Government has agreed to provide additional funding to Irish Water for their capital investment, to include a free first fix scheme.  Irish Water has submitted its water charges plan, including its proposed capital investment plan, to the Commission for Energy regulation.  Irish Water will announce details of the proposed first fix scheme in the light of the Commission&rsquo;s consideration of its water charges plan.</p></reply>

The SRF is designed to encourage the resolution of the remaining tranche of unfinished developments identified in the National Housing Development Survey 2013 and, particularly, those developments not likely to be resolved in the normal way through solely developer/owner/funder action because of the presence of specific financial barriers. It is envisaged that the SRF should be particularly targeted to address the remaining unfinished developments with residents living in them and, in particular, any developments that local authorities identified, for the purposes of the Local Property Tax waiver, as in a seriously problematic condition.  In December 2013, my Department wrote to local authorities seeking proposals for funding support under the SRF and the deadline for receipt of applications was 28 February 2014. All submissions were evaluated by my Department <i>in accordance with the criteria circulated to the local authorities.</i>On 2 May 2014, allocations from the Special Resolution Fund were announced and I can confirm that an allocation of &euro;250,000 was made available in respect of the housing development in question.</p><p>The following link contains a list of all developments approved for SRF funding:</p><p>It is hoped that the SRF will enable very substantial progress to be made in resolving as many of the remaining unfinished developments as possible.</p></reply>

My Department is currently considering, in consultation with Irish Water, what amendments to section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 will be required in this regard.</p><p>  As part of this process, and in the light of efforts to streamline the planning process to facilitate economic recovery, the Department will also look at, in consultation with local authorities, whether further changes to the current overall taking in charge system are desirable, for instance in relation to the time limits for the taking in charge of estates.</p><p>  My Department will shortly issue further guidelines to local authorities by means of circular letter in relation to the taking in charge of water services infrastructure.</p></reply>

The LGMA also took on the residual functions of An Chomhairle Leabharlanna, which has dissolved as of 1 November 2012. The LGMA is a central resource for the local government sector, providing, procuring and coordinating a range of support services and expertise which are most appropriately and efficiently delivered on a shared service basis at national level.</p><p>The Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency (HSCA) was established in 2012. It rationalises the functions of the National Building Agency (NBA), the Affordable Homes Partnership (AHP) and the Centre for Housing Research (CHR).

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation for homeless persons and related services rests with housing authorities.  </p><p>In February 2013, at the time of publication of the Government&rsquo;s <i>Homelessness Policy Statement,</i>a set of indicators was identified to be used to demonstrate the dynamics of homelessness as it is addressed.  These indicators will give a clearer picture of homelessness in Ireland and, in quantifying its on-going extent, will support the implementation of realistic and practical solutions.  The Pathway Accommodation &amp;amp; Support System (PASS) was extended nationally in 2013 and is now operational nationwide.  It will assist lead housing authorities in each of the 9 regions to report on these indicators and 2014 will be the first year for which PASS will produce composite national data on homelessness.  Quarterly reports from lead housing authorities are being published on my Department's website as soon as these are available.</p><p>Based on data recorded on PASS, a recent survey of lead housing authorities confirmed that 2,385 unique individuals utilised Section 10 funded emergency accommodation nationally during the week of 16 to 22 June 2014.  A regional breakdown of this total is provided in the following table.</p><p><b>Unique individuals that utilised Section 10-funded emergency accommodation during the week of 16 to 22 June 2014</b></p><p><table><tr><th><b>Region</b></th><th><div><b>No. of unique individuals </b></div></th></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td><div>1,548</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mid-West</td><td><div>243</div></td></tr><tr><td>South West</td><td><div>202</div></td></tr><tr><td>South East</td><td><div>152</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mid East</td><td><div>87</div></td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td><div>47</div></td></tr><tr><td>North West</td><td><div>47</div></td></tr><tr><td>West</td><td><div>36</div></td></tr><tr><td>North East</td><td><div>23</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Total</b></td><td><div><b>2,385</b></div></td></tr></table></p><p>A further similar survey is being undertaken this week (commencing 14 July) and the results are expected before the end of the month.

This service provides a mechanism for Departments to advertise board vacancies and it gives prospective candidates an opportunity to register their general interest in a position on a state Board and to be alerted to upcoming vacancies.   </p><p>Since July 2011, my Department has sought expressions of interest through its website, from suitably qualified and experienced persons, for consideration as members or chairpersons of the boards of State bodies under my Department&rsquo;s aegis. Expressions of interest can be made at any time and will be kept on file in my Department for consideration as vacancies occur. In considering applications, due regard is had to the requirements of the position, the qualifications, experience and expertise of applicants and Government policy regarding gender balance on State boards. </p><p>All appointments are made in accordance with the appropriate legislation governing appointments to each body. In some cases statutory selection procedures must be followed or nominations must be sought from independent nominating panels before appointments are made by the Minister or the Government, as appropriate. In a number of situations, only some appointments to the body concerned are made by the Minister, or appointments are made with the consent of another Minister. </p><p>The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water as a subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann (BGE) under the Companies Acts. The Memorandum and Articles of Association, provide that the appointment of directors is the responsibility of the Board of BGE, with the approval of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. 12 directors were appointed initially for the period to July 2014, one of whom has since resigned. The remaining 11 directors have been re-appointed for a further 6 month period to 30 November 2014. </p><p>The following have been appointed to the Board of Irish Water:   <table><tr><th>Irish Water </th><th>Ms. Rose Hynes (Chair) </th><th>July 2013 </th></tr><tr><td></td><td>Mr. Michael McNicholas </td><td>July 2013 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Mr. John Tierney </td><td>July 2013 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Ms. Margaret Rae </td><td>July/2013 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Mr. Philip Lee </td><td>November 2013 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Ms. Hilary Quinlan </td><td>November 2013 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Ms. Regina Finn </td><td>November 2013 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Mr. Colman Sheehy </td><td>November 2013 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Mr. Billy Moore </td><td>November 2013 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Mr. Brian McKeown </td><td>November 2013 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Mr. Sean Kelly </td><td>November 2013* </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Ms. Jacqueline Hall </td><td>November 2013 </td></tr></table>*resigned in June 2014   </p><p>In addition, although not a State Board in the traditional sense, appointments to the Board of Pobal, a not-for-profit company, fall to be made by the Government having considered nominees from a range of stakeholders.

In particular, the levy was introduced as an anti-litter measure designed to influence consumers by encouraging them to reduce their use of disposable plastic bags. </p><p>Section 72 of the Waste Management Act 1996, as inserted by section 9 of the Waste Management (Amendment) Act 2001, provided for the introduction of the plastic bag levy. The Waste Management (Environmental Levy)(Plastic Bag) Order 2007 and the Waste Management (Environmental Levy) (Plastic Bag) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2007 allowed for the levy to be increased from its previous level of 15 cent per bag to 22 cent per bag from 1 July 2007.</p><p>The introduction of the levy in March 2002 led to a dramatic reduction in the number of disposable plastic bags supplied to consumers, from an estimated 328 bags per person per year prior to the introduction of the levy, to 21 bags per person by the end of 2002 and a further reduction to an estimated 1 5 bags per person by the end of 2013.</p><p>The National Litter Pollution Monitoring System is used to measure the impact of the plastic bag levy on an ongoing basis and my Department also monitors the receipts from the plastic bag levy to monitor trends in the average per capita consumption of plastic bags. These data are used to ensure that the plastic bag levy is set at an appropriate level. <i>The National Litter Pollution Monitoring System Report 201</i><i>3</i>reports that plastic bags constituted 0. 14 % of litter arising in 2013. This compares with 5% prior to the levy&rsquo;s introduction.   </p><p>Receipts from the plastic bag levy for each year are published in the Environment Fund Annual Accounts. The 2013 Annual Accounts will be published on my Department's website in due course after they have been audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General while copies of the Annual Accounts up to and including 2012 are available on my Department's website at the following weblink: </p></reply>

The Government decision was based on estimates provided by local authorities, including those received from Kerry County Council. The Report on the Severe Weather from 13 December 2013 to 6 January 2014 contains details of estimates of the cost of damage caused on a county by county basis and has been published on my Department's website: </p><p>Requests for funding of new works to protect coastal areas have been referred to the Office for Public Works and are not covered by the Government decision of 11 February 2014.   </p><p>The arrangements for the drawing down of the funds by local authorities on foot of the Government decision were finalised following discussions between local authorities, my Department, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Office of Public Works, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. </p><p>Local authorities, including Kerry County Council, have been notified of the sums being made available to them and have been requested to prioritise works which are significant for economic activity, with particular regard to the tourist season. It is proposed to make a sum of up to &euro;2,699,991 available to Kerry County Council for a programme of repair works to roads, piers and harbours, coastal protection repairs, tourism infrastructure and other facilities which are classified as necessary community infrastructure. The sum of &euro;2,699,991 for Kerry is allocated across a number of headings, as shown in the following table.<table><tr><th><b>Local Authority</b></th><th><b>Roads Infrastructure</b></th><th><b>Piers and Harbours</b></th><th><b>Coastal Protection Repairs</b></th><th><b>Tourism Infrastructure</b></th><th><b>Other Facilities</b></th><th><b>Total</b></th></tr><tr><td>Kerry County Council </td><td>575,291 </td><td>88,600 </td><td>1,226,920 </td><td>787,180 </td><td>22,000 </td><td>2,699,991 </td></tr></table></p><p>In addition to the above funding, a once-off allocation of &euro;280,329 is being made to Kerry County Council to recoup the costs associated with the response to the storms. This includes the costs of response, clean-up works and necessary immediate works which were undertaken in the aftermath of the storms. </p><p>Arrangements are being made for payment of funds to local authorities, including Kerry County Council, for works undertaken that are due to be funded through my Department. In the case of Kerry County Council the total amount to be funded through my Department is &euro;1,089,180 and is made up of &euro;787,180 for tourism infrastructure, &euro;17,000 for local authorities own infrastructure, &euro;5,000 miscellaneous expenditure and &euro;280,329 for response and clean-up costs mentioned above. A claim for drawdown of &euro;280,329 for the response and clean-up costs has been received by my Department and is being examined with a view to payment as soon as possible. </p><p>The drawdown of funding for other works set out in the table above is a matter for the Council and the relevant Departments.</p></reply>

Leave to seek a judicial review must usually be sought within eight weeks of the decision, although the High Court may extend this period where it considers that there is good and sufficient reason for doing so. The High Court may only grant leave where it is satisfied that there are substantial grounds for contending that the decision is invalid or should be quashed. The person seeking leave must also have a substantial interest in the decision and have participated in the decision making process or had good and sufficient reasons for not doing so. </p><p>  Section 146 of the 2000 Act provides that a report and recommendation on any case which is before the Board for decision can be prepared to assist the Board in making its decision on that matter. The Board is obliged to consider any such report and recommendation before determining the matter but it is not bound to adopt the report in making its decision. However, subsection 34(10) of the 2000 Act in relation to planning appeals provides that in circumstances where the Board&rsquo;s decision is different, in relation to the granting or refusal of permission, from the recommendation of the reporting inspector, then the Board&rsquo;s decision must include a statement indicating the main reasons for not accepting the recommendation in the inspector&rsquo;s report. The Board follows this practice in all cases which come before it for decision.</p><p>  In June 2007, my Department issued Development Management Guidelines for Planning Authorities under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which planning authorities and the Board must have regard to in the performance of their functions. The Guidelines contain a section in relation to planning reports, and advise that the planning report should gather together all information relevant for the proper consideration of the application and that it should structure these considerations in a way that is clear to the applicant and the wider public and that enables informed judgements to be made as to the merits of an appeal to the Board. The Guidelines also note the requirements of section 34(10)(b) of the 2000 Act and reiterate that where a final decision of a planning authority or the Board on a planning application is different, in relation to either the granting or refusal of permission, from the recommendation of the final planning report, the decision must indicate clearly the main reasons for not accepting the recommendation. The Guidelines further advise that it is best practice that the decision would address all the relevant issues raised in the final planning report and that where the decision, while not differing from the recommendation in relation to the grant or refusal, significantly varies the conditions, the reasons for this variation should also be given. The Guidelines emphasise that implementing the above procedure is vital in supporting the openness and transparency of the planning system.</p><p>  I have no plans to amend the legislation in this regard at this time. </p></reply>

In accordance with section 72 of the Water Services Act 2007, Irish Water may require any consumer of water services provided by it to take their supply through a water supply meter. The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 also provided for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) to be responsible for the independent economic regulation of Irish Water.  In particular, the CER will be responsible for approving water charges plans codes of practice prepared by Irish Water.

Of the estimated 1.35 million domestic properties connected to public water supplies, approximately 300,000 properties will not be metered as part of the current phase, due to the cost or technical difficulty of doing so. These properties would include apartment blocks, other multi-occupancy buildings and houses with shared service connections. Irish Water has awarded contracts on a regional basis and over 290,000 installations were completed by the end of June 2014.</p><p>Irish Water has also commissioned a study on possible approaches to metering properties that are not part of the current metering programme, including apartments and properties with shared service connections. This report was recently submitted to my Department and the recommendations of the report are being considered. In particular, the Department is exploring with Irish Water the potential to include a new phase of metering of some 48,000 apartments, which the report suggests can be easily metered as part of a separate procurement process.</p><p>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

I will bring forward new planning legislation to reform Part V and the local authority development contributions regime to reduce the burden on new housing development. Measures to increase the supply of social housing will be a key priority, along with housing for those on low incomes and ending homelessness and the need to sleep rough by 2016.     Through the development of a new Social Housing Strategy, a public housing provision approach will be delivered that provides for those households who cannot afford to house themselves and also assists those who struggle to afford housing in the private market.</p><p>  It is essential that our recovery is based on sustainable development and addresses the long term issues and I am committed to enactment of the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill, together with a new national roadmap to help Ireland meet its climate change targets.</p><p>  I will also be continuing the Government&rsquo;s programme of rebuilding trust in politics and bringing forward legislation for the establishment of an Electoral Commission. </p><p>In addressing this wide-ranging brief, I am committed to driving the work of my Department to ensure it plays a significant part in or country&rsquo;s economic and social recovery.</p></reply>

These specific control requirements in relation to certain breeds were introduced as a balanced and workable arrangement which recognises the rights of dog owners, while also taking account of the needs of society to be protected from dogs with a significant capability to inflict very serious injury. Consultation in relation to these regulations included the Irish Kennel Club, the ISPCA, the Irish Veterinary Association, the Irish Veterinary Union, the Association of Dog Wardens, the Search and Rescue Dog Association (Ireland), the Irish Guide Dogs Association and Bord na gCon. </p><p>  Several jurisdictions have addressed the matter of restrictions of particular breeds of dogs in a similar way to Ireland. England, Northern Ireland, France and New Zealand all have similar restrictions on specific breeds of dog. </p><p>  The overall thrust of dog control legislation in Ireland, primarily the Control of Dogs Act 1986, is to place the onus on dog owners to act responsibly by keeping their dogs under effectual control. Such responsible dog ownership is the key to reducing incidences of dog biting and other problem behaviours.</p><p>  While I do not plan at this point to launch a review of dog control legislation, I will continue to monitor the position regarding these issues, including restrictions on certain breeds, and to receive feedback on these matters.</p></reply>

The then Minister for Defence appointed a 14 person interim Board as a temporary measure in 2011 and in this context none of the positions were advertised nor was the chairperson interviewed by an Oireachtas committee. Legislation to dissolve the Board was passed by the Oireachtas in December 2012. Its functions have now transferred back to the Department of Defence. </p><p>  There were no appointments to the Board of Coiste an Asgard from 2009. In the context of settling the Estimates for the Department of Defence for 2010, the Government decided that the national sail training scheme operated by Coiste an Asgard would be discontinued as recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure. The formal wind up of the Company including voluntary strike off with the Companies Registration Office was completed in early 2013. </p><p>  The only body currently under the aegis of the Department of Defence is the Army Pensions Board. The Army Pensions Board is an independent statutory body established under the Army Pensions Act, 1927. The Act specifies that the Board shall consist of a chairman and two ordinary members. The two ordinary members must be qualified medical practitioners of whom one must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps. The chairman and the non military ordinary member are appointed by the Minister for Defence with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The Army Medical Corps ordinary member is appointed by the Minister for Defence on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces.  </p><p>  There have been two appointments to the Army Pensions Board since March 2011. A serving officer was appointed to the position of Army Medical Corps member of the Board in December 2011, and a civilian doctor was appointed as ordinary member in November 2013.</p><p>  The position of Army Medical Corps ordinary member became vacant due to retirement in 2011. The then Minister for Defence appointed Commandant Adam Lagun to the Board on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff. As the Army Pensions Act, 1927 specifies that one of the ordinary members must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps, this position was not publicly advertised. Details of Commandant Lagun&rsquo;s appointment to the Army Pensions Board were published in the Iris Oifigi&uacute;il on 13 January 2012.</p><p>  The civilian doctor vacancy was advertised on the Department of Defence website and the Public Appointments Service website. A number of expressions of interest in the position were received and an appointment to the Board was made on foot of this public advertisement process.</p></reply>

The agenda has not yet issued but it has been suggested that Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) Missions and Operations and progress following the European Council meeting on defence in December 2013 will be discussed.  In relation to the CSDP Missions and Operations it is anticipated that Operation and Mission Commanders of the five ongoing EU military missions will brief Defence Ministers on the current state of play regarding their missions. These are Operation ALTHEA in Bosnia and Herzegovina; Operation EUNAVFOR ATALANTA the EU&rsquo;s anti-piracy maritime mission off the coast of Somalia; EUFOR RCA, the EU mission in the Central African Republic; and the EU Training Missions in Mali and Somalia (EUTM Mali and EUTM Somalia).</p><p>The meeting of the Heads of State and Government at the European Council in December 2013 focused on Defence.  The areas considered were broken into three clusters dealing with</p><p>I. increasing the effectiveness, visibility and impact of CSDP including rapid response:</p><p>- Developing new regional strategies where necessary and update existing ones,</p><p>- Further development of the comprehensive approach</p><p>- Working with the United Nations, African Union, NATO and partner countries</p><p>- Strengthening ties between CSDP and Freedom Security and Justice actors to deal with horizontal issues e.g. illegal immigration, organised crime etc.</p><p>- Increasing the ability to respond to emerging challenges including in the areas of cyber defence, maritime, border challenges, energy security and space.</p><p>In the area of Rapid response and Battlegroups (BGs) the proposals included:</p><p>- Improving the usability and deployability of Battlegroups through modularity</p><p>- Taking forward the agreed Framework Nation approach for the roster</p><p>- Enhancing and streamlining the Battlegroup exercises so as to improve transformation, interoperability and co-operation</p><p>- Involving Battlegroups in advanced planning</p><p>- Carrying out political exercises for the Battlegroups on standby</p><p>- Considering the financial aspects as part of the Athena Review (funding mechanism for EU military operations)to be carried out in the second half of 2014.</p><p>II. enhancing the development of capabilities: </p><p>- A systematic and longer term approach to Defence co-operation</p><p>- Increased transparency and information sharing</p><p>- Consolidation of demand and harmonisation of requirements</p><p>III. strengthening the defence industry:</p><p>- The need for a strong healthy and competitive Defence technological and industrial base</p><p>- A defence market that is open, transparent, opportunistic and based on equal treatment</p><p>- The importance of SMEs as innovators and key enablers for competitiveness</p><p>- The development of tangible measures on standards and certification</p><p>- The exploitation of synergies between civil and defence related research.</p><p>Following the Council discussion and adoption of conclusions a detailed overview of the actions to be taken forward at EU level and by the Member States was prepared and consisted of over sixty (60) actions.  This overview is considered a &ldquo;living document&rdquo; and reports on its implementation are provided by the EU organisations on a regular basis.</p><p>It is expected that the European External Action Service (EEAS), the European Defence Agency (EDA) and the EU Commission will brief Ministers at their informal meeting on work undertaken by those organisations to progress the Council Conclusions arising from the European Council discussions last December.  I expect reasonable progress to have been made and for further progress to be outlined to Ministers.</p></reply>

In this context, and within the available resource envelope, decisions to replace equipment and ongoing recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force will prioritise the maintenance of required operational outputs. The defence and security environment has changed significantly in the period since the publication of the last White Paper on Defence. In line with the Government&rsquo;s decision, work on the preparation of a new White Paper is currently underway. When completed and approved, it will set out a revised policy framework which will underpin Defence provision for the next decade. Accordingly, this project will remain a key priority and is central to identifying and prioritising future policy requirements, and associated operational and capability requirements. </p><p>  I will be discussing these and a range of other issues with the Secretary General of the Department of Defence and the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces in the coming weeks. Subject to my defining other priorities, work will then commence on the preparation of a new Strategy Statement, which is required in accordance with the Public Service Management Act, 1997. </p></reply>

In recent years, including 2014, funding has been provided for about 7,000 hectares of new planting.  In the years 2011 to 2013, the average annual planting level was in the region of 6,500 hectares and I would anticipate a similar outcome in 2014.  The new F orestry Programme 2015-2020 is currently being developed . The primary objectives of the new programme will be to i ncrease Ireland&rsquo;s permanent forest cover; increase and sustain the production of forest-based biomass to meet renewable energy targets; support forest holders to actively manage their plantations; and optimise the environmental and social benefits of new and existing forests. To meet these needs the following measures are being proposed:   </p><p>i)  Afforestation and Creation of Woodland</p><p>ii)  Forest Roads</p><p>iii)  Reconstitution Scheme</p><p>iv)  NeighbourWood Scheme</p><p>v)  Woodland Improvement (Thinning and Tending)</p><p>vi)  Native Woodland Conservation</p><p>vii)  Knowledge Transfer and Innovation</p><p>viii)  Producer Groups</p><p>ix)  Innovative Forest Technology</p><p>x)   Forest Genetic Reproductive Material</p><p>xi)  Forest Management Plans   </p><p>Further information on these measures is contained in the Consultation Paper published by my Department in March 2014 as part of the stakeholder consultation process.

However, there is a growing risk of land abandonment on commonages as under-grazing becomes more of a problem. Farming of commonages is a complex matter, with issues about the legal right to claim, in addition to regular disputes about the grazing of the commonages.  In the case of the treatment of commonage lands under the 2014 Direct Payment Schemes, the situation remains unchanged.

Artic les 34 to 36 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union prohibit Member States from maintaining or imposing barriers on intra-EU trade in goods. These provisions give rise to the principle of mutual recognition whereby each Member State is obliged to accept onto its market products which are legally manufactured or marketed in another Member State. Member States can only refuse to apply this principle in cases where there is an overriding public interest (e.g. public safety, public or animal health or the protection of the environment). Even then, all trade restrictive measures taken must be necessary for, and proportionate to, the protection of the public interest concerned.  My Department attaches considerable importance to the live export trade and, over the years, has been very active in facilitating both the cross border live trade and shipments abroad.<b></b>Live exports serve a dual purpose as a means of satisfying market demands for live animals and providing alternative market outlets for farmers. Total live exports to the end of June this year stand at almost 160,000 head of which almost 28,000 went to the UK, an increase of some 3,300 head or 14% up on the comparable period in 2013. Of this 28,000, some 20,200 went to Northern Ireland which is an increase of 5% on the same period in 2013.   </p><p>However, the potential to grow the live trade to the UK even further is constrained by the buying specifications operated by the British retail chains in relation to cattle born in this country and exported live for finishing and processing in that market. The retailers&rsquo; longstanding policy is to market British and Irish beef separately. This means that beef must be sourced from animals originating in one country; i.e. born, reared and slaughtered in the same country. In addition, logistical difficulties arise when a small number of Irish-born animals are slaughtered in a UK meat plant. Under mandatory EU labelling rules, these carcases have to be deboned in a separate batch, packaged and labelled accordingly, thereby incurring additional costs for the processor. These issues are a matter of commercial preference, both of slaughter plants in the UK and Northern Ireland, and of UK retailers. </p><p>While Bord Bia has repeatedly raised this issue with British retailers over the years, they are unlikely to reverse their marketing policy in the short term. The fact that the price of British beef has fallen significantly in recent times, and that the three UK retail outlets which stock Irish beef are currently under pressure to stock more British beef, is also a relevant consideration   in this regard. Nevertheless Bord Bia, in its ongoing interactions with British customers, will continue to pursue all opportunities to maximise the full potential of the beef and livestock trade with our largest trading partner. In addition Bord Bia actively supports the development of the live export trade through the provision of market information, developing market access and promotional activity.   </p><p>In addition I am engaging with Northern counterpart, Ms Michelle O&rsquo;Neill, in this regard. In so far as common market rules are concerned, however, as I have already explained, the issues relating to purchase of Irish born animals by NI slaughterhouses and the purchase of the meat from such animals by UK retail outlets are a matter of commercial procurement strategy by these operators. </p></reply>

While this report will be studied further in my Department as part of the ongoing review of the bovine TB eradication scheme, I should point out that this paper has modelled data specific to the British bovine TB eradication programme. It should also be noted that the scale of the TB problem and within-farm dynamics in the cattle industry in the UK are considerably different to the situation here. </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the comprehensive TB Eradication Programme as implemented by my Department has incorporated a badger removal policy since 2004 because TB is present both in cattle and in badgers and it is necessary to eradicate this disease in both species. Research conducted over the years by the Department and others has demonstrated that the eradication of bovine TB disease is not a practicable proposition until the issue of the reservoir of infection in badgers, which is seeding infection into the cattle population, is addressed. I should emphasise that badgers are only removed in areas where an epidemiological investigation carried out by my Department&rsquo;s Veterinary Inspectorate has found that badgers are the likely source of infection. </p><p>  My Department believes that the culling of badgers is cost effective and that it has contributed significantly to the very significant improvement in the disease situation in recent years and, in particular, since 2008, during which period the number of reactors has declined by almost 50% from around 30,000 to 15,600 last year. This is a new record low since the commencement of the eradication programme in the 1950s and, for the first time since then, eradication is now a practicable proposition. It is noteworthy that the animal prevalence of TB in Ireland in 2013 was, at 0.26%, roughly half of that in Northern Ireland where badger culling is not practised. The improvement in the TB situation has also resulted in a significant reduction in expenditure on the TB eradication scheme, which has fallen from &euro;55m in 2008 to &euro;30m in 2013. It is also noteworthy that the incidence of TB in badgers has fallen by about 50% since 2002, and this is also contributing to the reduction in the incidence of the disease in cattle.   </p><p>  In regard to badger vaccination, the ultimate objective of my Department is to incorporate badger vaccination into the Irish TB eradication programme when data is available to ensure that it can be incorporated in an optimally effective and sustainable manner. A number of field trials are ongoing in Ireland with this objective in mind, but it is anticipated that it will be a number of years before a viable oral delivery method can be put in place and, therefore, targeted badger removals will continue in the medium term. </p></reply>

In particular, the coming year will see the transition to the new Common Agricultural Policy and the rollout of the new Rural Development Programme which will deliver a vital injection of strategic investment into rural communities and provide essential supports for family farms.  The new CAP will provide the basis for delivering on the overall objectives of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.    Building on the significant progress already achieved under FH2020, I am firmly committed to delivering on the FH2020 plan and ensuring that all sectors within the agri-food sector benefit from the growth envisaged in output under the strategy. Central to this is the fundamental importance of providing a valuable market for the output of farming sector across the range of activities.   </p><p>  In this context, the ending of dairy quotas in 2015 provides a very significant opportunity for growth and expansion and managing the transition to this change in market conditions is a firm focus for me.  I am very cognisant of the challenges currently facing the beef sector and through the establishment of the beef forum and other strategic measures being considered by my Department, I am focused on ensuring that the sector will overcome the current difficulties being experienced. </p><p>  In tandem with the rollout of the CAP, the implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy is a strategic focus for me. This presents many opportunities for the seafood sector and together with the potential to add value in the processing sector, the targets set out in FH2020 for the seafood sector are eminently achievable.

The maintenance creditor may, for example, ask the court to order that maintenance be paid by way of attachment of earnings (so the maintenance due is deducted directly from income), or seek to recover sums owing through the courts as a contract debt, or utilise the enforcement mechanisms available under section 8 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1940 (as substituted by section 63 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011). In addition, where the failure to pay maintenance is as a result of unwillingness, as distinct from inability, to pay, the court has the option of holding the person in contempt of court. </p><p>  Where the maintenance debtor and creditor are in different jurisdictions, there are also provisions enabling maintenance recovery. In 2011 Ireland  implemented EU Maintenance Regulation 4/2009 which provides procedures for cross-border enforcement of maintenance obligations between EU Member States. Implementation measures are currently being prepared under the Hague Convention of 23 November 2007 on the International Recovery of Child Support and other Forms of Family Maintenance to allow for similar procedures for mutual cross-border enforcement of maintenance obligations with non-EU States which have ratified that  Convention.</p><p>  Given the range of enforcement possibilities currently existing or being provided for, and the range of options open to a court where a person liable for maintenance will not pay - up to and including imprisonment - I have no plans at present to introduce still more stringent penalties for failure to pay. Our key aim and focus is not on increasing penalties for failure to pay, but rather to ensure that where maintenance is ordered in respect of a child, that money is paid, in the best interests of the child. </p></reply>

Section 25 defines the persons who may apply for, or appear and be heard at, an application for a court order under section 24. They include the developer, the OMC, an owner of a residential unit in the development (i.e. a member of the OMC) or such other person as the court sees fit. The Court, if satisfied that a right has been infringed or an obligation has not been discharged, may make such remedial order as it deems appropriate in the circumstances with a view to ensuring the effective enforcement of the right or the effective discharge of the obligation in respect of the development concerned.</p><p>  More generally, statutory provisions governing the regulation of companies, including those concerning the memorandum and articles of association, the appointment and responsibilities of directors and requirements for submitting annual financial returns, are set out in the Companies Acts 1963 to 2013. </p><p>  The Office of the Director of Company Enforcement (ODCE) has published the 'Company Law Handbook on Residential Property Owners' Management Companies' which contains valuable information and practical guidance for OMCs, including chapters on specific company law topics such as the responsibilities of directors, accounting records and the filing of annual financial returns. In addition, the ODCE has published 'A Property Owner's Guide to Company Law' which is aimed at the owners and residents of apartments in multi-unit developments and explains how company law is relevant to them.

Demand in 2013 was at the same level as it was in 2012 and while there was a 10% drop in demand at the general law centres in 2012 compared to 2011, nevertheless the demand for general legal services (excluding asylum) in 2011 was 93% greater than it was in 2006. In recognition of this, the Board has not been subject to the level of cuts  that other public service bodies have had to experience and my predecessor was able to maintain the Board&rsquo;s allowance at the same level for 2014 as it was in the previous three years.  Nevertheless it is a challenging environment that has resulted in recent years in growing waiting times for those seeking legal services for most matters.  The Board prioritises certain categories of case, most notably cases involving children at risk of going into State (Child and Family Agency) care and cases involving international child abduction.  In 2013 approximately 17% of the Board&rsquo;s first appointments with clients involved cases that had been prioritised.  It is difficult for the Board to add additional categories of cases for prioritisation without such an approach impacting on the meaningful ability to prioritise the case types that I have just mentioned.</p><p>In September 2013 my predecessor signed into law by way of Regulations, a package of proposals from the Board for the revision of the financial eligibility and contributions provisions governing the granting of civil legal aid including a reduction in the capital eligibility threshold for legal services and increases in the contributions payable by most persons seeking legal services. These provisions should have some impact, on the resources available to the Board.  I can inform the Deputy that, in response to the changed environment the Board has taken steps to try and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of its legal services. Those steps include the following:</p><p>- A  &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach to service delivery is being piloted, the aim of which is that every applicant gets to see a solicitor within a period of one month for the purpose of getting legal advice. If the applicant requires further services they remain on the &lsquo;waiting list&rsquo;;</p><p>- In August 2012 the Board introduced a new case management system in its law centres which will deliver efficiencies in terms of administration as well as to the delivery of legal services. It will take time for the full benefits of this system to materialise;</p><p>- In November 2011  responsibility for the management and administration of the State funded Family Mediation Service was transferred to the Board. A key reason for this transfer was to improve the synergies between the family mediation services and the State funded civil legal aid services (most of the demand for legal services is in the area of family law);</p><p>- The Board has maintained a high level of usage of private solicitors for family law cases in the District Court;</p><p>- The Board continues to engage with other key players in the justice / legal area such as the Courts Service and the Child and Family Agency, with a view to trying to ensure that State funded resources that impact on its area of business are used to best effect.</p><p>Details concerning waiting times and case types, provided by the Legal Aid Board, are set out in the attached appendices.  Waiting times for legal services as of the 1 July 2014 are set out on a law centre by law centre basis in Appendix I.  Most of the Legal Aid Board&rsquo;s law centres operate a &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach which involves giving an applicant a short consultation (45 minutes) for legal advice.  Those persons remain on the Board&rsquo;s waiting list if they require further legal services.  It is not practical to give &lsquo;averages&rsquo; as the waiting times fluctuate at each law centre depending on a variety of issues including current court commitments, staff numbers and staff availability.  In terms of the case types that are awaiting a service, attached at Appendix II is a breakdown of the case types in respect of persons who have yet to see a solicitor while the breakdown at Appendix III relates to case types in respect of persons who have had a &lsquo;triage&rsquo; appointment with a solicitor but are awaiting further services.</p><p><b>Appendix I</b></p><p><b>Waiting times &ndash; 1 July 2014</b></p><p><b>Waiting times are given in weeks</b><table><tr><th><b>Law Centre</b></th><th><b>Part-Time Centre</b></th><th><b>Waiting time for a first consultation</b></th><th><div><b>Further waiting time for a second consultation</b><br /><br /><b>(centres operating triage)</b></div></th></tr><tr><td></td><td>Athlone</td><td><div>21</div></td><td><div>22</div></td></tr><tr><td>Athlone</td><td>Mullingar</td><td><div>24</div></td><td><div>20</div></td></tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown</td><td>- </td><td><div>33</div></td><td><div>n/a</div></td></tr><tr><td>Castlebar</td><td>- </td><td><div>30</div></td><td><div>34</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>- </td><td><div>16</div></td><td><div>13</div></td></tr><tr><td>Clondalkin</td><td>- </td><td><div>12</div></td><td><div>19</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork North</td><td>- </td><td><div>47</div></td><td><div>15</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork South</td><td>- </td><td><div>56</div></td><td><div>37</div></td></tr><tr><td>Dundalk</td><td>- </td><td><div>6</div></td><td><div>n/a</div></td></tr><tr><td>Ennis</td><td>- </td><td><div>19</div></td><td><div>33</div></td></tr><tr><td>Finglas</td><td>- </td><td><div>8</div></td><td><div>21</div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway Francis St</td><td>- </td><td><div>23</div></td><td><div>70</div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway Seville House</td><td>- </td><td><div>16</div></td><td><div>19</div></td></tr><tr><td>Gardiner Street</td><td>- </td><td><div>6</div></td><td><div>44</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>- Carlow</td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>46</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>- Kilkenny</td><td><div>6</div></td><td><div>45</div></td></tr><tr><td>Letterkenny</td><td>- </td><td><div>12</div></td><td><div>49</div></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>- </td><td><div>43</div></td><td><div>n/a</div></td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>- </td><td><div>24</div></td><td><div>27</div></td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>Drogheda</td><td><div>14</div></td><td><div>n/a</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Monaghan</td><td><div>12</div></td><td><div>n/a</div></td></tr><tr><td>Montague Court</td><td>- </td><td><div>29</div></td><td><div>n/a</div></td></tr><tr><td>Navan</td><td>- </td><td><div>16</div></td><td><div>22</div></td></tr><tr><td>Nenagh</td><td>- </td><td><div>6</div></td><td><div>33</div></td></tr><tr><td>Newbridge</td><td>- </td><td><div>24</div></td><td><div>46</div></td></tr><tr><td>Personal Injuries Unit</td><td></td><td><div>n/a</div></td><td><div>n/a</div></td></tr><tr><td>Portlaoise</td><td>- </td><td><div>15</div></td><td><div>40</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Boyle</td><td><div>5</div></td><td><div>24</div></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>Sligo</td><td><div>5</div></td><td><div>25</div></td></tr><tr><td>Smithfield</td><td>- </td><td><div>37</div></td><td><div>14</div></td></tr><tr><td>Tallaght</td><td>- </td><td><div>35</div></td><td><div>40</div></td></tr><tr><td>Tralee</td><td>- </td><td><div>34</div></td><td><div>n/a</div></td></tr><tr><td>Tullamore</td><td>- </td><td><div>22</div></td><td><div>n/a</div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>- </td><td><div>33</div></td><td><div>n/a</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>- </td><td><div>40</div></td><td><div>23</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>- </td><td><div>24</div></td><td><div>n/a</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

While the volume of cases processed by ISI up until now falls short of expectations, the caseload continues to increase month on month, as debtors become familiar with the solutions available to them.  To date, almost 1000 applications have been made to the ISI and almost 200 cases have already reached a successful conclusion.  There have been 164 bankruptcies so far this year.  Up to 61% of residual debt has been written off in some cases involving secured debt and over 80% of debt was written off in cases of unsecured debt. So far this year, the ISI is dealing with over &euro;0.5 billion of debt, and  it expects the increase in cases to continue over the coming months.  The ISI has now published a Debt Settlement Arrangement Protocol which it developed in conjunction with the key stakeholders and which is expected to result in the faster development of proposals, faster acceptance by creditors and higher acceptance rates by creditors, as happened in England and Wales when a similar Protocol was introduced there some years ago.  The ISI is currently working on developing a similar Protocol for the Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA), which it hopes will be agreed later this year and again, this should facilitate a more efficient and streamlined process.  In addition, I understand that the ISI will be launching an information campaign later this year in an effort to reach out to those struggling with debt and make it clear to them that there is a solution for everyone.  I will continue together with the ISI to keep its effectiveness under careful ongoing review and to address any issues that are required to be addressed.</p></reply>

Legislative provisions relating to the regulation of money lending are provided for in the Consumer Credit Act 1995, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Under the 1995 Act, unlicensed money lending is an offence.  Persons who engage in money lending and who do not hold the necessary licence granted by the Central Bank are committing an offence under section 98 of the Act.  A person who is guilty of an offence under the Act is liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, or on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &euro;100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.  There are also a number of provisions in the criminal law which may be of relevance in particular circumstances, for example, sections 10 and 11 of the Non-fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 and section 17 the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 provide for offences relating to harassment, extortion and demanding money with menaces.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the investigative agency responsible for the investigation of allegations of unlicensed money lending.  These investigations are conducted at a local level. The Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation can and does assist in such investigations, as requested.</p><p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that prior to May 2013 there was no specific Pulse incident category available to capture investigations into unlicensed money lending but I am informed that the Pulse system has now been subsequently enhanced to reflect a new incident type to record such offences.  I am further informed that details on any conviction related to illegal moneylending activity prior to this date would require a manual analysis of the Garda Pulse system which would require a disproportionate expenditure of Garda resources.  I am also advised that since May 2013 there have been no prosecutions for illegal moneylending activities but An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has indicated that there are three investigations into illegal moneylending activities currently underway.  Two investigations are still ongoing and in relation to the third investigation, a file has been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions seeking directions to charge.  I would, of course,  also encourage those who may have information concerning the operation of unlicensed money lenders in particular circumstances to make that information available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who will take all measures open to them to enforce the law in this area.</p><p>  Under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service and the Minister has no role in the matter.  Section 4(3) of the 1998 Act provides that the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions, which includes the provision of statistics.  The Courts Service has indicated that it is not in a position to provide statistics relating to convictions on illegal moneylending activity. I have asked the Courts Service to review the position in that regard.</p></reply>

Where the child's mother is in agreement, she and the father can jointly make a statutory declaration (referred to in section 2(4) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, as amended by the Children Act 1997) appointing him as a guardian of the child.  If the child's mother is not in agreement, the father can apply to court for appointment as a guardian under section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act, as inserted by the Status of Children Act 1987.  Notably, in the vast majority of applications determined by the courts, the father is appointed a guardian.</p><p>  The General Scheme of the Children and Family Relationships Bill also includes additional provisions under which many non-marital fathers would become guardians of their children on an automatic basis.  This will be determined on the basis of living together with the child's mother.

Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) has administered the Internationalisation Register on behalf of the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Education and Skills. The Internationalisation Register is publicly available and may be viewed at .  The Internationalisation Register is the register of education courses which comply with minimum standards relating to alignment, accreditation and, in the case of language courses, minimum learning hours for students.  It is used by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) as a reference for considering visa and residency applications from non- EEA applicants wishing to study in Ireland on a full-time basis. The Department of Education and Skills and QQI have advisory roles in identifying appropriate criteria for the inclusion of programmes in the register as well as assessing whether academic courses that apply for admission to the register fit the minimum standards.</p><p>INIS administers the immigration regime for non-EEA national students attending education courses in Ireland.  INIS performs this function to support the objectives of the Government for developing international education as outlined in the Minister for Education and Skill&rsquo;s document <i>Investing in Global Relationships: Ireland&rsquo;s International Education Strategy</i>.  The function of INIS in relation to colleges that recruit non-EEA national students is to ensure that they comply with the immigration conditions outlined in <i>Guidelines for Colleges offering courses to Full Time Non-EEA Students</i>(available since August 2011 and published on the INIS webpage ).  These immigration conditions include full compliance with inspections carried out by the relevant authorities i.e.Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) inspections, INIS inspections and inspections carried out by the relevant educational authorities.</p><p>I would advise the Deputy that the regulatory approach has, thus far, been one that has favoured competition and has minimised the barriers to entry.  The assumption has been that providers are reputable unless demonstrated to be otherwise and no track record as an educator has been required.  While this approach facilitates competition, it is a major contributory factor to the recent problems in the international education sector caused by the behaviour of some private sector colleges.  My officials, and their counterparts in the Department of Education and Skills, have had concerns on the effectiveness of certain aspects of the current regime for some time.  The introduction of the International Education Mark (IEM), as provided for in the Qualifications &amp;amp; Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012, was intended as the vehicle to address many of these issues.  In advance of the introduction of the IEM the Government is considering additional proposals that will provide for a comprehensive amendment of the regulatory framework and, in conjunction with the IEM, will further enhance our quality agenda.</p></reply>

Implementation of this programme will be a key priority for the remainder of my term in office, including the establishment of a new Independent Garda Authority;  the opening-up of Future appointments to the position of Garda Commissioner; the enactment of new legislation to reform, strengthen and clarify the remit and operation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, so as to ensure it is fit for purpose and to further ensure that the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as the wider public, can have the fullest confidence in its workings.</p><p>In addition, I expect to receive substantial reports from the Garda Inspectorate on the investigation of serious crime and a report on the review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na conducted on foot of the Haddington Road Agreement. I will consider the implementation of any necessary measures or reforms recommended in these reports.</p><p>The White Paper on Crime, incorporating a National Anti Crime Strategy, will also be finalised in the context of the reform programme and will provide an overall framework for strategies to combat and prevent crime.  My Department's focus with regard to crime and security centres on combatting crime in all its manifestations and dealing with the threat posed by terrorist groups who refuse to accept the principles of a free and democratic society.  In this context,<b></b>I am further committed to supporting the ongoing recruitment and training of new members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to the ongoing provision of new Garda vehicles and to supporting measures and reforms to enhance the efficiencies of Garda working, including, for example, the recently-announced measure to improve the Garda's capacity for computer crime investigation.   In addition, I will be introducing the necessary measures to implement the EU Directive on victims of crime.</p><p>In line with the Statement of Government Priorities 2014 &ndash; 2016, in the area of asylum seekers I will be bringing forward legislation to reduce the length of time the applicant spends in the system through the establishment of a single applications procedure. This will be achieved by the introduction of a Protection Bill.</p><p>Moreover, work on Immigration and Residence Bill will also continue. The commitment in the Statement of Priorities in respect of Direct Provision for asylum seekers will also be acted upon during the remainder of the term of office of the government.</p><p>In line with the Statement of Government Priorities 2014 &ndash; 2016, I am also committed to bringing forward a referendum on marriage equality in 2015.  I am currently working to complete the establishment of the Court of Appeal, the legislation for which completed it's passage through the Oireachtas yesterday.  I am committed to the establishment of a new system for Legal Services regulation, the legislation for which is currently going through the Oireachtas.  I intend to progress a substantial legislative programme, with a view to enacting key elements of legislation including, but not limited to, the Children and Family Relationships Bill, Judicial Council Bill,  Criminal Justice (Sexual Offences) Bill, Bail Bill, Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Bill, Mediation Bill and Sale of Alcohol Bill. I am also committed to the enactment of legislation to give effect to those recommendations of Judge Quirke in relation to support for women were admitted to and worked in a Magdalen Laundry which requires a statutory basis.</p><p>I am committed to reviewing the legislation in place pertaining to domestic violence, with a view to expediting Ireland&rsquo;s signing an ratification of the Istanbul Convention.

Where sections 6A and 6B of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, are applicable, a child born in the island of Ireland on or after 1 January 2005 has an entitlement to Irish citizenship if, at the time of the birth of the child, one of his or her parents had, during the period of 4 years immediately preceding the person's birth, been resident in the island of Ireland for a period of not less than 3 years or periods the aggregate of which is not less than 3 years. Periods of unlawful residence, periods of residence which were for the sole purpose of having an application for refugee status determined or periods of residence where permission was granted for the purposes of study are excluded from the determination of periods of reckonable residence. Entitlement of a child to Irish citizenship is determined by the Passport Office following receipt of an application for a passport on the child's behalf.Where a child born in the State did not at birth have an entitlement to Irish citizenship, the parent or guardian or person who is in loco parentis to the child may lodge an application for naturalisation on behalf of the child if and when the conditions for naturalisation are satisfied.</p><p>With regard to the residency situation of the children, the general position is that permission to remain in the State in respect of children under the age of 16 is granted in line with that granted to their parents.

In order to update their situation, the parents may write to the INIS c/o PO Box 10003, Dublin 1, on behalf of the children and provide documentation, preferably to include original birth certificates, original passports, two passport size photos (signed on the back) and attendance letter from schools to prove continuous residency in the State. Upon receipt of the appropriate documentation, the cases of the children will be examined by the relevant officials in the INIS and a decision communicated to them in due course.</p><p>Queries in relation to the Status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited<font color="#000080">.</font></p></reply>

These provisions deal with Realistic Imitation Firearms (RIFs) which includes airsoft guns with a muzzle energy less than or equal to one joule which are capable of firing small beads or pellets.  (Airsoft guns of over one joule in muzzle energy are firearms and need to be licensed by an owner the same way as a normal handgun, shotgun or rifle.) Possession of a RIF in any public place, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, is an offence.  There is also provision for the control of the use of RIFs, by restricting their possession and use to specified locations, such as airsoft venues, authorised by the local Garda Superintendent.</p><p>  A number of subsections within Section 40 have yet to be commenced.  To do so requires the establishment of a Register of Dealers in RIFs.  One such provision will make it an offence for a person to sell a RIF to a person under the age of 16 years. Work on this matter is in progress. A joint Departmental/ Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Review into firearms licensing is also nearing completion. I expect to receive a report arising from this Review shortly.</p></reply>

This relates to the implementation of an FSPB-commissioned pay and grading review in 2008 which recommended the upgrading of five FSPB positions. FSPB did not seek ministerial sanction from its sponsor Departments (Department of Health and Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety) prior to commissioning this review. </p><p>  Under the British-Irish Act, FSPB requires the approval of the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) comprising in this context the Minister for Health and the Minister for Health Social Services and Public Safety, and of the Finance Ministers in determining the remuneration of its staff. </p><p>  Implementation of the recommendations of the review, and therefore of the Labour Court recommendation, must be agreed by both jurisdictions before it can be approved by the NSMC. Notwithstanding the above, my Department can agree to the Labour Court recommendations. However, the implementation of the recommendations of the review would also require the agreement of both Minister Poots and the Minister of Finance and Personnel in Northern Ireland and Minister Poots has not sanctioned the implementation of the recommendations of the review.</p></reply>

The HSE has no access to data held by Biogen Idec in relation to this programme.</p><p>The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drug schemes in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. </p><p>Fampridine was never available to multiple sclerosis patients under the Long Term Illness (LTI) Scheme, however, the HSE received an application for the inclusion of Fampridine in the GMS and community drugs schemes.  The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association for the assessment of new medicines. </p><p>  In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product.  The report is available on the NCPE's website ().  The NCPE report is an important input to assist the HSE in its decision making process and informs further discussions between the HSE and the manufacturer of the drug.</p><p>  The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable.  In these circumstances, the HSE has not approved the reimbursement of Fampridine under the GMS or other community drug schemes. </p><p>However, I am aware that studies are ongoing to assess the wider impact of Fampridine on both walking and quality of life for persons diagnosed with MS.  The results of these studies will contribute to the evidence base demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of the product which can be used to support future applications for its inclusion on the lists of reimbursable items supplied under the GMS and other community drugs scheme.</p><p>The HSE met with Biogen Idec recently to discuss a potential revised application.  The HSE expects that Biogen Idec will submit a revised application.  The HSE will then re-consider the application in as timely a fashion as possible in line with the agreed procedures and timescales for the assessment of new medicines.</p></reply>

The programme will be delivered by senior psychiatric nurses at Clinical Nurse Specialist (CNS) grade working as part of consultant psychiatrist led Liaison Psychiatry Teams in acute hospitals.  The role will include the assessment and most importantly the follow up of people seen in EDs.  This might include phone contact, outpatient review by the nurse and/or linking in with other appropriate services with active follow up to try to ensure the person avails of the help being offered.  The overall aim is to reduce the likelihood of a repeat deliberate self harm attempt as it is well recognised that completed suicide is more likely to occur in those who repeat. </p><p>  An additional 37 WTE CNS posts were approved in 2013 for Emergency Departments with the highest number of presentations of self harm and these posts will support the roll-out of the Self-Harm Clinical Programme.  This is a new clinical development and it is necessary to build up a level of expertise in this area.  A decision on whether further posts are needed will be made when the programme is fully implemented.  </p><p>   In relation to the location of these posts, as this is a service matter I have referred the question to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

A key component is the improved management of people with asthma in primary care, thereby avoiding emergency attendance at General Practitioner  (GP) out-of-hours services, emergency departments and in-patient services. Implementation of the programme is ongoing and will continue in 2015.</p><p>  The National Model of Care for Asthma in general practice has been agreed by the HSE's Clinical Programmes, the Asthma Society and the ICGP.  As the Deputy will be aware, implementation of this model in general practice involves consultation on the GP contract with representative bodies.</p><p>  A Framework Agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) has recently been signed, which allows progress on these issues, initially in the context of the provision of GP care free at the point of access for children under 6 years.  It has been agreed that the discussions with the IMO which are now underway should also work towards agreement on a new GMS GP contractual framework. </p></reply>

In line with Government Decision S180/20/10/1424 of 2011, relating to the advertising for expressions of interest in vacancies on State Boards, my Department currently advertises for board vacancies as they arise, where I, as Minister for Health, have nominating rights under relevant legislation. I also appoint members on the nomination of various bodies, again in accordance with the relevant legislation.</p><p>There were some exceptions to the advertising process in 2012 and 2013.  In 2012, the members of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal were appointed, on the advice of the Attorney General, as these members carry out a very specific role in relation to assessing the quantum of awards under the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act.    Another exception was in the case of some hospital boards, e.g. Beaumont and St James&rsquo;s, where the term of existing members was extended as a prudent provisional measure, to allow time for appropriate competencies required in members of these boards to be set out, given the Health Reform Programme and its impact on hospital configuration.  Appointments of the new board members were subsequently advertised.  </p><p>In 2012 existing board members of the National Paediatric Hospital Board were re-appointed for a 3 month period to allow time to consider the competencies required by board members into the future.  In January 2013 four Departmental officials and two HSE nominated officials were appointed for a number of months for the same reason.  In July 2013,  the Chairperson and 3 other members for which the Minister had nominating rights were also appointed.  </p><p>The table below sets out the number of appointments to State Boards under the remit of the Department, where the Minister had nominating rights, and on the nomination of other bodies since March 2011 to 2014 (to date), including the number that were publicly advertised and the number of appointments drawn directly from the advertising process. It should be noted that there were no advertising campaigns in 2011, but 34 appointments were made where the Minister had nominating rights.<table><tr><th>Number of Appointments 2011 - 2014 (to date)</th><th>484</th></tr><tr><td>Appointments made where Minister had nominating rights</td><td>331</td></tr><tr><td>Number of Positions Advertised</td><td>272</td></tr><tr><td>Appointments made drawn directly from the public advertisement process</td><td>116</td></tr><tr><td>Appointments made where Minister did not have nominating rights</td><td>153</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The system, which includes two databases, allows the Department to record and actively track the title and whereabouts of all files of the Department.   These include records transferred to it from the Department of Local Government and Public Health on the establishment of the Department of Health in 1947. Other records relating to the functional areas of the health service would have transferred from local authorities to the health boards in 1971 and subsequently to the Health Service Executive in 2005. </p><p>  The Department's CRAFTS Active database contains all files that are currently in use and held in the relevant section within my Department, while the Inactive and National Archives database lists all other files, including departmental files stored in a secure off site facility or in the National Archives.  Department files that have been transferred to the National Archives cease to be part of the holdings of the Department although they can be recalled on a temporary basis on request.  The Inactive and National Archives database has a listing of over 230,000 files, 18,000 of which are deposited in the National Archives.  </p><p>  The AIRR (Access to Institutional and Related Records) Project began in 2004. Its purpose was to examine the Department&rsquo;s child care files, find any references to the names of children who were in care and to create an index containing those names.  The purpose of the index was to facilitate efficient and thorough searches and retrieval of records on behalf of individuals seeking their own personal information in the context of Freedom of Information legislation, Court Orders of Discovery and applications to the Residential Institutions Redress Board. </p><p>  The Project involved the indexing of all papers held by the Department relating to child care services, some of which contain information referring to individual children who were in care.  The personal information references have been indexed onto a specialised &lsquo;names index&rsquo; along with other relevant information.  </p><p>  The Inter-Departmental Committee to establish the facts of State Involvement with the Magdalen Laundries considered the routes of entry to the Magdalen Laundries, including from Mother and Baby Homes, and my Department and the HSE conducted searches of retained records for any relevant information. All relevant information and records discovered in this context were passed in full to the Inter-Departmental Committee's Secretariat.  </p><p>  Government recently agreed to establish a Commission of Investigation to investigate mother and baby homes.  Yesterday, my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, published the report of the Inter-Departmental Group on Mother and Baby Homes, which was established in early June, to assist the Government in scoping the necessary examination of this important issue.  Submissions on the terms of reference for the Commission from over 120 groups and individuals have also been received by that Department and a number of meetings have been held with groups.  Collectively, these inputs and consultations will assist the Government in finalising proposals for the Commission&rsquo;s establishment.  Any further detailed searches of the extensive records throughout the period referred to by the Deputy will be guided by the Commission.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable. It is estimated that in up to 5% of cases it is necessary to wait for further growth to take place before treatment commences.  Patients are assessed by the HSE Orthodontic Service under the modified Index of Treatment Need. Patients with the greatest level of need are provided with treatment by the HSE. Information on waiting times is collated by the HSE by region and for the intervals as shown below. Cork City and County are part of the HSE South region. The most recent information relates to the first quarter of 2014.</p><p><b>HSE South</b><table><tr><th>Waiting time from referral to assessment </th><th>1 - 6 months</th><th>7 - 12 months </th><th>13 - 24 months</th><th>&amp;gt;2 years</th><th>Total </th></tr><tr><td>No. of Patients </td><td>1,422</td><td>566</td><td>121</td><td>58</td><td>2,167</td></tr></table><table><tr><th>Waiting time from assessment to commencement of treatment </th><th>1 - 6 months</th><th>7 - 12 months </th><th>13 - 24 months</th><th>2 - 3 years</th><th>Over 4 years</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>No. of Patients </td><td>567</td><td>410</td><td>835</td><td>1,501</td><td>24</td><td>3,337</td></tr></table></p><p>The HSE is aware of the need to address orthodontic waiting times and commissioned an independent national review of orthodontic services to give guidance as to what changes will be desirable.  The review has now been completed. The key issue highlighted by the review, which has assessed services nationally, is that the Orthodontic Service should be fully integrated within the Primary Care Service. This is under consideration by the HSE to be implemented as part of the HSE's reform programme. In addition, an initiative to reduce waiting times through the provision of additional services is currently being explored by the HSE. </p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, the tobacco industry has argued that standardised or plain packs would be easier to forge and would lead to growth in illicit trade of tobacco products.  However, the Revenue Commissioners have advised me that they are satisfied that the standardised packaging legislation will not have a significant impact on their work in relation to illicit trade in tobacco products. The Revenue Commissioners have advised that the tax stamp is a key means for them to distinguish between legal and illegal products, irrespective of the way in which the cigarettes are packaged. Tax stamps will remain a fixture on tobacco products following the introduction of standardised packaging, and contain all features possible to minimise the risk of counterfeiting. </p><p>  Combating the illegal tobacco trade is, and will continue to be, a high priority for the Revenue Commissioners. They have extensive cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating the illicit trade, and in addition, cooperation takes place with other revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud office, OLAF, in the ongoing programmes at international level to tackle the illicit trade.</p><p>  Research carried out by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, in conjunction with the HSE National Tobacco Control Office, indicates that contraband represents the majority of illicit cigarettes. Figures from 2013 indicate that the proportion of smokers classified as having an illegal pack was 12%, representing a decrease of 4% since 2009. These findings indicate that the level of consumption of illicit product is being contained, although Revenue remains determined to confront the illegal trade in tobacco products, to optimise levels of seizures of illicit tobacco product and to pursue those found to be involved in this illegal activity.  The research estimates that the consumption of illegal cigarettes represented a loss to Revenue of approximately &euro;212 million in excise duties and VAT in 2013; a decrease from the estimated figure of &euro;249 million in 2010. </p><p>  The 2014 EU Tobacco Products Directive sets out further measures to be adopted by Member States in order to tackle illicit trade; in particular, it includes provisions relating to traceability and security features of tobacco products. Tobacco products will be marked with a unique identifier and security features.  This will allow for their movements to be recorded and for such products to be tracked and traced throughout the EU.  This will also facilitate the verification of whether or not tobacco products are authentic.</p><p>Following Government approval, Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations signed the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products, adopted by the Parties to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), in New York on 20 December 2013. The new international treaty is aimed at combating illegal trade in tobacco products through control of the supply chain and international cooperation.  As a key measure, Parties commit to establishing a global tracking and tracing system to reduce and eventually eradicate illicit trade.</p><p>  In view of the above, it is anticipated that illicit trade of tobacco will not increase as a result of the introduction of standardised packaging.</p></reply>

The HPO may provide statistics on hospital activity to third parties.  Such information is of an aggregate statistical nature which means that patients cannot be identified.  More detailed information is provided to bodies including the National Cancer Registry, the Health Research Board as well as researchers in universities.  However, I have been assured by the HPO that in providing any such data, patients&rsquo; identities are removed from the information given.  The issue of consent does not arise in the transfer of the data because all information is anonymised.  The HPO does not apply a charge for the provision of information.</p><p>  It is important to note that the HPO has implemented measures to ensure the confidentiality of hospital patient data.  In order to safeguard patient privacy and ensure that no patients can be personally identified, the HPO collects only a reduced range of information about patients at the national level.  This means that the HPO does not collect patient names, addresses or full dates of birth.  The HPO has advised me that the relevant section of the ESRI (the functions of which have since been subsumed into the HPO) met with the Data Protection Commissioner in 2010.  Following on from that engagement the ESRI changed its data collection methodology to improve its data protection procedures.  I have been advised by the HPO that it is compliant with the advice given to it by the Office of the Data Commissioner regarding its procedures governing data.</p><p>  In conclusion, I have been advised by the HPO that it is acutely aware of its responsibilities in relation to patient privacy and is fully respectful of the rights of patients in this regard.  My Department does not hold the detailed information sought by the Deputy.  For this reason, I have requested that the HSE respond directly to the Deputy on this matter.</p></reply>

In order to mitigate the impact on front line services of the reduction in employment numbers, the priority is to reform how health services are delivered in order to ensure a more productive and cost effective health system.  The revised working arrangements provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement are a pivotal element in this regard.  Subject to approval by senior managers, arrangements are in place in the HSE to allow the recruitment of staff where it has been established that there is an urgent service requirement.  In addition, the HSE continues to fill a significant number of development posts in line with service priorities identified by Government.</p><p>  On the specific issue of therapy services for children with a disability the Health Service Executive is currently engaged in a reconfiguration of existing therapy resources to multi-disciplinary geographic based teams for children as part of its National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years) so that there is a clear pathway to services for all children, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability. The Programme has been identified as a service priority and an additional &euro;4m ongoing funding has been allocated under the HSE National Service Plan to drive its implementation. The HSE has decided on the allocation of an additional 80 therapy posts nationally, which includes four therapy posts to support the reorganisation of services in Kerry.  My Department has asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to the issue of recruitment.</p></reply>

Under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2009, an 8% reduction in a range of fees and allowances payable to GPs was introduced in 2009, which effected full year savings in the region of &euro;34 million.  Further reductions to a range of GP fees and allowances were introduced in 2010, which effected full year savings in the region of &euro;44 million.  This equated to an approximate additional reduction of 9%.</p><p>  In 2013 the Minister for Health decided to apply further reductions to the fees and allowances payable to GPs.  This equated to an overall reduction of 7.5%, amounting to a saving of some &euro;38 million in a full year. The current rates of payment are set out in the following regulations:</p><p> S.I. 277/2013 - Health Professionals (Reduction of Payments to General Practitioners) Regulations 2013; </p><p> S.I. 278/2013 - Health Professionals (Reduction of Payments to General Practitioners) (National Immunisation Programmes) Regulations 2013, both of which came into effect on 24 July 2013.</p><p>  Under the FEMPI legislation, the Minister for Health is required to carry out a review of the operation, effectiveness and impact of the amounts and rates fixed under the regulations each year.  A review took place in June and it was decided that the reduced fees provided for in the FEMPI regulations should be maintained in place. The regulations will be reviewed again in 2015 and a decision will be taken at that time regarding maintaining, restoring or further reducing fees.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.  The conditions covered by the LTI Scheme are as follows: Acute Leukaemia; Mental handicap; Cerebral Palsy; Mental Illness (in a person under 16); Cystic Fibrosis; Multiple Sclerosis; Diabetes Insipidus; Muscular Dystrophies; Diabetes Mellitus; Parkinsonism; Epilepsy; Phenylketonuria; Haemophilia; Spina Bifida; Hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p><p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive (HSE), unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.</p><p>  The Government has decided to develop a new policy framework providing for eligibility for  a range of appropriate health services to take account of medical conditions. The HSE has established an Expert Panel to examine the range of conditions and services that should be considered as part of this process. A public consultation has also been undertaken to seek the views of the public, including patients, patient representative groups and professional bodies. The submissions received will inform the work of the Expert Panel.  The panel has been asked to report to the Director General of the Health Service by September 2014.</p></reply>

Consultants working in full-time private practice and those with B* contracts which permit off-site practice must obtain indemnity cover from medical defence organisations.   One of the medical defence organisations, the Medical Protection Society (MPS), which indemnifies the majority of consultants concerned,  increased its membership subscription rates in Ireland  from the beginning of July, 2014, by an average of 42%.  The consultants must purchase their professional medical indemnity up to agreed financial limits or 'caps'. Professional medical indemnity is provided by the medical defence organisations. In the event that a claim for an adverse medical event against a consultant exceeds these caps, the excess is covered by the State's Clinical Indemnity Scheme.</p><p>  Following a detailed assessment, Government agreed to extend the caps arrangements in 2013 for a period of five years. The Government also decided in July 2013 to adjust the cap annually in line with the Consumer Price Index. It is important to note that without the caps, indemnity subscription rates for consultants in private practice would have increased to a far greater extent than they have.  The caps rates since 1 July, 2014 are:</p><p>  - consultant obstetricians, neurosurgeons, and orthopaedic surgeons undertaking spinal surgery -  &euro;590,425 per claim as well as an annual aggregate limit of &euro;1,771,275 per consultant;</p><p>  - for all other specialties the limit is &euro;1,180,850 per claim with no aggregate limit;</p><p>  Officials in my Department have met representatives of the Medical Protection Society and also the Irish Hospital Consultants Association about this issue.  The State Claims Agency commissioned an actuarial assessment of any proposed decrease in the caps rates, which, while of benefit to private consultants, would incur more costs for the State and this issue is being examined by my Department in conjunction with the State Claims Agency.  At a time of huge financial pressure on the public health system any change to the caps arrangement must be carefully considered and a Government decision would be needed to effect such a change.</p></reply>

In November 2012 the Government announced its decision that the new children&rsquo;s hospital will be co-located with St James&rsquo;s on its campus, ensuring it benefits from the broadest possible range of adult sub-specialty expertise and research capability. The intention is ultimately to tri-locate adult, paediatric and maternity services on the campus. Satellite centres, which will share governance and staffing with the new children's hospital, will be built on the campuses of Tallaght and Connolly Hospitals.   </p><p>  The Government's decision was based on the over-riding priority of best clinical outcomes for our children. Tri-location of adult, paediatric and maternity services brings benefits for children, adolescents, newborns and mothers. In all cases, the benefits of tri-location are maximised where the adult hospital provides the broadest possible range of clinical sub-specialties and expertise, readily accessible for paediatric and maternity patients on the shared campus. In addition, tri-location that delivers the most significant depth and breadth of clinical and academic research on site will enhance the potential of research to drive best clinical outcomes. St James's Hospital is considered the best adult co-location partner for the new children's hospital, having broadest range of national specialties of all acute adult hospitals, as well as strong and well established research and education infrastructure.</p><p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is the body responsible for planning, designing, building and equipping the hospital and has been actively progressing the project on the new site. The Project Brief for the hospital on the St James's campus has been agreed, a decant strategy for the site is in place and is actively being progressed, and a preferred design team has been selected and is expected to be appointed shortly. Design development will then begin with the aim of making a planning submission in February 2015. Transition of services is scheduled to commence at the end of 2018. </p><p>  In order to establish the required number of car-parking spaces for the new children's hospital, a multi-factored approach was adopted, including a benchmarking exercise against existing children&rsquo;s hospitals. This multi-factored approach resulted in a proposal for 1,000 carparking spaces. The figure will be validated following appointment of the Design Team. </p></reply>

The projects mentioned are among these.  However as the Deputy will appreciate, I must prioritise the maintenance and upkeep of existing infrastructure.    I understand from the NRA that the Ballyvourney to Macroom scheme, which has been approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and where land is being acquired, is suitable for consideration as a PPP in the future and could be included in a project bundle.</p><p>  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Government&rsquo;s Comprehensive Review of Expenditure 2015-2017 and Capital Review 2015-2019 have commenced.  The Current and Capital Reviews will consider new ways of achieving Government objectives in the current tight fiscal climate. I cannot say at this point what the outcome of the Comprehensive Review and of the Capital Review process will be. The scope for progressing projects such as this will be dependent on the availability of funding.</p></reply>

We will abolish the &euro;3 travel tax subject to a deal being agreed with Ryanair and Aer Lingus to re-open closed routes and bring more tourists into Ireland. If no deal can be done, there will be no reduction in the tax. </td><td>In Budget 2014 the Government announced the introduction of a zero rate travel tax initiative as part of a process aimed at generating new airline routes into Ireland and this came into effect from 1 April 2014.  <br /><br />There has been a positive response to the initiative from airlines the introduction of new routes and increased capacity on existing services from Dublin, Shannon, Cork and Knock. A total of 23 new services have been announced commencing in 2014 along with additional capacity on 21 existing routes from the four main airports.</td></tr><tr><td>We will work with the Aviation Regulator to cut airport charges in order to deliver increased routes, airlines and passenger numbers.  <br /><br /></td><td>There were over 24.8m passengers through Irish airports in 2013 up 4%. Dublin Airport had its third successive year of growth of passenger numbers led by a record-breaking performance on transatlantic traffic.  As a result of this strong growth, a &euro;5.6 million rebate in airport charges is being paid to a total of 40 airlines at Dublin Airport under the growth incentive scheme. <br /><br />New and additional routes have been announced out of Dublin, Shannon and Cork to North America, Europe and the UK<b><font color="#FF0000">. </font></b>On 29 May 2014 the Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR) published a draft determination proposing to lower charges at Dublin Airport by 22% over the next five years.  Stakeholders have until 31 July to make submissions on the CAR draft determination.  A final determination is due in September 2014.   </td></tr><tr><td>A modern high speed transport system is essential to ensure our economic competitiveness. We will support the expansion in range and frequency of high capacity commuter services, which will be subject to cost benefit analysis. </td><td>The Public Transport Investment Programme is being rolled out in line with the &ldquo;Infrastructure &amp;amp; Capital Investment Medium Term Exchequer Framework 2012 -2016&rdquo;.  Projects/Programmes included in the Framework are:<br /><br />The Luas Cross City Project, which will link the two existing Luas Lines in Dublin City Centre, was the key public transport project prioritised under the 5-year capital framework. The project is progressing well to agreed timelines and is on target for completion by end-2017.<br /><br /><br />Other priorities included for implementation are also progressing on time and to budget as follows:<br /><br />- Railway Safety and Capital Maintenance Programme;<br /><br />- Replacement Public Service Obligation (PSO) buses;<br /><br />- Upgrade of existing QBCs in the GDA with emphasis on the Ballymun/Airport/Swords corridor;<br /><br />- Removal of certain pinch points/bottlenecks including some urban rail level crossings; and <br /><br />- The Regional Cities Programme which funds the development of sustainable transport projects in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.</td></tr><tr><td>Funding will be provided on a once off basis to repair damage done to non-national roads due to recent severe weather conditions.  </td><td>As part of the 2011 Jobs Initiative an extra &euro;60 million was reallocated to regional and local roads to carry out surface restoration and road reconstruction works. Subsequently, an additional &euro;50m. was allocated to regional and local roads under  Government stimulus measures in 2013 and funding in 2014 includes an extra &euro;50m allocated in the Budget for work on regional and local roads. In addition, as a result of the severe weather in the December/January period the Government confirmed additional funding of &euro;16.8 million for repairs to roads damaged during the period 13 December 2013 to 6 January 2014. In addition, a further &euro;20m was allocated to local authorities in May 2014 as part of the Infrastructure Stimulus Package (Phase 4).</td></tr><tr><td>We recognise the need to rebalance transport policy to favour public transport. We will therefore establish a Cabinet sub-committee on Infrastructure to explore the benefits to the public transport passenger of more diverse bus service provision. </td><td>In December 2013, the National Transport Authority (NTA) announced that about 10% of publicly subvented (PSO) bus services currently operated by Dublin Bus and by Bus &Eacute;ireann will be tendered out with the new services commencing in late 2016.  These routes include some orbital routes and local routes in Dublin, and some Dublin commuter routes into Leinster as well as Waterford routes.</td></tr><tr><td>The rural transport network is vital for rural communities as a reliable and sustainable transport service. We will maintain and extend the Rural Transport Programme with other local transport services as much as is practicable. </td><td>A major restructuring of the Rural Transport Programme (RTP) was announced in July 2013, including the establishment of 18 Transport Co-ordination Units (TCUs) replacing the existing 35 RTP Groups, to  manage rural transport services within their area. The new structures will maintain the focus on social inclusion, with stronger links into local policy making by local authorities and will position rural transport within a national integrated public transport network. They will ensure that the provision of rural transport services is mainstreamed as a subsidised public transport service. <br /><br /><br /><br />The process to establish the 18 TCUs on a phased basis is well advanced with the first TCU, Local Link Kerry, launched on 20 June 2014</td></tr><tr><td>We will review and update the regulation of taxis to ensure that taxi services are recognized as a key component of the public transport system and we will provide for a forum for discussion between the regulatory authorities and taxi providers. </td><td>The Taxi Regulation Act, 2013 was enacted in October 2013. Statutory Instrument No. 163 of 2014 completed the commencement of that Act in April this year with the exception of section 49. The National Transport Authority also introduced new small public service vehicle (SPSV) regulations on 7 April 2014 which introduce new measures provided for under the Act as well as consolidating and replacing the existing SPSV regulations. </td></tr><tr><td>We will legislate to regulate the vehicle clamping industry.  </td><td>The Vehicle Clamping Bill 2014 was published on June 9 last. The Bill is scheduled to be introduced in the Seanad on July 16 2014. Under this Bill it will be the function of the National Transport Authority to regulate clamping activities and matters relating to appeals.</td></tr><tr><td>We will introduce roadside drug testing programmes to combat the problem of driving under the influence of drugs.  </td><td>Section 11 of the Road Traffic Act 2014 provides for intoxicant impairment testing which will replace section 11 of the Road Traffic Act 2010.  These non-technological tests will assist the Garda&iacute; in forming the opinion that a driver is under the influence of an intoxicant and will form part of the evidence, should a court case ensue.  It is expected that section 11 will be commenced shortly.<br /><br /><br /><br />A working group chaired by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety (MBRS) and with representation from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department was established last year to consider the scientific, operational, legislative, resource and cost issues with regard to the introduction of roadside chemical testing for drugs. The MBRS is currently finalising detailed specifications for the oral fluid roadside testing devices and expects to issue the invitation to tender for the devices later this year<font color="#FF0000">.</font>It is also setting up a laboratory to test the devices.

Output IndicatorsProgress to dateAbolish the Travel Tax as part of a deal with airlines to restore lost routes 

International access is vital to tourism recovery. We will abolish the &euro;3 travel tax subject to a deal being agreed with Ryanair and Aer Lingus to re-open closed routes and bring more tourists into Ireland. If no deal can be done, there will be no reduction in the tax. In Budget 2014 the Government announced the introduction of a zero rate travel tax initiative as part of a process aimed at generating new airline routes into Ireland and this came into effect from 1 April 2014.  

There has been a positive response to the initiative from airlines the introduction of new routes and increased capacity on existing services from Dublin, Shannon, Cork and Knock. A total of 23 new services have been announced commencing in 2014 along with additional capacity on 21 existing routes from the four main airports.We will work with the Aviation Regulator to cut airport charges in order to deliver increased routes, airlines and passenger numbers.  

There were over 24.8m passengers through Irish airports in 2013 up 4%. Dublin Airport had its third successive year of growth of passenger numbers led by a record-breaking performance on transatlantic traffic.  As a result of this strong growth, a &euro;5.6 million rebate in airport charges is being paid to a total of 40 airlines at Dublin Airport under the growth incentive scheme. 

New and additional routes have been announced out of Dublin, Shannon and Cork to North America, Europe and the UK. On 29 May 2014 the Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR) published a draft determination proposing to lower charges at Dublin Airport by 22% over the next five years.  Stakeholders have until 31 July to make submissions on the CAR draft determination.  A final determination is due in September 2014.   A modern high speed transport system is essential to ensure our economic competitiveness. We will support the expansion in range and frequency of high capacity commuter services, which will be subject to cost benefit analysis. The Public Transport Investment Programme is being rolled out in line with the &ldquo;Infrastructure &amp;amp; Capital Investment Medium Term Exchequer Framework 2012 -2016&rdquo;.  Projects/Programmes included in the Framework are:

The Luas Cross City Project, which will link the two existing Luas Lines in Dublin City Centre, was the key public transport project prioritised under the 5-year capital framework. The project is progressing well to agreed timelines and is on target for completion by end-2017.



Other priorities included for implementation are also progressing on time and to budget as follows:

- Railway Safety and Capital Maintenance Programme;

- Replacement Public Service Obligation (PSO) buses;

- Upgrade of existing QBCs in the GDA with emphasis on the Ballymun/Airport/Swords corridor;

- Removal of certain pinch points/bottlenecks including some urban rail level crossings; and 

- The Regional Cities Programme which funds the development of sustainable transport projects in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.Funding will be provided on a once off basis to repair damage done to non-national roads due to recent severe weather conditions.  As part of the 2011 Jobs Initiative an extra &euro;60 million was reallocated to regional and local roads to carry out surface restoration and road reconstruction works. Subsequently, an additional &euro;50m. was allocated to regional and local roads under  Government stimulus measures in 2013 and funding in 2014 includes an extra &euro;50m allocated in the Budget for work on regional and local roads. In addition, as a result of the severe weather in the December/January period the Government confirmed additional funding of &euro;16.8 million for repairs to roads damaged during the period 13 December 2013 to 6 January 2014. In addition, a further &euro;20m was allocated to local authorities in May 2014 as part of the Infrastructure Stimulus Package (Phase 4).We recognise the need to rebalance transport policy to favour public transport. We will therefore establish a Cabinet sub-committee on Infrastructure to explore the benefits to the public transport passenger of more diverse bus service provision. In December 2013, the National Transport Authority (NTA) announced that about 10% of publicly subvented (PSO) bus services currently operated by Dublin Bus and by Bus &Eacute;ireann will be tendered out with the new services commencing in late 2016.  These routes include some orbital routes and local routes in Dublin, and some Dublin commuter routes into Leinster as well as Waterford routes.The rural transport network is vital for rural communities as a reliable and sustainable transport service. We will maintain and extend the Rural Transport Programme with other local transport services as much as is practicable. A major restructuring of the Rural Transport Programme (RTP) was announced in July 2013, including the establishment of 18 Transport Co-ordination Units (TCUs) replacing the existing 35 RTP Groups, to  manage rural transport services within their area. The new structures will maintain the focus on social inclusion, with stronger links into local policy making by local authorities and will position rural transport within a national integrated public transport network. They will ensure that the provision of rural transport services is mainstreamed as a subsidised public transport service. 



The process to establish the 18 TCUs on a phased basis is well advanced with the first TCU, Local Link Kerry, launched on 20 June 2014We will review and update the regulation of taxis to ensure that taxi services are recognized as a key component of the public transport system and we will provide for a forum for discussion between the regulatory authorities and taxi providers. The Taxi Regulation Act, 2013 was enacted in October 2013. Statutory Instrument No. 163 of 2014 completed the commencement of that Act in April this year with the exception of section 49. The National Transport Authority also introduced new small public service vehicle (SPSV) regulations on 7 April 2014 which introduce new measures provided for under the Act as well as consolidating and replacing the existing SPSV regulations. We will legislate to regulate the vehicle clamping industry.  The Vehicle Clamping Bill 2014 was published on June 9th last. The Bill is scheduled to be introduced in the Seanad on July 16th 2014. Under this Bill it will be the function of the National Transport Authority to regulate clamping activities and matters relating to appeals.We will introduce roadside drug testing programmes to combat the problem of driving under the influence of drugs.  Section 11 of the Road Traffic Act 2014 provides for intoxicant impairment testing which will replace section 11 of the Road Traffic Act 2010.  These non-technological tests will assist the Garda&iacute; in forming the opinion that a driver is under the influence of an intoxicant and will form part of the evidence, should a court case ensue.  It is expected that section 11 will be commenced shortly.



A working group chaired by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety (MBRS) and with representation from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department was established last year to consider the scientific, operational, legislative, resource and cost issues with regard to the introduction of roadside chemical testing for drugs. The MBRS is currently finalising detailed specifications for the oral fluid roadside testing devices and expects to issue the invitation to tender for the devices later this year.It is also setting up a laboratory to test the devices. Legislation to provide for the use of such devices is currently being drafted in consultation with relevant agencies and bodies and will form part of the Road Traffic Bill to be introduced later this year.We will continue to invest in the National Cycle Policy and we will look to extend the Dublin Bikes Scheme across the wider Dublin area and to other cities and integrate the scheme much more effectively with public transport links.  Strategic investment in sustainable travel under key programmes has been continued with on-going support for smarter travel investment committed under a 5 year multi-annual budget of &euro;65 million. . 



Works on cycling infrastructure in 13 towns were completed under the 2012/2013 Active Travel Towns programme.  9 towns were selected under a second round of funding awarded in April 2014 in respect of the period 2014-2016. 



A total of 15 projects were also funded and completed under the National Cycle Network Funding Programme 2012/2013. A further 3 projects shared in funding of &euro;6.3 million under the second tranche of NCN funding for the years 2014-2016.

11 cycling projects were selected to share in the &euro;10 million set aside for the development of greenways from the recently announced &euro;200 million Government Stimulus Package for Infrastructure Development.



The public bike  schemes  will be launched to the public  in Cork, Limerick and Galway in Autumn 2014 



Construction of the expansion of the dublinbikes scheme is currently on-going with several of the additional bike stations completed and operational.  It is expected that all of the additional stations will be completed by summer of this year, which will result in the overall provision of 102 dublinbikes stations, 1,500 bikes and a total of circa 3,000 cycle stands under the full dublinbikes scheme.  Coca cola was announced as the new sponsor for the Dublin Bikes in June 2014.Safety at sea and decent working conditions must underpin the development of the fisheries sector. We will explore the provision of an emergency towing vessel for the Coast Guard. A review study on the necessity for an Emergency Towing Vessel, and the associated risks and possible strategies that may be available to the State was undertaken and its summary findings were presented to Government on 10 July 2013.  In the current economic climate and also having regard to the long time frame for developing consensus on a suitable multi-purpose offshore patrol vessel (M-OPV) for the future, it was decided that the focus for the next few years will be on improving pollution and accident prevention, through the range of measures outlined in the Action Plan.

The Work in Fishing Convention 2007 sets standards to protect workers in the fishing sector.  The Department is working on developing the legislative basis to enable Ireland to ratify the Convention and implement it nationally. The Department has also engaged with the Federation of Irish Fishermen on the development of a new logbook, which is assisting the industry in complying with the requirements of the Convention, when it enters into force.

The Irish Maritime Administration of the Department is preparing a new Maritime Safety Strategy which will focus on reducing the number of deaths and injuries in the recreational craft, fishing, passenger and cargo vessel sectors. The development of the Strategy is being informed by a consultation process in the period June to August 2014 designed to engage a range of stakeholders and the general public.  Publication of the new Strategy is planned for Q4 2014.All State funding will be subject to the beneficiaries signing up to a dispute resolution service, a code of governance and a new mandatory code of conduct regarding child protection in sport. Irish Sports Council (ISC) is working with Federation of Irish Sports to develop Just Sport Ireland as preferred approach for dispute resolution.  There are currently over 40 sports signed up to Just Sport Ireland and six adopting their own dispute resolution services.



ISC&rsquo;s recognition and funding application procedures require all sports bodies to meet a certain standard of governance. In addition, the ISC are encouraging all funded bodies to sign up to the Governance Code for Community and Voluntary Organisations. The code encourages organisations to agree to operate to key principles in order to run their organisation more effectively in areas such as leadership, transparency and accountability and behaving with integrity.



The ISC has committed to working with Dept. Children and Youth Affairs and other appropriate authorities in implementing any new codes around child protection.A number of positions on the Sports Council&rsquo;s governing Board will be made directly electable. This was considered as part of the proposed Sport Ireland legislation which is currently being prepared.  It was decided that the Bill will not provide for 'Directly electable positions'.In future sports funding should prioritise projects which further greater participation in sport on a local and national level. New rounds of Sports Capital Programme advertised in March 2012 and January 2014 with a focus on projects that will increase participation in sport. 2036 applications were received in response to the latter round and successful applications were announced on 3 July 2014. In total, &euro;40.5m will be allocated for 880 sports projects across the country.The National Sports Facilities Strategy will become the blueprint for the future development of all sports facilities in the country and will inform any future investment on sports infrastructure.  One of the Department's priorities for 2014 is the development of a Policy Statement for Irish Sport.  The aim of the statement is to articulate the various policies that exist in sport into one single document and set out the objectives in this area.   The statement will take account of existing documents such as the draft National Sports Facilities Strategy which was published as a discussion document in 2012. We will prioritise the Tourism Marketing Fund as an essential pillar of our tourism strategy and will ensure the best return on Exchequer spending. A total of &euro;35.476m has been allocated to the Tourism Marketing Fund for 2014. This will ensure that the Business and Marketing Plan for Tourism Ireland for 2014 is fully resourced to meet its objectives. This plan was approved by the North South Ministerial Council on 22 January 2014.



Measures to ensure that marketing programmes provide the greatest possible value and impact are being further developed by Tourism Ireland, under the oversight of the Departments, and regular reviews of marketing programmes are undertaken by Tourism Ireland in association with the tourism industry.



Overseas visit numbers to Ireland reached 6.986m in 2013 (CSO):  +7.2% on 2012.  The latest CSO figures show that visit numbers for the period February-April 2014 are up 7.5% when compared to the corresponding period of 2013.   14,000 more people (+11.4%) were employed in &lsquo;Accommodation and Food Services&rsquo; in the first quarter of 2014, on a seasonally adjusted basis, compared to the same period in 2013.Marketing campaigns will be developed in emerging long haul markets such as China, Russia, India, Japan and the Middle East, using the Tourism Marketing Fund. Recovery of market share in Britain will also be a key priority in a revamped tourism strategy. Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s 2014 marketing plan included a range of measures to encourage growth in visitor numbers from emerging long haul markets, including working with key trade partners to ensure their marketing activities facilitate maximising our reach across target segments.  Tourism Ireland will continue to work with the relevant visa authorities to exploit further opportunities to promote the short-stay visa waiver programme through publicity, media trips and collaboration with UK Visa Offices to maintain and increase awareness in developing markets. 



Visits from long-haul markets grew by +15.1% in 2013.  For the period from February-April 2014, visits from long-haul markets (excluding North America) increased by 7.0% when compared to the same period in 2013.Event tourism will be prioritised to continue to bring major fairs and events to Ireland such as the Volvo Ocean Race or Solheim Cup. The F&aacute;ilte Ireland Events Ireland team continues to work in addressing enquiries and prospective queries from event organisers, with a view to welcoming major events which have the potential to deliver increased tourism numbers and significant economic benefit.  Some of the key events which took place in 2013 included the finals of the Heineken Cup and Amlin Challenge Cup, and the Irish Open Golf Championship. Major events (other than sporting) supported in 2013 included New Year&rsquo;s Eve Festival, Dublin, St Patrick&rsquo;s Festival, Galway Arts Festival, Kilkenny Arts Festival, Wexford Opera Festival, Cork Jazz Festival and Cork International Choral Festival.



Major events in 2014 will include the St Patrick&rsquo;s Festival, Giro D&rsquo;Italia, Irish Open Golf, Dublin Horse Show and the Adventure Travel World Summit. In May the island of Ireland hosted the first three stages of the world famous cycling race Giro d&rsquo;Italia. Following the spectacular opening stages in Northern Ireland, Dublin provided a host of special events and a world famous welcome for almost 200 of the world&rsquo;s top professional cyclists and their spectators. The Croke Park Classic American Football game will take place between the University of Central Florida and Penn State University at the end of August.



Through the 2013 Financial Support Fund, F&aacute;ilte Ireland supported 213 conference applications for bids and marketing support for committed conferences (as of mid-December 2013). These conferences represent 131,000 international delegates and have a potential estimated business value of &euro;179 million.We will target available resources at developing and co-ordinating niche tourism products and activity packages that are attractive to international visitors focusing on food, sports, culture, ecotourism, activity breaks, water-based recreation and festivals. There is significant progress on the delivery of the National Food Tourism Implementation Framework. In 2013 F&aacute;ilte Ireland selected eight further food ambassadors to join the Food Tourism Network Development programme, bringing the total number of food &lsquo;champions&rsquo; to twenty two. These emerging food &lsquo;champions&rsquo; will actively influence and shape the future of Irish cuisine and food tourism in their region. In 2013 the focus was on individuals located along the route of the Wild Atlantic Way and the benchmarking programme took place along the established driving routes of Norway in September. 



Food is one of the Key workstreams identified in F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s Business Plan for 2014.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has also invested in a range of walking and cycling routes around the country ranging in size and variety from looped walks to full greenways such as The Great Western Greenway. There are now over 200 accredited looped walks around the country.  Under the &lsquo;walkers welcome&rsquo; initiative it is supporting accommodation providers who provide additional services to walkers in key walking areas.    F&aacute;ilte Ireland has also recently undertaken significant cycle and activity tourism market research in four of our key overseas markets and the domestic market to identify both the potential market size for cycling in particular but also walking, equestrian, sailing, angling and water-based activities in Ireland.



29 key events which align with potential for driving international visitors will be supported through the national festival fund in 2014 and 175 festivals will be supported through the regional fund.  Improving the e-capability of our tourism product will be a priority.In excess of 3,600 tourism businesses availed of web supports in 2013. F&aacute;ilte Ireland is continuing to provide these programmes into 2014 with a particular emphasis on online selling both directly through industry websites and via 3rd party platforms.  

Supports provided to businesses in 2014 to date include:



- 275 businesses provided with digital specialist input, predominantly &lsquo;National Web Tests&rsquo;, designed to review their online status and identify specific strengths and weaknesses to target areas of improvement.



- 1345 businesses attended online &lsquo;Webinars, Web-Tutorials and/or face-to-face &lsquo;Digital Workshops&rsquo; addressing digital topics including digital strategy; channel management; content development; social media; mobile capability etc.

These were the Child and Family Agency, the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI), the Family Support Agency (FSA), the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) and the Ombudsman for Children. With effect from 1 January 2012, I have taken responsibility for the Children Detention Schools as provided in Part 10 of the Children Act 2001. Within this period 48 persons have been appointed to the boards of management of those bodies.</p><p>  Under the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013, the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board were dissolved and the service provision for these Agencies along with Child and Family Services previously provided by the HSE transferred to the new Agency with effect from 1st January, 2014. The membership of the board of the Family Support Agency was appointed to the board of the new Child and Family Agency on its establishment on January 1st 2014. The Ombudsman for Children's Office does not have a board.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, in line with the Government decision of April 2011, new arrangements were put in place for the making of appointments to State Boards and bodies.  Following this Government Decision, on my Department's website, I have invited expressions of interest from persons interested in being appointed to the boards of State Bodies and Agencies operating under the Department's aegis. The notice indicates the vacancies in the boards of the respective bodies. My officials acknowledge all expressions of interest received and maintain a database of those expressions. My Department&rsquo;s website is monitored and updated on a regular basis to reflect the number of vacancies as they arise.  </p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the governing legislation in relation to each of these bodies sets out the composition of the board either in terms of their qualifications and experience, or the Government Minister or body that is responsible for nominating representatives on them or who must be consulted in the nomination process. </p><p>  In making my decisions on appointments to boards, subject to the governing legislation, I will consider the most suitable persons for the positions available with due regard to the body or agency in question and its particular responsibilities and I will seek to ensure that the appropriate mix of skills and experience is in place to achieve the best result.   </p></reply>

Prior to the introduction of the programme in January 2010 there was no requirement for staff working directly with children in preschool services to hold any education qualification. </p><p>It is a requirement of the ECCE programme that preschool year leaders<b></b>in services participating in the programme, and who are receiving the standard capitation,  hold a qualification in childcare which is equivalent to Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ). A higher capitation rate is available to services participating in the ECCE programme in which all of the preschool leaders hold  an appropriate qualification at a minimum of Level 7 and preschool assistants hold a Level 5 on the NFQ.  </p><p>As part of the Early Years Quality Agenda, new qualification requirements for childcare workers are being introduced.  All staff caring for children in an early years service will be subject to a minimum qualification requirement of Level 5, while preschool leaders delivering the ECCE programme will require a Level 6 qualification.  These requirements will come into effect from September 2014 for new services, and from September 2015 for existing services. </p><p>Pobal, which administers the childcare support programmes on behalf of my Department, compiles an Annual Survey of the Early Years Sector.  According to its 2013 Annual Survey, of the childcare services that responded to the question relating to the number of staff employed, 87% of staff have a qualification equal to or higher than Level 5 on the NFQ .  This figure confirms the finding of previous annual surveys conducted by Pobal. Further figures provided in the Pobal Survey indicate that the number of childcare workers holding a Level 6 qualification is in the region of 45%. </p><p>Figures compiled this year by my Department indicate that approximately 24% of the 4,300 services participating in the ECCE programme are in receipt of the higher capitation. This means that at least one member of staff in the qualifying childcare service holds an appropriate qualifications at Level 7 or higher.</p><p>It is estimated by Pobal, from information provided by respondents to their Annual Survey 2013 that there is in the region of 24,000 staff employed in the childcare sector. </p></reply>

The programme is a free and universal provision to which all children have access and figures in relation to special needs children availing of this provision are not collated.</p><p>  To ensure that the ECCE programme is more accessible to children with special needs a number of additional provisions have been added.  These include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification under the programme where a child is developmentally delayed and would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.</p><p>  The Department does not have information in relation to the number of children with special needs currently participating in the ECCE programme.  About 200 children avail of the over-age exemption and the pro-rata provision each year.</p><p>  My Department has been working with the Department of Health in the context of building better supports to facilitate the children with special needs.

The Explanatory Guide to the Regulations recommends a range of adult/child ratios that reflect the age of the child and the level of care the child is receiving. For sessional pre-school services (i.e. services offering a planned programme to pre-school children for a total of not more than 3.5 hours per day), the ratios are:</p><p><b>Sessional Pre-School Services</b><table><tr><th>Age Range </th><th>Adult Child ratio</th></tr><tr><td>0-1 year</td><td>1:3</td></tr><tr><td>1-2.5 years</td><td>1:5</td></tr><tr><td>2.5-6 years</td><td>1:10</td></tr></table></p><p>Following a reduction in the weekly capitation payment to pre-school services participating in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, which provides a free pre-school year to children prior to commencing primary school, the 1:10 adult/child ratio was increased to a ratio of 1:11 for children qualifying for the pre-school support.  This decision, which was made so that participating childcare services would have some flexibility in managing the modest capitation reduction, relates only to the pre-school element of the service and not to other children enrolled in the childcare service. </p><p>The  Early Years  Quality Agenda is currently being progressed by my Department and will introduce a series of reforms that provide for the further development of the childcare sector.  Legislation to strengthen the current Early Years Inspection regime and to underpin the Quality Agenda has been enacted.  Regulations to give effect to the legislative changes are expected to be published shortly.  New National Standards for early years services will also be published shortly and will provide the basis against which services will be inspected and reported on.  It is expected that these new Standards will confirm the existing ratios.</p></reply>

These include the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme.  There is no specific funding allocated to provide for children in the 0 to 3 age category but childcare services can be availed of through one of the above programmes. </p><p>  The ECCE programme provides funding to support approximately 68,000 children each year but the minimum qualifying age is 3 years 2 months at the commencement of the school year and children under this age do not have access to this provision. </p><p>  The CCS programme provides support to community not for profit childcare services to enable them to provide childcare to lower income and disadvantaged families at reduced rates.  Eligibility for support under the programme is based on the income status of the parent and children of all ages are eligible to enrol for support.  There are more than 900 community childcare services participating in the CCS programme. </p><p>  The CETS programmes support parents who are participating in Solas and Education Training Board (ETB) training and education courses with the cost of childcare.  Children of all ages are eligible for support under this programme.  </p><p>  Two additional support programmes, the Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme,  which provides support to CE programme participants for children in the 0 to 13 age category, and the After-School Child Care (ASCC) programme, which supports certain categories of parents seeking after school care for primary school children, were introduced under the CETS programme and are currently implemented by my Department.  The total number of providers in contract to provide services under the CETS programmes is 1,600 but it should be noted that the ASCC programme relates to school age children.</p><p>  There are in the region of 4,500 notified childcare services currently delivering childcare services with nearly all of those participating in the ECCE programme.

The programme is normally provided for 3 hours per day, 5 days per week, over 38 weeks.  The Government has made a very significant commitment in maintaining the pre-school year on a universal and free basis despite the current budgetary situation.</p><p>  The ECCE programme is funded by my Department through the provision of capitation grants paid directly to participating services.  This capitation payment is for the provision of services, including preparatory and supportive work such as engagement with parents, training and organisation.  The standard capitation fee paid to participating services is &euro;62.50 per week per eligible child.  A higher capitation fee of &euro;73 per week per eligible child is available to pre-school services with more highly qualified staff.</p><p>  There are in the region of 4,300 pre-school services participating in the programme with new services applying to enter the programme each year.  The funding provided under the programme is a guaranteed source of income, paid in advance, and is an important support to services at this time. Services applying to enter the programme should be satisfied that they can meet the full cost of providing the pre-school year from the capitation provided.</p><p>  Ireland, like other European countries, doesn&rsquo;t provide for mandatory Continuing Professional Development for early years practitioners.  Data from the 2014 Eurydice and Eurostat Report &lsquo;Key Data on Early Childhood Education and Care &ndash; Education and Training in Europe&rsquo;  shows that in Denmark, Ireland, Greece, Cyprus, Poland, Sweden and Norway, CPD is not obligatory for educational and care staff.</p><p>  The same report identifies that &lsquo;Continuing professional development (CPD) plays an essential part in increasing ECEC professionals' competences.  In certain cases, participating in training allows staff not only to improve their knowledge and develop additional professional skills in ECEC, but also to upgrade their qualifications.</p><p>  I would like to be in a position to provide for mandatory CPD but first I would like to see early years practitioners meet the new minimum requirements.  The Deputy may be aware that as part of the early years quality agenda aimed at improving the quality of childcare services, new qualification requirements for childcare staff working directly with children were announced last year.  A minimum qualification of Level 5 (or equivalent) on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) will be required for all staff working with children in pre-school services and the minimum qualification for all pre-school leaders delivering the free pre-school year under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme will be increased from Level 5 to Level 6 (or equivalent) on the NFQ.  The new qualification requirements will apply to all new services from September 2014, and to all existing services from September 2015. </p><p>  To support staff who are seeking to meet the new qualifications requirement, funding of &euro;3 million is being made available over the two years 2014/2015 under the new Learner Fund which was launched in March this year.  The Fund is being administered by Pobal, with the assistance of local City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs). </p><p>  My Department also provides annual funding to seven voluntary childcare organisations in the childcare sector, who provide support to childcare services throughout the country.  This funding, which will amount to over &euro;2.6 million in 2014, enables the voluntary organisations to provide a range of support services to their members, including on-going training supports.</p></reply>

They comprise local representatives from the statutory, community and voluntary sectors, social partners, childcare providers and parents.</p><p>  The role of the CCCs was expanded under the National Childcare Investment Programme to enable greater flexibility and responsiveness to local needs, and they had a key role in the development of local childcare infrastructure, quality standards, training and information.  More recently, CCCs have been increasingly dedicated to locally managing administrative processes associated with the national childcare programmes (the Community Childcare Subvention programme, the Early Childhood Care and Education programme and the Childcare Education and Training Support programme).  They also support the performance and sustainability of services in their respective areas.</p><p>  Each CCC receives annual funding from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  The Department was required to find savings of 8% in the overall Childcare Committees budget over the two years 2013 and 2014.  In allocating the funding, the objective was to seek to more closely reflect the early education and childcare landscape within each area, and therefore reductions were not applied on a flat-rate basis as had been the case in previous years.  For 2013, the reductions applied to CCCs ranged from 0% to 9%, based on an analysis undertaken by Pobal on behalf of the Department which took account of a number of factors, including the number of children aged 0-12 in the CCC&rsquo;s catchment area, to arrive at a weighting for each CCC.</p><p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs was established in 2011.

The HSE had statutory responsibility for this service until the Agency was established on 1 January 2014.  Reports of concerns (referrals) relate to a child's welfare or where there are concern of child abuse (i.e. physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse or neglect).</p><p>Under the Child Care Regulations 1995, each child is required to have an allocated social whose statutory duties include-</p><p>- the preparation and review of the care plan,</p><p>- finding appropriate placements for and in consultation with the child,</p><p>- consideration of the wishes of the child and family including contact with parent(s), siblings and extended family,</p><p>- addressing education placement and health needs of the child,</p><p>- visits to placements to ensure that it is meeting the child&rsquo;s needs,</p><p>- meeting with child,</p><p>- working with child, their family, carer(s) and other significant persons and professionals with a view to planning the child&rsquo;s future, and </p><p>- keeping a record /medical assessment.</p><p>The Agency compiles monthly performance reports which include statistics in relation to children in care.  These reports are published on the Agencies website ().  The latest information from the Agency shows in April 2014, that of the 6,492 children in care, 93% or 6023 children had an allocated social worker.  This is a slight improvement to April 2013 when 92% of the 6,421 children in care had an allocated social worker (5,932).</p><p>Where a child does not have an allocated social worker, their case is managed by the social work department, usually by a duty social worker. Unallocated cases are often cases where a child has just come into care and is awaiting allocation of a social worker or where a child is in a very stable fostering placement, provided perhaps, by a relative.  Maternity leave, sick leave and movement of staff within the service can result in a case being unallocated for a short period of time.  Cases that are unallocated are closely monitored, supported and managed by the duty social work team under the supervision of the principal social worker.  Cases are subject to ongoing review and where appropriate, the level and nature of the support being provided  will change, depending on the needs of the child.</p><p>Under the Child Care Regulations 1995, each child is also required to have an up-to-date Care Plan, whereby the Agency is required to prepare a plan which specifies:</p><p>- the aims and objectives of the placement; </p><p>- the support to be offered to the child, </p><p>- the supports to be offered to the centre or foster parents as appropriate and the parents of the child by the health board; </p><p>- arrangements for access to the child by a parent or other named person; </p><p>- arrangements for review of the plan. </p><p>The plan should be prepared either before the child is placed, or as soon as practicable after placement and based on consultation with the child and his or her family.  Care plans are reviewed in accordance with the Regulations.  While the Agency has advised that data is not collected regarding annual or biannual review plans, the Agency does publish information in relation to up to date care plans.  The Agency had advised that 90% of the 6,492 children in care in April 2014 (5,868) had an up to date written care plan.  This is an improvement on April 2013 when 88% of children in care had an up to date plan.</p><p><b>Child Protection</b></p><p>In 2013, the HSE received 19,390 referrals (reports) of child abuse and this figure can be further broken down by abuse category: <table><tr><th>Number and % of referrals of <br /><br />Child Abuse: <br /><br />Physical Abuse </th><th>Number and % referrals of <br /><br />Child Abuse: <br /><br />Emotional Abuse</th><th>Number and % of referrals of <br /><br />Child Abuse: <br /><br />Sexual Abuse </th><th>Number and % of referrals of <br /><br />Child Abuse: <br /><br />Neglect </th></tr><tr><td>4,320</td><td>5,273</td><td>3,376</td><td>6,421</td></tr><tr><td>22%</td><td>27%</td><td>17%</td><td>33%</td></tr></table></p><p>Of the 19,390 referrals, 12,262 (63%) received a preliminary enquiry that took place within 24 hours of receipt of the referral.

In the main, these emergency situations arise out of hours. </p><p>  At present, out-of-hours emergency services for children at risk in the greater Dublin area are provided by the Child and Family Agency through the Crisis Intervention Service (CIS).  The remit of the service is to respond to crisis situations in which a child or young person requires immediate placement either due to child protection concerns or accommodation issues.  The service is delivered by the Child and Family Agency social work service.</p><p>  Outside the greater Dublin area, a more limited Emergency Place of Safety Service (EPSS) is provided for the Agency under a commercial arrangement by Five Rivers Ireland.  Under Section 12 of the Child Care Act, 1991, a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may remove a child to a place of safety where they have reasonable grounds for believing that there is an immediate risk to the health or welfare of a child.  Under the EPSS, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can access an emergency placement for such children found to be at risk out of hours.  The child is placed in a family setting until the following working day, when the local social work service assumes responsibility for the case.  The intention is to expand this service so that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can consult with a social worker out of hours. This is presently not the case outside the greater Dublin area.</p><p>  Provision for the development of the service was included in the 2014 Letter of Determination and Performance Statement which issued from my Department to the Child and Family Agency in December last.  Proposals have since been developed by the Agency for implementation of this key reform.</p><p>  In preparation for the expansion of the service, Emergency Out-of-Hours Pilot projects were put in place in Cork and Donegal during 2011 to help assess the demand for a national service.  These pilots have since been externally evaluated by the School of Social Work and Social Policy, Trinity College, Dublin.  The evaluation concluded that the pilots demonstrate the clear potential for a National Out-of-Hours service and that, while usage might be low, it would be an important addition to the range of child welfare and protection services in Ireland. </p><p>  Subject to a National Protocol this service will include the following components:- </p><p>  1. The service will operate on the same basis as the existing Crisis Intervention Service in the greater Dublin area; </p><p>  2. The service will be coordinated through a national Call Centre at the Crisis Intervention Service and all Garda stations will access the service by calling the national Call Centre; </p><p>  3. Staff on Emergency Out-of-Hours Service duty will provide advice and consultation to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to assist in their determination as to the needs of the child, by telephone and on call out as required;</p><p>  4. Where a staff call out is required, the staff member on duty will accompany a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;  </p><p>  Consideration of the proposal by the Department and the Agency will be concluded and it is expected that the service will be put in place by year end, in line with the Agency&rsquo;s 2014 Business Plan.</p></reply>

It has completed second stage in the D&aacute;il, and the remaining stages will be scheduled after the summer recess. </p><p>  The introduction of this legislation is in line with a key Programme for Government commitment, which will be fulfilled. The timing of the commencement of the legislation will take cognisance of the fact that the various sectors which will have statutory obligations imposed on them by the legislation will need adequate time to prepare for implementation. Through the auspices of the Children First Interdepartmental Group, my Department is continuing to liaise with relevant Departments and Agencies regarding the preparations which each sector is undertaking  in order to ensure that their statutory requirements under the legislation will be implemented. </p><p>  In parallel to the legislative process, my officials have commenced an exercise to revise and update the existing Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children (2011). This is to ensure that the Guidance, which will continue as the basis for all citizens to report concerns, reflects the new legislative obligations and provides, in one place, a complete reference resource for individuals and organisations.  This will provide clarity and ensure consistency between the proposed legislation and the existing non-statutory obligations which will continue to operate administratively for all sectors of society. </p><p>  The Children First legislation, once enacted and commenced, will represent an important and necessary addition to the child welfare and protection system.</p></reply>

Subsequent consideration by the Oireachtas Health and Children Committee will allow the issues to be carefully teased out and the views of different interested parties on these important and sensitive matters to be fully considered.  I look forward to advancing these important matters in association with the Oireachtas Health and Children Committee later this year.</p><p>  As well as the information and tracing legislation, I am conscious that  issues have arisen in relation to the operation of the Adoption Act, 2010, since its enactment.  There are a number of general policy questions around the nature of our adoption regime and I consider it timely to consider a review of adoption.  Given the range and complexity of the issues this requires scoping and preliminary examination after which decisions will be made on the extent and time scale for the review to see if proposals for legislative change emerge from this review or the nature of such proposals.  Based upon the many domestic and international legal aspects to adoption the issue of further legislative development will certainly be considered.  This review will inform future operational and legislative considerations regarding the Adoption Act, 2010.</p><p>  For the present, my legislative priority in the area of adoption is the preparation of  information and tracing legislation.  In addition, my Department is also working closely with the Department of Justice and Equality on the Children and Family Relationships Bill, which it is proposed will contain measures in relation to guardianship and adoption by civil partners.</p></reply>

Research on the problem shows there are no simple answers and there is no magic solution to tackling this complex social issue.</p><p>The Minister of  Communications established an Internet Content Governance Advisory Group under the chair of Dr. Brian O&rsquo;Neil in December of last year to ensure our national policy represents best practice in offering the same online protections to our citizens as those available in the offline world.</p><p>The Group&rsquo;s report was approved by Cabinet and published last month and makes several recommendations aimed at protecting children and young people without unduly limiting their opportunities and rights online.  Along with changes to institutional, administrative and legal structures, the report makes four specific recommendations on cyberbullying aimed at providing stronger supports for tackling this issue through primary and post-primary curricula and additional training and awareness measures.  With regard to the internet It is important to remember that there are many positive aspects about this , and that the best way forward for parents  is to proactively engage with their children in their endeavours, to ensure that they are able to maximise their enjoyment of the internet in the safest possible manner. </p><p>Parents should discuss with their children the potential dangers that exist and encourage them to bring up any difficulties or problems with other users that they may be interacting with on the Internet.  Parents should learn more about what their children are doing online and become familiar with the systems they use. </p><p>Many of the technologies that children use today have resources that can be used to help protect children from inappropriate or obscene . Filtering , Blocking and Parental Control Systems are among some of the options available.  Research relating to Ireland showed only a quarter of parents blocks or filters  websites (28%) and/or tracks the websites visited by their children (24%).</p><p>In 2013 the Minister for Education and Science launched the Action Plan on Bullying Since the Action Plan was launched, two successful awareness raising initiatives have been rolled out.  Internet Safety Day was held again on February 11th this year.  As part of this, the information service for young people, SpunOut, had a major focus on internet safety issues including bullying through its website and social media channels which reach thousands of young people every day.</p></reply>

The placing of such functions within the remit of the new Agency is in line with recommendations in the report of the Task Force on the Child and Family Support Agency.  The Task Force made recommendations on a range of other services relevant to children and families, including child and adolescent mental health services.</p><p>  The practical implications of the scale of organisational change being undertaken so far are such as to require that consideration of the Task Force's wider recommendations and, should it be considered appropriate, their implementation, take place according to a less immediate timescale.  This will allow for more careful review and consideration in conjunction with relevant Departments, principally the Department of Health, as regards extending the service remit of the Agency.</p><p>  A key policy objective for the Child and Family Agency is to ensure that the fundamental principles of co-operation and co-ordination in the development and delivery of services are in place.  This objective is reflected and is underpinned through formal agreements with the Health Service Executive as follows: -</p><p>  -  Joint Protocol for Inter-Agency collaboration between the HSE and the Child and Family Agency to promote the best interests of children and families. This protocol aims to ensure a consistent national approach to service delivery where the delivery of two or more services are involved in the same case.</p><p>  -  Memorandum of Understanding: Strategic Agreement between the Child and Family and the HSE.</p><p>  These agreements safeguard ongoing access to specialist services such as Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS).</p></reply>

A total of some &euro;175 million is spent on the ECCE scheme annually in which some 68,000 children receive free pre-school care.  Objective review and audit of such a significant scheme is integral to the assurance of financial control and achievement of value for money in the public sector.  The Department is a new department and it is to be expected that it should properly examine all major programmes for which it has been given responsibility.</p><p>  In response to all Department of Children and Youth Affairs Audit Report findings, a management action plan is put in place to ensure any issues identified are fully addressed. The action plan for the ECCE Internal Audit report is already being implemented and there is oversight of this process by the Department&rsquo;s Audit Committee.  This Audit Committee is made up of a majority of external members, including its chair.</p><p>  Significant reform of Pobal&rsquo;s operations in relation to this and other programmes administered on behalf of the Department was already underway prior to the Internal Audit and the findings of the Internal Audit have been incorporated into this change programme.  Work is advanced in changing the fee structure between the Department and Pobal away from a percentage administration fee and to an agreed charge based upon full costing and external benchmarking.  This is being undertaken across all programmes administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department and will be incorporated into a new three year Service Level Agreement. This will see Pobal funded for each activity on the basis of objective costs with the potential for cross-subsidy between different activities undertaken on behalf of the Department eliminated. </p><p>  Pobal is implementing a project to improve the use of information technology in the operation of the ECCE programme.

The report, published in July 2013, found that there have been significant improvements in the service response to homelessness of children (that is, not in the care of their parents) in the last 10 years.  The range and standard of prevention services and services for children has improved over the past decade and this has contributed to a decrease in the number of children presenting to services as being homeless.</p><p>  It should of course be noted that policy responsibility for homeless young people, insofar as it extends to my Department, relates to children under 18 and any child welfare and protection concerns that may arise in the context of the Child Care Act 1991.  Young people who are homeless, either singly or as part of a family unit and not falling within this category are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and local authorities.  Young people who were formerly in the care of the State and presently in receipt of aftercare services will, as part of this support, have their accommodation needs identified.</p><p>  Children who present as being homeless to emergency services are taken into care. Such children are typically more challenging to care for as they may be out of school; have experienced neglect and serious family discord; problematic drug use; have mental health or learning difficulties.  These children often wish to be only involved with peers and they may be less inclined to engage with social work services. Services need to provide early and flexible options to engage with these children and to support them beyond their 18th birthday.</p><p>  Aftercare is the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of a young person who is leaving statutory care at 18 years of age, to assist him/her in making the transition to independent living.  The children most vulnerable to homelessness as care leavers are those leaving residential care or short term foster care placements.  Children, who come into care late, in their mid to late teens, may not have developed the relationships with staff or aftercare workers that helps them achieve positive outcomes. It is essential that these young people have an opportunity to develop a relationship with a dedicated aftercare worker who will work with them to identify their needs and ensure that services are in place to help provide them with the stability and support they need.</p><p>  The Child and Family Agency has advised that they are in the process of establishing interagency aftercare committees at local level bringing together Local Authorities, HSE and other statutory and voluntary agencies.  These committees will develop interagency wrap around aftercare plans for young people, particularly for those with complex needs, including housing requirements.</p><p>  A protocol, developed by the Child and Family Agency and the County and City Managers&rsquo; Association, in relation to dealing with accommodation issues of young people leaving care, is nearing completion.  When agreed and implemented, the protocol will see the relevant local authority housing representative attend aftercare planning meetings with social workers of the Agency in relation to those young people for whom social housing has been identified as the most appropriate form of accommodation support.  This, it is hoped, will facilitate a more efficient service for those leaving care in obtaining social housing suitable to their needs.  </p><p>  Furthermore, as the Deputy will be aware, it has been decided to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare. This is in response to concerns that there was insufficient focus in this area and that such planning was not taking place on a properly structured and consistent basis.</p><p>  The approach adopted is to impose a statutory duty on the Agency to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person.  The aim is to create an explicit, as opposed to implicit, statement of the Agency&rsquo;s duty to satisfy itself as to the child&rsquo;s or young person&rsquo;s need for assistance by preparing a plan that identifies those needs for aftercare supports.  The draft provisions also clarify the range of agencies providing relevant services with which the Agency will cooperate in the development of the plan.</p><p>  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, at its sitting on 1st April, considered the draft aftercare provisions.  Following receipt of the Committee&rsquo;s report, I will consider its content prior to refining the text of the provisions in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.</p></reply>

However, I can assure the Deputy that I will be giving full consideration, in conjunction with senior officials in my Department, to identifying my priorities for the remainder of my term of office.  There is much work to be done and it is not without its challenges. Obviously, to deliver in full on our commitments in the Programme for Governments is of key importance and, in that context, the following will form part of my key priorities.</p><p>  I intend to enact the Children First Bill which is currently awaiting Committee Stage. I also hope to pass legislation to amend the Child Care Act 1991 in respect of aftercare.</p><p>  I will continue to support the work of the recently-established Child and Family Agency, known as Tusla.  This is a huge undertaking which will require continued commitment and dedication and detailed engagement with the Tusla board and management team.</p><p>  I also hope to see the development of the National Children Detention Facilities completed.  Funding for the new facilities was secured and work is well advanced.  We will meet our Programme for Government commitment to end the practice of detaining children in prison facilities. Later in the year I intend to present a Bill to the Oireachtas to amend certain provisions of the Children Act 2001.  This will provide for the merging of the three existing Children Detention Schools into a single legal entity, and will also address a number of legal and policy issues associated with managing all children under the age of 18 on that site. </p><p>  I intend to launch Ireland&rsquo;s first ever Early Years Strategy and policy on &lsquo;Family Support and Parenting&rsquo;, creating an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland&rsquo;s early years sector.  I intend to continue quality improvements in early years and childcare services and to review existing targeted childcare supports. It is crucial that we deliver high standards and transparency in this area, and that all parents have confidence in our early years sector.  Maintaining the free pre-school year is an on-going challenge but one I intend to meet. </p><p>  In relation to adoption services, work is continuing on the Heads of Bill for the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill and I hope to be in a position to seek Government approval to publish the Heads of Bill as soon as possible.  Once approved by Government, the Heads of Bill will be sent to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for its detailed consideration.</p><p>  The establishment of a Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and related matters is a recent Government priority, and one I expect that will require a significant level of participation by my Department.</p><p>  The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People was launched in April 2014. This is an innovative whole-of-Government approach to policies for children and young people. My Department has a diverse range of lead and co-ordination functions and I will do whatever I can at a political level to assist in the roll-out of the Framework.</p><p>  The new Area Based Childhood programme was a key commitment of this Government aimed at tackling child poverty, building on and continuing the work of the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme. Over the coming months I expect to see a number of the approved projects become operational.</p></reply>

This level of funding represents an increase of over &euro;558 million on the 2013 Estimate of &euro;439 million and the significant investment demonstrates that, while operating within difficult budgetary constraints, this Government is strongly committed to delivering important reforms and service developments to support children and families. </p><p>I consider that the estimate provision for my Department will facilitate the delivery of a significant level of public services, including those where Service Level Agreements exist as well as a number of new policy measures that include:</p><p>- The establishment of the new Child and Family Agency which took effect on 1<sup>st</sup>January 2014. This was a historic development and a significant milestone in the programme of this Government to fundamentally reform the delivery of services to vulnerable children and families. The financial allocation to the Agency in 2014 amounts to &euro;609 million, including &euro;7 million in capital funding. This resource allocation is for the continuing provision of services previously administered by the Health Service Executive, the National Educational Welfare Board and the Family Support Agency. It is acknowledged that delivering the range of service required of the Agency, within this budget, is challenging. Notwithstanding the significant level of resource provided, certain areas of expenditure, such as legal costs, have in the past proven difficult to manage within the allocated budget. The Agency is implementing significant reform to seek to achieve greater value for money in such areas and the progress in this regard is subject to ongoing monitoring and review with my Department. We will work closely with the Board and senior management of the Agency to ensure the provision within the significant resource provided, of high quality and responsive services to vulnerable children and families. </p><p>- An additional &euro;4 million to support implementation of the Pre-School Quality Agenda which seeks to support high standards through supporting the efforts of providers and their staff in delivering improved and more reliable quality; and to respond to concerns raised by parents;</p><p>- An increase of &euro;1.5 million in funding to address child poverty through the new Area Based Childhood (ABC) programme. This will bring to &euro;4 million the State funding to be invested in this initiative in 2014.   The total budget allocation for the programme over the period 2013 &ndash; 2016 is almost &euro;30 million.  </p><p>- &euro;31m in capital funding to facilitate the continuation of construction work on the new Children Detention School facilities in Oberstown, Lusk, Co. Dublin. The timeline for the project will see the first three residential units available in the third quarter of 2014 and will be prioritised for the transfer of 17 year old boys from adult prison facilities, currently in St Patrick`s Institution. </p><p>Other important areas being supported in 2014 are the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which has a funding provision of &euro;175 million. Some 4,300 pre-school services are participating in the programme and approximately 68,000 children are currently benefiting from it. In addition, in excess of &euro;50 million is also being made available to support the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services by the voluntary youth sector for all young people including those in disadvantaged communities.</p><p>More recently, a further &euro;5 million in capital funding has been made available to my Department in the current year for childcare under the Phase 4 Infrastructure Stimulus which is being introduced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.   I am currently considering the best options for the use of this additional funding and will be making further announcements in this regard in due course.</p></reply>

Interdepartmental engagement takes place at a variety of levels ranging from day-to-day contact between my officials and counterparts in other Departments, up to high level interdepartmental groups addressing issues of national importance.</p><p>It is not feasible to quantify all meetings between officials at all levels given the number and scale of these formal and informal engagements.  By way of example, the Deputy may wish to note that this Department has engaged with other Departments on the following matters:-</p><p>- Establishment of the Child and Family Agency</p><p>- Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children</p><p>- Draft legislation by this and other Departments</p><p>- The Area-Based Childhood (ABC) Programme</p><p>- The &ldquo;Growing Up in Ireland&rdquo; study</p><p>- Guardian <i>ad Litem</i>services</p><p>- National Strategy on Children and Young People&rsquo;s Participation in Decision&ndash;Making </p><p>- The National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence</p><p>- Policy, legislation and service delivery for the children detention schools</p><p>- HIQA business plan/corporate plan</p><p>- Homelessness</p><p>- The Early Years Strategy</p><p>- Obesity</p><p>- School Attendance</p><p>This is by no means an exhaustive list. It serves to reflect our values as expressed in our Statement of Strategy that we will &ldquo;collaborate and innovate across the organisation and with other departments, agencies and sectors to improve outcomes for children and young people, particularly those who are most vulnerable&rdquo;.</p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014-2020, was launched on 16 April 2014 and it is the first overarching national policy framework comprehending the age ranges spanning children and young people (0 &ndash; 24 years).  It represents a whole of Government approach comprising 163 commitments, runs from 2014 - 2020 and will accommodate a number of constituent strategies.  The Framework sets out and centralises common outcomes, it captures policy commitments, prioritises key transformational goals necessitating action and aims to ensure an innovative and effective way of working.  The document also identifies Departmental leaders and stakeholders with regard to those commitments and I expect that, as such, it will require and generate a considerable number of meetings and discussions.  As such it provides a roadmap for future interdepartmental engagement with regard to services for children and young people.</p></reply>
