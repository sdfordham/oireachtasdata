    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-09a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1363" speakername="Kevin  Moran" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017110900054#WRA00700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 26 together.</p>  <p>  I am very aware of the problems that coastal communities face in dealing with the erosion of soft coastline particularly given the severe weather events we have experienced in this country in recent years.  I am aware from my recent visit to Donegal the issues associated with erosion of soft coastal defences.  I can assure the Deputy that work is being carried out to address the problem at both a strategic level and through the local authorities responding to localised coastal erosion issues.</p>  <p>  Coastal erosion is a natural, ongoing process which takes place around the coastline of Ireland.  The Irish Coastal Protection Strategy Study (ICPSS) has surveyed and assessed the coastal erosion risk along the entire national coastline and this information is available to all Local Authorities to enable them to develop appropriate plans and strategies for the sustainable management of the coastline in their counties including the identification, prioritisation and, subject to the availability of resources, the implementation of coastal protection works both of a structural and non-structural nature.  Details of the ICPSS are available on the Office of Public Works (OPW) website www.opw.ie.  Because intervention within a coastal area may cause problems further along the coast, any proposed intervention measures are best developed in conjunction with a formal coastal erosion risk management study which has carefully investigated the problem and explored the full range of possible management options.  The OPW is prepared to fund such studies, where warranted, in advance of any proposed erosion management works or measures.</p>  <p>  The coastal zone management in the area indicated by the Deputy is a matter for Fingal County Council in the first instance.  The Council must assess the problem and, if it is considered that specific measures and works are required, it is open to the Council to apply for funding under the OPW Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  Any application received will be assessed under the eligibility criteria, which include a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of funding.  </p>  <p>  Fingal County Council applied for and was approved funding of &euro;57,800 under this scheme in 2012 to carry out a Coastal Erosion Risk Management Study from Portrane to Rush.  The funding was drawn down in 2013 following completion of the study.</p>  <p>  Following the severe storms of Winter 2013/2014 and on foot of submissions made by the local authority, total funding of &euro;200,000 was allocated by the OPW to Fingal County Council under the Government decision S180/20/10/1272 of 11 February 2014 to allocate funding for the repair of damaged coastal protection infrastructure.  Part of this funding was for a dunes repair project at Burrow beach, Portrane.  I am advised that this project was not proceeded with by the Council at the time and the Council indicated that this would form part of a separate application under the Minor Works scheme.</p>  <p>  The OPW is not currently in receipt of an application from Fingal County Council under the Minor Works Scheme for works at Portrane.  The OPW will liaise with the Council as appropriate in this regard should an application be received.  I understand that the Council is working to identify an appropriate and sustainable solution to the problem at Portrane, with particular reference to environmental considerations, in advance of submitting an application to the OPW for funding to carry out works. </p></reply>

This examination was in the context of the current age of entitlement to the State Pension and the scheduled increases to the State Pension age in 2021 and 2028. </p>  <p>  The Group, whose Report was agreed by Government in August 2016, considered policy around retirement age in both the public and private sectors, examining implications arising from retirement ages now and in the future.  The Group identified a set of framework principles to underpin policy in the area and made a number of recommendations assigned to Government Departments and Employer bodies for follow-up in that regard.  A copy of the Report is available online. </p>  <p>  In respect of the public service, and on foot of one of the recommendations of the aforementioned Report, my Department, with Public Service employers, was tasked with reviewing the current statutory and operational considerations giving rise to barriers to extended participation in the public service workforce up to and including the current age of entitlement to the Contributory State Pension.  In the context of the review, which is well advanced, meetings were held with employers from all public service sectors, including the civil service, local authority and health sectors, supplemented by further interactions and discussions with the employers. Issues in relation to cost, workforce planning, personnel and Human Resource considerations have been considered in the context of the review. </p>  <p>  Future policy in this area will be considered by Government based on proposals which I intend bringing to Government shortly based on the outcome of the review.</p>  <p>  Any change in the compulsory retirement ages for public servants would require primary legislation.</p></reply>

This paper, entitled &ldquo;Equality Budgeting &ndash; Proposed Next Steps in Ireland&rdquo;, looks at the international experience and best practice in this area, and outlines the pilot approach that will be adopted for the current budgetary cycle. </p>  <p>  In line with the international best practice in this area, the intention is to ensure that an equality perspective is integrated throughout the budgetary process.  Consequently, expenditure in relation to the process of budget and policy proofing forms part of the overall cost of the budgetary process rather than being assigned a separate allocation. </p>  <p>  The pilot cycle of equality budgeting will focus on a number of diverse expenditure programmes already in existence across a range of Departments.  The relevant Departments will conduct an assessment of the chosen policy areas with a view to defining high level gender equality objectives and performance indicators for the policies in question.  Responsibility for proofing expenditure programmes is a matter for the individual spending Departments in the first instance. </p>  <p>  The objectives and indicators that have been selected will be published by my Department in the Revised Estimates Volume in December this year.  Progress towards achieving these targets will be reported on in the Public Service Performance Report to be published in 2018. </p>  <p>  The pilot programme of equality budgeting will be reviewed following the 2018 budgetary cycle.  Learnings from the pilot approach will be used to expand the initiative to other expenditure programmes and equality dimensions for the 2019 budgetary cycle. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-09a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017110900054#WRA01700"><p>At the outset I would like to be clear about the Government&rsquo;s appreciation of the important contribution that EU funding has made to the development of the border region and to cross-border cooperation over the last quarter of a century.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform I have responsibility for two cross-border programmes with Northern Ireland, namely INTERREG and PEACE.  These programmes have a combined value of more than half a billion Euro over the period 2014-2020.</p>  <p>  As part of my Department's contingency planning for Brexit, the risks to these programmes &ndash; which are 85% funded by the EU &ndash; were identified.  The Irish Government has been clear about its commitment to the full implementation of the current programmes and to successor programmes post-2020.  </p>  <p>  In the aftermath of the UK referendum my immediate objective was to ensure that current funding would continue.  I was pleased, therefore, that towards the end of last year agreement was reached on a safeguard clause that has enabled funding letters of offers to be issued to programme beneficiaries for both programmes.</p>  <p>  Now that that short term objective has been achieved, my medium term objective is to ensure the full and successful implementation of the current programmes out to 2020, during a period in which the UK is expected to leave the EU.  My long term objective is to secure funding for successor programmes post-2020.</p>  <p>  It was for that reason that in the wake of the UK referendum I proposed to my Northern Ireland counterpart, M&aacute;irt&iacute;n &Oacute; Muilleoir, that we jointly write to the Regional Policy Commissioner, Corina Cretu, to underline the importance we attach to the continuation of EU funding.  </p>  <p>  In December M&aacute;irt&iacute;n and I visited Derry together to see the impact that EU funding is making on the ground.</p>  <p>  And in April I raised the impact of Brexit on the two programmes at the meeting of the General Affairs Council devoted to Cohesion Policy in Luxembourg.  While in Luxembourg I also took the opportunity to have a bilateral meeting with Commissioner Cretu where I impressed upon her the enormous contribution that EU funding has made to the economic and social development of the region, as well as the vital importance of continuing this funding.  I also invited Commissioner Cretu to visit the region to see for herself the impact on the ground.</p>  <p>  These two programmes are well regarded in Ireland &ndash; North and South &ndash; in the UK, and throughout the EU, so I believe the necessary goodwill is there for future funding from the European Union.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-09a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1363" speakername="Kevin  Moran" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017110900054#WRA02000"><p>Responsibility for the overall management and co-ordination to local emergency issues, including flooding events, rests with the Local Authorities. The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government leads the national co-ordination during a severe weather event.  The OPW supports the National Emergency Co-ordination Group when the group is convened to address an extreme weather event.</p>  <p>  The OPW carries out a statutory maintenance programme on 11,500 km of river channel and approximately 730 km of embankments nationally, on arterial drainage schemes completed by the OPW under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 and 1995. </p>  <p>  The Government has invested &euro;325m in major flood defence schemes since 1995 that are protecting approximately 8,500 properties with an estimated benefit to the country of damages avoided of over &euro;1.5bn.  The OPW currently has ten schemes at construction and twenty-six at different stages of design or planning. </p>  <p>  The &euro;40m expended by the OPW's Minor Flood Works and Coastal Protection Scheme for 650 small scale local authority projects is providing flood protection to over 6,200 properties. </p>  <p>  State Agencies continually monitor and, where possible, control river levels within their areas of responsibility, including on the Shannon.  The Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group established in 2016 is trialling the lowering of levels in Lough Allen to complement existing water level protocols in place for Lough Ree.  It is also targeting maintenance works along the Shannon.  These additional actions can help, in a small way, to manage flood risk.</p>  <p>  The OPW&rsquo;s proactive flood risk planning, through the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme is nearing completion.  I would hope by the end of this year to seek the approval from the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform for the 29 Flood Risk Management Plans developed under the CFRAM process.  Thereafter I would hope to announce the proposed structural measures contained within those Plans that will, over the coming years, be taken to detailed design to protect those communities at assessed risk.</p>  <p>  There are a range of other measures already in place to protect against a flood risk, including:</p>  <p>  - improved planning guidelines promoting sustainable planning and development,</p>  <p>  - improved national and local emergency flood response plans, and </p>  <p>  - guidance to households and businesses on planning for a flood event.  The Government&rsquo;s Be Winter Ready campaign is an important aspect of this initiative. </p></reply>

This is important as the performance of the public service has major implications for the management of the State&rsquo;s finances, and for economic development and employment creation.</p><p>The 2014-16 public service reform plan put the public ever more to the centre of what we do both in terms of service delivery and transparency, openness and accountability.  The final progress report on this plan, published in July 2017, was sent to all Deputies and is also available at www.reformplan.per.gov.ie.  The report set out a wide range of improved services for the public and savings across a range of projects.</p><p>Work continues in implementing reforms initiated under the 2014-16 plan including the ambitious programme of reform initiated under the Civil Service Renewal Plan and other sectoral reform programmes.  The CSR Plan aims to create a more unified, professional, responsive, open and accountable civil service that can provide a world-class service to the State and to the people of Ireland.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department is currently developing a new phase of public service reform called Our Public Service 2020 which is expected to be published by the end of the year.  This will build on the achievements of the last six years and allow the public service to better respond to new challenges.</p><p>Our Public Service 2020 aims to deliver better outcomes for the public, to support innovation and collaboration and to build public service organisations that are resilient and agile.  The framework is built on three key pillars.</p><p>- Delivering for our public</p><p>- Innovating for our future</p><p>- Developing our people and organisations</p><p>It will also ensure a continued emphasis on ensuring value for money principles are adhered to across the public service.</p></reply>

This would be the fourth increase in the minimum wage since 2011, and the second under this Government. This increase was confirmed by Government in the context of Budget 2018 and the minimum wage from 1 January 2018 will be &euro;9.55 per hour.</p>  <p>  Pay band data available to the Department indicates that some 94% of all public service staff are on salary points in excess of &euro;25,000 per annum.  The suggested wage at &euro;11.70 per hour based on the Civil Service 37 hour standard net working week equates to an annual salary of &euro;22,589.   </p>  <p>  Data based on Civil Service staff only, which is some 12% of the overall public service, indicates that only some 1% of staff (FTE) in the Civil Service are on salary points less than &euro;22,589.</p>  <p>  Any of those currently on an annual salary of less than &euro;22,589 could also be receiving remuneration in excess of the suggested living wage through additional premium payments in respect of shift or atypical working hours or are on salary scales that progress to the suggested living wage through incremental progression. </p>  <p>  Under the new Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, from January 2018 pay in the public service will be further adjusted.  The pay increases provided for under the Agreement are again progressively weighted towards the lower paid with benefits ranging from 7.4% to 6.2% over the term to end 2020. </p></reply>

This approach allows for systematic examination of existing spending programmes to assess their effectiveness in meeting policy objectives and also to identify scope for re-allocating funding to meet expenditure priorities.</p>  <p>  This year, over 20 analytical papers were produced by officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and some other Departments on significant programmes of current expenditure. In addition, an analysis of expenditure trends in key sectors was also published.  These papers are available on my Department's website at www.per.gov.ie/en/spending-review. </p>  <p>  Work is ongoing to prepare for the next round of the spending review process which will commence in early 2018.  The priority for this round of the spending review is to continue the process of examining existing spending by reference to the principles of efficiency, effectiveness, sustainability and impact. </p>  <p>  The aim is to ensure that the spending review will produce robust evidence based analysis, the output of which, in each work area, will feed into the consideration of expenditure policy.  As was the case this year, the intention is that the spending review analysis will provide a crucial evidence base on key expenditure issues to inform ongoing discussions on Estimates proposals.</p></reply>

This is in addition to the additional &euro;2.2 billion for housing already allocated to the implementation of the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.   </p>  <p>  Consequently between 2014 and 2021 public capital expenditure in Ireland will have more than doubled and as set out by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, this will see public investment in Ireland moving to among the highest in the EU.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that this new planned level of public capital investment represents an appropriate balance between the need for additional investment to realise the economy's long-term growth potential, the capacity of the economy to deliver additional public infrastructure consistent with fiscal and macroeconomic sustainability and the need to adhere to the responsible spending path agreed by Government with reference to the requirements of the EU Fiscal Rules.  </p>  <p>  In the meantime, the delivery of a large number of public capital investment projects and programmes is proceeding and while the position in relation to any individual project is a matter, in the first instance, for the relevant responsible Minister, the review of the 2015 Capital Plan which I published on 14 September, includes an update for each Department setting out the significant progress already being made in relation to implementation.  A copy of the review has been supplied to all Deputies.  My Department also published a major projects tracker, providing an update on progress on all significant projects and programmes with a value in excess of &euro;20m.</p>  <p>  In addition work is advanced by my Department in preparing a long-term 10-year capital plan for consideration by Government in due course.  The primary objective of the 10-year plan is to underpin the implementation of the new framework for spatial policy under the Ireland 2040 Plan.  The assessment of priorities for public capital investment over that period will be strongly informed by the detailed Infrastructure Capacity and Demand Analysis prepared by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) which assessed key drivers of infrastructure demand in the areas of housing. health, transport and education referred to in the Deputy's question.  The Infrastructure Capacity and Demand analysis was published alongside the review of the current capital plan and is available on my Department's website. </p></reply>

To do so would adversely affect the important independent role of the Commissioner.</p>  <p>  However, as the Deputy may be aware, an extensive review of the operation of the Freedom of Information (FOI) framework fed into the development of the FOI Act 2014 which introduced a modernised, consolidated, restructured and more accessible FOI system.  The Act, alongside an FOI Code of Practice, seeks to bring about greater efficiency, consistency and promote best practice in the operation of FOI throughout public bodies.  </p>  <p>  FOI gives rise to significant challenges.  The number, nature and complexity of requests continues to grow.  To support the effective implementation of FOI, the FOI Central Policy Unit at my Department oversees a training framework to ensure consistency in standards and approach. A total of 128 contracts have been awarded with some 8,600 participants receiving training.  The Central Policy Unit also provides ongoing support and advice to citizens and to FOI bodies through its website, www.foi.gov.ie and helpdesk and has presented at a number of conferences and training events.  Networks for FOI Bodies have been established which provide an excellent means of sharing learning and expertise, assisting in the development of common approaches and facilitating the transfer of learning between FOI bodies. </p>  <p>  Some 30,417 FOI requests were processed by public bodies in 2016, a record number and a doubling of the number reached under the previous Act, with some 73% of those requests granted either in full or in part.  It is also worth noting that in only 3% of cases did requesters avail of the review mechanism available to them.  Furthermore, only 1.5% of requesters seek an independent review by the Information Commissioner.  The steps taken by my Department and the low level of appeals gives some indication of the progress being made in the implementation of the 2014 Act and the general satisfaction of requesters. </p></reply>

Among the key reforms of the FOI Act was the removal of the requirement to pay up-front fees for making FOI requests to public bodies and the significant reduction in the cost of applying for internal reviews and appeals to the Information Commissioner.  </p>  <p>  In addition, in relation to non-personal requests, a minimum threshold of &euro;101 was introduced below which no search, retrieval and copying fees can be charged.  This means that if a request is focused and takes no longer than 5 hours to search for, retrieve and copy the records, the requests will be processed free of charge.  Furthermore a cap of &euro;500 was placed on the amount of search, retrieval and copying fees that can be charged (approx. 25 hours being spent on search and retrieval); and a further upper limit at &euro;700 (which corresponds to 35 hours being spent on search and retrieval) above which an FOI body can refuse to process a request, unless the requester is prepared to refine the request to bring the charges below the limit.  The Act also provides for public bodies to assist requesters if the requester wishes to amend or limit the requests concerned in order to reduce or eliminate such charges.  </p>  <p>  Records which contain only personal information relating to the requester (including requests under Section 37(8)) remain free of charge (other than where the grant concerned relates to a significant number of records and in such cases, the means of the requester must be taken in account).</p>  <p>  I consider that these reforms have had a key impact on the number of requests submitted with over 30,000 requests made in 2016 compared to around 10,000 in 2007 and with a 400% increase of non-personal requests in that period.</p>  <p>  I, as Minister, have no role in monitoring or policing the individual decisions of FOI Bodies, including in relation to fees.  Where a decision is made to charge a fee, the requester has the right to seek a review of that decision by the Information Commissioner and there is no fee payable for that review.  Of around 400 reviews referred to the Commissioner in 2016, only 4 (or 1%) related to decisions to charge a fee.</p>  <p>  To support the effective implementation of FOI by FOI Bodies, the FOI Central Policy Unit (CPU) at my Department provides a range of support and guidance.  It oversees a training framework to ensure consistency in standards and approach which has seen over 8,600 participants receiving training and also provides a website, www.foi.gov.ie and helpdesk and has presented at a number of conferences and training events.  Networks for FOI Bodies have been established which provide an excellent means of sharing learning and expertise, assisting in the development of common approaches and facilitating the transfer of learning between FOI bodies.  With particular reference to fees and charges, the CPU has published both Manuals on the processing of requests and a specific Guidance Note on Fees and Charges (CPU Notice 6) in order to assist Bodies in making decisions on fees. These are available on www.foi.gov.ie.</p></reply>

Ireland is 4th in the Euro Area and performs strongly, in 7th position, in the EU behind Denmark (3rd), UK (7th), Sweden (10th), Estonia (12th), Finland (13th) and Lithuania (16th).  Ireland ranks ahead of key competitors such as Switzerland, Netherlands, Luxembourg and Israel.  New Zealand is ranked 1st and Singapore is ranked 2nd.</p>  <p>  This is a positive result for Ireland. It is positive that Ireland&rsquo;s ranking on starting a business has improved by 2 places to 8th.  As benchmarked by the World Bank, Ireland is in the top ten in the world in terms of Ease of starting a business, paying taxes and protecting minority investors.  It is encouraging that the overall trajectory of Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness performance and scores in international measures of competitiveness is generally positive. </p>  <p>  The Institute for Management Development measure of competitiveness ranks Ireland 6th most competitive out of 63 economies.  Most importantly, the strong performance of clients supported by the enterprise agencies in winning exports, market share and job creation in the face of intense global competition reflects the competitiveness of the environment in which to do business in Ireland.</p>  <p>  While we are improving our performance, we cannot be complacent.  Other economies continue to reform and we must continue the implementation of high-level reforms to improve the environment for business competitiveness.  My objective is to ensure the economy is resilient at sectoral and firm level to deal with imminent competitiveness challenges and to build further on the progress we have made in making it easier to start and run a business in Ireland. </p></reply>

This included continuous engagement regarding the initial plans to situate the investment in Athenry and throughout the subsequent planning and legal processes.  The Government has also regularly underlined its support for this valuable project, including at the Taoiseach's meeting with the company's senior management last week.  Although it remains a commercial decision for the company itself to take, I am optimistic that the investment will proceed in the future.  We will continue working with the company in support of that investment. </p>  <p>  The delays that have beset this project have underlined the need to have an efficient and speedy planning process in place in this country.  The Government wants to ensure that similar such projects are not unreasonably delayed again.  That is why it had already been considering ways to avoid a repeat of this situation, including in advance of the recent High Court ruling.

In accordance with the Examination Framework, the Central Bank expects that, for all impacted customers, lenders&rsquo; redress and compensation offers will restore them to the position they would have been in had the detriment not occurred and that they are appropriately compensated for the detriment suffered.</p><p>As per the Central Bank&rsquo;s status update of 17 October, circa 13,000 affected customers have been identified to date through the Examination, the majority of whom will receive their redress and compensation before the end of the year. Prior to the Examination, the Central Bank ensured a further 7,100 cases involving tracker mortgage issues were rectified and remedied.</p><p>The Framework requires that lenders categorise impacted customers by reference to the type and level of detriment suffered. The types of detriment identified range from overcharging due to the application of incorrect interest rates up to loss of ownership of mortgaged properties.  The Central Bank advises that the calculation of redress and compensation proposals for customers can be complex. The Central Bank has challenged all lenders with particular regard to their redress and compensation proposals for loss of ownership situations and as a result lenders have substantially improved their proposals.  Each lender's compensation package is tailored to the specific circumstances of its customer. Given the complexity of the issues identified by the Examination, the scale of detriment suffered is unique to each individual customer, and the level of the redress and compensation payment will, therefore, be dependent on the circumstances of each individual case.  The Central Bank will continue to challenge and use all powers to force the best outcomes for all impacted customers.</p><p>In line with the Central Bank Principles for Redress requiring that all redress and compensation payments are made to customers on an upfront basis, customers can accept the redress and compensation offered and still make an appeal to the appeals panels required to be established by lenders. Customers&rsquo; rights to make appeals to the FSO and through the courts are also preserved.</p></reply>

This is in accordance with section 10 of the NAMA Act which states that NAMA is required to protect or enhance the value of its acquired assets and to obtain the best achievable financial return for the State.</p>  <p>  NAMA advances loans to its debtors and receivers for a range of purposes, primarily for capital expenditure purposes but also for essential current expenditure required to protect the value of assets including remediation works, health and safety requirements, security and insurance. For instance, it has been necessary for NAMA to incur significant expenditure on remediation work so as to enable unfinished or defective housing to be brought to a habitable standard.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that NAMA has advanced &euro;3.6 billion in funds to its debtors and receivers from inception to August 2017, comprising both current and capital expenditure. I am further advised that the majority of loans have been repaid either by the debtor or receiver, or by the proceeds of loan sales. </p>  <p>  I am advised that, of new funding advanced since 2010, &euro;0.6bn is currently outstanding to NAMA and is being actively managed by the Agency, as it relates to debtors whose loans are still held by NAMA. </p>  <p>  I am advised by NAMA that there has been no write-off of new funding advanced by it. The proceeds of an asset sale or of the associated loan sale are invariably greater than the amounts of new funding advanced against the asset concerned. Normally, sales proceeds are applied, in the first place, against new advances made by NAMA and the balance of the proceeds is then applied against the loans originally acquired from the participating institutions.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the realised proceeds from asset or loan disposals reflect the positive impact of any new funding advanced in order to preserve or enhance asset values. NAMA advise that, in the absence of new funding, the assets concerned would have deteriorated in value, the health and safety works would not have been completed and, as a result, the proceeds realised from their disposal would have been less than those actually realised.</p></reply>

In July 2011, on instruction from the Central Bank, Custom House Capital was prevented from carrying out any transactions or making payments to any clients in order to protect the interests of all clients, and prevent any further effect on client investments, until the impact of the issues involved was established. </p><p>On 15 July 2011 the Central Bank sought the appointment of High Court Inspectors to conduct an investigation into the affairs of the firm and assess its financial position, as there were significant concerns about the firm's operations following the identification of new and previously unknown issues.</p><p>Following a detailed investigation, Central Bank High Court Inspectors published a report identifying a range of significant, serious and previously unknown issues, which threatened client interests and made the firm unviable.  This report also recommended the appointment of a liquidator to Custom House Capital as the most appropriate action.  </p><p>On 21 October 2011 the High Court appointed Mr Kieran Wallace, Chartered Accountant, of KPMG, as Official Liquidator to Custom House Capital.  The Official Liquidator was also appointed as the administrator of Custom House Capital for the purposes of and pursuant to Section 33A of the Investor Compensation Act 1998.</p><p>The Official Liquidator was appointed by and is accountable to the Court for the conduct and completion of the liquidation of Custom House Capital. </p><p>The process of establishing legitimate ownership of all investments involves a significant and lengthy reconciliation of client holdings that will take time to fully complete. </p><p>The Official Liquidator continues to undertake reconciliation work on client holdings within Custom House Capital and this can be broadly categorised as occurring in the following order:</p><p>- Segregated cash and equities</p><p>- Other investments, property funds, equity and cash funds, bonds and other funds</p><p>- Segregated property investments (individually owned)</p><p>- Syndicated property investments via SPVs (mainly European properties)</p><p>- Syndicated property investments via Exempt Unit Trusts (mainly UK properties)</p><p>It should be noted that any client wishing to clarify individual investments/holdings will need to contact the Official Liquidator&rsquo;s office directly for information.</p><p>The Official Liquidator&rsquo;s work is overseen by the Examiner's Court and this includes reviewing the costs and progress of the Liquidation of Custom House Capital.</p><p>The Central Bank has, and continues to be, committed to working with all relevant statutory bodies in supporting them in the exercise of their powers in relation to the activities of Custom House Capital and the individuals concerned. Referrals have been made to the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, Director of Public Prosecutions, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Central Bank continues to work with these bodies.</p></reply>

If the consumer is not happy with the resolution of the complaint he/she is entitled to escalate the complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO) who has the statutory powers to investigate complaints against regulated financial services providers.  Further information about the FSO is available at .</p><p>While, the Central Bank does not have a statutory remit to investigate individual complaints of customers of financial services, it does accept and appreciate information from consumers of financial services in the context of its ongoing supervisory work.  In this regard, the Central Bank would welcome any information or evidence that may help its work.  As you may be aware however, due to confidentiality requirements imposed by domestic and EU legislation, which provides for confidentiality of information relating to ongoing supervision and limits disclosure to circumstances specifically provided for in Section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942, it cannot release supervisory information.</p></reply>

Relief has expired for qualifying mortgages taken out prior to 2004 and, with some limited exceptions, the relief ceased for new borrowings with effect from January 2013.  </p>  <p>  Legislation currently provides for the relief to cease for remaining recipients at the end of this year.  I am aware of the financial pressures that individuals continue to face and of the fact that, without any action in the Finance Bill, the relief holders of MIR would have faced a &lsquo;cliff&rsquo; where their relief would have ceased entirely from January 1st 2018.  Therefore, Finance Bill 2017 provides for the relief to be continued on a reducing basis for a further three years, to allow the remaining relief-holders a period of adjustment in which to adapt to the winding-down of the relief.  Subject to the passing of the Finance Bill, the effect of the measure will be to provide for 75% of the current relief to be continued into 2018, 50% of the current relief into 2019 and 25% of the current relief into 2020.  The relief will then expire at end 2020.</p>  <p>  It must be remembered that this relief has ceased for homeowners who purchased before 2004, and that those who purchased their homes from 2013 onwards have never benefitted from the relief.  It is my view that this tapered extension of the relief for a three-year period strikes an appropriate balance between supporting those current recipients and also considering fairness to homeowners who have never benefitted from the relief.</p></reply>

The relief is available, subject to a maximum limit, where farm land is leased to a qualifying lessee for a period of 5 years or more.  In order to qualify as a qualifying lessee for the purpose of the relief, the lessee must not be connected with the lessor, or with any of the lessors if there is more than one.  The rules for establishing whether or not persons are connected are laid down by section 10 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Effectively, this means that a lessor is not entitled to relief where the land is let to family members or family members of their spouse or civil partner.</p>  <p>  The policy behind this restriction is one of anti-avoidance, due to concerns that some may misuse the exemption.  In addition, it was felt that allowing the tax exemption in cases where the land was leased to &ldquo;connected persons&rdquo; may delay succession or lead to the fragmentation of holdings.  In an effort to avoid the misuse of the exemption and unintended consequences, it was decided to limit the eligibility of the tax exemption.  The connected party restriction has applied since the introduction of the relief over 30 years ago.</p>  <p>  While I understand there are cases caught by this restriction which are not seeking to abuse the scheme, the incentive was structured to take on board the usual anti-avoidance measures seen in much of the tax system.  Without this provision the relief would be potentially open to abuse, e.g. the passing back to the lessee of rent on which tax relief had been claimed.  This would not arise on arm&rsquo;s length transactions.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that there are already reliefs from stamp duty and capital acquisitions tax available in the case of permanent transfers of land between family members, such as by gift or sale.

In particular, the Central Bank can, generally speaking, only disclose such information in summary or aggregate form so that individual firms cannot be identified.  The Central Bank has to be careful that any public disclosures made by it do not breach its statutory confidentiality requirements, or prejudice any ongoing or possible future supervisory or enforcement actions.</p>  <p>  However, the Central Bank has advised that the Tracker Mortgage Examination Framework requires lenders to review all mortgage accounts, including those that have been redeemed, sold or transferred to another entity by the lender, together with mortgage accounts where the customer has lost possession of the secured property for any reason (including by way of voluntary and involuntary sale).  Bank staff accounts are included the same as any customer account.  </p>  <p>  As per the Central Bank&rsquo;s status update of 17 October, circa 13,000 affected customers have been identified to date through the Examination.  Prior to the examination, the Central Bank ensured a further 7,100 cases involving tracker mortgage issues were rectified and remedied.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the Examination Framework, the Central Bank expects that, for all impacted customers, lenders&rsquo; redress and compensation offers will restore them to the position they would have been in had the detriment not occurred and that they are appropriately compensated for the detriment suffered.   The Central Bank expects the majority of the 13,000 customers identified to date under the Examination will receive redress and compensation by year-end. Central Bank decisions regarding the groups of customers identified as part of the Examination and disputed by some lenders to date will be issued to lenders by mid-December. </p>  <p>   As at end-September, &euro;120 million has been paid in redress and compensation to approximately 3,300 impacted borrowers.  This is in addition to redress and compensation provided by permanent tsb plc (&euro;36.8 million) and Springboard Mortgages Limited (&euro;6.2 million) to customers pursuant to their Mortgage Redress Programme (MRP), which was required by the Central Bank and predated the Examination.

During the initial phase of the investigation, taxpayers were afforded an opportunity to voluntarily disclose previously undeclared liabilities.  The subsequent phase was undertaken primarily by way of enquiry letters issued to taxpayers on the basis of information relating to transfers to, and from, the State, involving a number of other jurisdictions, which was obtained from financial institutions on foot of High Court orders.  The amount collected by Revenue over the course of this investigation in tax, interest and penalties exceeds &euro;1 billion.  Work is ongoing on a number of cases as part of this investigation.</p>  <p>  As respects question No. 63, I am informed that the international environment has changed significantly in the years since the offshore assets investigation was initiated, with the emergence of closer cooperation between tax authorities worldwide aimed at those who hide their profits or gains offshore.  Initiatives such as FATCA (an Inter-Governmental agreement to share financial account information with the United States), DAC (EU Directives on Administrative Cooperation), and CRS (the OECD&rsquo;s Common Reporting Standard) are all now helping to ensure that tax administrations have greater visibility in respect of the offshore assets and income of their residents.  Revenue inform me that they will make full use of information of this kind to identify and pursue those who have attempted to use offshore accounts, structures or assets to evade their tax obligations.</p>  <p>  In the context of these new information sharing initiatives on off-shore income and assets becoming available to Revenue, it is no longer appropriate to provide incentives to tax defaulters to come forward and to disclose previously undisclosed income or assets. Accordingly, my predecessor, Deputy Noonan, introduced specific measures in the Finance Act 2016 to ensure that, as and from May 2017, tax defaulters whose default relates to offshore matters will be unable to avail of the benefits of the voluntary disclosure regime.  Anyone who did not come forward by 4 May 2017 to regularise his or her tax affairs now faces the prospect of substantially higher penalties, publication in the Quarterly List of Tax Defaulters and possible prosecution.</p>  <p>  Revenue is aware of the recent publication by media outlets of information deriving from the &ldquo;Paradise Papers&rdquo;.   If these papers identify individuals or entities associated with Ireland, Revenue will examine the cases and intervene as appropriate.  This could involve an enquiry letter, an audit or, where there are indications of a tax offence, investigation with a view to possible prosecution.  Revenue will also work in close cooperation with other tax administrations, in the framework of the OECD&rsquo;s Joint International Taskforce on Shared Intelligence and Cooperation, in addressing issues raised by the papers, and will, as appropriate share information under existing legal frameworks.</p>  <p>  As respects question No. 65, I am informed by Revenue that while there is no specific restriction on the moving of data to another jurisdiction, section 886 of the TCA 1997 requires that taxpayers must keep all records that are required to ensure a full and detailed tax return in respect of income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax can be made.</p>  <p>  Records includes any records, accounts, documents and any other data maintained manually or electronically which a person is obliged under the various Taxes Acts to keep, issue, or produce for inspection.  The records must be kept for a period of 6-years, or a greater period if the person has failed to make a return of income, or where a transaction is the subject of an investigation or proceedings.</p>  <p>  I am also informed that section 1078 of the TCA 1997 criminalises failures to comply with the provisions of the various Taxes Acts which require the furnishing of returns of income, profits or gains and the keeping and retention of books, records, accounts and other documents for tax purposes.   Specifically, the destruction or concealment of records from an authorised officer is a criminal offence under section 1078 (2)(h) and (hh) of the TCA 1997.</p>  <p>  It is also an offence under section 1078 to be knowingly concerned in the evasion of tax, or to knowingly deliver any incorrect return, statement, accounts or information in connection with any tax.</p>  <p>  As respects question No. 66, the stories reported by the ICIJ make a number of points about changes in the Irish tax system.   They rightly point out that Ireland has already acted to address definitively the issues around stateless and double Irish companies.  </p>  <p>  Multinational corporations&rsquo; tax planning has been subjected to intensive international examination in recent years, in particular in the OECD&rsquo;s BEPS Project.   Tax administrations worldwide, including many non-OECD countries who have committed to implementing the anti-avoidance recommendations arising from the BEPS Project, have agreed that addressing the global problem of corporations exploiting gaps and mismatches between different countries' tax rules requires the widest international co-ordination.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to working with our international partners to ensure that agreed measures addressing these issues are widely adopted.  Ireland has already taken a number of steps towards implementing the BEPS Actions.  In addition, the Coffey Review sets out a roadmap for implementing the remaining OECD recommendations, beginning with the launch of a consultation process which is now underway, and Ireland will also be implementing the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives, which give coordinated effect to specific BEPS Actions across the EU, to the timelines set out in the Directives.</p>  <p>  Unilateral national actions will not address multinational corporations&rsquo; tax planning.  Attributing international arrangements put in place by multinational corporations to Ireland&rsquo;s role is damaging and inaccurate.  While offering a competitive regime that builds the economy and provides jobs for our people, Ireland continually monitors international tax developments and will take any actions needed to implement enhanced international standards.</p>  <p>  Ireland meets the highest standards in transparency and this has been recently verified, for a second time, by the OECD-led Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes.  In August 2017, following an in-depth Peer Review, the Global Forum again awarded Ireland the highest rating, making Ireland one of only a small minority of the 145-member Global Forum to achieve this rating.  </p></reply>

I also set out the intention, as already announced, that the Government will publish a new 10-year capital plan alongside the proposed new National Planning Framework (NPF) for spatial policy detailed in the Ireland 2040 Plan.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Government has allocated a significant and well-planned, increase in public capital investment amounting to &euro;4.3 billion over the remaining four years of the current capital plan.  This is in addition to the additional &euro;2.2 billion for housing allocated in the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.</p>  <p>  Consequently between 2014 and 2021 public capital investment in Ireland will have more than doubled and, as set out by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, this will see public investment levels in Ireland moving to among the highest in the EU.</p>  <p>  The long-term capital plan will comprise a financial and budgetary plan for public capital investment over the next ten years.  It will contain detailed information on public capital investment projects and programmes already funded over the next four years, on the basis of the allocations announced in the recent Budget.  It will also identify the longer-term public infrastructure priorities which are intended to underpin the achievement of the key strategic outcomes set out in the Ireland 2040 Plan over the period to the late 2020s.</p>  <p>  The NPF which the new 10 year capital plan is designed to help deliver, is the product of extensive consultation, and is a key vehicle for establishing national infrastructure priorities. In addition, as part of the recent review of the current capital plan my Department held an extensive public consultation and has engaged with experts and key stakeholders.  Hence, I am satisfied that both the NPF and 10 year capital plan will represent the product of considerable consultation and public deliberation.</p>  <p>  I fully expect given the constitutional role of the Dail in approving and scrutinising Voted Expenditure that the 10 year capital plan will be subject to extensive discussion and debate in the Oireachtas, including through the work of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, of which the Deputy is a member.</p>  <p>  In this regard the key messages contained in the Committee's report last July on public capital investment were highlighted in the review of the capital plan published in September.  These aligned closely with several of the key themes set out in the review which are informing and guiding the preparation of the 10-year plan.</p></reply>

We must build on progress made in recent years and maintain and renew our focus on Public Service Reform.  It is essential that targeted recruitment and investment in public services is done in tandem with further Public Service reform measures, not least as current and future demographic trends will continue to place demands on public service delivery.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department is currently developing a new phase of public service reform plan called <i>Our Public Service 2020</i>which is expected to be published by the end of the year.  It will set out a series of actions to be delivered out to 2020 and beyond which will both build on the achievements of the last six years and respond to new challenges.</p><p><i>Our Public Service 2020</i>aims to deliver better outcomes for the public, to support innovation and collaboration and to build public service organisations that are resilient and agile.  The framework is built on three key pillars.</p><p>- Delivering for our public</p><p>- Innovating for our future</p><p>- Developing our people and organisations</p><p>The new reform plan also aims to strongly link expenditure with reform.  This is to ensure that real reform is delivered and that there is a continued emphasis on ensuring value for money principles are adhered to across the public service.</p><p>Ensuring value for the tax payer is an important element of managing the costs of public services and maintaining stable public finances. In July this year I published the output of the spending review.  The papers prepared for the Spending Review cover a wide range of policy areas and account for a significant proportion of current expenditure. In total, 21 papers have been produced by officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and other Departments.  In addition, an analysis of expenditure trends in key sectors was also published.  This was the first in a planned series of 'rolling' selective reviews that will take place each year to 2019. </p><p>The aim of the Spending Review process is to examine existing spending by reference to the principles of efficiency, effectiveness, sustainability and impact.  This approach allows for systematic examination of existing spending programmes to assess their effectiveness in meeting policy and reform objectives and also to identify scope for re-allocating funding to meet both expenditure and reform priorities.</p><p>In this way, we can ensure that we achieve real reform across the public service and that value for money is achieved for every euro of public funding spent.</p></reply>

On an on ongoing basis, managing the delivery of public services within budgetary allocations is a key responsibility of each Minister and their Departments.  Important measures are in place to ensure that budgetary targets continue to be met.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is in regular contact with all Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters and there is regular reporting to Government on expenditure levels.  The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored against published expenditure profiles and this information is published each month in the Exchequer Statement.</p><p>As set out in the most recent Exchequer Statement, total gross voted expenditure at end-October 2017 was &euro;46,220 million, which is &euro;375 million below profile, but up &euro;2,001 million (4.5%) in year-on-year terms.  Gross voted current expenditure of &euro;43,308 million at end-October is &euro;159 million below profile but up &euro;1,602 million (3.8%) year-on-year.  Gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;2,912 million at end-October is &euro;216 million below profile, but up &euro;398 million (15.8%) year-on-year.  The Deputy will be aware that 2017 was the third consecutive year in which we were able to increase public spending.  As set out in Budget 2018 last month, this will continue in 2018 with a modest, sustainable increase of just over 4% in spending compared to 2017.</p><p>Since the first public service reform plan was published in 2011, a comprehensive programme of reform has been implemented and this continues to be a key priority.  This is important as the performance of the public service has major implications for the management of the State&rsquo;s finances, and for economic development and employment creation.</p><p>The 2014-16 public service reform plan put the public ever more to the centre of what we do both in terms of service delivery and transparency, openness and accountability.  The final progress report on this plan, published in July 2017, was sent to all Deputies and is also available at <i>www.reformplan.per.gov.ie</i><i><font color="#0000FF">.</font></i>The report set out a wide range of improved services for the public and savings across a range of projects.</p><p>Work continues in implementing reforms initiated under the 2014-16 plan including the ambitious programme of reform initiated under the Civil Service Renewal Plan and other sectoral reform programmes.  The CSR Plan aims to create a more unified, professional, responsive, open and accountable civil service that can provide a world-class service to the State and to the people of Ireland.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department is currently developing a new phase of public service reform called Our Public Service 2020 which is expected to be published by the end of the year.  This will build on the achievements of the last six years and allow the public service to better respond to new challenges.</p><p>Our Public Service 2020 aims to deliver better outcomes for the public, to support innovation and collaboration and to build public service organisations that are resilient and agile.

The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and the Department's own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.</p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  As with other school planning areas nationwide, the demographic data for the South Kildare school planning areas is being kept under ongoing review by the Department to take account of updated data.  It is anticipated that decisions based on the nationwide demographic exercises will be announced before the end of 2017.</p>  <p>  With regard to demand for particular models of school provision, it should be noted that the patronage process for new schools is a separate process which has been in place since 2011.  This process is run after it has been decided that a new school is required.  Parental preferences are central to this process and prospective patrons are required to provide evidence of demand for their particular school model and medium of instruction.  Therefore, where, based on demographics, it might be indicated that a new school is required, it cannot be guaranteed that this would be a school under a particular type of patronage as this will be dependent to a large degree on parental preferences in the area at the time of a patronage process. </p>  <p>  My Department is aware that representatives of Educate Together and the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board recently entered into discussions regarding a possible partnership to provide Educate Together second-level provision in the Newbridge area of South Kildare, where significant additional places are being delivered.  I welcome this development and consider it a great example of constructive co-operation between patron bodies in order to provide greater choice and diversity to the education system.</p></reply>

My Department has no control over the allocation process to schools and is not in a position to influence the allocation process in light of the fact that the NCSE is an independent statutory body.  A school&rsquo;s allocation can increase or decrease and where schools receive a reduced allocation this can be for a variety of factors, such as pupils for whom the school had previously received an allocation have left, or have declining care needs.  In light of this, the employment of SNAs may be reduced from full-time to part-time or may be terminated by way of redundancy where the approved allocation of the school is reduced.</p><p>Where a full-time SNA post within a school is reduced to a part-time post, the issue of redundancy payment in respect of the loss of hours may arise.  Redundancy arrangements for SNAs are set out in Department Circular 0058/2006. </p><p>In addition,  as per the provisions of the Supplementary Assignment Arrangements for SNAs which were established on foot of proposals brought forward by the Labour Relations Commission (LRC) when the Haddington Road Agreement was being agreed and which continue to operate under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 - 2020, and both unions representing SNAs, namely SIPTU and IMPACT, have signed up to that agreement, where a school/ETB has an additional allocation of SNA hours/posts, then that additional allocation of hours/posts must be offered to any existing part-time SNAs in that employment, in order of seniority, before the employer has recourse to recruitment.  These arrangements are set out in Department Circular 0042/2017 (which can be accessed via the link  <i>). </i></p><p>On 5 July 2017, I announced that 975 additional SNAs were to be allocated to schools over the period September to December 2017, a 7.5% increase in SNA numbers in order to meet the level of assessed demand.  This announcement brings the total number of SNAs to 13,990, representing an increase in the total numbers of SNAs of 32%, from 10,575 to 13,990 since 2011.</p><p>In addition, and as announced as part of Budget 2018, funding is being allocated for the recruitment of over 1,090 new SNAs in 2018 (based on current forecasts), including some 130 posts which will be filled in the period between January and June next year, with the remainder being appointed from September 2018.  This brings the total number of SNAs to over 15,000.</p><p>While reduced hours or redundancies will unavoidably occur in individual schools due to a variety of circumstances, these increases in SNA numbers coupled with the operation of the Supplementary Assignment Panel Arrangements make it more likely that SNAs can avoid redundancy and that part-time SNAs can gain or regain full-time employment. </p></reply>

The Act empowers me as Minister to make regulations relating to the operation of centres including the appointment and remuneration of staff which includes the post of director. </p>  <p>  The regulations I recently promulgated under Section 37(6) of the Education Act underpins my Department's policy for the secondment of teachers to Education Support Centres.  These regulations comply with relevant legal and policy requirements.  </p>  <p>  Officials of my Department communicated the introduction and the rationale for the regulations to the Education Centres, ATECI as the representative body for Education Centres and the teacher unions.  Officials met with ATECI and one of the teacher unions and received a written submission from ATECI.</p>  <p>  By way of background, my Department arranges for the secondment of teachers from their teaching posts for the purpose of developing and providing CPD for teachers and for the appointment as Directors of Education Support Centres (ESC's).  Secondments are a temporary arrangement renewable on a year to year basis.  While on secondment, teachers retain their school post, the terms and conditions that apply to teachers and receive their salary and a secondment allowance which are met in full by my Department. </p>  <p>  In 2010, a new policy of secondment was introduced which included a new limit on secondment numbers and established an upper limit of 5 years on the length of a secondment, following which the Directors return to their posts either as a teacher or an inspector.  The policy was agreed by the then Minister for Finance Mr Brian Lenihan T.D., and the then Minister for Education and Science, Mary Coughlan T.D.</p>  <p>  There are many benefits from the revised policy for teachers, their boards of management and the system as a whole.  Because an upper limit of 5 years now applies to secondments, there is:</p>  <p>  - confidence that the teachers involved in the delivery of CPD have recent experience of the curriculum and of the school environment</p>  <p>  - certainty about secondment parameters which assist individual teachers and their boards of management in planning</p>  <p>  There are more opportunities for teachers to take on career enhancing roles in the support services and the Centres.  Teachers returning to their school after a period of secondment have the potential to enrich their school environment and they become eligible to take on subsequent secondment opportunities after a period back in their school.</p>  <p>  Regular turnover of seconded teachers is now an established practice with teachers returning to enrich their schools so the investment in their skills is not lost.  Since 2010, 10 Education Centres have successfully recruited new Directors and the work of the Centres has not been negatively affected.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Kildare Division on 30 September 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 341. There are also 20 Garda Reserves and 29 civilians attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 72 of whom have been assigned to the Kildare Division.  In addition, another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.  </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  The substantial increase in Garda numbers is tangible progress on achieving this Government&rsquo;s vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p><p>I am pleased to say that Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Kildare Division, in the coming years.</p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Some &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure over the period 2016 to 2021.</p><p>The Capital Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021 provides for an investment of &euro;46 million the Garda fleet to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit for purpose fleet. This is in addition to the investment of almost &euro;30 million in the period 2013 to 2015.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Laois/Offaly Division on 30 September 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 324, 8 of whom are community Garda&iacute;.  There are also 17 Garda Reserves and 25 civilians attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 66 of whom have been assigned to the Laois/Offaly Division, 37 of whom were assigned since 2016.  In addition, another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.  </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  The substantial increase in Garda numbers is tangible progress on achieving this Government&rsquo;s vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p><p>I am pleased to say that Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties . There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Community Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Laois/Offaly Division, in the coming years.</p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Some &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure over the period 2016 to 2021.</p><p>The Capital Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021 provides for an investment of &euro;46 million the Garda fleet to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit for purpose fleet. This is in addition to the investment of almost &euro;30 million in the period 2013 to 2015. In the period 2013 to end of 2017 almost &euro;44 million will have been invested in the fleet with some 2,000 vehicles coming on stream in that period. </p><p>This investment in resources will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and increased Garda visibility within our communities and I expect that the Laois/Offaly Division, like all other Garda Divisions will benefit from these new resources becoming available. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Laois/Offaly Division on 30 April 2016 and the 30 April 2017 is as set out in the following table:</p><p><b>STRENGTH OF THE LAOIS/OFFALY DIVISION</b><table><tr><th>DISTRICT</th><th>STATION</th><th>30 April 2016</th><th>30 APRIL 2017</th></tr><tr><td>BIRR</td><td>BANAGHER</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BIRR</td><td>27</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CLOGHAN</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>FERBANE</td><td>5</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILCORMAC</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KINNITTY</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SHINRONE</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>42</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>PORTLAOISE</td><td>ABBEYLEIX</td><td>19</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ARLES</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLYLINAN</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BORRIS-IN-OSSORY</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CLONASLEE</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DURROW</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MOUNTMELLICK</td><td>6</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MOUNTRATH</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>PORTARLINGTON</td><td>11</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>PORTLAOISE</td><td>103</td><td>117</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>RATHDOWNEY</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>STRADBALLY</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>152</td><td>169</td></tr><tr><td>TULLAMORE </td><td>CLARA</td><td>3</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DAINGEAN</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>EDENDERRY</td><td>12</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>RHODE</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TULLAMORE</td><td>74</td><td>72</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>92</td><td>92</td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS/OFFALY TOTAL</td><td></td><td>286</td><td>304</td></tr></table></p></reply>

We are also agreed that an overly long delay in the appointment of a new Commissioner would not be optimal for the organisation in terms of performance and morale.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that the Authority has commenced the groundwork for the recruitment process in advance of the formal triggering of the statutory process by Government.  I see this process taking a number of weeks during which the Authority will engage with my Department and with the Public Appointments Service which will undertake the competition on behalf of the Authority.  Importantly, it will also allow the Authority to explore with the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland how it sees the future role and responsibilities of the new Commissioner.  As the Deputy is aware the Commission is undertaking a comprehensive review of all aspects of policing in the State and has considerable experience and expertise.  I very much welcome the willingness of the Commission to share its perspective with the Authority in advance of completing its work in September 2018.  This will assist in ensuring that potential candidates have as much information as possible in relation to the future direction of policing in the State. </p>  <p>  Subject to the progress that the Authority makes over the coming weeks I would expect that the Government will be in a position to formally approve the Authority to invite the Public Appointments Service to conduct the selection process in the coming weeks.  Once the process is triggered I would anticipate that it will take between four to six months to identify and appoint a successful candidate.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-09a.273.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017110900061#WRH01600"><p>I want to assure the Deputy that I am very much aware of the impact of crime on rural communities, including the serious damage done by organised gangs who target rural areas to engage in burglary and other property-related crime.  In particular, I would like to highlight the good work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to a number of arrests in recent days of suspects for burglaries in rural areas.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and Districts and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.  However, I can assure the Deputy that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that optimum use is made of these resources.  </p><p>The success of the Garda measures to tackle burglary being implemented through Operation Thor is borne out by latest available CSO crime figures which show a very significant decline in property related crime.  It is encouraging to note that since the launch of Operation Thor in late 2015, the CSO burglary figures have shown a significant 30% decrease in burglary for the twelve months of 2016 when compared to 2015.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, Operation Thor involves a broad range of activities to tackle organised crime gangs and other prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime.  This comprehensive operation is supported by the enhanced Government investment in Garda resources, including an allocation of almost &euro;100 million for Garda overtime in 2017.  We have also invested heavily in the Garda fleet, with over 720 new vehicles coming on stream since the start of 2015 and a provision of &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles under the Capital Plan 2016-2021. </p><p>These additional investments in policing make it possible to maintain and extend a range of intensive policing operations, including the continued targeting of burglaries and related crime via Operation Thor. </p><p>Under Operation Thor we have seen over 87,060 targeted checkpoints and 65,960 crime prevention patrols nationwide.  This concentrated policing activity has produced in the region of 6,060 arrests and 6,700 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.</p><p>This Government has also made it a particular priority to strengthen our legislative provisions through the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b></b>2015 which is targeted at repeat burglars who have previous convictions and who are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary.  This new legislation is now available to support the work which is being carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under Operation Thor. </p><p>The Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities.  This is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will be aware that, as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders, including the farming organisations. </p><p>There are a range of partnership initiatives which have been established between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and important rural-based organisations such as the Irish Farmers Association, Muintir na Tire and other rural community organisations.These include the well established Community Alert Programme, which receives annual funding from my Department, as well as the work of the Metal Theft Forum, the Crimestoppers campaign highlighting the Theft of Livestock, the Theftstop initiative in relation to farm equipment, and the highly successful Garda Text Alert Scheme. </p><p>Furthermore, I was pleased to recently announce that an additional &euro;100,000 was being made available to Text Alert Groups, registered with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to provide modest financial assistance with the running costs they incur each year.  This Text Alert Rebate Scheme will be administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re and Groups wishing to participate in the Scheme can find more details at www.muintir.ie. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every District. Community Policing Teams will be made-up of Garda&iacute; from a number of different units who will work with the local community to prevent and detect crime.  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and will enhance the provision of effective Community Policing throughout the country. </p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  The substantial increase in Garda numbers is tangible progress on achieving this  Government's vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p><p>Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p></reply>

The report contained a recommendation that the former Stepaside station in Co. Dublin be reopened on a pilot basis and indicated that, subject to further analysis, the Commissioner is likely to recommend in the final report the inclusion of the former stations at Leighlinbridge, Co.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  In regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division as appropriate.</p>  <p>  I am advised that ratios such as the number of Garda per head of population are not an appropriate tool to use when considering the allocation of Garda resources as they fail to take account of, among other things, the fact that crime levels and types can vary significantly among communities of similar population size. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Meath Division on 30 September 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 293 compared to a strength of 279 on 30 September 2015, representing a 5% increase in the strength of the Division.  There are also 16 Garda Reserves and 29 civilians attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 46 of whom have been assigned to the Meath Division.  In addition, another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, Operation Thor, which is effective in all Garda Divisions including the Meath Division, involves a broad range of activities to tackle organised crime gangs and other prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime.  It is encouraging to note that in parallel with the implementation of Operation Thor burglary figures in particular have shown a significant downward trend.  The CSO official recorded crime statistics for Q4 of 2016 show a 30% decrease in burglary for the twelve months of 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015 - which parallels the implementation of Operation Thor.  Furthermore, in terms of burglary, the decrease in Meath Division for this period is 2% higher than the national average with a decrease in burglary of 32%. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  The substantial increase in Garda numbers is tangible progress on achieving this Government&rsquo;s vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Meath Division, in the coming years.</p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Some &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure over the period 2016 to 2021.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to be aware that on foot of a commitment in the Programme for Government, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, at the request of the Policing Authority, is carrying out a review of the dispersal and use of resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the delivery of policing services to local communities.  The Authority has informed the Inspectorate that the review should take account of:</p>  <p>  - the changing environments in rural, developing urban and suburban areas;</p>  <p>  - the views of local communities;</p>  <p>  - the allocation to and deployment of Garda resources at the local policing level, including the use of the Garda Reserve, Garda facilities and Garda equipment; and</p>  <p>  - relevant recommendations made in previous Inspectorate reports.</p>  <p>  The review will be comprehensive including a consultative process with local communities.  It is the view of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate that the review should be completed within the first half of 2018.</p></reply>

To this end, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in conjunction with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, completed an extensive analysis of the collision history on Ireland's road network.  Sections of road have been identified where a significant proportion of collisions occurred whereby speed was deemed the primary contributory factor.</p><p>Based on this analysis, a set of speed enforcement zones was developed.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na utilises these zones in order to direct speed enforcement activity in a proportionate and targeted manner.  The locations of these speed enforcement zones are in the public domain and are available on the Garda website: <i>www.garda.ie</i>.</p><p>These speed enforcement zones are continually reviewed in light of survey data, collision history and local feedback to ensure that enforcement activity is properly targeted.  Surveys are conducted to ensure the appropriate deployment of safety cameras on roads which have been identified as subject to inappropriate speed and where fatal and serious injury collisions continue to occur.</p><p>In addition, safety cameras are utilised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during day to day enforcement of the relevant provisions of the Road Traffic Acts and as part of specific target Garda operations throughout the country.</p></reply>

The case concerns an appeal taken by the State against a judgement of the High Court ordering the release of the three named prisoners who had been transferred to Ireland from the UK where they had been sentenced, under the provisions of the Transfer of Sentenced Prisoners Acts, 1995 -1997.</p>  <p>  The judgement is detailed and has implications for the continuance in its present form of the process operated by the Irish Prison Service for transferring prisoners from other States to Ireland.  The practical effect of this judgement and whether it will necessitate legislative and/or administrative changes is being examined by officials of the Irish Prison Service and my Department in consultation with Attorney General.  Given the complex nature of the review being undertaken, it is not possible at this stage to indicate a time frame for its conclusion.</p></reply>

Next year will see a continued focus towards our longest waiting patients, and overall waiting list numbers.

The aim of this Register is to find out which type of epilepsy drugs women are taking while pregnant and to collect information on the health of their babies after delivery.  Since 2007, the Irish Register has had a formal link to the United Kingdom Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register.  Women with epilepsy who become pregnant, whether or not they are taking anti-epileptic drugs for their epilepsy, are eligible to register their pregnancy.</p>  <p>  In March of this year, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) initiated a new review of the use of valproate-containing medicines in the treatment of women and girls who are pregnant or of childbearing age.  This review is examining the available evidence and consulting with relevant stakeholder groups.  The most recent component of the current review was a public hearing held at the London offices of the EMA on 26 September.</p>  <p>  In its summary of the public hearing, the EMA noted that the PRAC would consider a number of proposals and ideas presented by participants, including registers of women who were receiving valproate and children who had been exposed to valproate during pregnancy. </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the PRAC&rsquo;s current review of valproate will be concluded before the end of this year.  As soon as the review is concluded, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), which is the competent authority for the regulation of medicines in Ireland, will communicate the outcome and recommendations of the review to Irish patients, healthcare professionals and relevant stakeholders, including the HSE. </p>  <p>  The HSE Clinical Strategy and Programmes Division has developed the National Clinical Programme for Epilepsy, to provide the best value, safe care for all people with epilepsy in the right place, at the right time, sharing the best information available.  The model of care under the national clinical programme includes the development of a very detailed Standard Operating Procedure on the management of women with epilepsy.  It will cover the pathways of care associated with all aspects of pregnancy, contraception and menopause, and includes detailed support for the obstetrics service in the management of seizures and guidance for ante-natal care, including specific information covering the known extra risks of epilepsy associated with pregnancy to both the mother and foetus.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated that this Practice Guide for the Effective Management of Women with Epilepsy will be ready for approval by the HSE before the end of the year. </p>  <p>  In relation to the provision of additional services, the overarching principle governing the planning and delivery of health services, and supports for adults and children with disabilities, is that they should be integrated, as much as possible, with services and supports for the rest of the population.  The Government&rsquo;s agenda with regard to disability is set out in the current National Disability Strategy, which is based on a non-condition-specific approach to the delivery of public services.  The matter of the services available to these patients has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to you.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 10 working days, please contact my Private Office and they will follow up with the HSE.</p>  <p>  Patients currently taking valproate-containing medicines are advised not to stop taking these medicines and, if they have any concerns about their specific drug treatment and management of their condition, to discuss these with a healthcare professional.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-09a.377.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017110900064#WRL02000"><p>Valproate medicines have been authorised in all EU Member States for the treatment of epilepsy; whilst valproate-containing medicines are also approved nationally in Ireland to treat bipolar disorder.</p>  <p>  Valproate medicines should be initiated and supervised by a specialist experienced in the management of epilepsy or bipolar disorder.  It is also recommended that valproate should not be used in women of child-bearing potential unless other treatments are ineffective or not tolerated because of the risk of congenital malformations and developmental disorders in infants exposed to valproate in utero.  Women who could become pregnant should be given medical advice on the benefits and risks of treatments before valproate is prescribed and use effective contraception during treatment.  Clinicians, in consultation with their patient, may consider the therapeutic benefit of valproate to outweigh any possible risks for individual patients where discontinuation of therapy or switching to alternative therapies is not possible or poses an unacceptable risk to the health of that patient and consequentially to the health of the unborn child.</p>  <p>  The Irish Medical Council's Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics requires registered medical practitioners to make sure that, "any treatment, medication or therapy prescribed for a patient is safe, evidence-based and in the patient's best interests".  They should weigh up the potential benefits with the risks of adverse effects and interactions when deciding what to prescribe and should review their patients' treatment regimes periodically.  Registered medical practitioners  are also required to, "keep up-to-date with developments in medication safety."</p>  <p>  In 2014 a review of valproate by the European Medicines Agency, resulted in measures to strengthen the warnings and restrictions on the use of valproate medicines in women and girls, due to the risk of malformations and developmental problems in babies who are exposed to valproate in the womb.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) as the competent authority for the regulation of medicines in Ireland has highlighted the results of previous reviews of valproate and provided revised educational materials for both healthcare professionals and patients.  A warning label for the outer packaging of the valproate containing products was introduced in Ireland earlier this year; products carrying the new external warning label are now being supplied to retail pharmacies. </p>  <p>  In 2015 and again in October 2017, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, as regulator for pharmacists and pharmacies in Ireland, again highlighted the risks of the use of valproate in women of child-bearing age to ensure that those patients are informed and understand:</p>  <p>  - the risks associated with valproate use during pregnancy;</p>  <p>  - the need to use effective contraception;</p>  <p>  - the need for regular review of treatment;</p>  <p>  - the need to immediately consult a healthcare professional if they are planning a pregnancy or if they become pregnant.</p>  <p>  Pharmacists were encouraged to bring these issues, and any other relevant educational materials, to the attention of patients presenting in their pharmacy.</p>  <p>  In October 2016, the HSE's Medicines Management Programme (MMP) launched its &lsquo;Valproate Toolkit&rsquo;, an online resource consisting of a patient information booklet, summary guide for prescribers and a patient/prescriber checklist.  This information highlights that sodium valproate should not be prescribed to girls or women of childbearing age or pregnant women unless other treatments are ineffective or not tolerated.  The MMP continues to monitor the use of valproate by women of childbearing age.</p></reply>

The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card.  Notwithstanding this, I am aware that in recent times some GPs have begun to charge GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances. </p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position, under successive Governments, that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients.  If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient may make a complaint to the HSE Local Health Office, who will deal with the matter in accordance with the HSE's Complaints Policy.</p>  <p>  In order to achieve clarity on this issue, I have asked that any difference of perspective in relation to the provision of phlebotomy services be addressed in the GP contractual review process, which is currently underway.  The aim is to develop a contract which has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion and disease prevention and for the structured ongoing care of chronic conditions.  I look forward to constructive and positive engagements with a view to achieving a satisfactory outcome.</p></reply>

The above requirements shall apply to cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco from 20 May 2019 and to tobacco products other than cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco from 20 May 2024. </p>  <p>  Although the central requirements have been laid down in the Directive, Articles 15(11), 15(12) and 16(2) require the EU Commission to adopt secondary legislation (Commission Implementing Acts) to determine the technical details and key elements of the system, as well as to ensure aspects such as the system's interoperability. </p>  <p>  The EU Commission has published three draft Commission Implementing Acts providing the specifications for the system and discussions on these drafts are ongoing at EU level.

However, since CBD is not psychoactive it is not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs legislation, therefore does not require a licence.  CBD oil is not authorised as a medicinal product, however, it is sometimes marketed as a nutritional or dietary supplement.</p>  <p>- THC is the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis. Under the Misuse of Drugs legislation products containing THC are strictly controlled and possession is unlawful except under licence.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in March 2017, on foot of the conclusions from the Health Products Regulatory Authority&rsquo;s report &lsquo;Cannabis for Medical Use &ndash; A Scientific Review&rsquo;, I established an Expert Reference Group to advise on the development of a Cannabis for Medical Use Access Programme.</p>  <p>  The Expert Group is tasked with the development of clinical guidance for healthcare professionals treating patients through the Access Programme.  The Expert Group is also considering other operational aspects for the implementation of the Access Programme. Officials in my Department are working on secondary legislation to underpin the programme.  This work is well advanced but will take a number of months to complete.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that under the Misuse of Drugs legislation it is open to the Minister for Health to grant a licence to an Irish registered medical practitioner for access to medical THC-based cannabis for a named patient.  The granting of a licence is based on submission of an application to the Minister which is endorsed by a consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient and who is prepared to monitor the effects of treatment over time.  To date two such applications has been successful.</p>  <p>  Ultimately it is the decision of the prescribing clinician, in consultation with their patient, to prescribe or not prescribe any particular treatment, including cannabis, for a patient under their care.</p></reply>

The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as an initial, screening step.  Screening EIAs can be insufficiently specific, giving false-positive reactions in the presence of other similar bacteria, and certain other viral infections, including glandular fever.  In addition, blood samples from patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions can also lead to false-positive results. Samples giving positive or equivocal results in screening tests are further investigated in a second-stage immunoblot (Western blot) tests. Use of immunoblot testing greatly increases specificity.  Using this two stage approach will give a great degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme. </p>  <p>  All clinical (and other) laboratories in Ireland must undergo continuous quality assurance to ensure that the quality of the diagnostics they provide is maintained at the highest international level for human diagnostics.  Some laboratories abroad do not use antibody tests like the EIA (screening ELISA test) and Western Blot and instead will use other types of tests, for example, testing for levels of a specific white blood cell (CD-57) or lymphocyte transformation tests (tests to measure how specific cells in a person's immune system respond when exposed to antigens against Borrelia burgdorferi - the bacterium responsible for Lyme disease).  These types of tests are not currently recommended by international groups such as the CDC, Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) or BIA for a number of reasons:</p>  <p>  1. There is not enough scientific evidence that they are suitable tests to diagnose Lyme disease;</p>  <p>  2. There is no standard method to perform and interpret these kind of tests; and</p>  <p>  3. Positive results in these kinds of tests may be due to other illnesses or conditions and not just Borrelia infection.</p>  <p>  The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC, the Infectious Diseases Society of Ireland, the Irish Society of Clinical Microbiologists, the Irish Institute of Clinical Neuroscience and the Irish College of General Practitioners agreed a Consensus Statement on the Clinical Management of Lyme Borreliosis, which endorsed the previously referenced, internationally recognised set of guidelines (those of the IDSA) to Medical Practitioners to ensure a standardised approach to the diagnosis and management of Lyme disease in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC has established a Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee, the aim of which is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland.  In addition to staff from the HPSC, the membership of the Sub-Committee includes specialists in Public Health Medicine, Consultants in Infectious Diseases, Clinical Microbiology, Occupational Health an Entomologist from the Parks and Wildlife Service, a representative from the Local Government Management Agency, an Environmental Health Officer and, very importantly, a representative from Tick Talk Ireland, the primary Support Group for Lyme disease in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The initial work of the Lyme Borreliosis Sub-committee involved a survey of laboratory methods for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis in Ireland, the development of Lyme borreliosis guidance for general practitioners, the publication of medical media articles to highlight diagnostics and laboratory methods relating to Lyme borreliosis available in Ireland. Material has been produced which is aimed both at the general public and General Practitioners.  </p>  <p>  Any  changes to testing and treatment will take into account the report of the HPSC Sub-Committee.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  The amount of funding allocated to the NHSS in 2017 was  &euro;940m.  This amount was increased to &euro;949.7m in  the recent budget.</p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies.</p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.  This Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners, and when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  These recommendations include examining the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  The programme for a Partnership Government has also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination  against small businesses and family farms.  It is important to remember that the NHSS is largely underpinned by primary legislation  and changes to the NHSS will require legislative implementation.</p>  <p>  On this basis, I have requested legal advice from the office of the Attorney General regarding potential changes to the legislation that will address this matter.  My department has also been cognisant of this matter in the context of this years estimates process.  I have recently met with representatives from the IFA.  to discuss various strategies that may assist with addressing their members concerns and have apprised them of the current progress.  We agreed to meet again in the near future for further discussions.  I am committed to this review of the position with regard to family farms and small businesses for the purposes of the financial assessment of the scheme and I hope to be able to clarify proposed changes before the end of this year.</p></reply>

Indeed EUROSTAT estimates that fertiliser is the third most important expenditure item on EU farms, accounting for &euro;19.2 billion of input costs in 2014.  In terms of Irish farms, the Central Statistics Office 2016 final estimates of Output, Input and Income in Agriculture identifies fertiliser expenditure at &euro;508 million in 2016.</p>  <p>  I have long believed that the elimination of fertiliser tariffs and anti-dumping duties is something that could help farmers reduce their input costs and this is something that I have actively pursued at Agri Fish Council in 2016 and 2017, both with the Commission and in consultation with my Council colleagues. </p>  <p>  At the Agri Fish Council in June 2017, I asked the Commission to address the significant overpricing of fertilisers in the EU brought about by the imposition of anti-dumping duties on imports. </p>  <p>  Against that background I welcome the European Commission&rsquo;s intention to conduct a partial interim review of the anti dumping measures applicable to imports of ammonium nitrate originating in Russia.  The anti-dumping duties on Russian fertiliser imports range from &euro;32.83 per tonne to &euro;47.07 per tonne of ammonium nitrate with Nitrogen being the main nutrient used in Ireland relative to Phosphorus or Potassium.</p>  <p>  I should point out, however, that member States are not ad idem on this point, and that while Commissioner Hogan acknowledged the desirability of bringing about lower prices, he has also  indicated that, despite considerable efforts on his part both with other Member States and internally within the Commission, consensus will be difficult to achieve.</p></reply>

The laboratories also provide valued services and advisory support to the farming community, the food industry and wider society.</p>  <p>  The ambitious targets of the Agri-food industry for growth and development over the next decade, as set out in Food Wise 2025, must be underpinned by robust systems which protect and enhance our reputation as a producer of safe and wholesome food and one of the ways in which we must respond to this challenge is by developing a long-term strategy for the laboratories - building on existing capability and expertise in animal health, food safety and plant sciences, and ensuring we achieve both operational and scientific excellence. </p>  <p>  This was the primary reason for tasking a Working Group led by Prof. Alan Reilly to undertake a comprehensive review of the Department&rsquo;s Laboratories.  This review has considered both the central laboratory complex at Backweston and the eight regional laboratories located at Athlone, Cork, Kilkenny, Limerick and Sligo.  The Group has presented a report to the Department, which makes recommendations on:</p>  <p>  - Oversight and co-ordination of the laboratories activities;</p>  <p>  - Re-organisation of Divisions and support functions within the Central Laboratory complex;</p>  <p>  - Options for the future development of the Regional Laboratories &ndash; with a view to improving disease investigative and surveillance capability but with the over-riding imperative of maintaining and enhancing services to farmers; and</p>  <p>  - Human resources management within the laboratories - with a focus on grading structures, career development opportunities and workforce planning. </p>  <p>  To date no decision has been taken in respect of the options proposed for the Regional Veterinary Laboratories (RVLs).

The Agri-Environmental Scheme, &lsquo;GLAS&rsquo; has over 50,000 farmers participating, addressing climate and other environmental threats such as biodiversity and water quality.  The knowledge transfer programmes aim to bring the latest innovative sustainability research and practices direct to farmers.  Other schemes such as TAMS provide supports for low emission slurry spreading equipment, farm nutrient storage and renewable energy efficiency.  The Assembly also recommended supporting organic farming which is another of our RDP measures.</p>  <p>  My Department is also actively supporting the planting of trees and has set an ambitious target to increase forest cover in Ireland from the current 11% to 18% by mid century.  We have supported the establishment of over 300,000 ha of forestry since 1990 and over 9,000 km of forest roads.</p>  <p>  Food waste, while not directly within the remit of my Department, is part of the Origin Green Sustainability charter which requires companies to draw up independently certified plans which must include specific targets relating to waste management.  The 2016 Sustainability Report identified 4,600 tonnes of waste diverted from landfill and 24,000 tonnes of waste recycled or recovered.</p>  <p>  The suggestion of tax on greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture should be considered against the context of a range of actions being undertaken in fulfilment of the Government's policy of an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land use sector, which does not compromise sustainable food production.  I am also cognisant of the requirement in the Paris Agreement which places an obligation on Parties to foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions development in a manner that does not threaten food production.</p>  <p>  The sector is committed to playing its part and to ensuring that growth continues on the basis of sustainability, however, when considering policy options we must consider the multiple objectives of the agriculture and land use sector and their lower mitigation potential, something that has been recognised in the October 2014 European Council Conclusions.</p></reply>

The profile which is the best estimate of expenditure available at the time is difficult to forecast and may vary significantly during the year for a variety of reasons, such as the level of payments under demand led multi-year schemes, a different level of participation in some schemes than anticipated, the pattern of drawdown of Grants by State bodies, the levels of disease incident and payment of compensation, etc.  A monthly comparison is then reported showing actual expenditure against the profile. </p>  <p>  The recent Exchequer returns for my Department show that there are a number of budget lines, which are, for a variety of reasons, below profile.  The Department&rsquo;s expenditure at the end of October was behind profile by &euro;75m, of which &euro;38.6m is current and &euro;36.4 is capital. </p>  <p>  The profiled current expenditure for the January to October period represents just over two thirds of the voted funds so activity in the next seven weeks is also important, most particularly in relation to Programme B (farmer payments).  In this area almost half of the total annual spend is scheduled to take place in the last 2 months of the year. Expenditure is being monitored and managed carefully with a view to minimising expenditure savings on this year&rsquo;s Vote, in order to avoid spending pressures in subsequent years for multi-year schemes.  The department&rsquo;s staff are fully focussed on ensuring that scheme payments are made to eligible recipients.

It is worth noting that a significant framework of support for farmers with hen-harrier designated land is already in place through my Department's agri-environment scheme GLAS.  Under GLAS, farmers with hen harrier habitat qualify for a payment of &euro;370 per hectare and can earn up to &euro;7,000 per annum through a combination of GLAS and GLAS Plus payments.  The GLAS Hen Harrier action has proved hugely successful, with some 2,678 farmers now signed up.  This accounts for almost 70% of all farmers with hen harrier habitat and represents a major step forward in the conservation of the bird and in securing important additional income for the farmers concerned. </p></reply>

The main aim of the scheme, which began in 2016, is to demonstrate the positive effects that making homes warmer and more energy efficient can have on the health and wellbeing of people in energy poverty who are living with a chronic respiratory condition.  An independent research project will assess the impact the scheme is having.

Premises are separated by colour into 3 categories.</p><p>- The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require State Intervention.</p><p>- The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.</p><p>- LIGHT BLUE areas are part of eir&rsquo;s planned rural deployment of high speed broadband to 300,000 premises.</p><p>The map shows that of the 56 premises in the townland of Ballyhide, 46% fall within the AMBER area, 13% are in BLUE areas and 41% are in LIGHT BLUE.</p><p>Individuals can themselves check whether their premises are in an AMBER, BLUE or LIGHT BLUE area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>.  The premises at the Eircode detailed by the Deputy is in the LIGHT BLUE area and is part of eir's planned rural deployment of high speed broadband.  </p><p>My Department is engaged in an on-going procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network for the State led intervention. A significant milestone in that process was reached in September with the submission of &quot;Detailed Solutions&quot; by two bidders.  This is the last stage of the procurement process before receipt of final tenders and ultimate progression to the appointment of a preferred bidder(s).</p><p>To improve both mobile and broadband services in rural Ireland in advance of the roll-out of the high speed broadband network to be built in the State intervention area I established, in July 2016, a Task force to identify solutions which can be implemented in the short, medium and long term to alleviate mobile phone and broadband coverage deficits, to identify priority areas for roll-out and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers.  These solutions will enhance the existing services prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the NBP State-led intervention. </p><p>Under this Task force, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

I have therefore forwarded the question to the Port of Waterford Company and, with regard to Rosslare Europort, to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann for direct reply. </p>  <p>  The impact of Brexit on shipping and on Irish ports will be dependent on the outcome of EU-UK negotiations.  Ports are aware of the possible negative implications Brexit may have on the movement of goods and people and are working with relevant agencies to try and avoid undue delays.  In line with normal business planning, ports review their infrastructural requirements on a regular basis. </p>  <p>  My Department held a Workshop in April on the impact of Brexit on maritime transport, regulation and on the sectors on which this impacts.  Stakeholders, including Rosslare Europort and Waterford Port, were invited from organisations across the broader maritime sector, such as merchant shipping, national shipping, fishing vessels, recreational craft, ports, equipment suppliers, service providers and training providers.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department, in conjunction with the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO), is commencing a study into the use of the UK Land bridge by Irish importers and exporters.  The purpose of this research is to establish the volume of traffic using the UK Land bridge at present, the likely consequences that Brexit will have on Land bridge usage and the various alternative options that may be viable.  I expect this piece of research to be completed in Q1 of 2018. </p>  <p>  My officials will continue to work with the maritime sector and with other stakeholders to identify and plan for the implications of Brexit.</p></reply>

That said, while all candidates had relative strengths and weaknesses that were subject to comment within the report, it is very clear that Rugby World Cup Limited (RWCL) was hugely impressed by the quality of the bid put forward on behalf of Ireland.</p><p>Ireland scored top / joint top in 12 of the 21 scored categories, second in two and in all cases met or exceeded RWCL requirements.  Ireland's bid included proposals for Transport and Information Technology and while there was some comment about the lack of current provision, the plans for delivery of the tournament ensured that Ireland met or exceeded the requirements for hosting a successful Rugby World Cup. </p><p>In that regard, I was pleased to see that the Evaluation Report acknowledged the quality of Ireland&rsquo;s plans, and our ability to stage a successful event in 2023, stating as it does &lsquo;any of the three candidates could host a successful Rugby World Cup&rsquo;. </p><p>I would hope that a majority of World Rugby Council members, who will vote on November 15th, will place their trust in Ireland to deliver an outstanding Rugby World Cup 2023.  Appropriate engagement with various Rugby Unions will continue over the coming days ahead of the concluding vote.</p><p>Together with the Irish Rugby Football Union the Government will, in the coming week, strongly relay Ireland&rsquo;s compelling proposition to World Rugby Council members  ahead of the vote on November 15<sup>th</sup>as the team competes to turn our historic bid plans into reality.</p></reply>

Additionally, the communication refers to the affordability of childcare to families in disadvantaged areas and the need for additional funding in relation to payment for out of school time activities and services.</p><p>  Concerning the changes in the CE scheme, &euro;1m in funding has been made available to services that may find themselves unsustainable under the 2016 Regulations.  Two phases of funding were made available in the 2017 budget to aid community childcare providers as a result of these regulatory developments; phase one related to HR and recruitment support, while phase two is being provided on foot of a detailed financial analysis of services. </p><p>The application for phase two of CE funding, from the service in question, has been provisionally approved, and they will shortly receive a communication outlining the next steps required to complete the funding process.  However, to be eligible for receipt of CE Sustainability funding and childcare supports a service is required to have the correct legal status.  Therefore, our assessment process for this stream of funding includes checks regarding the legal structure and governance structures of applicant services.  At the time of application the service in question was not a registered company, and therefore their application could not be progressed until the issue was resolved.  As the service was aware of this issue in advance of application, the resultant delays were out of the Department&rsquo;s control, and could have been averted following appropriate notification and engagement from the service in question. </p><p>In respect of the wider sustainability issues identified in your communication: In September 2017 subvention rates under the targeted schemes rose by 50%, and an additional universal subsidy to the amount of &euro;20 a week per child was also made available.  This increase in funding will provide support for parents in low paid employment and training or education by enabling qualifying individuals to avail of reduced childcare costs at participating community childcare services.  In addition, &euro;3.5m in Programme Support Payments have been allocated to all childcare providers who register for the enhanced (September) childcare measures.  There is a commitment to pay this additional &euro;3.5m between September and the end of this year.  This will therefore bring the total payments in respect of &lsquo;Programme Support Payments&rsquo; in 2017 to &euro;18m.</p></reply>

In the other 25 areas, the Local Action Group is a Local Community Development Committee (LCDC), with the Local Authority as the Lead Financial Partner and one or more Local Development Companies operating as the Implementing Partners.  My Department understands that the LCDCs have the power to enter into contracts as are necessary for, or incidental to, the performance of their functions. </p>  <p>  To date, 429 projects have been fully approved by the LAGs for funding. The approach to the issuing of contracts is a matter for each individual Local Action Group.  However, I would expect that most of these projects have already been issued with, or will soon receive, a contract for funding. </p>  <p>  My Department does not have details regarding the number of contracts that have been signed at this stage.  Information regarding the date that the contract enters into effect is provided by the Local Action Groups when the first claim for payment is made for each individual project.</p></reply>

In that regard, it became clear earlier this year that project promoters and Local Action Groups had specific concerns regarding the implementation of the programme, including the application process and associated criteria. </p>  <p>  In light of those concerns, a forum was held in May with participants from all of the Local Action Groups and the Local Development Companies delivering LEADER.  The forum provided a platform to review the operation of the LEADER programme, to explore the administrative issues impacting on project approvals, and to identify potential solutions to the issues identified.</p>  <p>  Arising from the forum, my Department identified a series of 31 actions designed to improve programme delivery.  Most of the measures have already been introduced, while the remainder are being progressed in collaboration with the Local Action Groups and their Implementing Partners where appropriate. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that these actions are far reaching and will result in very significant changes to the way the programme is delivered, making the application process easier for all concerned.  I am regularly updated by my Department regarding the impact of the changes and the level of progress in approving projects under the programme.  While the changes need to be given time to take full effect, I am pleased to note that there are now 429 projects approved for LEADER funding of almost &euro;11 million, compared to projects with grant aid of less than &euro;1 million in the first 6 months of the year.</p>  <p>  Progress on the delivery of the LEADER Programme was discussed by the Monitoring Committee on the Action Plan for Rural Development at its meeting of 26 October.  There was general agreement at that meeting that progress was being made in implementing the actions and that their full effect should be seen in the coming months.  </p>  <p>  Other mechanisms for reviewing the delivery of the LEADER programme include annual reporting to my Department by each Local Action Group on progress in the delivery of their Local Development Strategies.  An evaluation of the LEADER Programme is also provided to the EU Commission each year as part of the Annual Implementation Report on the Rural Development Programme. </p></reply>

The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household. </p>  <p>  The fuel allowance scheme is widely advertised.  To qualify for a fuel allowance, a jobseeker must satisfy a number of conditions, including being in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for at least 391 days (time spent on jobseeker's benefit can make up the 391 days).  It should be noted that free fuel application forms are issued automatically to jobseekers who reach 391 days of unemployment.  Accordingly, the onus is on a jobseeker to apply for the fuel allowance if they consider themselves eligible.  Further information on eligibility is available on www.welfare.ie.</p>  <p>  Participants on T&uacute;s and other employment support schemes can be paid the fuel allowance where they applied for and were awarded the allowance prior to commencing on the scheme and where they satisfy or continue to satisfy the conditions.  I would like to reiterate that claimants moving to T&uacute;s cannot accrue entitlement to the fuel allowance while on the scheme e.g. a person moving from jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance with less than 391 days.</p>  <p>  However, if there is a change in circumstances e.g. where the T&uacute;s participant has an underlying entitlement to fuel allowance, but is not in receipt of the allowance because another member of the household was receiving it, if the fuel recipient is no longer residing at the address, then it is open to the T&uacute;s participant to apply for the fuel allowance.  In these circumstances, the fuel entitlement can be reviewed and awarded provided the participant satisfies all conditions for receipt of fuel allowance.</p>  <p>  The guidelines for the fuel allowance scheme are kept under review.  Any decision to extend the eligibility criteria for fuel allowance to allow persons on T&uacute;s to accrue entitlement to the allowance while on the scheme would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household. </p><p>To qualify for a fuel allowance under the fuel allowance scheme, a person must satisfy a number of criteria including being resident in the State, having primary responsibility for the heating of a household and<b></b>being in receipt of a qualifying payment. </p><p>A fuel applicant and members of his/her household may have a combined assessable income of up to &euro;100 a week above the appropriate rate of State Pension Contributory and qualify for a payment.  All non-contributory recipients are accepted as satisfying this means test. </p><p>Fuel applicants must also satisfy the household composition criteria, i.e., they must live alone or only with the following:</p><p>- a qualified spouse/civil partner/cohabitant or qualified child(ren);</p><p>- a person in receipt of a qualifying payment who would  be entitled to the allowance in their own right;</p><p>- a person who is receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance or Carer&rsquo;s Benefit in respect of providing full time care and attention to the Fuel Allowance applicant or their qualified spouse/civil partner/cohabitant or qualified child(ren);</p><p>a person receiving short term Jobseeker's Allowance (JA) or Basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance (less than 391 days for JA and less than 15 months/456 days for Basic SWA).</p><p>Therefore a social welfare dependant who is living with someone other than those listed above would not be entitled to the fuel allowance.  </p><p>The new weekly telephone support allowance (TSA) of &euro;2.50 will be paid from June 2018. People in receipt of both the living alone increase and fuel allowance will automatically qualify for the TSA.  It is expected that approximately 124,000 customers will qualify for the scheme at a cost of &euro;16 million in 2018.</p><p>A central objective of the TSA is to allow the most vulnerable people access to personal alarms or phones for security.  The allowance will also encourage social contact and assist in the prevention of social isolation for those living alone.</p><p>Therefore as stated above only customers who are in receipt of fuel allowance and the living alone increase will receive the new weekly TSA.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Other contributory factors include the continuing improvement in the economy leading to fewer people seeking support due to retaining and securing long-term employment allied with people exiting rent supplement through activation and securing job opportunities.

Contractors have no role in the decision making process.  The process with regards to such decisions includes written / verbal warnings and an opportunity for the jobseeker to re-engage with the services prior to the application of a reduced payment rate.</p>  <p>  Up to the end of September approximately 7000, or 5.8% of all clients who engaged with the JobPath service have had, at some point, a penalty rate applied to their payment:  some of these clients may have had the penalty rate applied after finishing their engagement period with the JobPath service, so the actual numbers who have had a penalty rate applied while with the JobPath service will be lower.  Application of penalty rates is not routinely recorded on a county basis but will be sourced and provided to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the deputy.</p></reply>

We need to ensure that any proposed approach does not cause further anomalies or disadvantages to arise, or hinder the move to a Total Contributions Approach.  We also need to determine, as best we can, the cost of any such approach and how that cost can be financed in the future.  </p><p>It is worth remembering that the 2012 rate bands more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place prior to that and people with only 20 years of contributions over nearly 50 years will still get an 85% pension.  </p><p>Reverting to the pre-2012 bands would move additional resources to people who already have means, and it is estimated that it would result in an annual cost of well over &euro;70 million in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10-12 million each following year.</p><p>Spending on State pensions has increased rapidly in recent decades.  This year, the cost is &euro;7.3 billion.  This is estimated to increase by &euro;1 billion every five years due the increased number of pensioners.  These projections mean that there are considerable sustainability and affordability challenges in the years ahead and we must start to address them now.</p><p>Accordingly, I want to ensure that any approach taken is fair and sustainable in the long term.</p><p>I hope that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

All attendees had an opportunity to raise any concerns they had about service delivery under the new model.

Under the Act, planning authorities are required to establish a register of vacant sites in their areas, beginning on 1 January 2017, and to issue annual notices to owners of vacant sites by 1 June 2018 in respect of vacant sites on the register on 1 January 2018.  The levy will be applied by planning authorities, commencing on 1 January 2019 in respect of sites which were vacant and on the vacant site register during the year 2018 and will subsequently be applied on an annual basis thereafter, as long as a site remains on the vacant site register in the preceding year.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2018, an increase in the rate of the levy was announced.  Under the new arrangements, the levy will be applied at the rate of 3 per cent of the market value of a vacant site from January 2019 for sites entered on the vacant site register of a local authority in 2018.

For that reason housing has been made a top priority through the development and implementation of the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.This priority has been reinforced further through increased capital and current funding for housing.  Following Budget 2018, over &euro;6bn has been ringfenced for housing between 2016 and 2021.</p><p>Under the Action Plan we have set clear, measurable and ambitious targets, including to: </p><p>- Double the annual level of new homes built to 25,000 by 2020; </p><p>- Deliver an additional 50,000 social housing units in the period to 2021; and</p><p>- Meet the housing needs of some 87,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment.</p><p>Significant progress has been made since Rebuilding Ireland was in the programme of social house building.  All the relevant indicators &ndash; including planning permissions, construction commencement notices and connections to the ESB grid - are showing very significant upward trends.Planning permissions are up almost half on the same period last year and commencements are also up over 40%. </p><p>The rent pressure zones introduced at the beginning of this year have led to a capping of rent inflation below 4%, which is a significant decrease when compared with the increase of more than 8% last year. </p><p>Over 19,000 new social housing solutions were provided in 2016, with a further 21,000 such supports to be delivered in 2017.  </p><p>Strong supply-side measures are also beginning to have a positive impact, such as the &euro;226m Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF); a streamlined planning process for large-scale housing developments; and other planning reforms to provide flexibility to deliver viable housing schemes and apartment developments in the right locations. </p><p>Notwithstanding this wide-ranging platform of action, significant challenges remain and, one year on from Rebuilding Ireland&rsquo;s publication, I initiated a focused review of the Action Plan.  A number of themed initiatives have already been announced as part of the review.  </p><p>In relation to social housing and homelessness, these include -</p><p>- The increase in social housing build, with the target for 2018 of c.3,000 newly built homes increasing by almost 30% to 3,800 new homes;</p><p>- Additional emergency accommodation and family hubs to meet the short-term needs of homeless households; and,</p><p>- The establishment of a new Homeless Inter-Agency Group.</p><p>Further measures have also been signalled in relation to the rental sector, including:</p><p>- A further extension of Rent Pressure Zones;</p><p>- An enhanced regulatory role for the Residential Tenancies Board; </p><p>- A reinforced awareness campaign to ensure wider awareness by tenants of their rights, an important measure in terms of homelessness prevention; and</p><p>- Additional legislative and other measures to strengthen the protections available to tenants and to address issues in relation to short-term lettings.</p><p>The Government re-inforced its commitment to delivering on housing through the allocation of very significant funding under Budget 2018.  In total, I have secured &euro;1.9 billion for housing next year, an increase of &euro;600 million, or 46%, on 2017.  This represents an increase of 62% on the capital side to build new homes and 35% on the current side  to support homelessness, as well as supporting households into new social housing tenancies.</p><p>Looking beyond 2018, I have secured an extra &euro;500 million for capital investment in social housing in the years 2019 to 2021 allowing the Rebuilding Ireland social housing target to be increased from 47,000 to 50,000 homes.</p><p>Budget 2018 removes the remaining significant obstacles to building more homes, more quickly and at more affordable prices: by investing more in direct house building by the State; by removing the capital gains tax incentive to hold on to residential land; by escalating penalties for land hoarding; by introducing new affordability measures; and by providing a new, more affordable finance vehicle for housebuilding, through Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI), which will provide finance at commercially competitive rates to developers with sites ready to go but who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining funding. </p><p>A second phase of LIHAF supported by &euro;50 million in funding will unlock even more sites.  A new fund of &euro;25 million will be provided over 2018 and 2019 to unlock local authority-owned land specifically to deliver affordable housing on those sites using models such as co-operative housing that have already proven to be successful but are now needed on a much greater scale.  My Department is currently drawing up the criteria for access to this scheme, to be announced in the coming weeks.</p><p>I believe that this Government's commitment to tackling housing has been clearly demonstrated in terms of the delivery on Rebuilding Ireland and the resources that have been allocated.My focus and that of all delivery agents will remain firmly on implementation and delivery to maintain and accelerate housing output.</p></reply>

These regulations focus on tenant safety and include new measures covering heating appliances, carbon monoxide and window safety.  In August, my Department published a guidance document to assist and support local authorities in implementing the 2017 regulations.</p>  <p>  Additional resources for inspection and enforcement are also being provided.  Over the four years to the end of 2017, a total of &euro;7.5m has been provided to local authorities for inspection purposes.  However, the rental strategy recognised the need for additional resources to support increased inspection of properties and ensure greater compliance with the regulations.  Provision has been made to start this process with an allocation of &euro;2.5m in 2018.  The intention is to earmark further increases over the period to 2021, by which point it is envisaged that &euro;10m will be provided annually, achieving an inspection coverage of 25% of rental properties each year.</p>  <p>  The issues of inconsistency and differences in capacity across local authorities are being addressed under the Rental Strategy.  Work is underway to build a more efficient, standardised and transparent inspections and enforcement approach across all local authority areas.  My Department, the Residential Tenancies Board and local authorities are working together to develop a national system of shared support services covering ICT, legal services, training and capacity development and resource and performance management.  This will mean that best practice approaches that work well in some local authorities will be developed and replicated across the system, taking advantage of economies of scale and ensuring that all local authorities have the appropriate personnel and systems in place, not only for inspection but also to act promptly and effectively when non-compliance is found.</p>  <p>  It is also my intention to introduce further measures to ensure that landlords meet their obligations in relation to quality, safety and compliance with regulations and standards.  Landlords, when registering a tenancy with the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB), will be required to certify that the property in question is compliant with regulations relating to standards for rental accommodation, overcrowding and fire safety.  In tandem, annual registration with the RTB will be introduced, effectively requiring annual certification by the landlord.  Failure to provide this certification, failure to register the tenancy or the provision of an untrue certification will all constitute offences, prosecutable by the RTB.</p>  <p>  The 1966 Housing Act already establishes effective limits on the numbers of people that can occupy the same bedroom.  The Act requires that there is at least 400 cubic feet of free air space for each person in a bedroom.  It also provides that people of opposite sexes, who are not living as a couple, cannot be required to sleep in the same room.</p>  <p>  The local authorities are responsible for enforcement.  Under the Act, a local authority can prohibit the use of an overcrowded dwelling, irrespective of whether it is being let or not, and can serve notice on the owner of a dwelling specifying the maximum number of persons that may occupy it without causing overcrowding.  If the owner of a house is causing or permitting the house to be overcrowded, the authority can require the owner to desist from causing or permitting such overcrowding within a period not exceeding twenty-one days.  Any person who neglects or refuses to comply with these requirements is guilty of an offence.</p>  <p>  In the context of legislative changes in relation to the rental sector, particular attention will be given to possible amendments to the provisions in relation to overcrowding, both in terms of its legal definition and the enforcement actions and sanctions applicable to such situations.</p></reply>

The majority of this funding supported the ongoing costs of tenancies established in 2015 that continued into 2016, and the costs of the 12,075 new households supported by the scheme in 2016.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 increased the Exchequer funding for the HAP scheme to &euro;152.7 million, in order to meet the continuing costs of existing HAP households, and the costs of the additional 15,000 households, targeted under Rebuilding Ireland, to be supported by HAP in 2017.  I expect this allocation to be be expended in full.</p>  <p>  The 2017 average monthly rent paid to landlords under the HAP scheme (up to the end of Q2) was &euro;688.  However, it should be borne in mind that the roll-out of the HAP scheme was not fully implemented until 1 March 2017 with the introduction of Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council and D&uacute;n Laoghaire - Rathdown County Council.</p>  <p>  Budget 2018 has increased the Exchequer funding for the HAP scheme by &euro;149m to &euro;301 million.  This will allow for the continued support of existing HAP households and also enable the additional 17,000 households targeted under Rebuilding Ireland to be supported by HAP in 2018, as well as supporting the roll-out of the HAP Place Finder Support Service across the country.</p></reply>

As such, tenants accommodated by a local authority in a RAS arrangement are deemed to have their housing needs met.</p>  <p>  However, it was recognised that tenants who were allocated RAS accommodation prior to 1 April 2011 may have had expectations that they would remain on the main housing waiting list and be eligible for other forms of social housing support.  Accordingly, my Department issued guidance to local authorities at the time, recommending that RAS tenants who wished to transfer to other forms of social housing support be given this opportunity via the creation of a transfer list option.</p>  <p>  The principle being applied was that the reasonable expectations of these households should be preserved and they should be placed on a transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the main housing waiting list.  This list, whilst being a &lsquo;transfer list&rsquo;, would reflect the specific priority/previous position that that household had on the main waiting list within the authority area in which they are resident.  Local authorities are responsible, in the context of their individual schemes of letting priorities, for managing the operation of their transfers lists.</p>  <p>  Since its introduction, RAS has provided and continues to provide high quality accommodation to many thousands of households.  It remains an important delivery mechanism to meet social housing need in the context of the targets for delivery set out in the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.</p></reply>

No payment is made by my Department in respect of inactive dwellings.  A property under a lease or availability agreement may become vacant because a tenant has moved to other accommodation or is deceased.  During the period of vacancy the local authority will undertake to allocate the property to another household in accordance with its scheme of letting priorities and on occasion, repair work may be required before it can be relet.</p><p>Under the Housing Assistance Payment scheme (HAP), a tenant sources their own accommodation, and the tenancy agreement is between the tenant and the landlord and is covered by the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended).

The limits also reflect a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn and thereby promote sustainable communities.</p><p>Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.  The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p><p>As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of the income eligibility limits for social housing supports has commenced.  I would expect the results of this review to be available for publication in 2018.</p><p>The Government is very aware of the general rise in house prices and in response, my Department has examined housing affordability in consultation with the Housing Agency, local authorities and other stakeholders as part of the targeted review of Rebuilding Ireland.  The review is now at an advanced stage and I expect to be in a position to announce details of the outcome, including any additional measures, in the coming weeks.</p><p>It is important to note that there are currently two house purchase loan offerings available to lower income first time buyers from local authorities.</p><p>The first is a standard annuity mortgage available from all local authorities.  The relevant terms and conditions applying to local authority housing loans are set out in the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2012.  Key eligibility criteria provide that a loan applicant must be a first time buyer and must be able to show their local authority that they cannot get a loan from a bank or building society.  Also, the gross income (before tax) of a single income household in the previous year must be &euro;50,000 or less and the combined gross income (before tax) of a two income household in the previous year must be &euro;75,000 or less.  The loan is subject to a maximum amount of &euro;200,000 and can be used to finance up to 97% of the purchase price of a new or second hand property or the applicant can use it to finance the building of their own home.  Further more detailed information is available from all local authorities.</p><p>The second option is the Home Choice Loan, a Government-backed mortgage for first time buyers.  First time buyers can apply for a Home Choice Loan to purchase a new or second hand property or build their own home.  Home Choice Loan provides up to 92% of the market value of a property purchased, subject to a maximum loan amount of &euro;285,000.  Home Choice Loan offers one variable interest rate.  The rate is currently set at 3.25% variable, APR 3.30%.  Further information is available at .</p></reply>

The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 provided for the Rent Predictability Measure and for areas, called Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs), where rents can now only rise by a maximum of 4% annually for a period of 3 years.</p>  <p>  This measure was implemented immediately in the four Dublin local authority areas and in Cork City as these areas already met the criteria for a Rent Pressure Zone in December 2016. A further 12 Local Electoral Areas (LEAs) were designated in January 2017, with the measure further extended to Maynooth and Cobh LEAs in March 2017 and to Drogheda and Greystones LEAs in September 2017.</p>  <p>  The data collected by the Residential Tenancies Board to produce its Rent Index Data shows that although there is still volatility in rental trends from quarter to quarter, the rate of increase in rents has slowed measurably since the designation of RPZs.</p>  <p>  In addition a number of significant changes are being made to the Rent Pressure Zone system following a recent review. Charging rents above those permitted by the legislation will become an offence and the RTB will be provided with the powers to investigate and prosecute transgressors so that it will no longer be solely up to the tenant to initiate a dispute.  The conditions under which properties can be exempted from the rent increase limits will be more closely specified and landlords will have to notify the RTB when claiming an exemption.  These changes will strengthen the impact of the Rent Predictability Measure and  will further slow the growth in rents.  </p>  <p>  To deal with the issue of affordable rents on a longer term and sustainable basis, my Department, reflecting the commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government and the Strategy for the Rental Sector, will lead an Expert Group to develop a viable cost rental model for the Irish rental sector taking into account the work already completed in this area, including by the National Economic and Social Council and others.  This Group will address issues such as funding mechanisms, the need to grow the necessary institutional capacity, particularly within the AHB and not-for-profit sector (whether through mergers, new entrants or strategic partnerships), rent levels, the households to be targeted and the appropriate regulation mechanisms.</p>  <p>  The Expert Group will assess the benefits that a larger and more developed not-for-profit segment would bring to the rental sector and the housing system, by increasing supply of rental accommodation for low to middle-income households and ensuring new capacity is developed. Following the conclusion of the focused review of Rebuilding Ireland, it is my intention to establish this Expert Group in the coming weeks. A proposal regarding its membership and terms of reference is currently being finalised in my Department.</p></reply>

No. 408 of 2012).  To support local authorities in operating their housing loan scheme in a consistent and efficient manner, the Housing Agency provides a central credit assessment  service to local authorities.  The final decision on loan approval is a matter for the relevant local authority and its credit committee on a case-by-case basis and in accordance with the relevant statutory credit policy that underpins the scheme. Decisions on all housing loan applications must be made in accordance with this statutory credit policy in order to ensure prudence and consistency in approaches in the best interests of both borrowers and local authorities as lenders alike.</p>  <p>  The Local Authority House Purchase Loan is not, as a general rule, available to those whose sole income relies on social welfare benefits.  However, where there is a primary income of a permanent waged or salaried nature and where the secondary income is from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP), then long-term social welfare payments can be considered, provided that the long-term nature of the payment is confirmed by the  DEASP or other relevant Government Department.</p></reply>

The report was primarily a desktop review of available information and broadly sets out an overview of the organisations involved in delivering homeless services, the types of services and their public funding.  With regard to recommendations, in summary the report referred to the need for a more comprehensive review of homeless services, including direct engagement with service providers, to consider the efficiency of funding a very large number of service providers and the extent to which duplication exists in the sector.</p>  <p>  Following on from the Mazars report, my Department is currently engaged in a Value for Money Review with regard to expenditure on homelessness services and an independently chaired steering group is in place to oversee the Review.  Questionnaires recently issued to a wide range of non-governmental homeless services providers and also the nine lead local authorities for the administration of homeless services.  The questionnaires seek details on the material resources available to service providers, their overall goals and the specific objectives of the services they deliver and invite comment on the policy challenges and opportunities.  The data produced via the questionnaires will be an important component of the overall Review process.  I expect that the Review will be finalised early in 2018.</p></reply>

However, the active management of the publicly-owned housing land bank is part of a range of actions being progressed under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, designed to accelerate and increase housing output. </p><p>Under Rebuilding Ireland, an online Housing Land Map was launched by my Department which aims to provide users with details of residentially zoned lands, local authority owned and Land Aggregation Scheme sites, other publicly owned sites with potential for housing development, and active private housing construction sites in the Dublin region. It represents a vital initial step in the new State Housing Land Management Strategy being developed under Ireland 2040, the National Planning Framework.</p><p>On 27 April 2017, details of some 1,700 hectares of land in local authority and Housing Agency ownership were published on the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map, with the potential to deliver some 42,500 homes nationally. The map also includes details of some 300 hectares of land in ownership of other State or semi-State bodies, with the potential to deliver a further 7,500 homes. These sites can be viewed at the following link: .</p><p>In order to ensure a consistent and comprehensive approach to the development of these lands, I have asked all local authorities to prepare Strategic Development and Management Plans for housing lands in their ownership, with particular emphasis on prioritising those sites that are already serviced and with the most potential to deliver housing at scale, in the short to medium term.  </p><p>In the first instance, the final development model for each site, including the tenure mix, will be the subject of careful consideration by the local authority concerned, including its elected members. </p><p>My Department is continuing to work with all local authorities and State bodies to ensure that housing is delivered from appropriately located and publicly owned sites to meet our current and future housing requirements.</p></reply>
