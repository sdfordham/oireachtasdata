All farmers supplying milk for liquid consumption in the winter months do so under contracts with processors which must be registered with the Agency. The Agency does not have a role in setting the retail price of milk but farmers supplying milk in the winter months are paid a premium over the price paid to farmers who only produce milk in the spring-autumn period. This premium reflects the additional costs of producing milk in the winter months.</p><p>  The Programme for Government contains a specific commitment to enact fair trade legislation in the retail sector so as to ensure balance between various players in the grocery goods sector. This comes under the remit of the Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation. I understand that legislation is currently being prepared by the Office of the Parliamentary Draftsman, at the request of his Department, to allow for the introduction of a statutory Code of Practice to regulate particular practices in the grocery trade. </p><p>  At EU level I understand that the high level group on better functioning of the Food Supply Chain has asked the Expert Business to Business Platform to make recommendations on a Community wide approach. The Platform has drafted guidelines of good practice but has not yet reached agreement on implementation. Discussions are continuing. </p></reply>

However, while I hold a lesser number of shares, there are a number of powers assigned to me under the Forestry Act 1988 under which Coillte Teoranta was established.</p><p>  Coillte Teoranta, which was established as a private commercial company under the Forestry Act 1988, came into operation on 1 January 1989 at which time certain State lands totalling 396,000 hectares were vested in the Company in accordance with the Act.  Coillte&rsquo;s Annual Report and Accounts 1989, which were published following it&rsquo;s AGM for that year, includes a map of Ireland showing the distribution of forests and also includes a summary by region. There is no record of a geological survey carried out by Coillte at this time.</p><p>  Coillte has acquired land since its establishment and now manages an estate of some 442,000 hectares. For this reason, if the Deputy is seeking to ascertain the current geographical spread or location of Coillte forests, I understand that such information is published in the Company&rsquo;s District Strategic Plans, which are accessible on the Company&rsquo;s website, while a breakdown by County may be made available on request to the company itself.  This would give the Deputy the current situation and is already in the public domain.</p></reply>

Indecon considered <i>inter alia</i>   legislation, governance structures, funding and management of the horse racing industry in Ireland. Regarding funding  the Report resulting from the Indecon study supports additional and sustainable funding for the development of the sector but states that this must be accompanied by an equal priority to maximise efficiency, effectiveness and value for money. In this context  it identifies a number of areas to be addressed  and recommends the introduction of measures to secure a significant increase in taxation from the Betting Sector and the creation of a level playing field between retail and remote off-course bookmakers and betting exchanges; a reduction in the size of the HRI Board and changes to the nomination and appointment processes; changes to the Committee structure of the Board; streamlining of functions between HRI &amp; the Turf Club; new arrangements to address marketing and competitiveness. </p><p>  I have indicated my general acceptance of the recommendations contained in the Indecon Report and I have confirmed my intention to bring forward legislative changes, where necessary, to implement the recommendations and update horse racing legislation.</p><p>  Having consider the Indecon Report I have asked the Turf Club and HRI to immediately establish a Joint HRI/Turf Club Implementation Task Force,  to address the opportunities for integration of functions, including shared services, with a view to achieving greater efficiencies and to achieve a minimum of 10% reduction in costs as identified in the report.  This is a critical pre-requisite to future funding for the industry.</p><p>  On funding generally the Minister for Finance has published the Betting (Amendment) Bill 2012 which when enacted will ensure that all bookmakers taking bets from Ireland will pay 1% betting duty on those bets in the same way that betting shops currently do. Betting Exchanges will also be subject to tax under the new arrangements but the calculation of the tax will differ from that applying to bookmakers. This measure will increase the yield to the Exchequer from betting.</p><p>  On the specific allocation to the horse racing industry Indecon also recommended  a multi-annual commitment and this is matter I am considering having regard to the current economic conditions and the general budgetary position.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-06a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012110600055#WRA01300"><p>Farmers, in common with business operators in other sectors, are at liberty to enter into partnership agreements establishing collaborative arrangements for farming or other activities. Such arrangements are governed by the Partnership Act of 1890. In addition, under the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, individual partnerships are given tax reference numbers and a precedent partner is identified for the purposes of assigning responsibility for the preparation and delivery to the Revenue Commissioners of a return of partnership income and gains.  </p><p>  A variety of business models, including collaborative arrangements such as partnership and share farming are available to farmers in all sectors, though not in a manner which requires formal registration of the farm partnership. </p><p>  However, in the dairy sector, specific formalized arrangements for the registration of dairy production partnerships were established under the Milk Quota Regulations, in the context of providing access to milk quota for partnerships under the Milk Quota Trading Scheme. These regulations will be repealed upon the demise of milk quotas in 2015. </p><p>  I am supportive of partnership and other collaborative arrangements between farmers which can help to address a variety of issues such as scale, land and capital equipment availability, sharing of skills and rural isolation. Equally, I recognize that there may be cultural and other barriers to formalised collaboration arrangements at farm level in Ireland.  </p><p>  With this in mind, and as a temporary stimulus to assist in the development of the partnership model, I announced in the context of last year&rsquo;s budget, a stock relief measure intended, subject to EU State Aid approval being obtained, to be available to registered farm partnerships. At present, and for the historical reasons already explained, the only formalised registration vehicle for farm partnerships is that available under the Milk Quota Regulations. </p><p>  Against the general background described above, I am at present considering the question of establishing a formalised mechanism for recognizing farm partnerships, and in that context seeking to identify a basis in primary legislation for such registration. While deliberations on this matter have not yet concluded, I expect to be in a position to make a decision on the matter in the near future.</p></reply>

The primary objectives of the Scheme was to improve welfare standards in the sector and to assist in the establishment of a breeding database from which suckler farmers could identify the best breeding stock for their particular requirements.</p><p>The tabular statement below illustrates the number of participants in the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme in a range of herd sizes.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Herd size<br />(cows)</div></th><th><div>Number of herds</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>1-10</div></td><td><div>10,471</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>11-20</div></td><td><div>11,359</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>21-30</div></td><td><div>6,296</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>31-40</div></td><td><div>3,157</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>41-60</div></td><td><div>2,407</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>&gt;60</div></td><td><div>1,177</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Total</div></td><td><div>34,867</div></td></tr></table></p><p>It can be seen from the table that the majority of the Suckler farmers are small holdings with herds of less than 20 animals.</p><p>A Value for Money Review on the operation of the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme was undertaken in 2011.  This was done in accordance with the Department of Finance Value for Money and Policy Review guidelines. This review found that the Scheme has been successful in meeting its objectives and some of its main findings can be summarised as follows:</p><p>- The Scheme has largely met its original objectives in terms of bringing about improvements in animal welfare, collection of breeding data and ultimatelyachieving improved competitiveness within the Irish beef sector.</p><p>- The animal welfare measures have directly contributed to improved prices for weanlings and improved reputation for Irish beef and live exports in key markets while also having a significant attitudinal and behavioural change by suckler farmers  with regard to animal welfare</p><p>- Significant improvements have been achieved in the collection and processing of the breeding data submitted under the Scheme.</p><p>- The Steering Group believed that the Suckler Scheme succeeded in advancing and improving management and animal husbandry practices on suckler farms but that it was appropriate to assess whether continued public funding was justified.</p><p>Part of this audit included surveys of, and presentations by, various interested bodies including the farming organisations and exporters and the conclusions were that the Scheme was extremely beneficial and was a significant contributor to the increased level of live exports in recent years. The future viability of this country&rsquo;s beef industry depends on our ability to produce the highest quality beef animals using the highest standards of animal welfare and husbandry.  Ireland is now well placed to exploit the marketing advantage that this scheme presents when selling beef into the European and further markets.</p><p>Payments will continue to be made under this Scheme on 2012 born calves and those born in earlier years at current rates as they become eligible for payment. Any decision in relation to the future will be considered during the forthcoming budgetary process.</p></reply>

In that connection, I welcome the three key principles underpinning the EU Commission&rsquo;s proposals for reform of the CAP which are to preserve food production potential in the EU, to ensure sustainable management of natural resources and to maintain viable rural areas.  I am satisfied that adherence to these principles will ensure the viability and future development of the food industry in Ireland and throughout Europe.</p><p>  My own view is that food security in the European Union is the essence of what the new Common Agricultural Policy is about. Growing populations and increasing demand for protein-based foods, which is what we predominantly produce in Ireland through the dairy and meat industries, present a significant opportunity not only to continue, as the EU has been, to promote a sustainable way of producing food from an environmental and climate point of view but also to produce greater volumes of food.  I will continue to make the case for sustainable intensification of food production, which is what agriculture should be all about.</p><p>  Of course, a strong CAP is contingent on securing an adequate budget to deliver the objectives of that policy.  In this regard, the negotiations to determine the budget for the CAP from 2014 to 2020 are part of wider negotiations that will decide the multiannual financial framework, or MFF, for the EU budget for the period from 2014 to 2020. These negotiations are being conducted under the auspices of the EU General Affairs Council, attended by the Tanaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Ultimately decisions on the MFF will be taken by EU Heads of State and Government.  A special meeting of the European Council has been scheduled for November 2012 for this purpose.</p><p>  The overriding national priority is to safeguard CAP funding to the maximum extent possible, having regard to the reality that CAP accounts for over 80% of Ireland&rsquo;s total receipts of EU funding, equivalent to about &euro;12 billion over the 2007-2013 period.  We will continue to strongly defend our proposed allocation in the negotiations.  This is a whole of Government position. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-06a.31.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012110600055#WRA02200"><p>I am conscious of the economic potential of the inshore fisheries sector to grow and make an increased contribution to employment and economic growth in peripheral coastal and island communities. Already, many shellfish species make a valuable contribution to our exports, either through direct export or as essential raw material for added-value seafood products.  Sustainably managed, there is much potential to grow landings in these fisheries.</p><p>  However, in light of the judgment of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) against Ireland concerning non-compliance with the EU Habitats and Birds Directives, my overriding policy priority for the inshore sector must be to bring all inshore fisheries, and aquaculture, in Natura 2000 sites into full compliance with those Directives.  Any wider policy initiatives for the inshore sector must take account of this policy priority and the associated legal constraints these Directives and the ECJ judgement impose in terms of putting in place new licensing or management arrangements for inshore stocks within or adjacent to Natura 2000 sites, in advance of the completion of the necessary environmental assessments under article 6 of the Habitats Directive.  </p><p>  My Department continues to work closely with BIM, the Marine Institute and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and other stakeholders to manage inshore fisheries generally and measures are implemented within the constraints of the ECJ judgement to protect the stock.  </p><p>  Much of our coastline is affected by the designation of many bays and estuaries as Special Areas of Conservation under the Habitats Directive or Special Protection Areas under the Birds Directive, collectively known as Natura 2000 sites.  Article 6 of the Habitats Directive applies to all such sites and serves to prevent the introduction of plans or policies for fisheries in those sites which would involve licensing of fishermen or certain other planned management arrangements for those sites, unless an environmental assessment under that Directive has first been conducted and has discounted any significant impact on the protected habitat or species.  The completion of Habitats Directive assessments for the in excess of 90 sites around our coastline is a significant undertaking that must be conducted in a systematic manner, informed by detailed scientific surveys and impact assessments on a site by site basis.</p><p>  My Department has been engaged in a major multi annual project to deliver full compliance with the Directives for all marine Natura 2000 sites and is working closely with its agencies and the National Parks and Wildlife Service on this task.  A substantial body of scientific data and analysis has been generated over the past number of years to inform the assessments.  The project is now focused on the roll-out of the bay by bay environmental assessments required under the Directives and implementation of any consequent management measures arising.  </p><p>  Three comprehensive assessments have been completed, in respect of Castlemaine Harbour County Kerry, Dundalk Bay County Louth and Roaring Water Bay County Cork.  Work is at an advanced stage in respect of Lough Swilly County Donegal and Clew Bay County Mayo, among others, and this process will continue throughout 2012 and into next year in respect of these and other sites.</p></reply>

Under the Commission&rsquo;s proposal, Less Favoured Areas &ndash; known as Disadvantaged Areas in Ireland &ndash; will become known as Areas facing natural or specific constraints, or ANCs. Designation of the ANC areas is proposed to be determined by 8 soil and climatic criteria. These are grouped under four headings of climate, climate and soil together, soil and terrain. They include low temperature, dryness, excess soil moisture, limited soil drainage, unfavourable texture and stoniness, shallow rooting depth, poor chemical properties and slope.</p><p>  This is a very important issue for Ireland as the total area designated as disadvantaged is almost 75% of Ireland&rsquo;s total land area. From an economic perspective the Less Favoured Areas Scheme is particularly significant, contributing to the support of in excess of 100,000 Irish farm families, whose ability to farm is restricted by the physical environment, in particular, the impact of the prevailing wet cold climatic conditions in Ireland. </p><p>  At EU level, in overall terms, I consider that the Commission&rsquo;s proposals of using bio-physical criteria as laudable, but I believe there is a need to broaden the scope of the proposed criteria and to give Member States more flexibility in designating areas. My Department has conducted extensive analysis of the impact of using the eight criteria. The results show that whilst there is not a major shift in the total area designated in Ireland there is a considerable change within the totality - areas not previously designated now included with other designated area excluded, and in some cases the designation is very difficult to justify. I can assure you, however, that I am seeking additional flexibility in the designation process and in the timeline for implementation of any changes to ensure that there are no abrupt or significant alterations to the conditions of the current scheme.  </p><p>  Of course the level of these payments in Ireland will also be informed by the decisions taken on the next multi-annual financial framework for the EU budget.  The funding for the second pillar of the CAP, which includes provision for these payments, falls to be decided by Heads of State and Government as part of the MFF negotiations.  A special meeting of the European Council is scheduled for 22 and 23 November for this purpose.</p></reply>

Axes 1 and 2 of the Rural Development Programme are administered by my Department while Axes 3 and 4 are delivered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. A broadband measure comes under the remit of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. Details of the allocation and expenditure per measure under the RDP up to 15 October 2012 are set out in the table below. This table does not include funds already committed but not as yet claimed.</p><p>The programme, like all national spending, is subject to ongoing budgetary constraints but is configured to maximise all available EU funding. Ireland&rsquo;s draw down rate under the Programme has been among the highest of EU Member States over the lifetime of the current Programme. As is the case with the Programmes of other Member States, expenditure has not been entirely consistent across the measures and this has been due both to the more long term nature of some of the measures and to the prevailing economic situation. Spending under a number of measures may continue until the end of 2015 and this will provide considerable scope to allow all measures to spend up to their full allocation.</p><p>Full draw down of available EU funds is a major priority. Any review of expenditure under the programme must take account of the Axis balance which requires spending over the Axes in the proportions of 10:80:10 under the RDP. Adjustments have already been made to the RDP Financial Plan and will continue to be made to the end of the Programme in order to achieve the fullest possible draw down of available funds.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Axis / Measure</div></th><th><div>Measure Code</div></th><th><div>RDP <br /><br />Allocation <br /><br />&#8364;m</div></th><th><div>Expenditure 2007 &#8211; 15 October 2012&#8364;m</div></th></tr><tr><td>AXIS 1 &#8211; COMPETITIVENESS</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div>Vocational training (REPS)</div></td><td><div>111</div></td><td><div>5.7</div></td><td><div>6.6</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Installation aid</div></td><td><div>112</div></td><td><div>12.3</div></td><td><div>12.9</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Early retirement</div></td><td><div>113</div></td><td><div>219.2</div></td><td><div>208.6</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Farm Modernisation</div></td><td><div>121</div></td><td><div>154.6</div></td><td><div>74.0</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>TOTAL AXIS 1</div></td><td></td><td><div>391.8</div></td><td><div>302.1</div></td></tr></table></p><p><b>Axis 2 &ndash; Environment and Land Management</b></p><p><table><tr><th><div>Axis / Measure</div></th><th><div>Measure Code</div></th><th><div>RDP <br /><br />Allocation <br /><br />&#8364;m</div></th><th><div>Expenditure 2007 &#8211; 15 October 2012&#8364;m</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>Less Favoured Areas</div></td><td><div>212</div></td><td><div>1,617.9</div></td><td><div>1,255.6</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Natura 2000</div></td><td><div>213</div></td><td><div>528.5</div></td><td><div>69.2</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Agri-environment </div></td><td><div>214</div></td><td><div>1922.5</div></td><td><div>1,784.4</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>TOTAL AXIS 2</div></td><td></td><td><div>4,068.9</div></td><td><div>3,073.2</div></td></tr></table></p><p><b>Axis 3</b></p><p><table><tr><th><div>Axis / Measure</div></th><th><div>Measure Code</div></th><th><div>RDP <br /><br />Allocation <br /><br />&#8364;m</div></th><th><div>Expenditure 2007 &#8211; 15 October 2012&#8364;m</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>Broadband</div></td><td><div>321</div></td><td><div>17.8</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>TOTAL AXIS 3</div></td><td></td><td><div>17.8</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr></table></p><p><b>Axis 4</b></p><p><table><tr><th><div>Axis / Measure</div></th><th><div>Measure Code</div></th><th><div>RDP <br /><br />Allocation <br /><br />&#8364;m</div></th><th><div>Expenditure 2007 &#8211; 15 October 2012&#8364;m</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>Competitiveness &#8211; under Measure 123 for Food Projects.</div></td><td><div>411</div></td><td><div>5.0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Implementing Local Development Strategies &#8211; Quality of Life</div></td><td><div>413</div></td><td><div>265.5</div></td><td><div>95.3</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Co-operation Projects</div></td><td><div>421</div></td><td><div>7.8</div></td><td><div>1.5</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Running of LAGS</div></td><td><div>431</div></td><td><div>62.5</div></td><td><div>46.5</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>TOTAL AXIS 4</div></td><td></td><td><div>340.8</div></td><td><div>143.3</div></td></tr></table></p><p><b>Axis 5 &ndash; Technical Assistance</b></p><p><table><tr><th><div>Axis / Measure</div></th><th><div>Measure Code</div></th><th><div>RDP <br /><br />Allocation <br /><br />&#8364;m</div></th><th><div>Expenditure 2007 &#8211; 15 October 2012&#8364;m</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>Technical Assistance</div></td><td></td><td><div>6.0</div></td><td><div>1.2</div></td></tr><tr><td>OVERALL RDP</td><td></td><td><div>4,825.3</div></td><td><div>3,519.8</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The very wet weather during the summer months led to significantly reduced yields and poorer quality. The effects of this will continue through into 2013.   The poor weather also led to higher disease pressures and higher costs. </p><p>  In relation to vegetables, there were also negative impacts on the planting of certain crops. </p><p>  The lower yields were offset to some extent by higher prices as the wet weather also affected producers across Western Europe. This was particularly so in the case of potatoes where prices have been more than double those of 2011.      </p><p><b>Assistance for the industry</b></p><p>  Unfortunately, the EU Commission does not provide funding to compensate for losses that arise due to the adverse weather conditions experienced this summer and due to the financial crisis the Irish Exchequer is not in a position to assist either. </p><p>  However my Department expects to provide over &#8364;3m in grant aid directly to horticultural growers this year to assist development of the industry under the Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector.  This competitive grant aid scheme, which covers all areas of the horticultural industry, is 100% State funded under the National Development Plan (2007-2013).</p><p>  My Department and the other State agencies will continue to work with potato growers and the horticultural industry to ensure the long-term viability of both sectors.</p></reply>

The Food Harvest 2020 (FH2020) report set out an ambitious target for a 50% increase in milk production by 2020, compared to a 2007-2009 reference period. </p><p>  The roots of this potential for increased production lie in the unrivalled natural advantage Ireland possesses in the form of a grass-based production system. This allows us to produce dairy products of the highest quality in an environmentally friendly manner and on a highly cost efficient basis, to meet global demand which is growing as a result of increasing population and purchasing power in developing economies.   </p><p>  The low carbon intensity of the Irish dairy sector is recognised by a number of important international reports which show Ireland to be among the most carbon efficient food producers in the world. </p><p>  In 2011, an EU Commission Joint Research Centre study found Irish milk, pork and poultry products to have the lowest carbon footprint in the EU on a per unit of production basis.  By factoring in future cost beneficial mitigation measures relative to increased production, the projected rise in agricultural output will represent a further improvement in the already efficient carbon intensity of agricultural production on a per unit basis.</p><p>  In addition, a 2010 FAO report indicates that the grass based livestock production systems that form the cornerstone of Irish agriculture are already highly carbon-efficient and are associated with a low carbon footprint for livestock produce.</p><p>  In April 2012, as part of the National Climate Policy Development Consultation, Teagasc published its Marginal Abatement Cost Curve for Irish Agriculture analysis. The report was prepared by Teagasc&rsquo;s working group on greenhouse gas emissions which integrates the extensive and diverse range of organisational expertise in research and practice associated with greenhouse gases. The analysis was conducted within the context of FH2020, which assumes that the 50% growth in the dairy sector will be achieved by a combination of 25% growth in cow numbers and 25% increase in yield.</p><p>  Without mitigation, under a FH2020 scenario, the historical downward trend in agricultural greehhouse gas emissions  is projected to reverse due to the growth in economic activity in this sector. In the absence of abatement measures, this report estimates that, by 2020, emissions are projected to increase by approximately 7% compared to the 2010 level. This increase is not substantial in comparison to the projected rise in agricultural output, due to ongoing gains in production efficiency and reductions in the carbon-footprint (greenhouse gas emissions per unit produced) of agricultural produce. Therefore, these figures would still represent a further improvement in the already efficient carbon intensity of Irish agricultural production.</p><p>  However, it is estimated that mitigation measures have the potential to achieve reductions in reported agricultural emissions of 5.5% relative to the FH2020 reference scenario in 2020.  Notwithstanding the planned increase in production, this would represent a 4.5% reduction compared to the reported agricultural emissions in 2005, which is the EU Effort Sharing reference year. These measures would include activities such as extended grazing, improved breeding index and efficient use of nitrogen.</p><p>  It is important to note that a Marginal Abatement Cost Curve cannot remain static, nor should it be interpreted as definitive. This is because the potential for greenhouse gas abatement, as well as the associated costs and benefits, are likely to change over time as ongoing research programmes deliver new mitigation measures, or as socio-economic or agronomic conditions evolve. Therefore, the Teagasc report should be interpreted as the first outcome of an iterative process. Developments in the science of greenhouse gas abatement and in the market conditions faced by Irish agriculture will continue to shape analysis into the future.</p><p>  In this context the Department will continue to support research and innovation to underpin the sustainable growth of the agri-food sector.  The Greenhouse Gas Initiative for Ireland, a research network funded recently under my Department&rsquo;s Stimulus Programme, is particularly relevant in this regard.</p><p>  In November 2011 my Department also invited proposals from independent external consultants to undertake an analysis and report on the likely environmental impacts of the achievement of the Food Harvest 2020 targets. Consultants were appointed in April 2012 and a final report is expected in early 2013. The possible impact on greenhouse gas levels is one of the areas under examination as part of the analysis.</p><p>  As regards the forthcoming Climate Change Bill I will, of course, be working closely with my colleague Minister Hogan and others in formulating this important legislation, taking into account all of the available data. </p></reply>

A total of 3% of the national forest estate is under ash and 10% of all new planting is currently made up of this important native species.  The disease itself is relatively new and is caused by the fungal pathogen <i>Chalara fraxinea </i>  which was first described in 2006. The precise origin of the disease remains uncertain and its biology is not yet fully understood. It has spread rapidly across much of Europe, with the majority of European countries where ash is present now reporting dieback. </p><p>  Ash plants and ash wood with bark imported from countries where the disease is known to occur represents the most likely source of infection in Ireland.  Approximately 200,000 ash plants and over 1000 cubic metres of round wood ash for hurley manufacture are imported per annum.  Firewood data is not currently broken down by on a species by species basis.</p><p>The Department has been actively monitoring for occurrences of this disease since 2008 by carrying out site surveys to establish the status of <i>Chalara fraxinea</i> in the country and by carrying out examinations of ash imports at ports, importers premises, nurseries and planting sites. Since 2008 suspect samples have been sent for laboratory analysis but up to recently all results were negative. Last month, a suspect case of <i>Chalara fraxinea</i> was identified in Co. Leitrim which, following molecular testing was confirmed on the 12th October as Ireland&#8217;s first instance of the disease. The site itself which was established in 2009, and was planted using material from a consignment of saplings imported from continental Europe.  Some 31,000 individual ash trees made up this consignment which was used in 11 separate sites throughout the country.  Ash trees planted on the 11 sites in question have been cleared and destroyed. This involved the removal and burning of some 31,000 trees from the imported consignment (and several thousand adjoining trees) which was carried out rapidly with the cooperation of forest owners and contractors.  Results from laboratory analysis received yesterday (5<sup>th</sup>   November) confirm that while most of this consignment distributed to other sites had no symptoms, in four of the sites the disease was present on a very small number of trees.   This confirms the Department&#8217;s use of a precautionary approach in destroying the entire consignment in all 11 sites.</p><p>I have introduced legislation banning the import of ash plants from countries or parts of countries known to have the disease. This Statutory Instrument came into effect from the 26<sup>th</sup>   October 2012 and in Northern Ireland equivalent measures were also simultaneously introduced. Additional legislative measures are also being introduced today in relation to wood in co-operation with the authorities in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

Programmes and services are developed with clients and partners overseen by an Authority that is representative of the main agriculture stakeholder groups. It is a matter for Teagasc to prioritise activities in the delivery of services and to allocate resources in accordance with these priorities. Ministerial responsibility is confined to matters of policy in accordance with the Act and the Minister does not interfere in the day to day operations of Teagasc. </p><p>  In 2009, Teagasc commenced a major organisational Change Programme to improve efficiencies, streamline services and promote greater integration across the organisation. The Programme involves the disposal of assets, a significant reduction in the number of research and advisory locations, reduction in staff numbers and redeployment of staff. Implementation of the programme is an operational matter for Teagasc. </p><p>  It has resulted in a slimmed down senior management structure and a new programme structure based around four integrated operational programmes. The network of Teagasc offices around the country is being streamlined from 91 to 51 with 38 offices closed to date. Transfer of staff and activities from Kinsealy Research Centre to Ashtown is also being progressed. There has been significant progress in reducing staff numbers with over 380 permanent and temporary posts cut since 2008 as part of the Government initiative to create a smaller, more integrated public service. As part of this initiative, Teagasc successfully implemented a voluntary early retirement programme in 2011 in which 83 staff exited the organisation. The overall cost of servicing pay and pensions in Teagasc fell by &euro;13m since 2008 while other non-pay costs declined by &euro;11m. </p><p>  These actions have resulted in Teagasc becoming a leaner, more efficient and focused organisation. Teagasc recognise that this process of change must continue and are committed to implementing further reforms in line with the Croke Park Agreement.</p></reply>

These proposals are linked to the EU 2020 Strategy and have three objectives of competitiveness, sustainable management of natural resources and wider rural economy, as under the current round.  These objectives are to be met through<b></b>  6 priorities of knowledge transfer, competitiveness, food chain organisation and risk management, preserving ecosystems, promoting resource efficiency and low carbon economy and realising jobs potential and development of rural areas.</p><p>  Many of the proposed measures are similar to those in the current round.  However there are new measures proposed for farm and business development, aimed at young farmers and small businesses and for cooperation, aimed at farm partnership type arrangements.  Other new options include support for producer groups, organic farming and insurance premia and mutual funds to compensate farmers. Less Favoured Areas will become known as areas facing natural or other specific constraints and significant changes are proposed to this measure.</p><p>  The axis balance provisions in the current programme are no longer a requirement and former Axis 3 measures now comprise one measure for basic services and village renewal in rural areas</p><p>  A single co funding rate of 50% is envisaged but certain measures relating to knowledge transfer, producer groups, co operation and young farmers set up may be co funded at the rate of 80%.    A specific provision is made for Leader funding (at least 5%) and Agri-Environment-Climate, Organic farming and Areas of Natural Constraint (at least 25%).  A 100% co funding rate is envisaged for innovation projects. </p><p>  The draft regulation proposes that funds will be distributed between Member States on the basis of objective criteria and past performance.  However, the Commission has yet to publish concrete proposals on distribution or to provide full details of the criteria and weightings it is planning to use.  </p><p>  Decisions on funding and co-financing levels for pillar 2 will be taken by Heads of State and Government as part of the multiannual financial framework negotiations for the next EU budget and a special meeting of the European Council has been scheduled for 22/23 November to finalise this.</p><p>  I have serious concerns that the envisaged use of a combination of past performance and objective criteria to determine distribution of Pillar 2 funds will reduce our allocation. I believe an objective criteria approach cannot provide a solution that will address the concerns of all Member States, and should be abandoned. Allocation of Pillar 2 funds should instead be based on past performance only, as measured over the entire 2007-2013 rural development programming period. Any adjustment beyond that should use the same methodology as the Commission has proposed for Pillar 1. </p><p>  I am also pressing for Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 funds to be considered together, and for the pragmatic approach being employed for direct payments to be used for rural development too. The latter would be consistent with the complementary nature of the two pillars within one common agricultural policy. </p><p>  In addition, I believe that no Member State with below-average Pillar 2 payments per hectare should lose in any redistribution, and no Member State should lose under both pillars. Ireland receives lower than average payments per hectare for direct payment and rural development funds combined, and I therefore see no justification for any reduction. </p><p>  In any event, it is imperative that we see proposals soon from the Commission on Pillar 2 distribution.  It is unrealistic to expect Member States to sign up to proposals for the allocation of Pillar 1 funds without knowing the Commission&#8217;s intentions on the second pillar.</p></reply>

The available grant-aid is 40% up to a maximum eligible investment ceiling of &euro;40,000 for milking machines and &euro;25,000 for cooling equipment.   Special incentives are provided for certain Milk Production Partnerships.   The indicative allocation for the Scheme in Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme is &euro;45 million.   In view of the high level of demand for grant-aid under the Scheme, I subsequently increased this amount to &euro;49 million by way of the transfer of &euro;4 million from the Rainwater Harvesting Scheme.  As the financial allocation for the Scheme is limited, a series of tranches is in place in order to ensure that approvals to commence work can issue to farmers at regular intervals.   Selection criteria have also been applied in order to determine those applications which will go forward to the approval process as the Scheme has been over-subscribed since its introduction.   </p><p>  The tranche which closed at end-July 2012 was over-subscribed and the processing of applications involved the detailed examination of all applications as well as the clarification and resolution of a large number of queries and other issues in correspondence with the applicants. This process is nearing completion and I expect that approvals will issue shortly. In addition, my Department has already commenced work on the applications received during the tranche which closed at end-October 2012. My aim is to ensure that approvals under both tranches will issue as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

In addition, it provides stable arrangements for access to the large EU seafood market for the large volume of Irish seafood products which the Irish fishing industry exports to EU markets. There has been traditional dissatisfaction in Ireland with the share of the relevant total allowable catches which Ireland secured at the outset of the CFP.</p><p>  The share Ireland received of the quotas available at the outset was determined on a system of relative stability, based on historical fishing patterns in the confines of set management areas. That system has continued since and was not changed in the CFP Reform&rsquo;s of 1992 or 2002. There is no support in the Council for a change in the traditional quota allocations in the current Reform  and the EU Commission has not proposed any changes. </p><p>However, under CFP arrangements agreed in 1976 a system of so called &ldquo;Hague Preferences&rdquo; was put in place, under which Ireland gets an enhanced share of certain key quotas on which we were traditionally dependant, if the share falls below certain set levels. The CFP Reform proposals envisage retaining this system in the way that it has operated previously and the retention of this arrangement is a key priority for me  .</p><p>Securing enhanced fish quotas for Ireland and enhanced fish landings into Ireland however remains as an objective, but must I believe be delivered within the structures in place. For example, over the last two years Ireland has secured, by working within the system, a very significant two thirds share of the new and very large Boarfish Fishery. This fishery which will permit Ireland to catch 56,666 tonnes this year holds the potential to build a large new processing industry in Ireland, developing human consumption seafood products for exports. On my trade mission to China earlier this year I promoted the products from this new fishery to the large Chinese seafood market and Irish processors have already sent over 12 tonnes of boarfish as a commercial trial to a seafood processor in Qingdao.   Similarly, on foot of initiatives taken by the Irish pelagic processing industry, this year we saw very large levels of landings of blue whiting into Killybegs for processing from Norwegian vessels. This gave a substantial boost for the Irish Seafood Processing industry generating increased employment in the North West.</p><p>  The other way of increasing Irish fish catches and landings into Ireland is by growing the stocks on which we are dependant and which are proximate to Ireland. By growing stocks we increase our permitted volumes of landings even within a fixed sharing arrangement. The Quota increases secured in this way in the Celtic Sea this year are clear evidence of the gains that can be secured through this approach. There is much in the CFP Reform, such as long term management of stocks, reducing and eliminating discards and rebuilding stocks to Maximum Sustainable Yield, which holds the potential to substantially increase catches by Irish fishermen in the short and medium term. </p><p>  One aspect of the CFP Reform Proposals, which I vehemently opposed from the outset, was the proposed system of mandatory transferable fishing concessions, which would have privatised the National Fish Quotas and posed real dangers to Irelands fishing and processing industries and would have threatened the economic survival of our coastal communities.  As part of the intensively negotiated General Approach which was agreed at June Fisheries Council we saw the removal of the mandatory element of this proposal where by each member state  will be allowed to manage their fish quotas to take account of their own individual circumstances. We are awaiting the EU Parliament&rsquo;s position on the reform, including in relation to its approach to dealing with quota allocations and individual transferable concessions.   </p><p>  I will prioritise securing final agreement between the EU Fisheries Council and the EU Parliament on the CFP during the Irish Presidency during the first half of 2013.</p></reply>

At both meetings, I stated that any venture to develop a combined sugar/bioethanol production facility would have to be a commercial proposition, financed in total by investors and interested parties and make sound economic sense in order to be viable. I also further suggested to both groups, the desirability of there being only one single proposition in play, as both studies had indicated a potential for only one such viable project and both groups had appeared to accept the reasonableness of this position at the time. </p><p>  Only recently, I re-stated that any business plan for a new venture in this area, would need to be competitive and that it would justify the very substantial investment to build a new facility. </p><p>  I have strongly supported the current EU Commission&#8217;s proposal to completely abolish sugar quotas from 30 September 2015, as part of the ongoing CAP reform discussions. At each meeting of the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers since October 2011, which has addressed this issue, I have intervened to fully support the Commission proposals for quota abolition. I also raised the issue with EU Agriculture Commissioner, Ciolos during his visit to Ireland in January 2012 and at the time I informed him of the growing momentum here for the revival of the sugar industry. </p><p>I also advised the Commissioner that while Ireland supports full quota abolition in 2015, if the regime were to continue beyond that date, Ireland does not want to be deprived, in the interim period of the option to recommence production<i>.</i>   I am also aware of a significant number of Member States which wish to see the current sugar quota regime extended to 2017 or 2018. In addition, the European Parliament have clearly stated that they want the regime extended to 2020, so I expect that in the eventual conclusion to these complex reform negotiations, in which the sugar question is but one significant element, a compromise outcome will be agreed. However, I will endeavour to ensure that if the sugar quota regime does get extended beyond 2015, Ireland will be allowed to access a sufficient quota amount to ensure a viable sugar industry here.</p><p>  I am most actively involved in these negotiations between Member States, on all aspects of the CAP Reform Proposals, including those concerning the EU sugar regime. During the first half of 2013, Ireland will hold the Presidency of the EU and   I will assume the role of Chairman of the Council of Agriculture Ministers during that 6 month period. Based on current progress and developments in these negotiations, I believe that agreement on the CAP Reform measures can be concluded in the Council, including an outcome on the future of the EU sugar quota regime, during our Presidency period.  </p><p>  Given the uncertainty outlined above, my Department has not carried out nor commissioned a study on the impact the end of the sugar beet quota system in 2015 may have on our climate policy should the industry be re-established here.  However, further consideration may be given to this issue in light of future developments at European level and when a greater degree of certainty is established with regard to the potential development of a new sugar/bioethanol facility in Ireland. </p><p>  With regard to the potential of sugar beet as a biofuel crop, establishing an ethanol plant in Ireland which uses sugar beet as a raw material in the production of ethanol would be a matter in the first instance for commercial decision by interested parties.  Such a development would not be dependent on sugar quota becoming available.  Sugar beet could be grown for such an enterprise, if regarded as commercially viable, in the same way that a quantity of sugar beet has always been grown in this country for fodder purposes.  </p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that the European Commission published a proposal on 17<sup>th</sup> October 2012, drawn up by DGs Climate Action and Energy, that seeks to introduce a 5% ceiling on the use of biofuels derived from sugar, cereals and rapeseed as part of the count towards the EU&#8217;s 10% target for renewable energy in the transport sector by 2020.  The proposal seeks to shift the focus away from 1<sup>st</sup>   generation biofuels and encourage future investment in advanced biofuels derived from municipal waste and agricultural residues that do not compete directly with food and feed crops. The Commission aims at protecting existing investment until 2020, but commits to cut all public subsidies for biofuels produced from crop-based biofuels once the current legislation expires in 2020.  </p></reply>

Of this, approximately 2.5 million cubic metres (c. 40%) is expected to come from private sector forests. These figures and particularly the increase in private timber production are excellent indictors for future growth in our forestry sector.  </p><p>  Furthermore in terms of downstream support for the industry, Teagasc has, to date, supported the establishment of 25 Farm Forest Producer Groups around the country to assist private forest owners in the management of the forests and the mobilisation of timber to the processing sector. In addition, the COFORD Council has convened a group comprised of sawmillers, Coillte and private growers to examine wood mobilisation issues in the sector and this group will report in 2013.</p><p>  Taken together, I believe that these policies, initiatives and funding will help ensure the continued supply of raw material to, and consequent retention of employment in, this important sector.</p></reply>

The plan sets out a roadmap for the Government&#8217;s vision, high level goals and integrated actions across policy, governance and business to enable Ireland&#8217;s marine potential to be realised in the coming years. The plan also provides a new momentum for growth in the marine area and involves Departments working together more efficiently and effectively on the diverse issues related to the marine. </p><p>  It is designed to contribute to getting the environment right for investment and so stimulate the private sector investment which will be crucial to achieving the targets outlined in the plan. As well as driving the potential of our marine economy, the plan will allow us to strike a balance between protecting the marine environment, its species and habitats, and maximising the use of its resources as a source of economic growth. </p><p>  The plan sets out an overarching target to double the value of Our Ocean Wealth to 2.4 % of GDP by 2030 and moving toward the EU average of 3.5%. The Government has also set a 2020 target of exceeding  &#8364;5bn in annual turnover. This would represent growth of approximately 50% drawn from a diverse range of marine sectors including marine and coastal tourism, marine commerce, seafood, shipping, oil and gas, renewable energy, marine manufacturing and other marine industries. The growth targets are based on existing government programmes such as my Department&#8217;s Food Harvest 2020 in relation to seafood, sector specific projections, for example, Failte Ireland covering Maritime and Coastal Tourism and base levels of marine economic activity as measured in the most comprehensive recent economic report, Ireland&#8217;s ocean Economy 2010. Socio- Economic Marine Research Unit in NUI Galway.</p><p>A copy of the published plan is available at </p><p>  Moving to the impact on marine facilities and tourism at the fisheries harbours, my Department has responsibility for the management and development of the six Fishery Harbour Centres, including Howth.  </p><p>  The Fishery Harbour Centres are unique in that they have been set up to provide a dedicated service to the Fishing Industry.  It is policy at each Fishery Harbour Centre that priority is always given to the needs of the fishermen and indeed the significant capital investment at the Fishery Harbour Centres has reflected this.</p><p>  However, in addition to serving the Fishing Industry, they also play an important role in the Irish tourist and marine leisure industry and also provide facilities for the support of passenger and cargo ferries to the islands.  There are comprehensive marine leisure facilities at Howth, Dingle and Ros An Mh&iacute;l Fishery Harbour Centres which work well alongside the needs of the fishing industry. My Department will continue to take every opportunity to facilitate and promote marine tourism at the Fishery Harbour Centres subject of course to its compatibility with the needs of fishermen and budgetary constraints. The various strands of the Integrated Marine Plan (IMP) which I have outlined are designed to provide a new momentum for growth in this area for harbours such as Howth. The key issue is the development of a strong inter agency approach which will see Departments and stakeholders working together more efficiently and effectively on the diverse issues related to the marine. </p></reply>

The current CFP is under review and will not be completed during the Cypriot Presidency and accordingly will fall for delivery during the Irish Presidency of the EU. </p><p>  My overarching goal for the new CFP is for a sustainable, profitable and self reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector, while balancing these objectives with the need to deliver a sustainable and eco centred fisheries landscape for future generations.</p><p>  In the current economic climate, we need a policy that both simplifies and reduces the administrative burden while at the same time strengthens and supports the industry&#8217;s capacity to maximise employment in coastal community&#8217;s dependant on fishing.  </p><p>  The new CFP will be agreed between the European Parliament and the EU Fisheries Council under the ordinary legislative process (co-decision).   </p><p>  The Council of Fisheries Ministers under the Danish Presidency reached a general approach on the Basic CFP Regulation and the Common Organisation of the Markets (CMO) at the June Fisheries Council (12 June).

For example, herd incidence has fallen from 7.5% in 2000 to 4.2% last year and reactor numbers in 2011 were, at 18,500, the lowest recorded since the commencement of the programme in the 1950&rsquo;s.  Reactor numbers and herd incidence have remained at close to 2011 levels this year.  I would like to emphasise that the reduction in disease levels has also resulted in considerable savings on disease eradication. For example, expenditure on the TB and Brucellosis eradication schemes has fallen by over &euro;20m or by one third since 2008.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the difficulty in attributing trends to a single factor, my Department believes that much of the improvement in the TB situation, in recent years, is due the badger removal programme which has been in place for some years now. While the badger culling programme would appear to be very successful here, the long-term objective of my Department is to develop a vaccine for badgers and considerable research has been conducted in collaboration with UCD and the UK Department of Agriculture on the development of such a vaccine. My Department is implementing a number of badger vaccination trials in order to establish the efficacy of the oral vaccine in reducing the level of TB infection in field conditions.  If the field trials are successful, badger vaccination will be introduced as part of the eradication programme in due course and this will reduce the need to remove TB infected badgers as TB levels fall in both cattle and badgers. It will be some years, however, before a vaccination programme on a widespread basis is a practicable proposition. </p><p>  The eradication programme is scientifically based and my Department continues to monitor and review the effectiveness and efficiency of the programme on an on-going basis in light of experience and research. In this context, my Department reviewed the programme last year and concluded that, since the badger constraint was now being effectively addressed, if further progress was to be made, it was necessary to address other potential sources of infection, including from neighbouring herds and the movement of high risk animals. For this reason, my Department introduced a number of changes into the TB programme earlier this year to prevent the spread of disease from infected herds to clear herds and to tighten up on overdue testing. These changes, which were made following a number of consultation meetings with the farming organisations, are designed to protect clear herds from buying in high risk animals and were based on research which demonstrated that there are increased risks attached to the movement of certain animals or being in the vicinity of a TB infected herd.</p><p>  I am satisfied that these changes have improved the effectiveness of the eradication scheme, particularly by confining the disease to herds where it is originally detected. I am also very pleased with the improvement in the incidence of TB in recent years. Nevertheless, I want to re-affirm that my Department&rsquo;s ultimate objective is to eradicate the disease and this appears to be a more realistic objective now than at any time in the past.  My Department will continue to review and make changes to various elements of the programme as deemed necessary in light of experience.</p></reply>

The building of alliances with counterparts in like-minded Member States is an essential component of Ireland&rsquo;s approach to both sets of negotiations.   </p><p>  The negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework, or MFF, for the period from 2014 to 2020 are being conducted under the auspices of the EU General Affairs Council, attended by my colleague, the Tanaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs. However, I have also been taking the opportunity, in the course of my extensive consultations with counterparts on the reform of the CAP - and in preparation for the Irish Presidency of the Agriculture Council - to make very clear Ireland&rsquo;s concerns in relation to the elements of the budget negotiations that have a direct bearing on the CAP. </p><p>  The overriding national priority is to safeguard CAP funding to the maximum extent possible, having regard to the reality that CAP accounts for over 80% of Ireland&rsquo;s total receipts of EU funding, equivalent to about &euro;12 billion over the 2007-2013 period.  This is a whole of Government position. The CAP is the only expenditure heading that has already been reduced in real terms in the Commission proposal. There is pressure from some Member States to reduce CAP spending further - and this has been reflected in the latest version of the Negotiating Box circulated by the Cypriot Presidency last week. The Irish Government&rsquo;s view remains that the amounts proposed by the Commission are the minimum acceptable, and we will strongly resist pressure for further cuts.  </p><p>  We also want to retain our current levels of funding for both direct payments and for rural development. The Commission proposals for Pillar 1 direct payments take a pragmatic approach to redistribution and are broadly satisfactory, albeit with a small loss to Ireland. However, the Presidency&rsquo;s communication last week raises the prospect of cuts to both pillars, and we will therefore continue to strongly defend our allocations in the course of the negotiations.  </p><p>Ultimately, of course, decisions on the MFF will be taken by EU Heads of State and Government.  A special meeting of the European Council has been scheduled for the 22nd and 23rd   of this month for this purpose, and it is my intention to attend those talks.</p><p>  More specifically in relation to CAP reform, the building of alliances is something that I have undertaken since my appointment in March of last year. Dialogue with my counterparts in other Member States has been a constant feature of the negotiations thus far, and has been particularly effective in recent months in our efforts to ensure that the scale of transfers arising from the redistribution of direct payments within Member States is kept to the minimum possible level.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that, under the Commission&rsquo;s flat rate proposals, the scale of transfers in Ireland would be extremely large, and both economically and politically unjustifiable. Approximately 75,000 farmers would see their payments rise by an average of 85%, while 55,000 would see their payments fall by an average of 33%. An alternative approach developed by Ireland, involving the application of the Commission&rsquo;s methodology for the distribution of direct payments between Member States, would ensure more modest gains of an average of 29% and losses of 9%. </p><p>  I have been working closely with like-minded Member States to gain support for this alternative approach, which is consistent with the Commission&rsquo;s desire to move away from the historical basis for direct payments but does not go as far or as fast as the Commission proposes. And I have been very successful, with five Member States - Denmark, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Luxembourg - signing up to a joint paper with Ireland that calls for Member States to be given the flexibility to apply this model. Other Member States have also shown interest, and we are continuing to consult with them. I am hopeful that these efforts will result in greater flexibility being given to Member States to implement models that suit their own farming conditions, and will mitigate the potential impact of the move away from the reference to historical payments.  </p><p>  Of course all of these bilateral contacts are in addition to the opportunities that I have availed of to discuss issues of importance to Ireland with my Ministerial colleagues from the other Member States - and Commissioner Ciolos - at the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers meetings held each month in Brussels or Luxembourg, and at the Informal Ministerial Councils, held this year, for example, in Denmark and Cyprus.  I have also addressed the Agricultural Committee of the European Parliament, and have met with key MEPs including Rapporteurs and Shadow Rapporteurs across the different CAP reform dossiers, as well as key interlocutors in the Commission and in the Council Secretariat. </p><p>  I plan to continue these contacts over the coming months, and to engage actively with Ministerial colleagues from other Member States, with the Commissioner and with Members of the European Parliament.  My approach will continue to be informed at all times by the need to maintain and develop alliances with like-minded Member States in order to secure the best possible outcome for Ireland in the CAP reform negotiations. </p><p>  I should add that my contacts at Ministerial level are supplemented by a parallel process of detailed engagement at official level by my Department with counterparts from the Commission, European Parliament and other Member States.</p></reply>

The objective of the review was to deliver a policy which would ensure an economically and biologically sustainable fishery. I received over 20 sets of proposals and comments in relation to herring stocks management. It was very clear from these documents that there was no agreement within the industry as to how the future herring fishing opportunities should be managed.  I asked my Department to examine the proposals received and to prepare for me a number of options, which as far as practically possible, took the views of stakeholders into account while delivering proper and effective management.</p><p>On 22 December 2011, I published a draft policy document on the matter which I believe meets the objectives to the greatest extent possible. I again carried out a written consultation process and received 49 written submissions. I then met the industry regarding the draft policy and again there was no consensus.</p><p>Having considered all views and having regard to the sustainability of the fisheries, I came to a decision which I believe provides for the proper and effective management and conservation and rational exploitation of the herring stocks.    The policy is based on giving access to each of the fisheries to those with recent track record in that particular fishery.  The track record involves vessels having landed a minimum of 5 tonnes of herring in 2009 or 2010 or in 3 of the 5 years during the period 2006 to 2010.  In addition, there are some very limited specified  circumstances where an earlier track record may be taken into account.</p><p>Both the North West Herring Fishery and the Celtic Sea Herring fishery are ring fenced separately based on the vessels track record in each fishery. A vessel may have qualified in one or both fisheries depending on the vessel&rsquo;s track record as specified above.</p><p>The only exception to track record relates to small vessels in the Dunmore area for the Celtic Sea fishery where a small scale local fishery is permitted in line with the Rebuilding/  Management Plan for the fishery.  Two modest restricted quota fisheries were established for vessels under 20m in overall length without a track record, in both the Celtic Sea and Area VIa South.</p><p>The decision made was based on a clear, detailed and objective assessment of the fisheries in recent years.  This policy is intended to ensure the long term sustainability of the herring fisheries by limiting participation in the main fisheries to those vessels which have participated in the fishery, in the 5 years prior to the commencement of the review, even at a low level.</p><p>There are 33 vessels which were not precluded from fishing for herring under the old system (i.e. less than or equal to 19.81m Registered Length) but which are now precluded from fishing for herring because they are greater than or equal to 20m in Length Overall and did not have the track record specified for qualification as set out above.  This list does not include all vessels of under 20m in overall length who would have in the past had the option to book into the fishery and receive an individual allocation for herring as there was no restriction in their licenses but did not have a track record of fishing for herring and now have access to allocations set under the modest restricted fishery on a periodic basis.   The vessels are shown below according to the registered home port of the vessel. This does not necessarily reflect the operational home port of the vessel.</p><p><table><tr><th>Registered Home Port</th><th>Vessels &gt; 20m LOA without Herring Access</th></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Arklow/Dublin</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Skibbereen</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Drogheda</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>3</td></tr></table></p></reply>

As part of this process the Commonage Framework Plans, first published in 2002, have been reviewed in co-operation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service to take account of the current vegetative condition of commonages nationally. This review which replaces the Commonage Framework Plans has been carried out on a commonage LPIS parcel basis and sets a minimum and maximum number of ewe equivalents (EE) required to graze the commonage parcel to ensure that it is maintained in Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions (GAEC)   </p><p>  The overall numbers required for each commonage LPIS parcel are apportioned to all claimants on a commonage based on the area of the commonage they claimed on their 2012 SPS application. This information is available on the Department&rsquo;s website. The area of commonage claimed by an applicant on their SPS application does not amend or adjust the actual share of the commonage owned by them. </p><p>  Maintaining commonage land in GAEC is vital to protect against areas being deemed ineligible under the Single Payment Scheme, other Direct Aid Schemes and consequential imposition of sanctions under Cross Compliance/GAEC provisions. All shareholders have a role to play in making sure that penalties are avoided and a collective approach to grazing the commonage minimises the risk of this happening. The Department is proposing, therefore, that scheme claimants will be required to submit details to Department in writing, of the number of ewe equivalents each will graze on the commonage to achieve the required grazing number across the whole commonage parcel. The collective agreement will allow flexibility for claimants to increase sheep numbers up to at least the minimum while not exceeding the maximum allowed.  </p><p>  The Department has been in on-going discussion for some time with the farming organisations in relation to the proposed changes. Further meetings are underway this week. Arrangements for the implementation of the proposals will be announced when final decisions have been made. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-06a.130.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012110600056#WRB02300"><p>A number of new tax measures were introduced in 2012, with a view to</p><p>  -	encourage farming as a career for young people; </p><p>  -	incentivise farm partnerships and greater productivity at farm level;</p><p>  -	stimulate land sales and land transfers;</p><p>  -	facilitate new enterprise opportunities in farming; and </p><p>  -	help agri-food businesses innovate and export.</p><p>  The new stock relief measure for farm partnerships introduced from January 2012 is intended to encourage more farmers to enter into partnership agreements.  For registered farm partnerships, the current rate of 25% stock relief was increased to 50%, and, for certain young trained farmers entering such partnerships, a rate of 100% stock relief is available.  This new incentive will run until December 2015.  I believe that collaboration through partnership can improve farm structures generally, facilitating farms to operate more efficiently, increasing scale on farms, and bringing more innovative and energetic young prospective farmers into farming.  More farming partnerships are required to increase productivity and meet the Food Harvest 2020 targets.  Several events were organised this year to encourage the concept of partnership amongst Irish farmers.  </p><p>  Budget 2012 reduced the stamp duty rate on agricultural land from 6% to 2%.  In addition, half the rate (1%) will be applicable on transfers to close relatives until the end of 2014.    This change will substantially reduce the stamp duty payable on transfers of farm land by gift or by sale. It should stimulate a stagnant land market &ndash; currently only 0.5% of total agricultural land is offered for sale annually &ndash; and ensure that land transfers to more active producers.  It will also promote inter-generational transfer, as the cost of lifetime transfer to transferees who do not qualify for the young trained farmer stamp duty relief has reduced considerably.</p><p>Budget 2012 restructured the retirement relief available on Capital Gains Tax in order to incentivise the earlier transfer of farm assets to the next generation, and to encourage the sale of land by those farmers with no successors.  As of 1st January 2014, for those farmers aged 66 and over, an upper limit of &euro;3m will be introduced on family transfers, compared to an unlimited amount currently.  On non-family transfers, the current upper limit of &euro;750,000 will be reduced to &euro;500,000.  Applying the new limits from 1st   January 2014 allows farmers already aged 66 and over to plan the orderly transfer of assets in advance of that date.</p><p>  Other tax changes introduced in budget 2012 which benefit the agri-food industry include:</p><p>  -	Additional supports which will benefit the food industry including improvements to the R&amp;D tax credit and a Foreign Earnings Deduction to apply where an 		individual spends 60 days a year developing markets for Ireland in the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa). </p><p>  -	The VAT rate applied to open farms (such as pet farms) will be 9% rather than the new standard rate of 23%.  This will be of significant benefit to such farms, 		which offer an important opportunity for farm diversification. It brings the treatment of open farms into line with the VAT rate applied to museums and other 		cultural attractions. </p><p>  -	The exemption rate for the Universal Social Charge has been raised from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036. This will be of particular benefit to low-paid seasonal workers in 		the farming sector. </p><p>  -	Consistent with the commitment in the Programme for Government on carbon tax, farmers are now allowed a double income tax deduction in respect of the 		increased costs arising from the change in carbon tax (the carbon tax is to increase from &euro;15 per tonne to &euro;20 per tonne from 1 May 2012 for agricultural 		diesel). </p><p>  -	An amendment to the VAT refund order for farm construction will allow farmers to claim a refund on wind turbines purchased from 1st January 2012.</p><p>  The taxation measures announced in Budget 2012 reflect the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the agri-food industry and in particular to the expansion planned in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.  This commitment will continue to inform future budgetary policy.</p></reply>

Since that date about 115,000 applicants have been paid some &euro;579M. Advance payments will continue to be made on clear cases, twice weekly, on an on-going basis. The balancing payments will commence as provided for under EU legislation from 1st   December.</p><p>The number of farmers not cleared for payment of the advance of the Single Farm Payment on 5th   November is 7,665 or 6.24% of applicants.  My Department will continue to clear the maximum possible number of these cases for payment by the 31st December.  However, due to the number of variables involved, it is not possible, at this stage, to indicate what the year-end outturn will be.   </p><p>  Payments under the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme commenced, on schedule, on 26 September and, to date, payments worth some &euro;185,864,741 have issued to 83,921 applicants. Given the changes to the Terms and Conditions governing the 2012 Scheme, prompted by the need to achieve the savings necessitated due to budgetary restrictions, it is difficult to project the level of spend that will be achieved by year-end. That said, however, every effort is being made to maximise the expenditure under the Scheme in the current calendar year. To this end payments are continuing to issue twice weekly, as individual cases are confirmed eligible for payment.</p><p>  As regards the agri-environmental schemes of REPS and AEOS, under the governing EU Regulations, comprehensive administrative checks, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, as well as field inspections must be completed before payments can issue. Actual expenditure in any one year will depend on the completion of this process and on the and level of query resolution on individual claims. </p><p>  I expect that 2012 payments of REPS 4 and of both AEOS 1 and 2 to commence shortly and my and my objective is to ensure that as many REPS and AEOS participant as possible are paid by year end. </p></reply>

Post reform, production is now concentrated in 18 Member States. The present regime runs from 1 September 2006 to the 30 September 2015. There is no mechanism under the present EU Regulations which would allow for the re-instatement of the sugar quota for the growing of sugar beet in Ireland for the production of sugar. Of course, sugar beet is still grown in Ireland as a fodder crop.</p><p>  In 2011 I met with two separate groups which had conducted feasibility studies, into the possibility of establishing a new sugar/bioethanol facility in the country. At both meetings, I stated that any venture to develop a combined sugar/bioethanol production facility would have to be a commercial proposition, financed in total by investors and interested parties and make sound economic sense in order to be viable. </p><p>  I also further suggested to both groups, the desirability of there being only one single proposition in play, as both studies had indicated a potential for only one such viable project and both groups had appeared to accept the reasonableness of this position at the time. Only recently, I re-stated that any business plan for a new venture in this area, would need to be competitive and that it would justify the very substantial investment to build a new facility. </p><p>  I have strongly supported the current EU Commission&#8217;s proposal to completely abolish sugar quotas from 30 September 2015, as part of the ongoing CAP reform discussions. At each meeting of the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers since October 2011, which has addressed this issue, I have intervened to fully support the Commission proposals for quota abolition. I also raised the issue with EU Agriculture Commissioner, Ciolos during his visit to Ireland in January 2012 and at the time I informed him of the growing momentum here for the revival of the sugar industry. </p><p>I also advised the Commissioner that while Ireland supports full quota abolition in 2015, if the regime were to continue beyond that date, Ireland does not want to be deprived, in the interim period of the option to recommence production<i>.</i>   I am also aware of a significant number of Member States which wish to see the current sugar quota regime extended to 2017 or 2018. In addition, the European Parliament have clearly stated that they want the regime extended to 2020, so I expect that in the eventual conclusion to these complex reform negotiations, in which the sugar question is but one significant element, a compromise outcome will be agreed. I will endeavour to ensure that if the sugar quota regime does get extended beyond 2015, Ireland will be allowed to access a sufficient quota amount, to ensure the reinstatement of a viable sugar industry here.</p><p>  I am most actively involved in these negotiations between Member States, on all aspects of the CAP Reform Proposals, including those concerning the EU sugar regime. </p><p>  During the first half of 2013, Ireland will hold the Presidency of the EU and I will assume the role of Chairman of the Council of Agriculture Ministers during that 6 month period. Based on current progress and developments in these negotiations, I believe that agreement on the CAP Reform measures can be concluded in the Council, including an outcome on the future of the EU sugar quota regime, during our Presidency period.  </p></reply>

These require that a full and comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, as well as field inspections, must be completed before payment issue. The Commission have made it clear, in the course of audits, that all checks must be passed and eligibility conditions met. This means that a farmer&rsquo;s application must be fully in order, all outstanding documentation provided and queries resolved before payment can be released to him or her. Given these requirements, my officials take considerable care in validating payments while also ensuring that farmers receive their payments as soon as possible.  In overall terms, the situation is that preparations for payments are now at an advanced stage and I expect that payments under both REPS and AEOS in respect of the 2012 scheme year will commence shortly.</p></reply>

It marks a point at which the Rockall Bank, part of the very large Hatton-Rockall area of continental shelf extending under the north-east Atlantic Ocean, protrudes 21 metres above sea level.  During the 1960s and 1970s the issue of Rockall was a source of legal and political controversy in both Ireland and the United Kingdom. The UK claims sovereignty over Rockall and has sought to formally annex it under its 1972 Island of Rockall Act.   While Ireland has not recognised British sovereignty over Rockall, it has never sought to claim sovereignty for itself.  The consistent position of successive Irish Governments has been that Rockall and similar rocks and skerries have no significance for establishing legal claims to mineral rights in the adjacent seabed or to fishing rights in the surrounding seas.  </p><p>  During the course of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which took place from 1973 to 1982, Ireland worked hard to achieve agreement on this principle. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which was adopted at the conclusion of the Conference on 10 December 1982, provides at Article 121, paragraph 3 that:  &ldquo;Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.&rdquo;  Rockall falls into precisely this category.  </p><p>  In 1988, Ireland and the UK reached agreement on the delimitation of areas of the continental shelf between the two countries, stretching out up to 500 nautical miles from their respective coastlines.  This included the division of the Hatton-Rockall area of continental shelf on which Rockall is situated, although under the terms of the Law of the Sea Convention the location of Rockall was irrelevant to the determination of the boundary.  According to that determination, Rockall is situated to the north of the boundary agreed with the UK in 1988 and lies outside the zone claimed by Ireland.  </p><p>  As with any claim to continental shelf lying beyond 200 nautical miles from a state&rsquo;s coast, the UN Convention requires that Ireland and the UK submit their claims for examination to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf.  However, the claims to the Hatton-Rockall shelf agreed between Ireland and the UK are not accepted by Iceland or Denmark (on behalf of the Faroe Islands), which make their own claims.  </p><p>  The four countries have met regularly since 2001 in an effort to resolve the overlapping claims issue, but to date have been unable to reach agreement.  The 10-year deadline for the making of submissions to the UN Commission expired for Ireland in May 2009.  The Government therefore submitted the national claim for this area at the end of March 2009, as did the British Government in respect of the UK&rsquo;s claim.  The deadline for the Faroe Islands is 2014 (because Denmark, which is responsible for the foreign relations of the Faroe Islands, only became a party to the Convention on the Law of the Sea in 2004) and its submission was lodged with the Commission in New York in 2010. </p><p>  The Commission&rsquo;s rules of procedure prevent consideration by the Commission of a submission relating to a disputed area without the consent of all the states concerned and Iceland does not currently consent to the consideration of these submissions.  The submission within the deadline preserved the State&rsquo;s legal position and since then the Government has continued to work for the creation of conditions that will permit its consideration as soon as possible. </p><p>  The State&rsquo;s continental shelf has already been successfully extended beyond 200 nautical miles in the area to the west of the Porcupine Bank where, following consideration by the UN Commission, 39,000 square kilometres of additional seabed designated in 2009 under the Continental Shelf Act.  Together with France, Spain and the UK, we have also made a successful submission to the Commission in relation to a large area of seabed in the Celtic Sea and Bay of Biscay and the four countries have recently begun discussions on the division of this area.</p></reply>

However, in circumstances where groups in Gaza continue to fire missiles at Israel, primarily at civilian targets, as has been happening again in the last week, Israel is entitled to interdict supplies of arms destined for Gaza, and therefore to detain and search cargoes.  Non-military goods, however, should then be allowed to enter.   I have seen reports that the ship recently intercepted was carrying supplies of basic non-military goods.  I have also seen reports that the cargo in question was then transferred to Gaza by land; I should say, however, that I have no direct information to verify either of these reports.</p><p>  While I have every respect for the motives of those engaged in these efforts, these repeated attempts to break an enforced naval blockade have been both dangerous and, I would suggest, counter-productive.   There is a risk that the flotillas themselves will become the focus of political discussion rather than the issue of Gaza itself.   Shipments into Gaza, even if unimpeded, can never provide more than a fraction of the needs of the territory.   Much larger volumes enter the territory daily both from Israel and in smuggling tunnels which stretch across the border with Egypt.  The key issue is not sea access but persuading Israel to lift the restrictions on land shipments, which are the only way in which the needs of Gaza can be met.</p></reply>

However, there is no prospect at present of achieving consensus on such a ban.</p><p>  I have written to the Deputy, and to all Deputies, this week to set out in greater detail the Government&rsquo;s position on issues related to settlement products.</p><p>  The report &lsquo;Trading Away Peace&rsquo; is an important and powerful synopsis of issues surrounding the illegal settlements, which are an increasingly destructive element both in the lives of Palestinians and in relation to the very concept of a peace agreement in the Middle East.  Settlements are thus a real threat to the interests and future of both Palestinians and Israelis.   While I would not necessarily accept all of the views in the report, I agree -- and have been saying for some time -- that the international community, and the EU specifically, need to become more active about these issues and, where necessary, to follow up statements with actions.</p><p>  It is impossible to estimate with any degree of certainty the value of settlement goods imported into Ireland.  Total imports to Ireland from Israel last year were &euro;177 million.   The EU Commission has estimated very roughly that settlement products might amount to somewhat under 1% of imports from Israel.   This would suggest that settlement goods imported into Ireland might amount to roughly &euro;1.7 million (though this is a very imprecise estimate).  The percentages estimated in the above-mentioned report might suggest a somewhat higher figure, although the total would still be quite small.</p></reply>

I have regularly stated in this House that this Government does not tolerate and will not tolerate the use of our airspace or airports for any illegal purpose, including torture, rendition or the unauthorised detainment of any individual.  This position is unchanged; Ireland remains totally opposed to the practice of extraordinary rendition. </p><p>  Immediately following the first reports several years ago that the US was practising extraordinary rendition to transit prisoners, the then Government demanded and received specific assurances from the US authorities that such prisoners had not been transferred through Irish territory, nor would they be, without our permission. These assurances were confirmed at the highest political level.  They were of a clear and categoric nature, relating to facts and circumstances within the full control of the US authorities.  I am satisfied, as previous Ministers have been, that it is appropriate for the Government to rely fully on these assurances.</p><p>  The permission of the Government must be sought and obtained for the transport of prisoners through Irish airports. I made it clear in this House on 22 May 2012 that &ldquo;under no circumstances will we grant permission for the transport of prisoners who are subject to extraordinary rendition&rdquo;.</p><p>  It is likely that a small number of commercially leased aircraft which have been involved in legitimate commercial activities have also been involved at various times in activities related to extraordinary renditions.   However, there is no evidence to suggest that any of these aircraft were carrying prisoners at any time when they transited through Irish airports, including Shannon Airport. </p><p>  The Deputy seeks the introduction of &ldquo;a system of checks and investigations aimed at ensuring that there can be no aircraft passing through Shannon involved in the practice of extraordinary rendition&rdquo;.    Where allegations have been made, including by members of the Oireachtas, these have been fully investigated by senior officers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In no case has any evidence been adduced to support claims that extraordinary rendition had occurred.   If anyone has evidence to suggest that any person subject to extraordinary rendition has transited an Irish airport during this process, this evidence should be made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, so that an investigation can take place.     </p><p>  Questions relating to the regulation of international civil aviation and to the Chicago Convention are primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.   The Department of Transport is the primary interlocutor with the International Civil Aviation Authority, which has responsibility under this Convention for the regulation of international civil aviation.   </p></reply>

I have also made it clear that all necessary actions to pursue those guilty of this crime must be taken by the Ugandan authorities and that Irish funding be repaid in order that it can be used for the purposes for which it was intended, that is assisting the poor of Northern Uganda.</p><p>The Auditor General of Uganda has been carrying out a special investigation into the handling of aid funds by the Office of the Prime Minister. Ireland has been working with and assisting the office of the Auditor General as an inherent part of our programme of building accountable institutions of Government. He has visited Ireland to look at our systems of accountability. His recent report highlights significant financial mismanagement in relation to the Peace Recovery and Development Programme (PRDP) for Northern Uganda.  The PRDP Programme was established to rebuild <i>Northern Uganda, a region which has suffered dreadfully from internal conflict and the ravages of Joseph Kony and his so-called Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army</i>  .  The Auditor General has found that funding of &#8364;12.6 million received from Ireland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark last year was transferred to unauthorised accounts, of which the Irish Aid component is &#8364;4 million.</p><p>  Our Ambassador in Kampala and the Director General of Irish Aid, who travelled out from Ireland, last week met with the Prime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Finance and Economic Development of Uganda and stressed my insistence that the misappropriated funds be restored by the Ugandan authorities.  The Ugandan Government have since confirmed that all Irish Aid funds that have been misappropriated will be reimbursed, that the officials against whom financial impropriety has been established will be fully prosecuted, and that strong measures will be undertaken to tighten their internal controls. I welcome this commitment and have directed our Ambassador to work with the Ugandan authorities in bringing matters forward.  The suspension of funding channelled through the Government of Uganda remains in place.</p><p>  A team from the Evaluation and Audit Unit of my Department also travelled to Uganda last week to investigate the findings of the Auditor General and they will be reporting shortly.</p><p><i>Ireland&#8217;s aid programme is strongly focused on the poorest people and communities in sub-Saharan Africa. </i><i>The Government will not provide financial support under our development cooperation programme unless it is clear that Irish money is being spent for the purpose for which it was allocated.  </i>  Irish funding is not given to the Ugandan Government to spend as they see fit, but rather it is for programmes in particular in the social, health and education sectors that are prescribed and agreed with Irish Aid. Funding sector programmes through Government systems is an important tool in achieving strong development outcomes and empowering national Governments to deliver and take ownership of the provision of services is essential if the improvements put in place are to be sustainable in the long term. </p><p>In the case of Uganda, the independence and strength of the Auditor General is a clear sign of Ugandan Government accountability systems working well and the importance of assisting in this work. Ireland has been providing technical and financial assistance to his office for a number of years to build the skills and capacity required for the conduct of complex investigations such as this. <i>While the findings of the Auditor General in this case are deeply disturbing, the fact that the Auditor General is now in a position to make them is a demonstration of the increased capacity and determination of elements within the Ugandan administration to enforce accountability for the use of government and donor money.  </i>  It is only by building national accountable systems such as this that corruption can be eliminated and I believe that if eventually we are in a position to resume development assistance to Uganda, we must continue to work and assist the Auditor General. </p><p>  Our aid programme in Ugandan is regularly examined and evaluated in order to ensure we achieve effectiveness and value for money. This is done through: auditors based in our Embassy in Kampala; the evaluation and audit team at headquarters; international accountancy firms whom we commission to carry out audits; the national audit offices of our partner Governments; and my Department&#8217;s Audit Committee which provides an independent appraisal of Irish Aid&#8217;s audit and evaluation and also meets with the Comptroller and Auditor General and publishes an annual report on its work. However, it is clear that notwithstanding all these &#8216;checks and balances&#8217; that funding programmes through Governments can be very challenging as we can see in this particular case. I am committed to ensuring that we learn from this to strengthen our systems of monitoring and audit to seek to minimise the potential for the misuse of funds.</p><p>Ireland has had a bilateral aid programme with Uganda since 1994. The programme is strongly focussed on reducing poverty among some of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people in the country. Our aid programme in Uganda is designed to: reduce the incidence of HIV and AIDS; to build schools and provide education for poor children; to reduce the incidence of Gender Based Violence; to improve democratic accountability including the promotion and protection of human rights; to help enhance the capacity of  the private sector to provide jobs and economic opportunities for Ugandans and, in particular, to provide support for Karamoja<i>,</i>   which is one of the poorest and most marginalised regions of the country.</p><p>Since commencing our work in Uganda, we have witnessed huge improvements in the quality of life for the Ugandan people.  Peace has returned to most of the country after generations of war.  There are now 8.3 million pupils in primary schools compared to 2.5 million in 1997. The HIV prevalence rate has been reduced dramatically from 18% in the 90s to just over 6% today. Most importantly, poverty has more than halved over the last two decades.<b></b>  These are real achievements, which have been made possible with the support of donors such as Ireland.</p><p>  Currently 190 staff are assigned to the Development Cooperation Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade at Headquarters and Embassies and Missions overseas.  There are four  headquarters based officers in the Embassy in Kampala . In addition, the Embassy has a number of professional staff hired locally to provide technical input to specific programme and project areas, including a professional accountant, an internal auditor and several staff working specifically on monitoring and auditing of programmes.</p><p>  The annual budget for the Irish Aid programme in Uganda over recent years was &#8364;32.75 million in 2011, &#8364;33 million in 2010, and &#8364;35.4 million in 2009. Additional support of over &#8364;7 million annually was provided by Irish Aid through NGOs, missionaries and other international partners for their work in Uganda.  </p><p>  I will continue to ensure that our funding is directed to those areas most in need, is used for the purposes intended and represents the best value for money. We are committed to delivering on our commitment that all aid funded by the taxpayer will benefit the poorest and most vulnerable in the countries where we are working.</p></reply>

Details of the Irish, international and Ugandan NGOs that receive funding from Irish Aid for  programmes in Uganda are detailed below.</p><p>It should be noted that funding proposals submitted by NGOs are rigorously appraised against clear criteria by Irish Aid staff both in Headquarters in Ireland and in the Irish Embassy in Kampala and, as appropriate by external experts. The criteria include a proven organisational capacity for the effective use of funding and an assessment of management and oversight systems within partner organisations. Departmental procedures to ensure that funding to the NGO sector is used for the intended purposes include regular field monitoring visits, annual narrative and financial reporting against agreed objectives and budgets, evaluations, audits and ongoing reviews of compliance. Audit is a fundamental component of good governance and the primary responsibility for complying with audit obligations rests with the NGOs funded by the Department. NGO partners must submit annual audited accounts to the Department as part of the annual reporting process.</p><p>I have witnessed on my recent trips to sub-Saharan Africa the excellent work being undertaken by many Irish and international NGOs funded by Irish Aid. I am personally very committed to working with NGOs, both large and small, to build their capacity to make a real difference on the ground in the countries that they operate. I am fully aware of the deep rooted historic support of the public to Irish NGOs working to improve the lives of those in developing nations. My Department will continue to support the work of NGOs in Uganda and in our other Programme Countries and will ensure that Irish Aid funding is directed to those areas most in need, is used for the purposes intended and represents the best value for money.

This report is in turn examined by the Public Accounts Committee.</p><p>  Secondly, my Department has in place a fully independent Audit Committee who reports to and advises the Secretary General.  The Audit Committee provides oversight of the evaluation and audit function, reviews the work programme and audit policies, and assesses the operation of the Department&rsquo;s system of Risk Management.   The Audit Committee meets approximately 8 times each year, including annually with the Office of the Comptroller &amp; Auditor General.  It publishes an annual report on its work.</p><p>  The work of the Evaluation and Audit Unit in my Department is in line with international auditing standards employing a risk-based approach to determine its multi-annual workplan.  This is approved by the Secretary General and overseen by the independent Audit Committee.</p><p>  The role of audit has evolved in recent years to include reviews by my Department of partner Governments&rsquo; public financial management systems in countries where Irish Aid implements its development programmes. Evidence gathered from these reviews demonstrate that National Audit Offices (NAOs) are operating effectively.  This in turn allows my Department to use National Audit Offices as part of our audit systems. </p><p>  As part of the Evaluation and Audit Unit&rsquo;s strategy to strengthen the capacity of National Audit Offices, my Department supports a global initiative known as the INTOSAI Donor Cooperation (International Organisation for Supreme Audit Institutions) and Ireland is a prominent member of this initiative providing both funding and in-kind support.  </p><p>  Regular reviews of the overall audit approach, audit work programmes and resources are undertaken by the Evaluation and Audit Unit to ensure that developments in audit keep abreast of the challenges posed by the expanding programme.  As part of this process the Evaluation and Audit Unit proposed in 2011 that an external review of the audit systems employed by my Department be undertaken and this review is scheduled to take place in 2013.  I look forward to the outcome of this review.  In addition, the Evaluation and Audit constantly monitors its own performance and adjusts its operation to ensure maximum effectiveness.</p></reply>

A Risk Management Committee, chaired by the Head of Corporate Services Division, coordinates risk management across the Department and reports to the Management Advisory Committee (MAC).  Individual Heads of Division are responsible for managing Risk in their own areas of operation and Risk management is a standing item on the agenda of the monthly meetings of the MAC.  This structure and approach is in line with Department of Finance guidelines.  Nevertheless, my Department is constantly striving to enhance its Risk Management processes in line with best practice.  In that context, it is considering a recommendation from the Department&rsquo;s external Audit Committee that a Chief Risk Officer be designated for the Department.   Given the very diverse range of functions fulfilled by the Department and the need to concentrate increasingly scarce staff resources on major current and upcoming operational responsibilities, it is has not been possible to identify a candidate to fulfil the role who is free of line management responsibilities.  The Secretary General of my Department invited the Audit Committee to meet with the MAC to elaborate further on its proposal and set out its view of how a dedicated Chief Risk Officer would operate in the Department and this meeting will take place shortly.  </p><p>  The Audit Committee has also recommended the appointment of a Head of Finance at Counsellor/Principal Officer grade who holds a professional accounting qualification and who has significant relevant experience.  While the current moratorium on recruitment and the limited possibilities for redeployment of a suitably qualified candidate from elsewhere in the public service means that it has not been possible to implement this recommendation to date, my Department is developing a proposal to strengthen and upgrade its professional capacities in the accounting area which will feature in the Department&rsquo;s Workforce Plan which will be finalised shortly. </p><p>  In the meantime, I note that both internal audits and external Comptroller and Auditor General audits have reported satisfaction with the management and operation of the Department&rsquo;s Finance Unit.</p></reply>

As a large and nearby market, with similar business practices and client needs, it is a natural fit for Irish exporters. It accounts, for example, for 41% of Irish Food and Drink exports and the market supports vital employment in the Irish economy.    It is also a growing market. Notwithstanding the current economic challenges globally, for the first eight months of this year, our merchandise exports to Britain have increased by more than &euro;1billion compared with the same period last year, reflecting both the quality and value of the offering from Irish exporters and the priority attached to the market by the Government.  </p><p>  Reflecting that importance, the level of trade promotion activity by the Government in the British market is already quite extensive. To date in 2012 there have been 25 Ministerial or high-level visits to Britain incorporating a trade promotion element. Typically these have been in support of specific sectorial trade promotional activities by the State development agencies. </p><p>  Our economic agencies and our diplomatic service have a significant market presence in Britain, and are well positioned to support exporters there on a targeted and ongoing basis. </p><p>  Notwithstanding that extensive promotional effort and export performance, the Government is clear that we must seek to further develop our trade relationship with Britain. </p><p>  The Joint Statement issued by the Taoiseach and PM Cameron in March of this year aims to build on the existing strong trade relations between Ireland and the UK. Supporting and further developing this growth is something to which I am devoting considerable attention. </p><p>  The Joint Statement identifies a number of sectors where collaboration between British and Irish entities could give rise to mutual gain and work is ongoing between the two Governments in pursuit of that agenda.</p><p>  It is also true that, even without availing of the Government support available, it is possible for Irish companies to engage in Britain with relative ease. Many Irish suppliers maintain a physical presence in the UK and in some sectors customers operate as a UK and Ireland business, resulting in market needs which are very closely aligned. </p><p>  I should also note that trade missions may take place under the auspices of non- governmental groups, including Chambers of Commerce, which bring together companies with common interests.  The Deputy may be aware, for example, that there is a newly formed British Irish Chamber of Commerce which I expect will engage in activities designed to increase trade between Britain and Ireland.</p><p>  Because of the importance of the British market, I intend to keep the level and nature of trade promotion with Britain under review and to support whatever activities best generate new business opportunities and employment in Irish firms.</p></reply>

Every day it saves lives and builds capacity for the future &ndash; making a real difference in the lives of millions. The programme is central to our foreign policy, has an enviable international reputation, and consistently enjoys strong political and public support. </p><p>  Over the past five years, and despite the very difficult economic conditions facing the country for much of that period, Ireland has consistently contributed over 0.52% of Gross National Product (GNP) towards Official Development Assistance (ODA). This level of contribution has earned us a strong reputation for being a generous and reliable donor, and clearly demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s determination to meet our commitments towards assisting some of the world poorest people. In the current year, Ireland will contribute &euro;639 million to ODA.  </p><p>  Each year a detailed analysis of Ireland&rsquo;s ODA is published in the statistical annexes to the Irish Aid Annual Report.  The annexes provide a comprehensive analysis of Ireland&rsquo;s ODA, including the developing countries supported; the areas or sectors in which we engage, and the partner organisations implementing our development programmes. I am arranging for copies of the annual reports for the past five years to be sent to the Deputy. </p><p>  Irish Aid works in some of the world&rsquo;s least developed countries, often in challenging and risky environments. Many times we are working through government systems and other partnerships with relatively low capacity.  We have put in place rigorous systems for planning, monitoring, evaluating and auditing the aid programme to ensure funding is spent for the purposes intended. We continually monitor and assess programmes both at mission level and by headquarters staff to ensure that programmes deliver the intended results. A comprehensive system of internal audit is in place, with an independent audit committee which reports directly to the Secretary General. We work closely with national audit offices and provide assistance where appropriate. All instances and/or allegations of fraud or misappropriation are reported directly to the Secretary General and onwards to the Comptroller and Auditor General.     However no control environment, no matter how strong, can provide cast iron assurances that fraud or misappropriation will not occur.  In the last two weeks evidence of serious misappropriation of funding in Uganda has come to light concerning Irish and other donor funding intended for Northern Uganda.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade took immediate and decisive action and suspended all aid to Uganda through government systems, until such time as the funding is repaid and action taken against the perpetrators of this fraud. In addition a team of Evaluation and Audit officials from my Department travelled to Uganda to investigate the findngs of the Auditor General and will be reporting back shortly.</p><p>  The role of the Ugandan Auditor General was very important in identifying this fraud especially in view of the levels of collusion involved. Irish Aid has been assisting this Office over a number of years as part of its programme of building strong and accountable Government institutions. Corruption and fraud must be fought if continuing progress is to be made in Africa. Offices of Auditors General are key to this fight and we will continue to support them where possible. </p><p>  We have now received confirmation from the Ugandan Government that all Irish Aid funding misappropriated will be repaid; the officials who engaged in financial impropriety will be fully prosecuted, and that strong measures will be undertaken to tighten internal controls.  We welcome this commitment, and our Ambassador in Kampala is working with the Ugandan authorities in bringing matters forward.  Finally, we are determined to ensure the lessons learned from Uganda are incorporated into our business control system. </p></reply>

One officer who retired under this arrangement has been temporarily re-engaged in order to assist with the Department&#8217;s activities in the lead-up to and during Ireland&#8217;s Presidency of the EU from January to June 2013.  The officer was re-engaged on a pension abatement basis, meaning that he continues to receive his pension and is paid a correspondingly reduced salary by the Department. This temporary recruitment arrangement is in line with a Government Decision of 16 December 2011 relating to Presidency matters, including staffing arrangements.  The policy of my Department regarding the re-hiring of retired officials is to do so to the minimum extent possible.  However, for certain once-off or short-duration projects, it is more productive and cost-effective to re-hire retired staff who already have the relevant expertise and experience than to go through a time-consuming and relatively expensive recruitment, induction and training process.     There are no State agencies, offices or bodies under the aegis of my Department.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, we are in a programme of financial support with the EU and the IMF.  The programme documents include a commitment to publish a budget to achieve a specified level of consolidation.  The commitment provides broad indications of how this is to be achieved. As part of our programme, we are obliged to share some information with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF &ndash; the External Partners, especially during the quarterly review missions.    In this context, the continuing conditions listed at the start of the Memorandum on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality include the following provision:</p><p>  &quot;To facilitate programme monitoring, the authorities will provide the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF with:..... All information required to monitor progress during programme implementation and to track the economic and financial situation.&quot;  Such information is shared on a confidential basis, with the understanding that its circulation is restricted. This includes technical information on the options for revenue and expenditure measures which could be considered to meet the fiscal consolidation targets already specified.  Any such options are clearly signalled as being subject to Government decision. This information flow is part of the process needed to facilitate the evaluation of the performance to date, and also, to provide assurance to the EU, ECB, and the IMF that there are options available to enable us meet our commitments. </p><p>  The quarterly review process is an integral part of our financial support programme. The process starts with a review mission and ends with consideration and approval by the EU (Commission and Council) and the IMF Executive Board.  Following each review mission the external partners and the Irish authorities agree updated programme documents, specifically the Letters of Intent, the Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality, the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies and the Technical Memorandum of Understanding. Once finalised, the Letters of Intent are signed jointly by the Minister for Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank and are issued to the EU and the IMF, along with the accompanying programme documents.  These documents are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and placed on the Department of Finance website following their transmission.  In the event that these documents are issued prior to Budget Day, they will not include Budget Day details as mentioned above.</p></reply>

The levy will operate for a period of 4 years only (2011 to 2014) and the legislative provisions giving effect to the levy (section 4 of Finance (No 2) Act 2011) were specifically drafted to reflect this.</p><p>The moneys raised from the pension fund levy are being used to pay for the Government&#8217;s <i>Jobs Initiative </i>introduced<i></i>in May 2011. The measures introduced as part of the <i>Jobs Initiative</i>   include a new 9% VAT rate on certain activities, the halving of the lower rate of PRSI and small amounts of additional current and capital expenditure.</p><p>The implementation of a jobs and growth strategy is a key priority of the Government. The measures announced in the <i>Jobs Initiative</i>   are aimed at assisting in employment generation &#8211; providing opportunities for those who are out of work, to restore public morale and confidence in the economy and encourage spending by consumers. </p><p>  The chargeable persons for the levy are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) with responsibility for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans. The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled, where they decide to do so, to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy. It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible. I cannot intervene in this process in respect of the ESB pension fund or other pension funds.</p><p>  However, the legislation also includes safeguards aimed at ensuring that benefits payable, either currently or prospectively to any member, are adjusted in such a way that the reduction in value of those benefits shall not exceed 0.6% of the market value of the assets accounting for the scheme&#8217;s liabilities to that member. </p><p>  I am conscious of the concerns of pension scheme members about the impact of a levy in circumstances where the pensions sector, in common with other sectors in our economy and society, is finding the current economic and financial environment very challenging.  However, much of the value of pension funds is attributable to the rolled up value of generous tax reliefs that pension savings have historically been granted and continue to receive. The imposition of the levy is for a relatively short period and its purpose is to improve the economic environment by providing the means to encourage job creation in areas of our economy most likely to deliver that employment quickly. </p></reply>

As the populations of most EU countries are aging, issues around pension sustainability and adequacy mean that effective retirement age and the need for longer working in particular have come to the fore. In Ireland, there are currently six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately two to one by 2050.  People aged 65 years and over will account for a greater proportion of the population while the proportion of working age is expected to decline.  People are living longer with healthier lives and growing numbers of people want to work, or may need to work beyond State pension age.  This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.  Therefore, the task of financing increasing pensions will fall to a diminishing share of the population.  </p><p>  With these challenges and opportunities in mind, earlier this year, the Government asked the OECD to examine Ireland&rsquo;s overall pension policy in light of the economic downturn and to ensure that it meets the needs of future generations.   The review, which began in April of this year, encompasses the totality of pension provision in Ireland i.e. state, private, occupational and public sector.  The review takes account of the Programme for Government commitments in the pensions area, including tax reliefs and the commitment to cap taxpayers&rsquo; subsidies for pension schemes, (including politicians&rsquo; pension schemes), that deliver income in retirement of more than &euro;60,000.   The review will focus in particular on the commitment on universal coverage, and is also informed by developments at EU level in relation to pensions.   </p><p>  The OECD will report on the sustainability of the pension system in the light of demographic and investment challenges; the adequacy and coverage levels, in order to ensure adequate income in retirement with a particular focus on the lower and middle income group; the modernity of pension systems to ensure flexibility in the labour market and supporting mechanisms for longer working, and equity within the pension system.</p><p>  In addition to this overall review, the Government has, since coming into office, introduced a number of key pension reforms:</p><p>  Legislation was introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 to abolish the State pension (transition) with effect from January 2014 thereby standardising pension age at 66.   The State pension (contributory) age will be increased to 67 in 2021 and to 68 with effect from 2028.</p><p>  Further changes to State pension include changes to rate bands; to align the rate of pension paid with the contribution made ensures that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions. </p><p>  Significant changes to occupational pensions, specifically defined benefit pension provision have also been introduced:</p><p>  Legislation introduced in 2011 provided for a sovereign annuity as an option for pension schemes.  In August, the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) announced details of the sale of over &euro;1 billion of Irish Amortising Bonds which were purchased by pension schemes and welcomed pension funds into the economy.</p><p>  The regulatory structure for defined benefit pension schemes has been re-introduced. Legislation enacted during the year strengthened the Funding Standard by introducing a requirement for schemes to develop a risk reserve from 2016 and to meet the reserve requirement in 2023 with a view to ensuring greater security for pension scheme members and giving pension schemes increased protection from market volatility in the future.</p><p>  The &ldquo;Report on Pension Charges in Ireland 2012&rdquo; was recently published by my Department with support from the Central Bank and Pensions Board.  This report, which is a fact finding report, has concluded that there are serious challenges in relation to the reasonableness and transparency of the pension changes.   Comments from interested parties and stakeholders are being invited over a 3 month period (i.e. by the end of January 2013).  These responses will be considered and a further policy and regulatory response, if necessary, will be brought to Government.</p></reply>

On the understanding that the residence under construction will, when completed, become the individual&rsquo;s sole or main residence, tax relief is generally afforded on the interest paid on monies used to purchase the site and on interest paid on monies used to fund various stages of construction.  However, where the residence when completed does not become the sole or main residence of the individual, any tax relief granted on interest paid will be recouped. </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, tax relief on interest paid on all qualifying home loans is being phased out. Tax relief on interest paid on qualifying home loans taken out in the period 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2012 will continue up to and including the 2017 tax year. However, tax relief is not available on interest paid on loans taken out on or after 1 January 2013.  Likewise, where a residence is under construction, only the interest paid on monies drawn down on or before 31 December 2012 will qualify for tax relief.  </p><p>  A qualifying loan for mortgage interest relief is one which without having been used for any other purpose, is used in purchase, repair, development or improvement of a claimant&rsquo;s principal private residence.   </p><p>  As with all time-limited reliefs, there will always be people who just miss out, and that is why I have been as flexible as possible with the legislation within the current budgetary constraints. However, I do not intend to extend the parameters of mortgage interest relief any further.</p></reply>

AIB does not disclose the amounts paid to these advisors for commercial reasons. As AIB has a strong focus on minimising the costs to the bank of these expert advisors, in each case, the bank undertook a competitive tendering process to select the advisors to assist in this sale process. These processes focused on relevant experience, product knowledge, quality of advisory team and fee structure. Furthermore, in the case of the sales advisor, fees were structured to incentivise the advisor to assist in maximising value for the bank and its stakeholders.</p><p>  This sale brings AIB&rsquo;s total net non-core de-leveraging to date to 80% of AIB&rsquo;s 3 year PLAR de-leveraging target of &euro;20.5bn. AIB remains on course to complete the majority of its total 2013 de-leveraging targets by year end 2012 and to achieve this target in line with PCAR capital requirements assumed under the March 2011 exercise.</p></reply>

In addition, details of all hydrocarbon oils, including marked gas oil, retained for home use are included in Revenue&#8217;s annual Statistical Report, which is published on <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>.</p><p>  My understanding of the Deputy&#8217;s second question is that it envisages a movement away from the current system of marking of oil to which a reduced rate of tax applies to one in which certain users would be given refunds as part of the mineral oil tax paid by them in respect of fuel used for non-auto purposes.  The issue of the introduction of a rebate scheme for users of marked gas oil has been addressed in previous parliamentary debates.  A change to a system of this nature would involve the establishment of an expensive repayments system and would give rise to significant costs and place an administrative burden on oil traders, users and the Revenue Commissioners.  It would also pose significant cash-flow costs for those currently using marked gas oil.  Marked gas oil has a wide range of uses such as the propulsion of trains, the operation of agricultural, construction and industrial machinery, commercial sea-navigation (including fishing) and for commercial and home heating purposes.  Any change in the existing system would therefore impact across a wide range of users.</p><p>  Enforcement action is taken by the Revenue at all stages of the fuel supply chain, targeting those involved in laundering and those selling laundered fuel.  Legislation introduced this year includes provision for the strengthening of licensing requirements for the sale of auto-fuel as well as the introduction of a new system of licensing for the sale of marked gas oil.  There will also be a new requirement, from January 2013, for all fuel traders to make monthly returns to Revenue detailing their fuel transactions.  This will be an important new source of information on the fuel supply chain and will assist in the identification of unusual or suspicious patterns of activity.</p><p>  In addition, the Revenue Commissioners are working closely with Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs in the UK on the development of a more effective fuel marker.  An Invitation to Make Submissions was issued jointly by both administrations in June.  This has generated considerable interest across a number of countries and I am advised that it is expected that a significant number of proposals will be submitted by the closing date of 30 November.</p></reply>

The Exchequer had available cash balances of &euro;22.5 billion at end-October 2012.    Funds in the Exchequer are used for the ongoing payments necessary for running the State. The April Stability Programme Update (SPU) estimated that the cumulative Exchequer deficit over the years 2013-2014 would be close to &euro;25 billion. In addition to these day-to-day costs, there are large debt redemptions that are scheduled from early 2013, including a &euro;5.6 billion bond repayment in April 2013 and a &euro;7.6 billion bond repayment in January 2014. The continuing budget deficits and debt redemptions must be adequately and prudently funded.</p><p>  The cash reserves held in the Exchequer come from a number of different sources such as tax revenue, non-tax revenue, and borrowings by the State from the market and under the EU/IMF Programme. As the Exchequer is an omnibus account, it is not possible to derive a single robust cost figure in relation to the balances maintained. A cost, for example, of not maintaining an adequate and prudent cash balance would include the risk that the Exchequer would be unable to meet its obligations and that market interest rates would possibly be higher than would otherwise be the case due to the perception that the State had a precarious liquidity position.</p><p>  Exchequer cash reserves are an important component in bolstering investor confidence in Ireland as it continues on the path to full independent market access at sustainable interest rates. The EU/IMF programme ends in 2013 making such market access of critical importance.</p></reply>

A higher imputed distribution rate of 6% applies from this tax year to ARFs and/or &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs with asset values of more than &euro;2 million. I assume the Deputy is suggesting an increase in the imputed distribution from 6% to 8% for ARFs and/or &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs of more than &euro;2 million in value and an increase from 5% to 7% where the asset values are greater than &euro;1 million and less than &euro;2 million.    I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that information provided to them in the context of the tax paid on these deemed or imputed distributions does not include information on the value of the ARFs and/or &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs out of which the distributions are deemed to arise. There is therefore no basis on which a definitive estimate of the impact on the Exchequer of the change mentioned in the question could be compiled.</p><p>  As an exercise that might provide some indication of the scale of the additional tax yield involved, data made available to my Department from private sector sources provides a breakdown of ARFs by value in respect of a number of providers representing an estimated 40% of the ARF market. There is no similar data available in relation to &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs.</p><p>  Out of a total value of some &euro;2.4 billion in ARFs under management by these providers where the average ARF value was just over &euro;127,000, the total value of those ARFs representing individual funds of over &euro;1m and under &euro;2 million was &euro;274 million. The total value of those ARFs representing individual funds of over &euro;2m was &euro;137 million. Based on a very rough extrapolation of these figures to arrive at a broad potential estimate for the total value of ARFs with assets in excess of &euro;1 million, the estimated additional tax yield from applying increased imputed distribution rates to such ARFs as set out above would be about &euro;8 million in a full year. </p><p>  It is important to note that the deemed or imputed distribution measure is designed to encourage draw downs from ARFs and &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs so that they are used, as intended, to fund a stream of income in retirement in the same way as a retirement annuity, for which ARFs are supposed to operate as a more flexible alternative. The measure, in itself, does not give rise to significant tax revenues as it does not apply to actual draw-downs from ARFs and &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs, which are taxed in the normal way. Moreover, increasing the annual percentage notional distribution for ARFs and &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs as suggested in the question would further increase the risk that the retirement income derived by the owners from such funds could be depleted before death.</p></reply>

Fiscal consolidation reduces the fiscal deficit and increases investor confidence which in turn lowers the cost of borrowing and helps to put public debt on a declining path.  Having said that I fully recognise that there will be a short term reduction in output before these medium term benefits are realised. So it is a difficult balancing act between the need for consolidation on the one hand and the need to support the emerging recovery on the other. There is, I think it is fair to say, an acknowledgement among many commentators that we in Government are getting this balance right.</p><p>  The recent IMF World Economic Outlook suggests that the average size of fiscal multipliers (the effect of consolidation on growth) across countries may have been underestimated in recent years. More recently, senior IMF staff tasked with monitoring developments in Ireland pointed to the multiplicity of factors at play in acting as a dampener on growth and acknowledged that there was no convincing evidence that the fiscal multiplier for Ireland was underestimated compared with that assumed under the programme. </p><p>  Ireland is a small, open economy with imports accounting for over three quarters of GDP. This means that a considerable amount of consolidation leaks out through reduced demand in countries we import from. We can already see this in the Balance of Payments figure, which shows the current account moving from a deficit of -5.7% of GDP in 2008 to a surplus of 1.1% in 2011.</p><p>  Fiscal multipliers vary according to the fiscal instruments used, and the impact on aggregate demand as a result of expenditure changes can differ from tax changes. I would reiterate the Government&rsquo;s cognisance of this and its commitment to implementing consolidation in as growth-friendly a manner as possible. </p><p>In order to correct our excessive deficit and minimise the cost to the taxpayer through sustaining investor confidence and keeping the cost of borrowing as low as possible, Ireland is committed to implementing further consolidation over the next three years. Evidence of the rewards associated with this approach is already visible through the lowering of bond yields since early summer and the successful return of the NTMA to the debt market.</p></reply>

Lump sum amounts up to &euro;200,000 are paid free of tax. They are also paid free of USC. The portion of a lump sum between &euro;200,001 and &euro;575,000 is taxed on a ring-fenced basis at 20%. This means that no tax credits or other tax reliefs can be set against this portion of the lump sum. No USC is chargeable. Any amount of a lump sum in excess of &euro;575,000 is taxed at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate of tax (credits and other tax reliefs are available). In this instance, USC is chargeable on the excess. These amounts are lifetime amounts with prior lump sums aggregating with later lump sums.    I assume from the Deputy&rsquo;s question that he is proposing that retirement lump sums in excess of &euro;100,000 be taxed as outlined above.

If it is assumed that these individuals would retire in line with retirement trends from the public service in a normal year (about 2.5%), then the additional tax yield from taxing lump sums in excess of &euro;100,000 at 20% could be about &euro;8 million in a full year.</p><p>  I have no data on which to provide a similar estimate in relation to the private sector.

The option of receiving benefits in the form of pension only is not available to members of public sector schemes. Depending on the impact of any tax charge on retirement lump sums, the option to commute part of a pension fund may no longer be exercised by private sector pension scheme members or may be exercised in a manner that reduces the value of the lump sum taken to minimise or avoid any immediate tax charge.</p></reply>

The annual earnings cap acts, in conjunction with age-related percentage limits of annual earnings, to put a ceiling on the annual amount of tax relief an individual taxpayer can obtain on pension contributions. A breakdown of the cost of tax relief on employee contributions to occupational pension schemes is not available by income tax rate, as tax returns by employers to the Revenue Commissioners of employee contributions to such schemes are aggregated at employer level. An historical breakdown is available by tax rate of the tax relief claimed on contributions to personal pension plans &mdash; Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) &mdash; by the self-employed and others, to the extent that the contributions have been included in the personal tax returns of those taxpayers. There is, therefore, only a limited statistical basis for providing definitive figures.   However, by making certain assumptions about the available information, the Revenue Commissioners inform me that the combined estimated full year yield to the Exchequer from reducing the current annual earnings cap of &euro;115,000 to &euro;60,000 in respect of individual contributions to occupational pension schemes, RACs and PRSAs would be about &euro;175 million.</p></reply>

That engagement is ongoing.</p><p>  Research carried out on behalf of these stakeholders leads them to suggest, in broad terms, that changes to the existing maximum allowable pension fund for tax purposes at retirement (the Standard Fund Threshold - SFT) affecting individuals on earnings of over &euro;125,000 per annum would deliver savings broadly equivalent to what would be achieved by reducing marginal rate tax relief on employee pension contributions to the standard rate while impacting on a much smaller number of taxpayers.</p><p>  I would point out that the scale of pension saving reliefs available to higher earners, in particular, has been significantly restricted over recent years. Aside from the reduction in the SFT from over &euro;5.4 million to &euro;2.3m in Budget and Finance Act 2011, the annual earnings cap which operates in conjunction with age-related percentage limits to determine the annual amount of tax-relievable contributions that can be made by an employee or individual to pension savings has been reduced from over &euro;275,000 in 2008 to its current level of &euro;115,000 per annum. This means that higher earners can only benefit from tax relief on their pension contributions on a percentage of their earnings (based on age) up to &euro;115,000 per annum which is already below the earnings level being targeted in the research referred to in the question. The report on the research is being examined.</p><p>  The debate around the incentive regime for pension saving has tended to focus either on a further reduction in the maximum allowable pension fund for tax purposes at retirement or on a reduction in the rate of tax relief on pension contributions. These approaches are not, of course, mutually exclusive.  In my 2012 Budget speech in December last, I said that I did not propose to make changes to the existing marginal rate relief at that time but that the incentive regime for supplementary pension provision will have to be reformed to make the system sustainable and more equitable over the long term. I said that my Department and the Revenue Commissioners would work with the various stakeholders in the next year to develop workable solutions. On foot of this, a broad informal consultation was undertaken this year across a spectrum of stakeholders in the pensions sector, in addition to the professional stakeholders mentioned earlier, to establish their views on further changes to the incentive regime for pension saving.</p><p>  I will give due consideration to the views of all interested parties  in the pensions sector in the context of any proposals I may make to Government regarding the incentive regime for pension saving.</p></reply>

Ireland has however used the option under paragraph (3) of that article, to apply two lower rates to cider below 8.5% vol and 6% vol. In addition, a further reduced rate of tax for low strength cider was introduced, with effect from 15 October 2008, for cider of a strength not exceeding 2.8% alcohol by volume, as provided for Under Article 5 of the Directive.  The Deputy refers to the UK in his question, the UK exemption is a historical one which was in operation prior to the implementation of the Directive in 1992. Under the current EU legislative framework, a reduced rate can only be applied on the basis of strength, and there is no provision for exemption based on size of operation.  The Deputy should note that a cider manufacturer's licence is also required for the production of cider on a commercial basis under the Finance (1909-1910) Act 1910.</p></reply>

In order to ensure that proposals in relation to such mortgages were consistent with the Central Bank&#8217;s consumer protection and prudential policy objectives, the proposed criteria for any such facility would need to be agreed in advance between mortgage lenders and the Central Bank. In response to the Central Bank&#8217;s letter, only a small number of mortgage lenders said that they would consider offering such a facility.   A trial period commenced in mid-2011 and was due to be assessed by the Central Bank and the institutions involved before the end of 2011. However the low level of activity made it difficult to conduct a meaningful review.</p><p>  The Central Bank also advised me that, following the issue of the report of the Inter-Departmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group in September 2011- which included a recommendation on trade down mortgages - several lenders contacted the Central Bank with regard to offering negative equity mortgages.  This included trade up, trade down and trade down where the customer was in arrears.</p><p>  In light of this and of the low level of take up in 2011, the Central Bank revised some of its criteria and communicated this revision to the main lenders.

The Agency advises that, in certain cases, it permits debtors to retain part of the income from their income-producing assets to pay overheads where necessary for the preservation and enhancement of the value of property securing its loans.  These costs may include an allowance for the remuneration of debtors and the staff employed by the debtor to manage the assets when the Agency decides that this offers the best and most cost effective option for the taxpayer.</p><p>  The Agency advises that the decision as to whether to work with a debtor, and whether to approve the retention of overheads to include an allowance for the remuneration of a debtor, is determined on an individual case basis by its assessment of how it can best optimise debt recovery.  A number of factors are taken into account in this regard, including a debtor&rsquo;s level of co-operation with the Agency and, where applicable, the voluntary reversal of asset transfers and pledging of unencumbered assets.   </p><p>  The Agency advises that it does not permit an allowance for the remuneration of a debtor in circumstances where that debtor&rsquo;s business plan is unacceptable or the debtor is not co-operating, including in circumstances where a debtor refuses to grant charges over unencumbered assets and/or to reverse asset transfers to relatives and others.  As previously advised, the Agency is also currently pursuing a number of cases in the Courts to effect the reversal of asset transfers by debtors that appear to have been designed to put the assets beyond its reach.</p><p>  The Agency similarly advises that, as the legal pursuit of personal guarantees generally occurs in the context of enforcement, the retention of overhead costs by a debtor does not arise.  As advised to the House recently, to date the Agency has secured charges over unencumbered assets controlled by its debtors with a total value of &euro;514 million. This amount includes arrangements with certain debtors that the transfer of assets to connected parties be reversed.</p></reply>

Rather, under Section 42 of the NAMA Act 2009, the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) assigns staff to the Agency.  As of end-October 2012, some 227 staff had been assigned by the NTMA to the Agency.  The Agency reimburses the NTMA the costs incurred in assigning these staff and in providing other business and support services.   The legislation which established the NTMA in 1990 deliberately positioned it outside of the wider public service structures with the operational freedom to negotiate market-competitive salaries to enable it to compete with the private sector to attract and retain staff with specialist and highly marketable skills.  Under this business model, there are no general pay grades and no pay scale and all staff are on individually negotiated contracts.</p><p>  Other than a small number of staff reassigned from other functions within the NTMA, Agency staff are employed by the NTMA on the basis of specified purpose contracts &ndash; their employment lasts for as long as their particularly skills and experience are required.  The total remuneration of NTMA staff assigned to the Agency, which is set out below in tabular format, reflects the fact that, given the nature of the Agency&rsquo;s activities, this staffing complement is primarily composed of experienced professional staff with substantial private-sector experience.  The total remuneration delineated below includes gross salary, employer pension contribution and, where applicable, other benefits.  Agency staff members are subject to the Public Service Pension Deduction.</p></reply>

As there is no single internationally agreed comparative measure in place, I am not in a position to provide the information on effective tax rates sought in either of the Deputy&#8217;s questions. </p><p>In answer to previous questions, I have acknowledged that one estimate of the effective rate of corporation tax in Ireland is 11.9%.  This figure came from a 2011 <i>Paying Taxes</i> study produced by the World Bank and PriceWaterhouseCoopers as part of an annual <i>Doing Business</i>   report and includes a measurement of effective tax rates across 183 countries.  This effective tax rate was calculated based on the tax obligations of a standardised company operating in each country of the study and using standard assumptions regarding exemptions, deductions and allowances.</p><p>Another recent study by the European Commission &#8211; <i>Taxation Trends in the EU 2011</i>   - also indicates that Ireland has an effective corporate tax rate which is close to, or indeed higher than, the statutory 12.5% rate (the rate identified is, in fact, higher than 12.5% perhaps because of the higher 25% tax rate that applies, generally, to non-trading profits).</p><p>  The above calculations are to give the Deputy examples of the differences that exist in comparative studies on effective tax rates, depending on how the rate is calculated or who carries out the calculation.  However, the fact that these effective tax rates are close to our headline rate is reflective of the strong transparency around Ireland&#8217;s 12.5% corporation tax regime.  Neither I, nor my Department, have considered the possibility of introducing a minimum effective tax rate for businesses.</p></reply>

The TCA requires a company&rsquo;s trading profits to be computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice subject to any adjustment required by law in computing such profits. Expenses that are incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the trade are deductible in computing trading profits, while allowances are available for capital expenditure on plant and machinery, industrial buildings and certain intangible assets used in the trade, with such allowances treated as a trading expense.

The use of enforcement equipment such as mobile X-ray scanners and other detection technologies is just one part of a multi-faceted strategy employed by Revenue to tackle smuggling. This strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of smuggling activity and developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis. It necessitates ongoing review of operational policies and optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and inland to intercept contraband product.   Revenue continually monitors ongoing developments in available X-ray and other technologies and the selection and deployment of detection equipment is constantly reviewed. Revenue has made use of the European Union&#8217;s Hercule II programme to part-fund the acquisition of detection equipment and will apply for further funding, where appropriate, in the future. The actual technology selected and the operational deployment of that technology are matters for the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>  Under the present rules of the Hercule II programme, Ireland would have to fund a minimum of 50% of the capital cost and 100% of the ongoing operational costs of a new container scanner. The capital cost of such a scanner would be of the order of &#8364;3 million and the running costs would be approximately &#8364;320,000 a year.</p><p>Revenue currently has two mobile X-ray container scanning systems, which are based at Dublin Port and Rosslare Ferry Port. However, both scanners are available for deployment at other ports<font color="#FF0000"> </font>  and at warehouses etc as required, and Revenue utilises them, on a risk assessment basis, at various locations throughout the country.  Revenue is satisfied that the container ports are adequately serviced by these scanners and has no plans at present to acquire any additional scanners of this kind.</p><p>  Revenue also uses smaller static baggage/parcel scanners at all major ports, airports and postal depots and are currently in the process of replacing units in Dublin Airport, Shannon Airport and Rosslare Ferry Port. In addition, it expects to take delivery shortly of a mobile x-ray van, which will enhance scanning capabilities at airports, ports and warehouses. The acquisition of this equipment is being supported by the Hercule II programme.</p></reply>

As further advised the Agency&rsquo;s analysis shows that 17% or 29 principals retain income of up to &euro;49,000; a further 43% or 73 principals retain income of between &euro;50,000 and &euro;99,000; 23% or 38 principals retain income of between &euro;100,000 and &euro;149,000; 15% or 25 principals retain income of between &euro;150,000 and &euro;190,000; and 2% or 3 principals retain income of &euro;200,000.  The Agency advises that, based on this breakdown, the total principal salaries retained from income producing assets in 2012 will be of the order of &euro;15.5 million.  The Agency advises that it takes a large number of factors into account before approving the overhead allocation for any debtor to operate its business.  These include the overall value of the assets, the debtor&rsquo;s level of co-operation, knowledge of the assets, experience and the Agency&rsquo;s view of the extent to which he can add value.</p></reply>

Most schemes would have a normal retirement age of 65. Revenue approval may also provide, however, for early retirement from age 50 where scheme rules allow and with the employer's consent. In such situations benefits are restricted.   In the case of personal pensions such as retirement annuity contracts (RACs) and  Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) benefits can be taken from age 60 with no retirement condition. Buy-out bonds, are Revenue approved policies or contracts of assurance  into which  occupational scheme benefits have been transferred and which can be availed of by members of occupational pension schemes leaving service or where schemes are winding-up. Benefits can be taken at the same time as were available under the original occupational scheme.   </p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in relation to all of these pension arrangements benefits can be taken at any stage where retirement is due to serious ill-health or incapacity. </p><p>  Where retirement benefits are taken in any of the circumstances outlined above, pension benefits drawn down by an individual (after taking any tax-free retirement lump sum that may be due) are subject to tax, generally at the individual's marginal rate of income tax.</p><p>  I have no plans to amend the above arrangements for accessing pension benefits. </p><p>  There are a number of reasons why, under existing policies, early withdrawals of pension savings are not permitted, the principal one being that pension schemes and plans (and the associated tax reliefs) are designed as long term savings vehicles to provide an income in retirement based on the principle that the savings will be &quot;locked away&quot; until that time. This, in effect, is the quid pro quo for the tax relief which is available to encourage long term saving for retirement.  </p><p>  There are also issues around pension funds investing in a beneficiary's own business. The first is the protection of pension benefits.  In other words it would not be possible to protect pension and death benefits if the pension funds were to be invested in a company or business resulting in the possibility that the pension scheme or plan might ultimately be unable to pay the pension benefits on the retirement of the beneficiary or beneficiaries.  Secondly, tax legislation in relation to pension saving arrangements seeks to ensure that the investment transactions of the pension arrangements are conducted on a commercial 'arm's length' basis.  It does this by effectively rendering transactions that are not arm's length tax inefficient by deeming the amount or value of the pension schemes assets used in such transactions to be a pension payment and, therefore, subject to income tax.</p></reply>

Where such opportunities exist, controlled foreign company legislation enables the home country, subject to various conditions, to treat the subsidiary's profits as accruing directly to the parent company as chargeable profits of the parent company.   Ireland does not exempt dividends, received by Irish parent companies from foreign subsidiaries, from corporation tax. While a common method of preventing double taxation, i.e. taxation in the source country and taxation in the receiving country, of dividends is for the receiving, or "residence", country to exempt the dividends concerned, Ireland relieves any double taxation, that would otherwise arise, by giving credit for the tax, if any, suffered in the source country against the Irish corporation tax on the dividends concerned. On that basis, where the dividends are received from a jurisdiction that has taxed neither the "underlying" profits nor the dividends used to repatriate them, those dividends will be fully chargeable to Irish corporation tax. There will not be the opportunity to accumulate tax-free profits in a foreign subsidiary and then to repatriate them as tax-free dividends, which controlled foreign company legislation seeks to address in other countries.</p><p>  The Deputy's question appears to refer to structures that have been outlined in recent media reports. Where companies in foreign countries own valuable assets, such as patented intellectual property, it is reasonable that there should be full remuneration for the licensing of those assets to Irish companies. It would be incorrect to assume that the foreign companies concerned are subsidiaries of the Irish licensee companies. In the structures described in media reports the Irish companies would appear to be the subsidiaries of the intangible asset-owning foreign companies concerned. While it is appropriate, in any event, that Irish companies should pay for the licensed use of assets owned by companies resident in other jurisdictions, it is not clear what relevance controlled foreign company legislation could have in such circumstances.</p></reply>

Ireland deposited its instrument of ratification of the ESM Treaty on 1st August 2012.   The ESM Treaty, at Article 48.1 provides that the ESM will enter into force when instruments of ratification, approval or acceptance have been deposited by signatories whose initial subscriptions represent no less than 90% of the total subscription.  The ESM Treaty accordingly entered into force on 27th September 2012 following its ratification by 16 of the 17 Euro area member states, representing over 99.8% of its subscribed capital base.  All 17 Euro Area Member States have now ratified the ESM Treaty. </p><p>  As you will be aware, the Euro Area Summit Statement of 29th June affirmed that it is imperative that the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns be broken.  The Statement of 29th June also stated that it has been agreed that when an effective single supervisory mechanism is established, involving the ECB, for banks in the euro area, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) could have the possibility to recapitalise banks directly. This would rely on appropriate conditionality, including compliance with state aid rules, which should be institution specific, sector-specific or economy-wide and would be formalised in a Memorandum of Understanding.  </p><p>  The European Commission stated on July 2nd 2012 that the ESM Treaty does not need to be changed in order to allow the direct recapitalization of banks.  They pointed out that Articles 14 - 18 of the Treaty set out the instruments that may be used to guarantee the Eurozone's financial stability, and that Article 19 provides that the Board of Governors may review that list of instruments and decide to make changes to it.</p><p>  The ESM Treaty, therefore, provides for a review by the Board of Governors of the financial instruments available to it, and to make changes to that list. The decision on any such change would be made by the Board of Governors acting by mutual agreement, in accordance with Article 5 of the ESM Treaty. </p><p>  Work is continuing at a technical level to put in place both the single supervisory mechanism, and the European Stability Mechanism's direct banking recapitalisation facility, at the earliest possible date. Ireland is participating constructively in these technical discussions. Any proposal to change the list of financial instruments provided in the ESM Treaty must be consistent with that Treaty.</p><p>  The most recent European Council on 18/19 October 2012 concluded that:</p><p>   &quot;The Eurogroup will draw up the exact operational criteria that will guide direct bank recapitalisations by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), in full respect of the 29 June 2012 euro area Summit statement. It is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns. When an effective single supervisory mechanism is established, involving the ECB, for banks in the euro area the ESM could, following a regular decision, have the possibility to recapitalize banks directly.&quot;</p><p>  It is important from Ireland's perspective, that progress towards these goals is made as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

Accordingly, it is considered that the appropriate forum for resolution of any dispute by a taxpayer regarding alleged negligence on the part of his or her accountant is either the accountant's relevant accountancy professional body or the Courts.    I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that taxpayers are the persons legally responsible for filing their tax returns and accounts. Taxpayers can either prepare their tax returns and accounts personally or they can engage the services of an accountant to do so. It is reasonable to expect that a taxpayer would take any necessary steps to ensure the reliability of the accountant selected for this purpose &ndash; including that the accountant would only submit material to Revenue with the client's agreement. </p><p>  Any taxpayer who submits incorrect accounts or information to the Revenue Commissioners, whether personally or through an accountant is, of course, obliged by law to correct the position, without delay. Errors corrected promptly may not have any impact on a taxpayer beyond possibly having to pay any additional tax liability due (but no more than would have been incurred if the correct accounts or information were submitted originally). However, if corrections are not made promptly an interest charge may be incurred and, depending on the nature of the incorrect accounts or information submitted, a penalty may also be incurred.  In this regard, I explained in my earlier reply that the Revenue Commissioners will consider all factors leading to any adverse tax consequence, but it is important to note that the Revenue Commissioners will not relieve a taxpayer of an adverse tax consequence solely on the grounds that an accountant was in some way responsible. </p><p>  I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners provide significant information in relation to the operation of the tax system and indeed the Revenue On-line System facilitates the calculation and filing of tax returns by taxpayers and their agents.</p></reply>

It was estimated at that time that this would be made up of &#8364;0.95 billion in new revenue measures introduced in 2013 and &#8364;0.3 billion in carry-over from the measures introduced in 2012. There were however minor revisions to this estimate in <i>Budget 2012</i>   where the carry-over effect into 2013 of the revenue measures introduced in 2012 was estimated at &#8364;220 million. This information is set out on page D.17 of Budget 2012. </p><p>The estimated full year yields and/or costs of the tax revenue measures introduced in <i>Budget 2012</i> are set out on pages B5 &#8211; B11 of the <i>Summary of 2012 Budget and Estimates Measures Policy Changes</i>   section of the Budget 2012 book. </p><p>  The difference between the estimated yield/cost of a measure in 2012 and in a full year is effectively the carry-over impact. </p><p>The biggest source of carry-over in 2013 is from the 2% standard increase in the VAT rate which it is estimated will yield an additional &#8364;110 million in 2013. The increase in carbon tax is expected to deliver an additional &#8364;29 million next year. The increase in the capital acquisitions tax (CAT) is also expected to deliver an additional &#8364;25 million in 2013 and the increase in DIRT an additional &#8364;15 million. These are the main sources of carry-over. For further details the Deputy should consult pages B5 &#8211; B11 of the <i>Summary of 2012 Budget and Estimates Measures Policy Changes</i>   section of the Budget 2012 book. </p><p>In the context of producing the <i>Budget 2013</i> tax revenue forecasts in the coming weeks, the Revenue Commissioners will advise my Department if the estimated full year costs and/or yields of the tax revenue measures introduced in <i>Budget 2012</i>   need to be revised further.</p></reply>

However, the Deputy will be aware of the high income individuals&#8217; restriction, which is already in place. The most recent report by the Revenue Commissioners on the restriction is in respect of the 2010 tax year. This report was published by my Department on 1 August 2012 and is available on the Department&#8217;s Tax Policy website <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i>  . The restriction, since 2010, applies to a greater number of individuals. The adjusted income threshold at which the restriction begins to apply is &#8364;125,000 and the relief threshold is &#8364;80,000 or 20% of adjusted income, whichever is higher. The objective of these changes was to achieve an average effective rate of income tax of 30 per cent where the restriction applies in full i.e. for those with adjusted incomes of &#8364;400,000 or greater. This effective rate does not include amounts payable in respect of PRSI and other levies and charges i.e. the Income Levy and Health Levy which applied in the tax year 2010 and the Universal Social Charge which applies from the tax year 2011.</p></reply>

The employer therefore, in accordance with PAYE Regulations, operates the emergency basis of tax deduction by deducting the appropriate amount of tax, PRSI, if applicable, and Universal Social Charge. The individual concerned subsequently submitted a tax return and a tax credit certificate based on this return will issue shortly.

The surcharge will apply at a rate of 5% on the amount of income sheltered by property reliefs in a given year and will be in addition to any normal USC payable on this income. This USC surcharge will apply to all investors with this level of gross income regardless of whether they invested in Section 23 type investments or accelerated capital allowance schemes.  </p><p>  In addition, investors in accelerated capital allowance schemes will no longer be able to use any capital allowances beyond the tax life of the particular scheme where that tax life ends after 1 January 2015. Where the tax life of a scheme has ended before 1 January 2015 no carry forward of allowances into 2015 will be allowed. The delayed implementation of this measure is designed to give individuals time to adjust to the absence of the carry forward provision.  </p><p>  There are now only two property based tax incentive schemes remaining in the tax code: the Mid-Shannon Corridor Tourism Infrastructure Investment scheme (only 80% of expenditure can qualify in certain areas) and the Qualifying Specialist Palliative Care Units scheme, which was not commenced.</p><p>  All other such schemes have been terminated, subject to transitional arrangements for certain schemes where projects were already in the pipeline. However, due to their nature these reliefs continue to entail ongoing costs on the Exchequer in terms of tax foregone.</p></reply>

This acronym focuses on four key areas, namely, Design, Awareness, Research and Technology.  The policy is informed by the building unit professional and technical staff, driven by its technical guidance documents and updated by continued energy research and development.</p><p>  It has been demonstrated that all schools designed and built in line with the above policy and the technical guidance documents can have an energy performance that is more than twice as efficient as international best practice.</p><p>  Under my Department's Summer Works Scheme, in excess of &euro;182m has been spent since 2009 on improvements to mechanical and electrical installations, toilets, windows and roofs in both primary and post-primary schools across the country, which is contributing to the energy efficiency of these buildings.  In addition, &euro;15 million has been spent under my Department's 2009 energy efficiency scheme and further &euro;7.4 million under the 2010 water conversation scheme.  In total in excess of &euro;204 million has been provided to school to assist with energy efficiency and conversion since 2009 which represents 16% of the total overall capital spend on school building since 2009.</p><p>  My Department, in conjunction with Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has developed an &quot;Energy in Education&quot; website (www.energyineducation.ie) which I launched recently.  The website is designed to help school boards of management, principals, teachers, administrators, care-taking staff, pupils and parents to improve energy use practices and to reduce school operating costs, along with helping to protect the environment for future generations.</p></reply>

Continuing students who are renewing their grant for attendance on an existing course with their existing awarding authority, which will be either a local authority or a VEC, will continue to have their applications processed and paid by the relevant grant awarding authority.

The data in the table has been provided to my Department by SUSI, the new centralised grant awarding authority.

Continuing students who are renewing their grant for attendance on an existing course with their existing awarding authority, which will be either a local authority or a VEC, will continue to have their applications processed by the relevant grant-awarding authority.<br />  A survey completed by the the grant awarding authorities in January each year provides details in relation to processing of grant applications.  The accompanying table provides details supplied to my Department by the grant awarding authorities as at week ending the third week of January for 2009, 2010 and 2011.  Further decisions in later months may have resulted in additional awards.<br />  In relation to the 2012/13 academic year SUSI has received just over 66,000 completed applications for student grants this year to date.  Approximately 18,000 applications are now complete and have either been provisionally awarded, awarded or refused.  This includes 9,000 applications which have been refused and 9,000 which have been awarded, or awarded pending submission of final course details by the student. <br /> The processing position for the 2012/13 academic year in relation to renewals as at 19 October 2012 is that the 66 grant-awarding authorities have dealt with 40,286 renewal applications.  A total of 31,049 applications have been awarded and 1,958 applications have been approved.  The data in relation to renewals has been compiled from information supplied to my Department by the 66 grant-awarding authorities<br /> The Deputy will appreciate that the data in relation to the 2012/13 academic year is not directly comparable as it does not cover the same time frame.  The statistics for the previous years are as of the third week in January and therefore include three additional months processing by the various awarding authorities.  In addition, the migration of the new applications to SUSI has enabled the 66 grant-awarding authorities to process renewal applications on a more efficient basis - these are generally more straightforward and require significantly less documentary evidence.</p><p><b>66 Grant Awarding Authorities &ndash; Processing Position as per January Survey</b></p><p><table><tr><th><b>2009/10 </b>Academic Year<br /><br />(Position as at 21/01/2010)</th><th>Total</th><th>Awarded</th><th>Refused</th></tr><tr><td>New applications </td><td>57,133<br /><br /></td><td>30,591<br /><br /></td><td>5,730<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>Renewals</td><td>36,391<br /><br /></td><td>30,969<br /><br /></td><td>882<br /><br /></td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th><b>2010/11</b> Academic Year<br /><br />(Position as at 21/01/2011)</th><th>Total</th><th>Awarded</th><th>Refused</th></tr><tr><td>New applications</td><td>62,040<br /><br /></td><td>31,239<br /><br /></td><td>8,065<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>Renewals</td><td>44,495<br /><br /></td><td>34,678<br /><br /></td><td>1,240<br /><br /></td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th><b>2011/12 </b>Academic Year<br /><br />(Position as at 21/01/2012)</th><th>Total</th><th>Awarded</th><th>Refused</th></tr><tr><td>New applications</td><td>66,479<br /><br /></td><td>32,152<br /><br /></td><td>6,932<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>Renewals</td><td>45,082<br /><br /></td><td>37,874<br /><br /></td><td>1,952<br /><br /></td></tr></table></p><p>Applications not decided as at third week in January each year would include applications where documentation was outstanding, incomplete applications, applications transferred to another assessing body and applications yet to be processed.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</p><p>  All schools were advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2012/13 school year by 16 March, 2012.   All schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy, have now been advised by the NCSE of their SNA staffing allocation for the current school year.  Details of the allocations which have been made to each school are available at www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  To date, the NCSE has allocated 10,311 WTE SNA posts to schools based on the number of valid applications received and the extent of the care needs of qualifying children.  The remaining 264 posts are available for allocation throughout the school year for new assessments of disability, new entrants, or emergency or late applications, in accordance with the terms of the SNA scheme.  The NCSE has estimated that based on the experience of last year, that these 264 posts should be sufficient to meet demand during the school year.</p><p>  Where schools have enrolled new pupils with special educational needs who were not considered at the time that the allocations for the 2012/13 school year were made, or where schools are in a position to demonstrate that they cannot cater for the care needs of qualifying children from the level of SNA support which has been assigned to them, they may apply to the NCSE for additional SNA support or for a review of their SNA allocation.</p><p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  The NCSE has advised my Department that it has not received an application from the school concerned for SNA support for the pupil in question.</p></reply>

The special rates vary, depending on the categorisation of the particular school or class.  Rates of up to &euro;879 per pupil are payable in comparison with the standard capitation rate of &euro;178 per pupil.  Additional capitation of &euro;7.5m was provided for pupils in special schools and special classes attached to mainstream schools in 2011.</p><p>  My Department's Circulars 40/2009 and 48/2009 clarify issues relating to the allocation of funding for schools.  Schools have flexibility and discretion on how to target funding to the school's own priorities, based on its knowledge and understanding of the needs of the students it serves.</p><p>  As the information requested by the Deputy relates to the introduction of the additional capitation funding many decades ago, it is not readily available and will involve retrieval and analysis of archived files, following which the information requested will be forwarded to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The programme for Government sets out that education will be a priority for this Government and that we will endeavour to protect and enhance the educational experience of children, young people and students.  The continued commitment of this Government to special education provision, at a time when savings are being required across a range of expenditure areas, has ensured that children with special educational needs can continue to have access to educational facilities in line with their requirements.</p><p>  Approximately 15% of the entire budget of my Department &ndash; some &euro;1.3 billion &ndash; was spent in support of children with special educational needs in 2011.  Provision for the current year is in line with expenditure for last year showing that, despite the current economic difficulties, the overall level of funding for special education has not been cut.   The equivalent spends for 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 are &euro;468m, &euro;605m, &euro;706m, &euro;838m, &euro;900m, &euro;1bn and &euro;1.2bn respectively.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that expenditure in relation to supports provided for children with special educational needs occurs across a number of separate divisional areas such as, for example, salary costs for additional teaching and Special Needs Assistant (SNA) supports, school building adaptations, assistive technology, transport arrangements and enhanced capitation payable.  From 2004 onwards, the particular spend on special education within the various categories has been differentiated and aggregated.  However, details of the disaggregated expenditure made for children with special educational within various categories of expenditure provision was not separately recorded prior to 2004 and is therefore not readily available.</p></reply>

This includes the allocation of resource teaching hours to schools as well as the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required and the discontinuation of such classes where the need no longer exists.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such supports.</p><p>  In respect of special classes, schools are required to observe Department policy in enrolling children to these classes.  This includes having a professional assessment confirming that the child's attainment levels meet the Department's criteria and a recommendation for special class placement.  Schools are eligible for resources for special classes when the pupils enrolled meet the Department's criteria and where there are enough eligible pupils to retain a class.</p><p>  Information going back to 1997, as requested by the Deputy, is not readily available.  However, I can advise the Deputy that the number of special classes rose from approximately 350 classes in 1998 to over 500 in 2010.  The number of special classes in mainstream schools from 2010 to present is 516 in the 2010/11 school year, 549 in the 2011/12 school year and 640 in the 2012/13 school year.</p></reply>

Applied Behavioural Analysis, or ABA, is one of the approaches used in special classes for children with autism.</p><p>  The use of ABA as part of the range of interventions is particularly useful for addressing behavioural issues.  My Department supports the use of ABA and training is provided for teachers in its use.  Therefore it is not researching its introduction.  However, the Department does not accept, based on research, advice and best practice, that ABA should be the only approach used.  While ABA helps to improve behaviour, other approaches, such as Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS) are just as important in developing children's communication and speech skills.  It is important that children have access to a range of approaches so that their broader needs can be met.</p><p>  The Deputy may be interested to note that teachers in special schools have been using ABA principles for more than 25 years.  ABA involves the systematic application, at any time during the child's day, of behavioural principles to modify behaviour.  The effectiveness of behavioural interventions to improve the performance of children with autism and to ameliorate behavioural difficulties has been recognized for decades.  My Department's child centred policy is based on advice received from international experts on autism, NEPS, the Inspectorate and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism.</p></reply>

The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for pre-school children with autism.</p><p>  As home tuition takes place outside the school environment my Department's preference is that the tuition provider be a qualified teacher who is registered with the Teaching Council. Where this is not possible approval may be given for a tutor with alternative qualifications to undertake the tuition and these details are available on my Department's website. In such scenarios approval for nominated tutors is made on a temporary basis pending a qualified teacher being sourced.</p><p>  The qualification standard required by the home tuition scheme reflects that required in a school environment. Class teachers in schools are required to be fully-qualified  with a qualification relevant to the sector in which they are teaching.  All primary teachers are qualified to teach in any primary or special school/classroom. All initial teacher education (ITE) programmes would have regard to inclusion in their content - it's a theme that is integrated throughout course programmes. However, the level of content would vary between different providers. There would also be options for students to pursue additional study in the area of special education on an elective basis.</p><p>  Recently, and for the first time, the Teaching Council's criteria for ITE providers stipulate mandatory elements of study, including special education. The learning outcomes of these ITE programmes also reflect the need for the teacher to be able to provide for the holistic development of students, to implement a range of teaching methodologies suitable to the students/class, to apply knowledge of the individual potential of students, their disposition towards learning and their backgrounds, identities and learning styles to their teaching, to evaluate learner progress, to act as an advocate for students, referring students for educational support and participating in the provision of that support, amongst other relevant outcomes.</p><p>  Separately teachers have access through the Special Education Support Service to continuing professional development in a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA), the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS).</p></reply>

The National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years) has been established since 2010.  It is supported by a National Coordinating Group which has representatives from the Department of Health and my Department in addition to other key stakeholders. The Programme is based on the recommendations of the Report of the National Reference Group on Multidisciplinary Services for Children aged 5-18 Years produced by representatives of the professions and management involved in delivering multi-disciplinary services to children which is available on the HSE website www.hse.ie.</p><p>  The long term goal of this Programme is to bring consistency in service delivery and a clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need. Implementation of this Programme will have a positive impact on the provision of clinical services for all children requiring access to health related supports, regardless of where they live or which pre-school or school they attend.</p><p>  While the Programme supports the principle of providing access to mainstream education where appropriate, it also recognises a continuing role for special schools.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</p><p>  All schools were advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2012/13 school year by 16th March, 2012.  All schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy, have now been advised by the NCSE of their SNA staffing allocation for the current school year. Details of the allocations which have been made to each school are available at www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  The NCSE allocates a level of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school. SNAs should then be deployed by schools in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.  Where schools have enrolled new pupils with special educational needs who were not considered at the time that the allocations for the 2012/13 school year were made, or where schools are in a position to demonstrate that they cannot cater for the care needs of qualifying children from the level of SNA support which has been assigned to them, they may apply to the NCSE for additional SNA support or for a review of their SNA allocation.</p><p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

Continuing students who are renewing their grant for attendance on an existing course with their existing awarding authority, which will be either a local authority or a VEC, will continue to have their applications processed and paid by the relevant grant awarding authority.</p><p>  In total, SUSI has received just over 66,000 completed application for student grants this year. Some 18,000 applications are now complete. This includes some 9,000 applications which have been refused and some 9,000 which have been awarded, or awarded pending submission of final course details by the student. SUSI is awaiting documentation on some 21,000 applications.  Some 15,000 students have not responded at all to requests for documentation and a further some 6,000 have submitted incomplete documentation. The remaining some 27,000 are applications on hand with SUSI for processing. Of the remaining applications on hand with SUSI, the majority of these some 15,000 are being checked to ensure that all documentation has been submitted, however, based on the material received by SUSI to date they expect that 40% will be returned incomplete.  Of the remainder some 6,000 are awaiting final assessment, some 600  have appealed the decision previously made on their applications and some 5,000 are new applications submitted after the closing date.  This data has been supplied to my Department by SUSI.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the average waiting time for the processing of grant applications is dependent on a number of variables including the volume of applications received, staffing resources, whether or not completed application forms have been received and how quickly complete further documentation requested is returned.</p><p>  A survey completed by the the grant awarding authorities in January each year provides details in relation to processing of grant applications as the third week in January. The processing position as at the 21 January 2012 in relation to new applications was that a total of 66,479 applications were received.  Some 32,152 new applications were awarded and some 6,932 applications were refused.  The Deputy will appreciate that the data supplied by SUSI in relation to new applications in the 2012/13 academic year is not directly comparable as it does not cover the same timeframe. The statistics for the previous year is as at 21 Janurary 2012 and therefore includes 3 additional months processing by the various awarding authorities.  Measures introduced to increase the number of applications being processed and paid include the following.</p><p>  Staffing levels in SUSI have been substantially increased in recent weeks, with an additional 20 staff members processing the documjentation received from students, and extra staff have also been assigned to SUSI head office to work on continually improving the processes and speeding up processing times.  SUSI has engaged with USI in relation to communicating to students the need to send in all documentation required to complete their application.  A moderator is now in place on www.boards.ie to address issues raised by applicants through this forum.  SUSI have commenced three additional waves of SMS and e-mail communications to encourage students who are awaiting responses from SUSI to get in contact quickly and with the correct documentation.  SUSI have also put in place an additional call out service to students requesting them to submit their final course acceptance form.  SUSI has also posted the top ten reasons on why students' documentation packs are incomplete on the www.cdvec.ie and the www.susi.ie websites.</p><p>  In addition my Department has requested that the Higher Education Authority once again request institutions to show flexibility and consideration, as most have done in the past, to students who may be awaiting a decision on their grant application or payment of grants.  The Higher Education Authority has also requested institutions to consider not withdrawing facilities such as library or exam access, given that those students are awaiting decisions on their grant applications.</p><p>  In relation to information been provided to students by the SUSI helpdesk the deputy will appreciate that the SUSI helpdesk have received some 174,977 calls and some 30,746 e-mail queries to the SUSI helpdesk since it went live on the 13th February 2012.  SUSI is seeking to constantly improve the information available both online and from its helpdesk email and telephone services.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</p><p>  All schools were advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2012/13 school year by 16th March, 2012.  All schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy, have now been advised by the NCSE of their SNA staffing allocation for the current school year. Details of the allocations which have been made to each school are available at www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  The NCSE allocates a level of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school. SNAs should then be deployed by schools in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p><p>  Where schools have enrolled new pupils with special educational needs who were not considered at the time that the allocations for the 2012/13 school year were made, or where schools are in a position to demonstrate that they cannot cater for the care needs of qualifying children from the level of SNA support which has been assigned to them, they may apply to the NCSE for additional SNA support or for a review of their SNA allocation.</p><p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has recently notified Departments and public bodies of the mandatory requirement to use central contracts, put in place by the National Procurement Service (NPS), when procuring a range of commonly acquired goods and services. These national contracts are targeted at securing best value for money and facilitating Departments and agencies to deliver services within their budgetary constraints. Within the Education Sector, the mandatory arrangement relating to stationery currently applies to the Higher Education and VEC Sectors.</p><p>  The NPS is supporting Small and Medium Business Enterprises (SMEs) through its education and guidance strategies and many Irish SMEs have been successful in winning NPS frameworks in areas such as stationery, managed print services and ICT consumables.  These SMEs may, in turn, source many of their services and products from local manufacturers and agents.</p><p>  While I appreciate the Deputy's concerns, given the budgetary pressures under which we all now operate, savings on the procurement of goods and services across the public sector can go someway to ensure that the level of service provided to the community is greater than what it might otherwise be.</p></reply>

The principal considerations underpinning this policy are the needs of the child and how to meet those needs with the minimum of segregation and maximum participation with peers, that is, in the least restrictive environment.</p><p>  The practice and policy is to provide schools for children. It is not to provide schools for particular approaches, into which children will be fitted. Rather it is to identify children's needs and meet those needs in the existing school setting that is appropriate for meeting them. In the case of children with autism, this will be in the least restrictive environment, with trained teachers who have access to additional professional support, additional training in teaching children with special educational needs and in autism studies, and training in the principal approaches that are used in working with children with a diagnosis of autism.</p><p>  The position is that each child's identified needs should determine the teaching approach and methodology that is to be used. As children differ significantly from one another and as children's needs vary and change over time, it is not possible to impose a method or approach that will work for all children with autism. The research evidence is clear that no matter what exclusive approach is followed, its success is limited. No one approach has a monopoly on success. Different approaches have been applied successfully with different children, and each approach has been shown to have limitations. This is why my Department does not establish schools to follow a particular approach including, Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA).</p><p>  The policy is based on advice received from national and international experts on autism as well as the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) as well as my Department's Inspectorate. My Department has considered published research, including the Report of the Task Force on Autism (2001) and the Evaluation of Educational Provision for Children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (2006), both of which are available on my Department's website. The report of the Taskforce includes a comprehensive list of contributions. My Department was also mindful of contributions of many others experts at international conferences/visits.</p><p>  My Department's position is reflective that there is no universal agreement that conclusive research exists to support the exclusive usage of ABA or indeed, the exclusive use of any other approach, as a basis for national educational provision for children with autism. It is for this reason that my Department's preferred policy is for a child centred, rather than a method-centred, approach where the approach to be taken is based on the individual child's needs.  The person referred to by the Deputy submitted, on request, a number of contributions to my Department.</p></reply>

Principals and teachers will receive comprehensive professional development in educational assessment, including processes of moderation, and providing feedback to students. Assessment arrangements in schools will be subject to internal moderation to ensure that proper procedures are  followed in all cases. Principals will have to formally confirm that moderation procedures were followed.  Final assessment at the end of the three years is just one element of a broader school based approach to assessment.</p><p>  The NCCA is developing an assessment and moderation toolkit which will provide teachers with assessment materials for classroom use, and will support the design of class and school assessment. It will also offer guidelines on in-school moderation, and show how professional dialogue between teachers in a school (and, where a teacher is the only teacher of a subject, between schools) can ensure that there is a shared and common understanding of the standards of work expected.  The new forms of assessment will be phased in over eight years to give schools, students and parents the opportunity to gain confidence in and have an understanding of the new assessment system.</p><p>  The results awarded on every School Certificate will be sent to my Department. My Department will monitor the national and school patterns along with the results in the standardised testing of reading, Mathematics and Science. This monitoring will provide further quality assurance and identify any local or national anomalies. A report on overall trends will be published regularly. I am confident that these arrangements are robust for all contexts, including where teachers may be assessing their own children, given the low stakes nature of the assessment envisaged in the new Framework for Junior Cycle.</p></reply>

Under the teacher allocation reforms the combined resources available for GAM (General Allocation Model) and language support (circa 4,100 posts) were used to create a single simplified allocation process to cover both the GAM and language support. Schools have autonomy on how to deploy the resource between language support and learning support depending on their specific needs. The new GAM arrangements also provided for additional permanent teaching posts (circa 370) to be given to schools with high concentration of pupils that require language support. Further additional temporary EAL support are also provided, as necessary, to schools that have high concentrations of pupils (at least 20% of total enrolment) that require language support in the 2012/13 school. These allocations are made on the basis of appeals by any of these schools to the Staffing Appeals Board.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</p><p>  There are 10,575 Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) SNA posts available for allocation in the 2012/13 school year, which is the same number of posts which were available for allocation for the 2011/12 school year. The NCSE initially allocated 10,311 WTE SNA posts to schools based on the number of valid applications received to date and the extent of the care needs of qualifying children. The remaining 264 posts are available for allocation throughout the school year for new assessments of disability, new entrants, or emergency or late applications, in accordance with the terms of the SNA scheme. The NCSE have estimated that based on the experience of last year, that these 264 posts should be sufficient to meet demand during the school year.</p><p>  Every child who has met the criteria for access to Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support in the current school year to date is in receipt of support. In respect of new applications, the NCSE has capacity to allocate additional SNA posts throughout the school year, and will do so where valid applications are received. Where schools have enrolled new pupils with special educational needs who were not considered at the time that the initial allocations for the 2012/13 school year were made, or where schools are in a position to demonstrate that they cannot cater for the care needs of qualifying children from the level of SNA support which has been assigned to them, they may apply to the NCSE for additional SNA support or for a review of their SNA allocation.</p><p>  Finally, I wish to confirm for the Deputy that this Government remains committed to protecting services for children with special educational needs. The number of SNA posts available for allocation to schools for the 2012/13 school year has been maintained, at a time when there has been a requirement to make savings across a range of expenditure areas.</p></reply>

The estimated cost of these posts is in the order of &euro;100m. This Government recognises the importance of ensuring that students from a Protestant or reformed church background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos while at the same time ensuring that funding arrangements are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.</p><p>  With regard to the fee-charging Protestant schools, an arrangement exists whereby funding is provided by my Department to the Secondary Education Committee (SEC), an organisation run by the churches involved in managing the Protestant secondary schools. The SEC then disburses funds to the Protestant fee-charging schools on behalf of pupils who would otherwise have difficulty with the cost of fees and who, in the absence of such financial support, would be unable to attend a second level school of a reformed church or Protestant ethos. Funding amounts to &euro;6.5 million annually. This fund ensures that necessitous Protestant children can attend a school of their choice.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I announced a review last December, in the context of the Budget 2012, where I made a further one point change to the staffing allocation of fee charging schools. I indicated at the time that that the purpose of the review would be to inform future policy in relation to exchequer support for these schools.   The review will be included in the material used to inform Government deliberations on the next budget.</p><p>  I would like to make it clear that there has been no decision relating to fee paying schools and any budget adjustments for this year. Given the extremely difficult economic circumstances that this country is facing and the fact that every Department has to find considerable cost-savings, all expenditure must be examined to see if cost-savings can be found.  I wish to reiterate that no decisions in relation to the upcoming Budget have been made.</p></reply>

As of September 2012 all five strands of Project Maths were rolled out to all mainstream schools.  Information on the timing and phasing has been widely disseminated.</p><p>  The purpose of the initial engagement with 24 schools and the adoption of a phasing in approach was to learn from the experiences in these project schools while using this period to work with the schools to develop materials and lesson plans and resource materials, which would then be available for mainstreaming to all schools. This phase of development has therefore been evolutionary in nature, with syllabuses and resources being developed and refined during the project phase. There has been ongoing professional development made available to schools by the Project Maths Development Team.  As well as CPD, there are significant resources available on www.projectmaths.ie which provide clarity on what is expected from teachers and students.</p></reply>

However,  it is an accepted tenet that care and education are inextricably linked elements in a child's holistic development and younger children who attend early years services are also availing of a programme which must comply with Regulation 5 of the 2006 Child Care (Preschool Services) (No 2) Regulations 2006.</p><p> Regulation 5 covers the Health, Welfare and Development of the child and states that ' A person carrying on a preschool service shall ensure that each child's learning, development and well-being is facilitated within the daily life of the service through the provision of the appropriate opportunities, experiences, activities, interaction, materials and equipment, having regard to the age and stage of development of the child and the child's cultural context.'

As far as I am aware, no such scheme has ever been proposed by the European Commission for the consideration of member states.  However the European Commission provide a very comprehensive website called Study in Europe which provides up to date information on higher education institutions in 32 European countries, details of courses and programmes which are available and the criteria for entry to them.  The website should be of use to any student considering studying abroad and is at the following link: http://ec.europa.eu/education/study-in-europe/</p><p> At a global level, UNESCO produces an international guide to studying abroad. It includes a searchable on-line database of higher-education study opportunities and the scholarships offered by higher education institutions and international organisations in over 151 countries. It also has contact details and information on admission requirements, application deadlines, financial aid, fees, living expenses and other relevant information for all courses. Information on eligibility for student grants for Irish citizens who wish to pursue their education in the EU is available on www.studentfinance.ie.  </p></reply>

Teachers with a Montessori qualification are registered under Regulation 3 (Montessori and Other Qualifications) and are taken as analogous to 'Restricted Recognition' as set out in Circular 25/00 &ndash; Recognition of Teacher Qualifications for the Purpose of Teaching in National Schools. There are differences between Montessori teaching and Primary Teaching across the entire content and teaching methodology of the primary school curriculum. Teachers with a Montessori qualification are at present given restricted recognition to teach in special schools and in the categories of special classes in mainstream national schools where Irish is not a curricular requirement and in resource posts for pupils with special needs in mainstream schools.</p><p>  To change the situation such teachers would need to undertake further studies, suitable for qualification as a primary teacher. The Teaching Council has statutory responsibility for professional accreditation of initial teacher education programmes.  It is open to any teacher education provider to submit proposals to the Teaching Council for the accreditation of courses leading to qualification as a primary teacher.  My officials have discussed this issue with the Teaching Council and will engage with the initial teacher educators in the near future.</p></reply>

The Grangegorman Development Agency (GDA) prepared a master plan for the site which formed the basis for securing Strategic Development Zoning (SDZ) awarded by Dublin City Council in July 2011.  The SDZ was appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la but was given approval in May 2012.  Following the announcement of the stimulus package for the country in July 2012, some &euro;180 million of the Government's estimated &euro;2.25 billion stimulus package announced will go towards the Grangegorman project.  DIT is currently located in 39 sites across the capital, some of which are in poor condition.  The plan for Grangegorman is to combine these sites into one single educational facility.  The GDA is progressing the renovation of several historic buildings and the construction of a new science research institute. It is proposed that this will result in an initial 1,050 students on the Grangegorman site by 2014.  In parallel with this, the agency is advancing two quadrangles as Public Private Partnerships which will facilitate the relocation of an additional 10,000 students currently in various locations around the city.  This will bring over 50% of DIT to Grangegorman by 2017.  This initial investment including the first phase of the PPP investment is expected to give rise to a sizeable presence of students at Grangegorman.  The College of Art and Tourism, the College of Sciences and Health and the College of Engineering and Built Environment (part) are expected to be relocated to the campus.</p></reply>

There are over 500 bodies, including some voluntary bodies, under the Act.  It is anticipated that in excess of 100 additional public sector bodies will be brought within remit as a result of my legislative proposals.  Subject to specific conditions, this will include, for example, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, public financial bodies (NTMA, NAMA, NPRF, and the NDFA), the Central Bank of Ireland, public bodies with important regulatory, quasi-judicial and investigative functions (to include the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Applications Tribunal) and Vocational Educational Committees.  The number of bodies will be further increased when I bring non-public bodies benefiting from significant State funding within remit on a case-by-case basis under criteria balancing the public interest with appropriate proportionality.  I submitted the detailed General Scheme of a Freedom of Information Reform Bill to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform in August for its views and recommendations.  I expect to be in a position to publish the Freedom of Information Bill following careful consideration of the views to be furnished by the Joint Committee on the legislative proposals and the drafting of the Bill by the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel in due course.</p></reply>

The level of spectrum fees that will be generated by the Multi-Band Spectrum Award process will be determined by the eventual level of demand expressed in the auction.  I am advised that section 2.2.5 of the ComReg&rsquo;s Information Memorandum (Document 12/52) provides, among other things, for the following reserve prices for spectrum lots being made available in the auction: &euro;10.81 million for each lot in the 800 MHz and 900 MHz bands across both &ldquo;time slices&rdquo; (noting that 13 such lots are being made available); and &euro;5.4 million for each lot in the 1800 MHz band across both time slices (noting that 15 such lots are being made available).  The process of awarding of spectrum rights is entirely a matter for ComReg.  In light of this and the extremely commercially sensitive nature of the process, I cannot comment further on the process which  is ongoing at this time.  Fees which are received by ComReg for spectrum access are transferred directly to the Exchequer in accordance with provisions of Section 30 of the Communications Regulation Act 2002, as amended.  Proceeds from the sale will be taken into the Central Fund and used to fund Exchequer-financed expenditure.</p></reply>

This includes 1.4 billion euro to fund the proposed new Public Private Partnerships (PPP) programme.  The list of projects selected for Phase 1 of this programme was published when the announcement was made and is available on my Department&#8217;s website <font color="#0000FF">www.per.gov.ie</font> and on the PPP website <font color="#0000FF">www.ppp.gov.ie</font>.</p><p>  This investment is directed towards projects that meet key infrastructural needs and are in line with the priorities in the Government's Investment Framework. These projects will form the first phase of a new programme of PPP&#8217;s designed to stimulate economic growth and create employment.  Ownership of the individual projects remains with the Sponsoring Department for each project.  My Department chairs a PPP Steering Committee and is closely engaged with the relevant line Departments and their agencies, who are represented on the Committee, to ensure that projects are progressed promptly.

Current Government policy is to issue employment permits for the employment of non-EEA nationals for specific vacancies and in response to employer demand for strategic skills and labour shortages in designated occupations in key economic sectors such as healthcare, information technology and financial services.</p><p>  Ireland has to compete with other countries for migrant labour, particularly in respect of high-level skills.  Skills required in the high-tech sectors are in demand and in short supply globally.  While increasing the supply of high-level skills from domestic sources is the most sustainable way forward in the long term, in the short term, there continues to be a need to supplement Ireland&rsquo;s skills stock through employment permits and to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s employment permits system is geared towards attracting such skills.</p><p>  The Department of Justice and Equality is responsible for the implementation of policy in relation to the admission of non-EEA nationals to the State and their residence in the State.  However, the employment permit regime provides for control of Ireland&rsquo;s labour market as well as powers for enforcement of employment rights.  Deputies will be only too aware that economic migrants are a vulnerable class of people.  Therefore, any actions affecting inward economic migration should be cognisant of the need to ensure that such migrants are protected and made aware of their employment rights.</p><p>  The Employment Permits regime is supporting the enterprise sector and significant levels of applications are successful particularly those based on high skills levels. Figures indicate: A reduction in total applications in line with economic circumstances, but an increase in Green Card applications, in line with a greater emphasis on high value skills; An increase in the proportion of applications in respect of ICT job roles with applications in respect of ICT job roles being more successful than the norm.  Over 90% of ICT related applications are successful and over 1,000 ICT related applications have been approved so far this year.</p><p>  My Department has reviewed its processes with a view to attracting more ICT related applications and is confident that significant improvements can be made shortly which will greatly enhance the employment permits regime, for example: In conjunction with Forf&aacute;s, a review is underway of the Green Card Employment Permit Scheme which is used by Ireland to meet labour market requirements where skills shortages have been identified by reference to analyses undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs.  An interim review of the four core employment permit types - Green Cards, Intra-Company Transfers, Work Permits and Spousal/Dependents - is being conducted with a view to improving the throughput and quality of employment permit applications.  Such an initiative would favour the ICT sector in particular as it would include a streamlining of the documentary process, a reduction in the time it takes for applicants to prepare a successful application, and a significant reduction in processing times.  Closer interactions are being cultivated with the Department of Justice and Equality with a view to providing a more coherent service across the employment permit regime and visa regime including policy convergence, greater information sharing and unified communications from both Departments in respect of labour market access.</p><p>  I intend to announce a range of improvements in this regard shortly.  It is also the Government&rsquo;s ambition that Ireland should take advantage of the opportunities for employment in the ICT sector and that every opportunity is afforded to our graduates and unemployed to prepare them with the skills required to work in that sector. Employment Permits are but one way of increasing the level of ICT skills available in the labour market.  Building Ireland&rsquo;s ICT skills capability will require improving the domestic output of skilled ICT graduates and my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills has already put in place plans to establish an overarching target of doubling the annual output from honours degree ICT undergraduate programmes to 2,000 graduates by 2018.  These plans involve actions to: increase the domestic supply of honours degree graduates in the short term through expansion of conversion; and boost the longer term supply and quality of graduates from the higher education system.</p><p>  Finally, work is also proceeding with regard to the preparation of new employment permits legislation which will provide for more flexibility and targeted instruments in support of the economy&rsquo;s evolving skills needs.  Heads of Bill were approved by Government last April and since then, my Department has been engaged with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel (OPC) in order to progress the drafting of the Bill.  My Department is currently considering a second draft and expects to revert to the OPC shortly with a view to finalising the draft as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The number of new jobs created in IDA client companies in each of the years 2002 to 2011 is set out in the tabular statement.  Figures for 2012 will not be available until the end of the year.  Details of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s job and investment announcements from 2008 onwards are available on the Agency&rsquo;s website &ndash; <i>www.idaireland.ie</i>.  Details of announcements in the period 2002 to 2007 are set out on the attached tabular statement.  It must be remembered, however, that not all investment and job creation projects are announced.</p><p>Information relating to grants approvals for IDA client companies is confidential between the Agency and the client company.  In all instances where financial assistance is approved by IDA for a company, the agency and the client enter into a legal and binding contract.  The contract, which is confidential between IDA Ireland and the company, includes conditions and milestones with which the company is required to comply before any financial assistance is paid.  IDA Ireland pays grants pro rata with achieved performance so, in order to draw down grants, a company must meet the agreed performance targets as set out in the contract.</p><p>I understand from IDA Ireland that there is normally a time lag of between 2 to 3 years between a grant approval and actual payment of the first instalment of that grant.  In addition, grants are usually paid over a number of years when various criteria have been met by the client company.  Accordingly, it is not possible to provide accurate data relating to grants awarded in a particular year but not drawn down in that year.</p><p>Grant payments are refunded to IDA Ireland when a company fails to meet the conditions outlined in the grant agreement or in instances where companies have closed.  The total amount of grants refunded annually is contained in the financial statements to the Agency&rsquo;s Annual Report and Accounts, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  IDA&rsquo;s Annual Reports for each of the years 2007 to 2011 are available on the Agency&rsquo;s website <i>www.idairelad.com</i>.</p><p><b>Table showing Number of Jobs created in IDA Supported Companies in each of the years 2002 to 2011 inclusive </b></p><p><table><tr><th><div><b>Year</b></div></th><th><b>Number of new jobs created</b></th></tr><tr><td><div><b>2002</b></div></td><td><div><b>11,407</b></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><b>2003</b></div></td><td><div><b>9,357</b></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><b>2004</b></div></td><td><div><b>10,846</b></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><b>2005</b></div></td><td><div><b>12,176</b></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><b>2006</b></div></td><td><div><b>12,531</b></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><b>2007</b></div></td><td><div><b>10,401</b></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><b>2008</b></div></td><td><div><b>9,203</b></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><b>2009</b></div></td><td><div><b>5,239</b></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><b>2010</b></div></td><td><div><b>9,075</b></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><b>2011</b></div></td><td><div><b>11,594</b></div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

There is intense and continual international competition to win foreign direct investment, which is mainly dominated by Metro City Regions with populations in excess of 1 million.  Ireland has one Metro Region, the Greater Dublin area.</p><p>  In order to achieve balanced regional development IDA Ireland focuses on marketing Gateway locations within each Region as the areas of critical mass and highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.</p><p>  South Tipperary forms part of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s South Economic Region along with the counties of Cork, Waterford, Kerry, Wexford, Carlow and Kilkenny.  The locations of emphasis for IDA in this Region are the Gateways of Cork and Waterford and these are actively promoted to potential investors through IDA&rsquo;s network of overseas offices.  In addition, the other counties referred to, including South Tipperary, are promoted as part of the Agency&rsquo;s marketing efforts and in response to specific client requirements.  At present there are 9 IDA Ireland supported companies in South Tipperary employing approximately 3,400 people, while in the South Economic Region there are 207 client companies employing over 38,000 people.  I have been informed by IDA that, since the beginning of 2011, there have been a total of 74 sponsored visits by potential investors to this Region.  IDA Ireland has drawn my attention to the fact that, while it seeks to influence location, in the final analysis it is the investor who decides where to visit and where to locate. </p></reply>

Ireland does not ratify international Conventions until any such necessary amendments to domestic legislation have been identified and effected.</p><p>  A preliminary assessment of the implications of ratifying the International Labour Organisation&rsquo;s Convention 189 on Domestic Workers is currently being finalised by my Department.  The Assessment includes an Article-by-Article examination of the extent to which Domestic legislation provisions already provide for the Rights and Entitlements enunciated in each Article, as well as the extent to which any legislative amendments will be required.  This assessment will then be forwarded to the Office of the Attorney General for their examination.</p><p>  It is important, however, to note that domestic workers are protected by virtue of the fact that the full suite of employment rights legislation, including that of redress for violations of their employment rights, apply to domestic workers in the same way as they apply to other categories of employees in Ireland.  Also it is worth pointing out that NERA has carried out a programme of inspections involving Domestic Workers as well as continuing to respond to any complaints it receives from Domestic Workers.</p><p>  A voluntary Code of Practice for Persons Employed in Other People&rsquo;s Homes was developed under the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  The Code sets out certain employment rights and practices for persons employed in other people&rsquo;s homes and encourages good practice and compliance with the law in such employment situations.  In any proceedings before a court, or a workplace relations dispute resolution body, a code of practice shall be admissible in evidence and any provision of the code which appears to the court, body or officer concerned to be relevant to any question arising in the proceedings shall be taken into account in determining that question.</p></reply>

The Fund has a significant entrepreneurship focus.  It will add value to other Government schemes of support for entrepreneurs and unemployed persons, such as the Back to Work Allowance, the range of training programmes and the Seed Capital Scheme.</p><p>  The Fund will provide support in the form of loans of up to &#8364;25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people, with viable business propositions, that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks.  Microfinance Ireland (MFI), the company set up to operate the Fund, will work closely with the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) / Local Enterprise Offices which provide assistance with training and preparing business plans for entrepreneurs.  They will carry out an initial evaluation of the quality of business proposals/loan applications from entrepreneurs before sending same on to MFI for decision.  The addition of microfinance will now enable the CEBs to deliver a wider suite of services to all entrepreneurs, namely grants, mentoring, soft supports and access to loan finance.</p><p>  MFI and the CEBs are very conscious of the particular difficulties the youth sector faces with regard to credit history, previous business experience etc. and where they can assist young entrepreneurs, they will. However, the potential viability of the business proposal is the dominant factor in any credit decision made by Microfinance Ireland.</p><p>  In addition to MFI and the CEBs, other sources of funding are available for example, the Seed Capital Scheme, business angels, E.I.I.S etc.  While access to start-up finance through the various channels outlined is important to support youth entrepreneurship, other policy actions are equally important such as fostering entrepreneurship in students while at school or in third level education.  Over 20,000 students now participate annually in the various CEB&#8211;supported programmes implemented in the education sector. (see answer to PQ 47725).</p><p>  Microfinance Ireland has sought European Investment Fund (EIF) accreditation under the European Progress Microfinance Facility to avail of the EIF loan book guarantee which is anticipated to cover approximately 25% of bad debts incurred.  A decision is expected from the EIF in November 2012.</p><p>  The Government continues to monitor the requirements of all business sectors regarding access to finance and in that context will continue to assess the needs of youth entrepreneurs in the light of the operation of the Microfinance Loan Fund and the availability of support from sources such as the EU, EIB and IMF.  If there is a clearly identified need for a further targeted initiative to address market failure in this sector the matter will be addressed by relevant Departments.  A guide entitled &#8220;Financial Support for Irish Business&#8221; has been published on my Department&#8217;s website at    under &#8220;latest publications&#8221;.</p></reply>

The CEBs provide both financial and/or non-financial assistance to microenterprises in the start-up and expansion stages.  Encouraging and promoting a youth enterprise culture is an important area of activity for the CEBs.  Through various programmes and initiatives, the CEBs seek to influence student attitudes in favour of enterprise.  Examples of initiatives provided by the CEBs at both primary and secondary level include the annual Student Enterprise Awards, as well local or inter-County initiatives such as Exploring Enterprise, Celtic Enterprise and B&iacute; Gn&oacute;thach Enterprise.  Over 20,000 students now participate annually in the various CEB&#8211;supported programmes implemented in the education sector. Contact details for the CEBs can be found on </p><p>  The &#8216;<i>Think outside the Box&#8217;</i> competition, co-sponsored by Enterprise Ireland, Invest Northern Ireland, Cruickshank Intellectual Property Attorneys, Mammoth Advertising, Grant Thornton and Intel is open to all full time Third Level students in the island of Ireland.  The competition offers Third Level students from all academic disciplines and courses, the opportunity to realise their entrepreneurial ambitions and is designed to encourage innovation, promote enterprise and foster a spirit of entrepreneurship among Third Level students.  As well as &#8364;30,000 in cash prizes, the competition offers &#8364;30,000 in consultancy to help the finalists make a serious start at making their idea a commercial reality.  This year, <i>&#8220;Think outside the Box&#8221;</i> attracted submissions from over 360 Third Level students from colleges across Ireland.   Enterprise Ireland will continue to participate in the &#8220;Think outside the Box&#8221; competition in 2013.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland also supports young Third Level researchers through a number of initiatives including: the Enterprise Ireland Commercialisation Fund; Innovation Vouchers; Innovation Partnerships; Applied Research Enhancement Centres; Technology Centres; Campus Incubation Units and FP7.

In 2012, the CEBs received an Exchequer Capital Allocation of &euro;15 million towards the provision of grants and soft supports, such as training, mentoring and advice services, to the micro-enterprise sector.  This allocation is distributed among the CEBs once it is secured by my Department and thereafter the disbursement of these monies to clients is a matter for each Board. My Department does not retain any of the allocation for distribution later in the year.</p><p>  The CEB Central Coordination Unit (within Enterprise Ireland) works closely with the CEBs throughout the year reviewing individual expenditures to ensure that the funding allocated to the CEBs is utilised to the maximum extent possible.  As part of this process, the Central Coordination Unit conducts regular surveys among the CEBs to monitor expenditure, identify savings and determine any additional capital funding requirements to year end.  As a result of these exercises, additional demand was identified by 30 of the 35 CEBs and my Department began a process to identify savings in other Agencies of the Department that would fund these requirements.  This process in reality can only be done towards the final quarter of the year when the Agencies are in the best position to determine their full year spending requirements.</p><p>  Additional funding of &euro;3.78 million was identified and made available to the CEBs for the provision of direct assistance to the micro-enterprise sector and I am assured that this funding will be disbursed to eligible projects before the end of the year.  At no stage due to lack of funds do CEBs refuse to assist a viable enterprise that is in real need of support.  My Department has made it clear to the CEBs via the EI Central Coordination Unit that if such a situation were to arise; funding will be made available through savings elsewhere in the Departments vote.</p><p>  The funding arrangements for the CEBs are based on sound financial practice as set out within the Government financial procedures and ensure that the State maximises its return on its investment in jobs from across the capital expenditure programme.</p></reply>

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 4.25%).</p><p>  Last year I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare to meet the commitment made in the Programme for Government.  The Advisory Group will, inter alia, examine and report on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.  In addition the third Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, as at 31 December 2010, examined the long-term cost implications to the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and the break-even contribution rates required to provide short term benefits to the self-employed.</p><p>  Any proposals to extend such social insurance entitlements will have to be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of the finding of the Actuarial Review that the self-employed achieve very good value for money compared with the employed &ndash; when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.</p><p>  Self-employed individuals who fall on hard times or are without work for some time due to ill health may establish entitlement to assistance-based payments.  Those who have been previously self-employed can apply for the means-tested disability allowance, in the same manner as those who were not self-employed.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for assistance-based payments, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.  The Department of Health&rsquo;s treatment of the self-employed who suffer from illness is a matter for the Minister for Health.</p></reply>

The aim of rent supplement is to provide short term income assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.</p><p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant.  Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs.  There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.  The tenant&rsquo;s engagement with the Department usually takes place after the tenant has reached an agreement with the landlord.</p><p>  I am aware that some landlords are advertising their property on public sites and stating that they are unwilling to accept rent supplement recipients as tenants.  The Equal Status Acts 2000-2011, prohibit discrimination in the provision of services that are generally available to the public whether provided by the state or the private sector.  There are nine grounds prohibiting discrimination namely - gender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, race, disability and membership of the Traveller community.  Refusal to accept rent supplement tenants does not fall within the area of discrimination as provided for under the equality legislation.</p><p>  The fact that approximately 90,000 people are currently in receipt of rent supplement of which 42,000 have been awarded during 2012 proves that a significant number of landlords are accommodating applicants of the scheme and that rent supplement recipients are able to access accommodation.</p></reply>

As the populations of most EU countries are aging, issues around pension sustainability and adequacy mean that effective retirement age and the need for longer working in particular have come to the fore.  In Ireland, there are currently six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately two to one by 2050.  People aged 65 years and over will account for a greater proportion of the population while the proportion of working age is expected to decline.  People are living longer with healthier lives and growing numbers of people want to work, or may need to work beyond State pension age.  This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.  Therefore, the task of financing increasing pensions will fall to a diminishing share of the population.</p><p>  With these challenges and opportunities in mind, earlier this year, the Government asked the OECD to examine Ireland&rsquo;s overall pension policy in light of the economic downturn and to ensure that it meets the needs of future generations.  The review, which began in April of this year, encompasses the totality of pension provision in Ireland i.e. state, private, occupational and public sector.  The review takes account of the Programme for Government commitments in the pensions area, including tax reliefs and the commitment to cap taxpayers&rsquo; subsidies for pension schemes, (including politicians&rsquo; pension schemes), that deliver income in retirement of more than &euro;60,000.  The review will focus in particular on the commitment on universal coverage, and is also informed by developments at EU level in relation to pensions.</p><p>  The OECD will report on the sustainability of the pension system in the light of demographic and investment challenges; the adequacy and coverage levels, in order to ensure adequate income in retirement with a particular focus on the lower and middle income group; the modernity of pension systems to ensure flexibility in the labour market and supporting mechanisms for longer working, and equity within the pension system.</p><p>  In addition to this overall review, the Government has, since coming into office, introduced a number of key pension reforms: Legislation was introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 to abolish the State pension (transition) with effect from January 2014 thereby standardising pension age at 66.  The State pension (contributory) age will be increased to 67 in 2021 and to 68 with effect from 2028.  Further changes to State pension include changes to rate bands; to align the rate of pension paid with the contribution made ensures that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.</p><p>  Significant changes to occupational pensions, specifically defined benefit pension provision have also been introduced: Legislation introduced in 2011 provided for a sovereign annuity as an option for pension schemes.  In August, the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) announced details of the sale of over &euro;1 billion of Irish Amortising Bonds which were purchased by pension schemes and welcomed pension funds into the economy.  The regulatory structure for defined benefit pension schemes has been re-introduced.  Legislation enacted during the year strengthened the Funding Standard by introducing a requirement for schemes to develop a risk reserve from 2016 and to meet the reserve requirement in 2023 with a view to ensuring greater security for pension scheme members and giving pension schemes increased protection from market volatility in the future.</p><p>  The &ldquo;Report on Pension Charges in Ireland 2012&rdquo; was recently published by my Department with support from the Central Bank and Pensions Board.  This report, which is a fact finding report, has concluded that there are serious challenges in relation to the reasonableness and transparency of the pension changes.  Comments from interested parties and stakeholders are being invited over a 3 month period (i.e. by the end of January 2013).  These responses will be considered and a further policy and regulatory response, if necessary, will be brought to Government.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently approximately 90,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement, for which the Government has provided &euro;436m in 2012.</p><p>  The timescale for determining individual applications for rent supplement is dependant, among other things, on the availability of the required information, such as details of the applicant&rsquo;s income, bank statements, information from landlords, etc.  In addition, some aspects of the applications are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where further investigations or third party evidence is required.  Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information.  If the Deputy has a concern in relation to processing delays in a particular area or in respect of an individual, they should provide this detail to the Department for follow up.</p><p>  A key objective of the transfer of the Community Welfare Service from the Health Service Executive to my Department on 1st October 2011 is to provide a streamlined, consistent and enhanced service to the customer.  The process of integration is on-going and significant progress has already been made with a unified service, Intreo, now in the process of being delivered in four offices. The delivery of services in relation to processing rent supplement applications is also subject to on-going review.</p><p>  Statistics are not available on the average length of time taken to assess rent supplement applications.  The provision of a prompt service is a major objective for the Department&rsquo;s staff dealing with rent supplement applications.  This is tempered by the necessity to ensure that every case is fully investigated and that all cases are dealt with in a consistent and fair manner.  I am satisfied that the Department&rsquo;s staff dealing with these applications make every effort to ensure rent supplement claims are processed in an efficient manner.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-06a.997.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012110600060#WRQ03200"><p>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  The Government has provided &euro;436 million for the scheme in 2012.  There are currently approximately 90,000 rent supplement recipients proving that landlords are accommodating applicants of the scheme.</p><p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant.  Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs.  There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.</p><p>  However, rent supplement payments can, at the request of the tenant and with the agreement of the Department, be paid directly to the landlord.  If the Department were to introduce a system whereby all rent supplement payments were to be made directly to landlords the efficiency of the scheme would be significantly affected.  For example, the Department would potentially have to create a formal relationship with some 90,000 additional clients, the landlords.  This would involve greater complexity and significant resources to deal with a new set of third parties.  It would not be an effective use of resources to have departmental staff negotiating rental agreements for those with a short term need.</p><p>  The Government has effectively two initiatives to deal with long term reliance on rent supplement.  The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) is in operation since 2004 and the new Housing Policy Initiative as announced by my colleagues the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Housing &amp; Planning on 16th June 2011.</p><p>  In March 2012, the Government approved in principle to transfer responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long term housing need from my Department, currently provided through rent supplement, to housing authorities using a new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  Among the main features of HAP is that landlords will be paid directly by the local authority.</p><p>  A multi-agency steering group has been established to develop proposals to give effect to this transfer.  The group is chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and consists of representatives from the Departments of Social Protection; Public Expenditure and Reform; Office of the Revenue Commissioners; the County and City Managers Association, and the Housing Agency.  It is planned that pilot testing of HAP arrangements will commence during the second half of 2013 with general roll out and commencement of transfers from January 2014.  The new arrangements will achieve a key Government commitment of removing barriers to employment and at the same time returning rent supplement to its original purpose of a short-term income support.</p></reply>

The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses. It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Fuel allowance is &euro;20 per week payable for 26 weeks. The 2012/2013 fuel season commenced on 8 October 2012 and almost 400,000 people will benefit at an aggregate cost of &euro;215 million.  </p><p>  There would be a number of difficulties in paying the fuel allowance as a lump sum for some recipients while others receive it as part of their weekly payment.  If the payment were given in advance as a lump sum, there could be significant over-payments if a recipient&rsquo;s circumstances were to change during the payment season.  If it were paid in arrears, it obviously would create further budgeting difficulties for individuals and their families.  </p><p>  Many oil companies provide facilities for making payment by monthly instalment over a period of time which allows people to plan and budget for fuel expenses.  I am satisfied that this arrangement is sufficient to meet the needs of our customers.</p></reply>

The delivery of employment services at local level is an integral part of the new INTREO service. The Department currently contracts with 23 Local Development Companies and 1 community organisation for the provision of local employment services in 24 locations. These organisations play an important role in the delivery of employment services and given the urgent need to address unemployment, the intention is to enhance employment services at local level and not reduce such services. In this regard, the Department is currently engaged in a procurement process from which it intends to appoint expert advisor(s) to assist with the design and delivery of employment service provision, on a contracted basis with external providers, as envisaged under the Pathways to Work strategy. It is expected that the initial design will be completed in the first quarter of 2013 and thereafter the question of procuring additional employment services in line with this design will be considered. </p></reply>

The estimated expenditure on child benefit for 2012 is around &euro;2 billion in respect of some 1.15 million children. </p><p>  The Government is conscious that child benefit, as a universal payment, can be an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment. The social protection system also provides assistance to low income families with children through the payment of qualified child increases on primary social welfare payments and through the family income supplement payment. Both of these provide a level of assistance which is directly or indirectly linked with a household&rsquo;s income situation.</p><p>  I am conscious that achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, including child benefit, raises complex issues about the effectiveness and efficiency of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children. In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and has completed its work on this area. Their report is currently receiving my consideration and will assist the Government in setting out a pathway towards a more appropriate system of child income supports.</p><p>  It is envisaged that any proposed changes to the child benefit scheme and in particular a change from a universal to a means-tested payment would be considered in the context of the annual budget and announced on Budget day.  Therefore I do not intend to signal anything about the government&rsquo;s intentions in this area at this time.  </p></reply>

However, the Department of Social Protection has an important role to play in assisting households in the immediate aftermath of emergency events such as the flooding of November 2009, October 2011 and June 2012.  A humanitarian aid scheme was approved by Government in response to these floods.  The humanitarian aid scheme, which is means tested, is available to people whose homes were damaged in the flooding and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and in some instances structural repair as a result of the flooding damage.  Payments issued to householders affected by these floods as follows.</p><p>  Following the 2009 flooding, 2,100 payments were made at a value of approximately &euro;1 million during 2010.  The majority of these payments were made in counties Galway and Roscommon.  The counties mainly affected by the autumn 2011 flooding were Dublin and Monaghan.  Payments to the value of &euro;879,073 have been paid to date in respect of 952 claims in Dublin and &euro;28,767 in respect of 46 claims in Monaghan.  The total paid during 2011 in respect of these counties was approximately &euro;359,000.  Following the June 2012 flooding, over 100 payments have been made to affected householders in the Cork area to the value of &euro;108,500.  Total payments to the value of &euro;752,300 have been made in 2012 under the humanitarian aid scheme. Based on the scheme expenditure to date, it is estimated that expenditure for the full year will be in the region of &euro;900,000.  Any changes to this scheme will be considered in a budgetary context.</p></reply>

It is a fundamental qualifying condition for these benefits that a person must be available for full-time work.  My Department engages with jobseekers in order to support them and their families in progressing into employment.  One of the key concepts underpinning pathways to work and intreo, a new service providing a single point of contact for all employment and income supports, is the relationship between the jobseeker and the Department.  In accepting payment of benefit and support, the jobseeker shall agree to avail of the appropriate support measures offered during the course of the activation process, whether this is employment, education, training or placement in employment schemes.</p><p>  With regard to the dynamics of the Live Register it may be noted that the great majority of people on the Live Register have a strong financial incentive to work and significant numbers leave the register each year.  Indeed, for many unemployed people, unemployment is a short-term experience and the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes have an important labour market function in supporting people through periods of involuntary unemployment.  In this context the establishment of a compulsory work system for jobseekers would be a matter for my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in the first instance.  However, I would note that there could be significant potential for such a system to interfere with the functioning of the labour market, for example through substitution of existing work.</p></reply>

It provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals at all skills levels.  The aim of JobBridge is to assist individuals in breaking the cycle where they are unable to get a job without experience.  It provides them with an opportunity to gain valuable experience, relevant knowledge and skills within a working environment.  The Scheme is open to organisations in the private, public and community or voluntary sectors.  The JobBridge Scheme has made significant progress to-date since it came into operation on the 1<sup>st</sup> July 2011. 11,671 internships have commenced to date with 5,262 participants currently on an internship as at 1<sup>st</sup> November 2012 and 1,879 opportunities presently advertised on .</p><p>  In response to the specific matter raised by the Deputy, I wish to advise that an individual cannot apply for an internship with an organisation that they have an <i>existing</i> employment relationship with e.g. working part-time.  However, the terms and conditions of the Scheme currently provide that an individual may partake in an internship with an organisation that they had a <i>previous</i>   employment relationship with subject to all other eligibility criteria being met.  I am delighted to further advise the Deputy that there is no &#8216;one day&#8217; condition or rule preventing participation on JobBridge.  The Department will endeavour to contact the person concerned in this instance to clarify the matter. In the meantime if you have any further queries in this regard, please contact the JobBridge unit at   and the staff there will assist further if required.</p></reply>

An examination has also been carried out of existing child care schemes and of the capital investments already made by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in this sector.

The approach differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice.  The first two involve the enhancement of the website    and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline within the Citizens Information Board both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears.  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders.  This advice will be provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.</p><p>  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender will advise the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &#8364;250 to an accountant of the borrower&#8217;s choosing for the provision of this advice.  An operating protocol for the provision of this advice has been agreed between the main accountancy bodies and the lenders. The general scope of the advice will be limited to the borrower&#8217;s principal private residence.  The advisory framework has commenced with practising accountants because they already operate within a regulatory regime which includes qualitative oversight by their regulating bodies and in these circumstances it was possible to establish the advisory framework for people with mortgage distress within a relatively short timeframe.</p><p>  There is nothing to inhibit other financial intermediaries from continuing to give advice on mortgages as requested by borrowers.  While the advisory framework will be monitored on an on-going basis, it is not intended to conduct a full review of the service before June 2013.  The review will be undertaken to ensure that it is meeting its objectives and will encompass all aspects of the service including if participation is extended to other interested parties, the criteria that would be required in terms of relevant qualifications, experience, independence, professional indemnity insurance, etc.  The accountancy bodies have notified their members about the new service. To date, some 2,700 accountants have confirmed to their accounting body that they wish to be part of the panel and their details are now listed on a county by county basis on the website  .</p></reply>

His payment was stopped and he was assessed with having an overpayment of disability allowance of &euro;63,206.30.  The person was notified in writing of this decision and of his right of appeal.  Further letters were sent to him regarding the recovery of the overpayment.</p><p>  The weekly rate of disability allowance payment depends on the amount of weekly means assessed.  The legislative provisions regarding disability allowance state that means will be assessed from all income which the claimant or claimant&rsquo;s spouse may reasonably expect to receive during the year following the date of their claim with certain exceptions.  Income derived from earnings from self-employment is not included in these exceptions, and is accordingly assessable in full as means for disability allowance.</p></reply>

The medical evidence provided by the claimant in support of his claim was examined by a medical assessor who was of the opinion that the person concerned is not eligible for invalidity pension as he does not satisfy the medical criteria.  The application for invalidity pension was disallowed by a deciding officer.  The person in question was notified of this decision and the reason for it on 26 July 2012.  Further medical evidence was subsequently submitted by the claimant.  This additional evidence, along with the original information, was evaluated by a different medical assessor who expressed the opinion that the person concerned does not satisfy the medical criteria.

The primary objective of the report was to gather information on the level of pension charges levied, to assess whether these charges are reasonable and transparent, to report on the findings and to make recommendations.</p><p>  The report highlights a wide range of issues in relation to pension charges and identifies a number of serious problems.  It is fully recognised that the provision of pension schemes cannot be cost free.  However, there are major challenges to be addressed in the two main areas of reasonableness and transparency of charges. </p><p>  In recent years a number of initiatives have been progressed at Irish and EU level which focused on the area of disclosure and transparency of pension charges. These initiatives included the publication of the revised Consumer Protection Code by the Central Bank in 2012 and the recent consultation paper by the Pensions Board on pension simplification.  At EU level, my department will be monitoring development across a range of proposals which are currently under consideration and will be progressed during 2013.  The outcome of these developments will inform a review of relevant regulatory framework in Ireland.</p><p>  The report is a fact finding report, comments from interested parties and stakeholders are being invited over a 3 month period (i.e. by the end of January 2013).  These responses will be considered and a further policy and regulatory response, if necessary, will be brought to Government.  </p><p>  On the broader pension policy front, the report clearly identifies the importance of economies of scale in driving down charges. At present, the OECD is conducting a review of longer term pension policy and will comment on key policy issues such as the possible introduction of an auto-enrolment pension scheme for all employees, which could have a major impact on reducing charges.</p></reply>

The individual scheme allocation has been agreed with schemes by the Department of Social Protection. The budget for training on CE now stands at &euro;5.5m; this is an increase of &euro;1.2m on the original budget for 2012. This equates to a training grant of approximately &euro;250 per place annually.  This arrangement allows for a flexible response and enables local offices to re-allocate the training budget between schemes if required, once the Divisional Budget is not exceeded. Thus achieving improved utilisation of the training budget.</p><p>  Each CE Scheme has received an indicative budget as agreed between the sponsor and the DSP Officer.  Schemes can utilise the CE Advance Payment to offset training fees which are required to be paid in advance.  This will be reimbursed to the scheme on receipt and approval of invoices.  The training allocation for each CE participant is approved by the DSP Officer based on the CE Individual Learner Plan submitted by the CE Supervisor.</p><p>In allocating the budget to Schemes, the Department of Social Protection has taken into account if training can be accessed at no cost from F&Aacute;S or the VECs. In addition access to the Springboard Programme which provides access to 3rd   level courses without incurring fees is now available to CE participants, once a participant satisfies the entry criteria.</p><p>  For many CE participants, CE is the main avenue to gaining qualifications and making up for lost learning opportunities in the past.  This is recognised in the current arrangements.</p></reply>

A person wishing to pursue the back to education allowance will have to satisfy a number of conditions such as being a certain age, in receipt of a prescribed social welfare payment for a specified time period, pursuing a full time course of study leading to a recognised qualification in a recognised college and progressing in the level of education held by the client with reference to the national framework of qualifications among others.  The scheme covers a wide range of full-time courses of education in approved colleges spanning basic foundation courses to third level courses across all disciplines. </p><p>  BTEA guidelines are, in the main, mirror those in place for similar student supports administered by the Department of Education and Skills and require student progression from one qualification level to a higher one.  It is my intention to retain the requirements in respect of progression in education as a feature of the BTEA in line with the necessity that State support for education purposes is grounded on a student progressing from one qualification level to a higher one.  This is necessary to ensure displacement does not occur and best use is made of the resources available.  </p><p>  It is important to note that the BTEA scheme is not intended to be an alternative form of funding for those wishing to enter or re-enter the education system.  It is not possible, within the scope of the scheme, to authorise an application for payment where the basic qualifying conditions have not been satisfied and progression is not evident.  Under the scheme guidelines deciding officers must adhere to the progression rule in making BTEA claim decisions.</p><p>  The progression requirements outlined above do not apply in cases of a person wishing to pursue a part time education course which they may do while still obtaining their jobseekers payment.  They must apply at their local social welfare office and verify that participation on the course does not reduce their availability for work.  In the case of jobseekers benefit, participation on a course does not grant any extension to the normal period for which jobseekers benefit is paid. </p><p>  My Department is currently reviewing a wide range of activation supports that are available, including BTEA, and it is my intention to canvass the views of stakeholders as part of the implementation process resulting from the review.</p></reply>

The payment came into existence in 1986 and replaced the children&rsquo;s allowance payment, which was first introduced in 1944. The estimated expenditure on child benefit for 2012 is around &euro;2 billion in respect of some 1.15 million children. </p><p>  A number of objectives have been attributed to the child benefit scheme and its precursor over the years.  These objectives were reviewed as part of a policy and value for money review completed by the Department of Social Protection in November 2010. The review identified the primary objectives of child benefit as providing assistance to parents and others in meeting the cost associated with raising children and in contributing towards alleviating child poverty.  The review also noted that the evolution of policy since the schemes introduction has also seen a number of secondary objectives emerge over time with varying significance, including the reduction of financial disincentives for parents to take up work; financial assistance with specific costs such as the cost of paid childcare; and the provision of an independent income source for women in the home. The review considered that the universal nature of child benefit allows it to fulfil a number of different roles and accommodate multiple objectives.</p></reply>

The Report of the Group, which recommends a scheme for the legal recognition of transgender persons, was approved by the Government on 12 July 2011, and was subsequently published on 14 July, 2011.  </p><p>  Since the publication of the Report, the Department has been working on developing draft Heads of a Gender Recognition Bill. In this context, it has engaged in discussions with the relevant medical health professionals and with representatives from interested NGOs.  Given the legal complexities involved in relation to some of the GRAG recommendations relating to the marital and civil partnership status of individuals, in March, my Department sought advice from the Office of the Attorney General, which in turn sought the legal opinion of external counsel on these issues. </p><p>  Preliminary discussions have taken place between my Department, the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Justice and Equality in relation to the legal opinion of external counsel. The Office of the Attorney General is in the process of considering the various approaches suggested by counsel. Once my Department receives the formal legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General, this will inform the drafting of the Heads of Bill. Given the sensitive and complex nature of the issues involved, it is my intention to ask the Oireachtas Committee on Education and  Social Protection to discuss the provisional draft Heads of Bill once they are completed.</p><p>  It is therefore not possible to be definitive at this stage about when I will be in a position to introduce legislation to give legal recognition to the acquired gender of transgender persons.  When my Department has received the formal opinion of the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office and when the Oireachtas Committee has discussed the provisional draft Heads of Bill I will be in a better position to give a timeframe for the introduction of the legislation.</p></reply>

It provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals at all skills levels.  The aim of JobBridge is to assist individuals in breaking the cycle where they are unable to get a job without experience.

Within this context, it is widely recognised that it is good policy and practice for host organisations to acknowledge receipt of applications from jobseekers.      </p><p>  However, I would advise the Deputy that the process of applying for internships is entirely a matter for the host organisation and prospective interns.  As you are aware, participation on the Scheme is on a voluntary basis and the Department is not involved in the recruitment process other than hosting the advertisements and verifying the eligibility of jobseekers to participate.</p><p>  The Department does not condone incidences wherein jobseekers apply for posts and do not receive an acknowledgment from their prospective host organisation.  In light of matters raised by the Deputy, the Department will re-emphasise the importance of host organisations responding to applications by jobseekers.  This will be implemented via the JobBridge website.</p></reply>

It provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals at all skills levels.  The aim of JobBridge is to assist individuals in breaking the cycle where they are unable to get a job without experience.  It provides them with an opportunity to gain valuable experience, relevant knowledge and skills within a working environment.  The Scheme is open to organisations in the private, public and community or voluntary sectors. </p><p>  The JobBridge Scheme has made significant progress to-date since it came into operation on 1<sup>st</sup> July 2011. 11,671 internships have commenced to date with 5,262 participants currently on an internship as at 1<sup>st</sup> November 2012 and 1,879 opportunities presently advertised on  . </p><p>  A clear set of rules have been developed and are in operation to protect the intern and safeguard JobBridge from potential abuse.  Thus, in order for an organisation to participate on JobBridge, one of the key conditions is that an organisation or self-employed person must have a minimum of 1 full time employee who is employed for 30 hours or more per week (i.e. on payroll and subject to tax and PRSI).  A host organisation participating in JobBridge must be in a position to provide a substantial commitment to their intern so as to ensure the provision of a quality internship.  It is important that strong mentoring and support is available for the intern and that they can improve their skills and knowledge while working with other colleagues in a team environment. </p><p>  Potential host organisations can avail of the JobBridge guidelines and full eligibility criteria which are available on the JobBridge website .</p><p>  I wish to further highlight that an independent evaluation of the Scheme is currently being undertaken by Indecon International Economic Consultants.  This evaluation will assess the design, delivery and impact of the JobBridge Scheme; it will provide details of the nature of the work experience of the participants; a measurement of the relevance of that experience to the labour market and progression into employment.  It is anticipated that the final report will be published in late December.  This Report will also present recommendations on how the Scheme might be improved.  It is at this stage that further consideration will be given to amending the terms and conditions of the Scheme including the specific matters raised by the Deputy.</p></reply>

This ranges from senior management engagement, ongoing day-to-day operational contact and also the annual Summer School jointly run by the two authorities.  In general, the main contacts are in relation to the assessment and payment of social welfare benefits.  Payment of cross-border benefits is regulated by EU Regulations on the co-ordination of social security systems and so there is a necessity for ongoing contacts with Northern and UK authorities to assess and pay benefits across a wide range of schemes.</p><p>  Fraud control is an important issue for authorities in both jurisdictions and in this regard there are formal and ad-hoc arrangements in place for the sharing of information in this area.  A Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Ireland is in place to ensure Co-operation and Mutual Assistance in the Administration of Social Security Programmes in matters of mutual interest in the areas of fraud in their respective social security systems.  </p><p>  In addition, there is a Cross-Border Operational Forum, comprising senior fraud managers from the Department of Social Protection, the  Department for Work and Pensions and the Northern Ireland Social Security Agency of the Department for Social Development.  The Forum&rsquo;s remit is to liaise at operational level and ensure that measures are in place to ensure effective co-operation, prevention and detection of fraud  . </p><p>  Case by case data-matching takes places between the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Social Development (DSD) in Northern Ireland on cases where social welfare fraud or abuse is occurring.  In 2011, 4,288 checks were carried out by the DSD on behalf of the DSP.  Similarly, 2,716 checks were carried out by the DSP on behalf of the DSD for the same year.</p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s Special Investigation works with other agencies such as Revenue, National Employment Rights Authority, Customs and the Garda&iacute; and ensures that control activity is being targeted at high risk categories of claimants/employers.  There is an active and ongoing relationship between the Department&rsquo;s SIU officers and their counterparts in the Fraud Investigation Service in Northern Ireland.</p><p>  An annual Summer School is run jointly by the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Social Development, Northern Ireland.  This year marked the 13th anniversary of this very successful joint event.  The School is residential and takes place over the period of one week.  It is hosted in turn by each Department, and held in Dublin and Belfast on alternate years.  Twenty four staff from each Department are invited to attend.  Lectures and study group sessions held throughout the week provide an opportunity for staff to come together in a university environment to explore issues of social policy facing their Departments and their societies in general.  In the Department of Social Protection, staff of the following grades are invited to apply for a place on the School; Staff Officer, Executive Officer, Higher Executive Officer and Administrative Officer.  All administration in relation to the Summer School is managed by a small team of staff in both Departments who liaise regularly.</p><p>  The Department does not have any unit dealing exclusively with co-operation with Northern Ireland.  Officers contact Northern authorities as required as part of their normal responsibilities.  Given the manner in which contacts with Northern Ireland take place and the wide number of people involved it would not be possible to quantify the actual staff numbers and time involved.</p></reply>

The primary objective of the report was to gather information on the level of pension charges levied, to assess whether these charges are reasonable and transparent, to report on the findings and to make recommendations.</p><p>  The report highlights a wide range of issues in relation to pension charges and identifies a number of serious problems.  It is fully recognised that the provision of pension schemes cannot be cost free.  However, there are major challenges to be addressed in the two main areas of reasonableness and transparency of charges. </p><p>  The report is a fact finding report and comments from interested parties and stakeholders are being invited over a 3 month period (i.e. by the end of January 2013).  These responses will be considered and a further policy and regulatory response, if considered necessary, will be brought to Government.  </p><p>  In recent years a number of initiatives have been progressed at Irish and EU level which focused on the area of disclosure and transparency of pension charges.  These initiatives included the publication of the revised Consumer Protection Code by the Central Bank in 2012 and the recent consultation paper by the Pensions Board on pension simplification.  At EU level, my Department will be monitoring development across a range of proposals which are currently under consideration and will be progressed during 2013.  The outcome of these developments will inform the regulatory framework in Ireland.</p><p>  On the broader pension policy front, the report clearly identifies the importance of economies of scale in driving down charges.  At present the OECD is conducting a review of longer term pension policy and will comment on key policy issues such as the possible introduction of an auto-enrolment pension scheme for all employees which could have a major impact on reducing charges.</p></reply>

There are currently six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately two to one by 2050.  People aged 65 years and over will account for a greater proportion of the population while the proportion of working age is expected to decline.  People are living longer with healthier lives, and while this is a welcome development, it does have obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.  Therefore, the task of financing increasing pensions will fall to a diminishing share of the population.  </p><p>  In relation to the current adequacy of pensioner incomes, it should be noted that this group have the lowest consistent poverty rate and are least likely to be at risk of poverty due to the adequacy of the State pension, compared to the rest of the population.  Between 2004 and 2010, consistent poverty for those aged over 65 decreased from 3.3% to 0.9%.  The at risk of poverty rate for people in that age group fell from 27.1% to 9.6% over the same period.  </p><p>  In relation to budgetary measures, the revised estimates for my Department provide for expenditure in 2012 of nearly &euro;6.26 billion on pensions or 30.4% of total expenditure.  The Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012 &ndash; 2014 published by Government last December provides for additional new expenditure reduction measures of &euro;540 million to be achieved in Budget 2013.  Reducing overall expenditure in 2013 and beyond in line with these targets will be very challenging.</p><p>  The Government will consider the appropriate level of expenditure on pensions in 2013 in the context of the forthcoming Budget.  The outcome will be announced on Budget Day.</p></reply>

The person concerned was notified of this decision on 29th August 2012.  Following a review of his circumstances on 1st September, the decision to disallow the claim has been upheld.</p><p>  BTEA is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to remove the barriers to participation in second and third level education by enabling those in receipt of certain social welfare payments to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher qualification than that already held.  A person wishing to pursue the BTEA scheme will have to satisfy a number of conditions such as being a certain age, in receipt of a prescribed social welfare payment for a specified time period, pursuing a full time course of study leading to a recognised qualification in a recognised college and progressing in the level of education held by the client with reference to the national framework of qualifications among others. </p><p>  Progression in education is a condition which is not unique to BTEA, indeed State support for education purposes is grounded on a student progressing from one qualification level to a higher one.  This is necessary to ensure displacement does not occur, in that courses could be offered to students who are not progressing at the cost of students progressing from a lower education level.  BTEA guidelines are, in the main, in line with the mechanisms in place for similar student supports administered by the Department of Education and Skills and require student progression from one qualification level to a higher one.  Furthermore, the BTEA scheme is not intended to be an alternative form of funding for people entering or re-entering the third level education system.</p></reply>

This is being undertaken as a result of the Gaeltacht Act 2012 which gives effect to a Government decision that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta will be responsible for the implementation of the <i>20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030</i>   in the Gaeltacht.  It is my intention that this will drive greater efficiency in service delivery in the Gaeltacht.</p><p>  In addition, Foras na Gaeilge is undertaking a review of its 19 core funded bodies.  It is envisaged that this review will result in a reconfiguration of the Irish language sector.  Since Foras na Gaeilge is an agency of the North South Language Body, which is co-funded by the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in Northern Ireland, decisions with regard to this review are taken by the North South Ministerial Council. </p></reply>

In line with this process, I have invited the County and City Councils in Munster to submit expressions of interest and proposals setting out possible locations where the ceremony might be held following consultation with local communities, interest groups and other stakeholders.  The purpose of this new selection process is to generate public awareness and interest in the annual National Famine Commemoration, to increase the number of potential sites available to choose from each year and to ensure that the selection process is as transparent and open as possible.  A sub-committee of the National Famine Commemoration Committee will assess these proposals and will recommend the most suitable site.  I expect to announce the date and location of the commemoration following the sub-Committee's assessment.</p><p>  The Deputy should also note that in line with previous years, an international event has been planned to commemorate the Great Irish Famine.

My Department has two North South Implementation Bodies under its remit - Waterways Ireland and An Foras Teanga.  The latter Body comprises Foras na Gaeilge (with the responsibility of promoting the Irish language in every aspect of everyday life throughout the island of Ireland) and the Ulster Scots Agency/Tha Boord o Ulst&egrave;r-Scotch (with the responsibility of promoting the Ulster-Scots language and culture, both within Northern Ireland and throughout the island of Ireland).  Waterways Ireland is responsible for the management, maintenance, development and restoration of the inland navigable waterway system throughout the island, principally for recreational purposes.</p><p>  These North South Bodies are co-funded and co-sponsored with the Department of Arts, Culture and Leisure, Northern Ireland.  In addition to the language and inland waterways sectors, the Deputy will be aware that there is ongoing North South engagement in a number of other areas of my Department, some of which also come within the remit of the Department of Arts, Culture and Leisure.

The most recent engagement was at the plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council on Friday last, 2 November in Armagh.  The ongoing engagement involves a variety of officers in my Department across the range of activities involved, in addition to those dealing specifically with the North South Bodies mentioned. </p><p>  My Department's staff complement for An Foras Teanga comprises 5 officers (viz. Director 25%, PO 25%, AP 80%, HEO 100% and CO 100%).  A North South Co-operation Unit has been in place in my Department since its establishment.  The 2 staff members working full-time in the Unit also have responsibility for Waterways Ireland.  The Unit is overseen by a Principal Officer (25%), who also has a number of other responsibilities.</p></reply>

The second Action Plan, which I will be publishing shortly, provides a progress report on delivery of the national energy savings targets.  The Action Plan will show that Ireland is on track to deliver the 20% energy saving target.</p><p>  The public sector is estimated to spend around &euro;600 million per annum on energy.  Achieving our 33% savings target for the public sector would save in the region of &euro;150 million each year.  The top 135 public bodies, which account for over 95% of public sector energy consumption, are required to submit detailed energy and activity data to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).  From this data, detailed progress scorecards will be produced and published for each organisation.  From 2013 on, an online energy data system will facilitate all public bodies, including schools and healthcare facilities, to report detailed energy data and allow SEAI to prepare detailed performance scorecards for all public bodies.</p><p>  In September I wrote to the head of each public body, reminding them of their obligation to report annually their energy usage to SEAI. Enclosed with each letter was the SEAI report: &lsquo;Energy Use in the Public Sector&rsquo;, which outlines savings achieved across the public sector to end-2010 amounted to 650 GWh.</p><p>  The SEAI Public Sector Programme is a comprehensive support framework to assist public bodies in meeting the 33% energy saving target by integrating energy management practices across organisations.  While the Programme comprises four main elements including Monitoring and Reporting, Best Practice and Procurement, the flagship element is the Partnership Agreement, which provides tailored support delivered to those organisations who demonstrate commitment to strategic energy management.  So far fourteen leading public bodies, with a combined annual energy spend of more than &euro;200 million, have committed to Partnership Agreements that are anticipated to deliver cumulative energy savings of &euro;330 million by 2020.  My objective is to encourage other public bodies to join this initiative and demonstrate their commitment and leadership in realising significant energy savings.</p><p>  As the above indicates, considerable progress with accompanying savings is being made in energy efficiency in the public sector.  This effort will be intensified in the coming years.  Achievement of &euro;100m savings in just 2 years would require considerable appropriate investment by public bodies at a level which may not be realistic in the current financial climate.  Nevertheless, the Deputies can be assured of my strong commitment to realising the goals we have set for energy efficiency in the public sector.</p><p>  More recently, Better Energy Workplaces evaluates new approaches for implementing sustainable energy upgrades to existing facilities in the public, commercial, industrial and community sectors.  By accelerating the scale and depth of retrofit across these sectors the programme aims to create energy efficiency exemplar projects. The scheme disbursed &euro;11 million in grants in 2011, co-financed 85 projects and supported 250 jobs.  This year the Better Energy Workplaces Fund has offered support to 145 projects &ndash; 44 of which are in the public sector.  This scheme has developed public sector and market competence and capacity for pay-as-you-save type models.</p><p>  Finally, the recently adopted Energy Efficiency Directive will translate elements of the European Efficiency Plan into binding measures on Member States, including an annual rate of renovation for central Government buildings of 3%; an inventory of central Government buildings with a total useful floor area over certain thresholds; and an obligation on public bodies to procure products, services and buildings with high energy efficient performance.  The 3% renovation target for central Government buildings represents a challenge for the Office of Public Works (OPW), however, the energy savings will greatly outweigh the costs of renovation.  My Department will work closely with the OPW over the coming months to prepare a plan for the realisation of this target.</p></reply>

Best scientific advice, both nationally and internationally, indicates that the introduction of a salmon hatchery operation into a wild salmon fishery can reduce the ability of the genetically distinct native strain to survive and results in the loss of their adaptability to their catchment.  </p><p>  The advice also indicates that the issue of decline of salmon stocks in a particular catchment, leaving aside the international issue of survival at sea, is best dealt with through improvements in water quality and salmon habitat. </p><p>  Stocking, for conservation purposes, in cases where artificial intervention is required to maintain the genetically distinct salmon strain under threat, could be considered.</p><p>  This is not the case, however, in the River Feale whose salmon stock is above the Conservation Limit particular to its own unique stock and which has an annual surplus of salmon available for exploitation.  Nevertheless, I do recognise recent concerns over the longer term decline in salmon numbers on the River Feale, and understand from IFI that efforts are being made to monitor these stocks, quantify any stock variations and to establish and address potential reasons for a decline.</p><p>  In this regard a survey of the juvenile salmon population, planned for the Feale in 2013, will allow the juvenile salmon stock status to be assessed against baseline surveys carried over the past 20 years. Once the Feale salmon stock assessment has been analysed any remedial action necessary can then be considered.</p></reply>

It was specifically seeking to test innovative and pioneering partnerships for delivery by building on existing community groups/networks within the Community rather than targeting individual homeowners or businesses.</p><p>  The Pilot stimulated a high level of interest from community groups and other organisations around the country.  It was a very competitive call and received applications for funding well in excess of the &euro;3 million that was made available.</p><p>  The application from Glenbeigh Community Centre requested 100% funding, and although the maximum funding levels were not defined in the call, the maximum grant awarded under the pilot was 80%.</p><p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) reviewed the project against the published evaluation criteria using a standardised evaluation form.  A minimum overall pass mark of 50% was required in order to be eligible for funding.  Unfortunately, the application from Glenbeigh Community Centre did not achieve the minimum pass mark and so has been declined for funding under the Pilot.  SEAI would be very happy to provide further feedback to the applicant on the areas in which the project scored poorly and to identify opportunities for it to be improved.</p><p>  Should funding be allocated for a full scale Communities Programme in 2013, it is hoped that Glenbeigh Community Centre would give it their consideration.</p></reply>

Roll out of 4G is one of the key elements of the Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August.  This Plan aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020.</p><p>  The level of spectrum fees that will be generated by the Multi-Band Spectrum Award process will be determined by the eventual level of demand expressed in the auction.

The scheme disbursed &euro;11 million in grants in 2011, co-financed 85 projects and supported 250 jobs.  This year the Better Energy Workplaces Fund has offered support to 145 projects &ndash; 44 of which are in the public sector.  This scheme has developed public sector and market competence and capacity for pay-as-you-save type models.</p><p>  Finally, the recently adopted Energy Efficiency Directive will translate elements of the European Efficiency Plan into binding measures on Member States, including an annual rate of renovation for central Government buildings of 3%; an inventory of central Government buildings with a total useful floor area over certain thresholds; and an obligation on public bodies to procure products, services and buildings with high energy efficient performance.  The 3% renovation target for central Government buildings represents a challenge for the Office of Public Works (OPW), however, the energy savings will greatly outweigh the costs of renovation.  My Department will work closely with the OPW over the coming months to prepare a plan for the realisation of this target.</p></reply>

As the national regulatory authority for the management of our radio spectrum, ComReg has set out its position on spectrum sharing when it published its latest strategy statement for managing the radio spectrum in November 2011 and subsequently in Document 12/52 relating to the Multiband Spectrum Release Decision.  In its Strategy ComReg notes the recent trend towards increased collaboration between operators in the provision of wireless/mobile services.  There are various drivers for this, including operators&rsquo; desire to reduce costs and/or provide a higher quality of service to consumers by using their combined resources.  There are many forms of collaboration and the benefits and drawbacks of each type will vary depending on the specifics of the collaboration. </p><p>  ComReg is of the view that spectrum sharing and pooling can, in principle, bring benefits such as reduced costs and improved quality of service.  At the same time, ComReg is aware of the potential policy concerns, particularly in relation to competition.  Each case would have to be judged on its merits.  ComReg has however indicated that it would look more favourably on agreements that do not overly restrict competition and deliver demonstrable benefits that are shared with final consumers.</p></reply>

The legislation provides for natural gas installers to be registered as a Registered Gas Installer (RGI). It is a legal requirement that any gas works carried out on domestic gas installations may be carried out only by a Registered Gas Installer.  The CER intends to consult next year on a proposal to extend this requirement to the carrying out of gas works on commercial installations.</p><p>  The CER discharges its gas safety responsibility through the implementation of a Natural Gas Safety Regulatory Framework.  The Framework has been in operation for five years. Since 2009, it has included a system for the regulation, certification, ongoing inspection of work and investigation of complaints regarding the competence of any particular natural gas installer.  The legislation provides for prosecution through the court system of unregistered gas installers.  The CER has attained three successful prosecutions to date in cases where unregistered installers have completed domestic gas works.</p><p>  It is the responsibility of the public to ensure that they engage only registered installers. The CER is responsible for promoting the safety of natural gas and may direct a natural gas undertaking to engage in campaigns promoting natural gas safety. Campaigns encourage consumers to use only registered installers for the completion of gas works in a domestic setting and highlight that it is a legal requirement for anyone carrying out domestic gas works to be a registered gas installer.  The 2012 campaign utilised TV, radio, online display, and search engines to reach its target audience.   The details of the 2013 campaign have yet to be finalised.</p><p>  Safety is a matter of highest priority for the CER and the regulator is currently undertaking a review of the Framework with a view to maximising its effectiveness.  An initial consultation paper was published over the summer period and a further consultation is due to be carried out over the coming months.</p><p>  Finally, the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) has significant responsibilities in regard to health and safety in the workplace including gas works carried out in a commercial setting.</p></reply>

It has been constructed on time and within budget.</p><p>  As with any major, complex project using purpose-built technology, comprehensive testing is necessary in relation to the Interconnector.  Recent tests have highlighted some issues with regard to localised incidents of noise interference with telephone lines.  I understand from EirGrid that a programme of works involving EirGrid and its contractor is currently under way to address these issues.  The start of commercial trading over the Interconnector has been deferred until such time as all of the localised issues are resolved.</p><p>  I wish to emphasise that this issue relates to noise on some telephone lines in the vicinity of the interconnector and is not a health concern.</p><p>  In relation to any costs arising from the delay in the commercial operation of the Interconnector, it should be noted that EirGrid has not yet taken over the Interconnector from the contractor which designed, manufactured and installed it, and intends to do so only when the interference issues have been satisfactorily addressed.</p><p>  The figures previously supplied by EirGrid in an affidavit to the Commercial Court in unsuccessful legal proceedings taken by Rush Community Council related to the scenario in which EirGrid would have been prevented from operating the Interconnector due to a legal challenge, in which case all costs incurred and loss of revenue would have fallen to EirGrid and to Irish electricity customers.  However, the current scenario is entirely different.</p><p>  By way of conclusion, I wish to state that the Interconnector is a hugely significant step in delivering electricity connectivity between Ireland and the UK and towards lessening our isolation as an energy market.  Any temporary issues will be resolved as soon as possible in order to allow the Interconnector operate at a level which allows it to benefit Irish electricity consumers.</p></reply>

In 2011 ICES reiterated its previous advice that all anthropogenic mortality (e.g. recreational and commercial fishing, hydropower, pollution) affecting production and escapement of eels should be reduced to as close to zero as possible until there is clear evidence that both recruitment and the adult stock are increasing.  In 2011, glass eel recruitment has fallen to 5% of their 1960-1979 level in the Atlantic region and less than 1% in the North Sea area, and showed no sign of recovery.</p><p>  In Ireland, recruitment has been declining at many monitoring sites since the mid-1980s, for example in the 2000-2011 period, the glass eel catch in the Shannon was at 2% of the pre-1980 numbers.  In summary, recruitment of glass eels and elvers remained low during the 2009 to 2011 period both in Ireland and across Europe.</p><p>  In Ireland it is anticipated that there will be a considerable decline in silver eel production, as indicated by recruitment history, yellow eel stock indicators and modelled projections for index stocks.  As part of Ireland&rsquo;s eel management regime, every three years, a review of the status of eel stocks is conducted, this coupled with input from stakeholders, supports the decision making process on the future of the commercial and recreational eel fishery.  Inland Fisheries Ireland has just completed a full public consultation on the future of the commercial and recreation eel fishery; the recommendations from this review are being finalised.  </p><p>  Inland Fisheries Ireland has made a number of reports on eel stocks available on its website including The National Eel Stock Recovery Plan, The Status of Eel Stocks in Ireland and The Implementation of the Eel Management Plan for Ireland.</p><p>  In 2009 the then Central and Regional Fisheries Boards (now Inland Fisheries Ireland &ndash; IFI) engaged with the eel fishermen representatives to investigate possible diversification schemes.  I understand that a number of former eel fishermen were contracted by the ESB to undertake Trap and Transport operations to mitigate the impact of hydropower schemes as part of the eel management plan.   As I already indicated the recommendations from IFI&rsquo;s review and the public consultation on the future of the commercial and recreation eel fishery are being finalised and the continuation of existing diversification activity will be considered in that process. </p><p>  There is no property right attaching to public eel licences and consequently the issue of compensation does not arise, given that the closure of the fishery was applied for conservation reasons under the Fisheries Acts.  Given that context and having regard to national economic circumstances, no provision has been made for compensation payments.</p></reply>

This includes information on transmitter sites being used.  This is in accordance with Part 8 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, which provides that the development of the RT&Eacute; network is an operational matter for RT&Eacute;.</p><p>The SAORVIEW network is complete and is available to c. 98% of the population.  It must be understood that it is impossible to cover 100% of the population by terrestrial means.  Reasons for this include local topography for example. For technological reasons this is not going to change.</p><p>Furthermore, as also explained to the Deputy, I have been informed by RT&Eacute;NL that SAORVIEW has delivered a significant improvement in terrestrial coverage in both geographical and population coverage in County Kerry as set out in the following tables:</p><p><b>Geographical</b></p><p><table><tr><th><div>Channel</div></th><th><div>Analogue Coverage</div></th><th><div>SAORVIEW Coverage</div></th><th><div>Increase</div></th></tr><tr><td>RT&Eacute; One</td><td><div>75 % area</div></td><td><div>87%</div></td><td><div>12%</div></td></tr><tr><td>RT&Eacute; Two</td><td><div>75% area</div></td><td><div>87%</div></td><td><div>12%</div></td></tr><tr><td>TV3</td><td><div>40% area</div></td><td><div>87%</div></td><td><div>47%</div></td></tr><tr><td>TG4</td><td><div>64% area</div></td><td><div>87%</div></td><td><div>23%</div></td></tr></table></p><p><b>Population</b></p><p><table><tr><th><div>Channel</div></th><th><div>Analogue Coverage</div></th><th><div>SAORVIEW Coverage</div></th><th><div>Increase</div></th></tr><tr><td>RT&Eacute; One</td><td><div>90% population</div></td><td><div>95%</div></td><td><div>5%</div></td></tr><tr><td>RT&Eacute; Two</td><td><div>90% population</div></td><td><div>95%</div></td><td><div>5%</div></td></tr><tr><td>TV3</td><td><div>44% population</div></td><td><div>95%</div></td><td><div>51%</div></td></tr><tr><td>TG4</td><td><div>75% population</div></td><td><div>95%</div></td><td><div>20%</div></td></tr></table></p><p>In relation to SAORSAT in Co. Kerry, RT&Eacute;NL has organised training for installers. On October 1st ten installers attended a training course in Kerry.  The course was open to any installer and the ones that attended were from areas such as Firies, Killorglin, Kenmare, Killarney, Cahersiveen, Beaufort, Waterville and Castleisland.  It was demonstrated how SAORSAT works, the best dish type to use, how to fix the dish correctly and how to point it in the correct direction.  On 22 October RT&Eacute;NL provided a demonstration of SAORSAT to about 60 attendees in Annascaul, County Kerry.  Initial feedback from the meeting was positive. Should installers in Kerry have any difficulties installing SAORSAT, they should contact RT&Eacute;NL directly and RT&Eacute;NL will arrange the necessary training.

The level of profits will depend on a combination of factors including, the volume of recoverable gas, the cost of developing and operating the infrastructure, the price of gas over the life of the field, together with the timing and profile of production.</p><p>  Completion of the Corrib gas field development works by the developer is the principal factor that will determine the date for first gas.  Pending such completion, it is not possible to state a date for when gas from the Corrib gas field will become available.  It is estimated that construction of the onshore section of the pipeline, including the construction of a 5km tunnel, which began last year, will take in the region of three years. </p><p>  First gas cannot, therefore, reasonably be anticipated before the second half of 2014 and revenues payable to the State will not commence until the development goes into profit.</p></reply>

There are currently eighteen exploration licences, seventeen licensing options and five petroleum prospecting licences extant in respect of exploration in the Irish offshore.  </p><p>  All authorisations granted are subject to the carrying out of agreed work programmes. While work programmes in respect of licensing options are mainly of a desk-study nature, work programmes in respect of exploration licences include seismic surveys and drilling operations.</p><p>  Since November 2011 the Barryroe appraisal well in the Celtci Sea was the only well drilled in the Irish offshore. </p><p>  While my Department has not yet received any applications for drilling operations in 2013 and 2014, I understood that plans are being advanced for in the order of three to five wells.</p><p>  In relation to seismic surveys 130 kms&sup2; of 3D seismic was acquired since 1 November 2011 and while my Department has not yet received applications for the shooting of seismic surveys over the next two years it is anticipated that in the region of 800km&sup2; of 3D seismic and 1800km&sup2; of 2D seismic will be acquired. </p><p>  Given that no new discovery has been declared as a &ldquo;commercial discovery&rdquo; since the Corrib Gas Field was discovered in 1996, there are no other plans for new onshore infrastructure at this point in time.</p><p>  Works in relation to the development of the Corrib Gas Field is ongoing with the principal remaining element being the onshore pipeline. It is estimated that construction of the onshore section of the pipeline, including the construction of a 5km tunnel, will take in the region of three years.

This is in accordance with Part 8 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, which provides that the development of the RT&Eacute; network is an operational matter for RT&Eacute;.</p><p>The SAORVIEW network is complete and provides c. 98% population coverage.  It must be understood that it is simply not possible to provide 100% coverage by terrestrial means.  Reasons for this include, for example, local topography.</p><p>In addition to SAORVIEW, RT&Eacute; has developed SAORSAT, a new free-to-air satellite service unique to Ireland to ensure the RT&Eacute; television services are available to the remaining 2% of the population.  SAORSAT launched in March 2012.  SAORVIEW and SAORSAT coverage and reception information is available on <i>www.saorview.ie</i> and <i>www.rtenl.ie</i>.</p><p>Specifically in relation to Kerry, as I explained to the Deputy in a Parliamentary Question reply of October 10th, I have been informed by RT&Eacute;NL that SAORVIEW has delivered a significant improvement in terrestrial coverage in both geographical and population coverage in County Kerry as set out in the following tables:</p><p><b>Geographical</b></p><p><table><tr><th><div>Channel</div></th><th><div>Analogue Coverage</div></th><th><div>SAORVIEW Coverage</div></th><th><div>Increase</div></th></tr><tr><td>RT&Eacute; One</td><td><div>75 % area</div></td><td><div>87%</div></td><td><div>12%</div></td></tr><tr><td>RT&Eacute; Two</td><td><div>75% area</div></td><td><div>87%</div></td><td><div>12%</div></td></tr><tr><td>TV3</td><td><div>40% area</div></td><td><div>87%</div></td><td><div>47%</div></td></tr><tr><td>TG4</td><td><div>64% area</div></td><td><div>87%</div></td><td><div>23%</div></td></tr></table></p><p><b>Population</b></p><p><table><tr><th><div>Channel</div></th><th><div>Analogue Coverage</div></th><th><div>SAORVIEW Coverage</div></th><th><div>Increase</div></th></tr><tr><td>RT&Eacute; One</td><td><div>90% population</div></td><td><div>95%</div></td><td><div>5%</div></td></tr><tr><td>RT&Eacute; Two</td><td><div>90% population</div></td><td><div>95%</div></td><td><div>5%</div></td></tr><tr><td>TV3</td><td><div>44% population</div></td><td><div>95%</div></td><td><div>51%</div></td></tr><tr><td>TG4</td><td><div>75% population</div></td><td><div>95%</div></td><td><div>20%</div></td></tr></table></p><p>In relation to SAORSAT in Co. Kerry, RT&Eacute;NL has organised training for installers. On October 1st  ten installers attended a training course in Kerry.  The course was open to any installer and the ones that attended were from areas such as Firies, Killorglin, Kenmare, Killarney, Caherciveen, Beaufort, Waterville and Castleisland.  It was demonstrated how SAORSAT works, the best dish type to use, how to fix the dish correctly and how to point it in the correct direction.  On 22 October RT&Eacute;NL provided a demonstration of SAORSAT to about 60 attendees in Annascaul, County Kerry.  Initial feedback from the meeting was positive.</p><p>Should installers in Kerry have any difficulties installing SAORSAT, they should contact RT&Eacute;NL directly and RT&Eacute;NL will arrange the necessary training.  Further information on SAORSAT is available on <i>www.saorview.ie</i> and <i>www.rtenl.ie</i>.</p><p>In relation to the requirement to have a television licence, section 142(1) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides that &ldquo;....a person shall not keep or have in his possession anywhere in the territory of the state a television set save in so far as such keeping or possession is authorised by a television licence for the time being in force&rdquo;.</p><p>The 2009 Act defines a television set as &ldquo;any electronic apparatus capable of receiving and exhibiting television broadcasting services broadcast for general reception (whether or not its use for that purpose is dependent on the use of anything else in conjunction with it) and any software or assembly comprising such apparatus and other apparatus&rdquo;.</p><p>In effect, this means that, if you own a television set in Ireland, you must have a current television licence for that set.  The requirement to have a TV licence is applied equally to all households in possession of a television set in the State.</p></reply>

The Licensing Options are for a two-year period from 1st March 2011 to 28th February 2013 and specifically exclude exploration drilling.</p><p>  I would like to advise the Deputy that Tamboran Resources Pty Ltd was also awarded a five-year exploration licence by the Northern Ireland authorities over adjacent acreage in Country Fermanagh. </p><p>  With regard to the regulatory process for the use of this technology, I can advise that the European Commission has confirmed that the exploration and exploitation of unconventional hydrocarbons has to comply with the requirements of EU legislation.  A comprehensive legislative framework on environmental protection and access to hydrocarbon resources is already in place and applies to all hydrocarbons, conventional and unconventional from planning to the aftercare of sites following exploitation. The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive plays a central role in the assessment of such applications as it ensures that the environmental implications of projects are taken into account in the permitting process, before decisions are made, and it involves the public in the decision&ndash;making process, making it more transparent.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the existing statutory framework, in October of last year, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources requested the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to conduct research and advise on the environmental implications of hydraulic fracturing as a means of extracting natural gas from underground reserves.</p><p>  In May 2012, the EPA published its preliminary research into the environmental aspects of shale gas extraction in the form of a small desk based study, which was carried out by the University of Aberdeen.  The study provides an introduction to the environmental aspects of fracking including a review of regulatory approaches used in other countries and areas for further investigation and research such as geological principles of relevance in fracking and shale gas extraction, potential environmental impacts and establishing best environmental practice.</p><p>  While the study is a preliminary study it will inform the development of the terms of reference for a much more detailed research study to be commissioned by the EPA later this year.  The terms of reference for this more extensive research are currently being drawn up by a steering group including representatives from the EPA and my Department.  The outcome of the further research to be commissioned by the EPA will assist in a robust scientific based assessment of any future application proposing the use of this technology and I can confirm that until there has been time to consider the second stage of the EPA research, the use of hydraulic fracturing in exploration drilling will not be authorised.</p><p>  With regard to the issues raised by the Deputy with respect to plans for the development of wave energy, I should make clear that there is no contradiction in pursuing a policy of seeking to exploit our indigenous natural gas resources, while at the same time working towards achieving a significant increase in the generation of electricity from renewable energy sources.  As natural gas will continue to be important to electricity generation in Ireland going forward, clearly Ireland would benefit if that natural gas was not imported, but instead came form our own indigenous natural resources.</p></reply>

The EIB has also provided some loans to commercial developers of renewable energy projects in Ireland.  The companies negotiate directly with the EIB themselves and I have no role in the process.</p><p>  To develop the offshore grid sector, in December 2010, Ireland, along with 9 other countries, signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the North Seas Offshore Grid Initiative (NSOGI).  A copy of the Memorandum is available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  The parties agreed they would work towards facilitating strategic, coordinated development of the offshore and onshore grids in the Northern European Seas to ensure more cost effective and sustainable development.</p><p>  Since then, the parties to the agreement have been actively working through a number of working groups on aspects to take forward the goals expressed in the Memorandum. Ireland has been represented on all 3 working groups and has been a co-chair along with the UK of the market and regulatory group.  The Programme Board intends to put a report on the work of the groups to Ministers who are meeting on 3rd December. </p><p>  In October 2011, the European Commission tabled a comprehensive package to enhance trans-European infrastructure development in the areas of transport, energy and information society.  The trans-European energy infrastructure guidelines identify twelve priority corridors and thematic areas that must be implemented in the coming decade to help the EU meet its short and longer term energy and climate objectives.  To translate these corridors and areas into concrete projects, the guidelines include a new way of identifying energy infrastructure projects that can receive the label of Projects of Common Interest (PCI), which are necessary to implement these priority corridors and areas.</p><p>  The NSORI is among 10 priority corridors that have been identified as follows:</p><p>  &ldquo;Northern Seas offshore grid (&ldquo;NSOG&rdquo;): integrated offshore electricity grid in the North Sea, the Irish Sea, the English Channel, the Baltic Sea and neighbouring waters to transport electricity from renewable offshore energy sources to centres of consumption and storage and to increase cross-border electricity exchange.</p><p>  Member States concerned: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom;&rdquo;</p><p>The infrastructure package is currently being negotiated in the EU. Negotiations are expected to conclude by end year with a view to publication of the relevant legislative instruments in 2013.  The final amount of funding available under the energy infrastructure package will be subject to budgetary negotiations and agreement in the context of the EU multi-annual financial framework for 2014-2020.</p></reply>

Better Energy: Homes provides financial assistance to private homeowners who wish to improve the energy performance of their homes.  Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures including attic insulation, wall insulation, heating systems upgrades, solar thermal panels and accompanying BER.  The grants range from &euro;200 for attic insulation to &euro;3,600 for external wall insulation and the average grant value per household in 2012 is &euro;1,100.  Better Energy: Homes is a demand-led programme.  From the start of 2012 to 31st October 2012, the scheme disbursed over &euro;25.9m in grants and supported the installation of almost 64,000 measures in over 23,000 homes.</p><p>Better Energy: Warmer Homes delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to households that are vulnerable to energy poverty and is 100% funded by the Exchequer.  The measures include attic insulation, draught proofing, lower energy light bulbs, energy advice, and cavity wall insulation, when appropriate.  The scheme is managed by the SEAI and delivered through a range of Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage.  From the start of 2012 to 31st  October 2012, the scheme has disbursed over &euro;9.3m in Exchequer funds and supported the delivery of energy efficiency upgrades to over 7,400 homes.</p><p>The following tables provide a breakdown of the number of homes, measures and geographical distribution of grants paid under Better Energy Homes and Better Energy Warmer Homes from January to October 2012.</p><p><b>Table 1</b></p><p><b>Number of homes and measures completed under Better Energy Homes and Better Energy Warmer Homes</b></p><p><b>(Jan - Oct 2012)</b></p><p><table><tr><th>2012 (Jan &#8211; Oct)</th><th><div>Better Energy: Homes</div></th><th><div>Better Energy: Warmer Homes</div></th></tr><tr><td>Homes Completed</td><td><div>23,023</div></td><td><div>7,401</div></td></tr><tr><td>Measures Completed</td><td><div>63,876</div></td><td><div>N/A</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total Spend (&#8364; M)</td><td><div>&#8364;25.9 M</div></td><td><div>&#8364;9.3 M</div></td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 2</b></p><p><b>Breakdown of measures completed under Better Energy Homes (Jan - Oct 2012)</b></p><p><table><tr><th><div>Table 2</div></th><th><div>Roof</div></th><th><div>Walls</div></th><th><div>Heating Systems</div></th><th><div>Solar</div></th><th><div>BER</div></th><th><div>Total</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>Measures Completed</div></td><td><div>15,348</div></td><td><div>17,893</div></td><td><div>5,142</div></td><td><div>1,815</div></td><td><div>23,678</div></td><td><div>63,876</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Total Spend (&#8364; M)</div></td><td><div>&#8364;3.103</div></td><td><div>&#8364;17.107</div></td><td><div>&#8364;2.829</div></td><td><div>&#8364;1.453</div></td><td><div>&#8364;1.501</div></td><td><div>&#8364;25.992</div></td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 3</b></p><p><b>Number of homes by County completed under Better Energy Homes and Better Energy Warmer Homes</b></p><p><b>(Jan - Oct 2012)</b></p><p><table><tr><th> County</th><th><div>Better Energy : Homes</div></th><th><div>Better Energy : Warmer Homes</div></th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td><div>220</div></td><td><div>110</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td><div>398</div></td><td><div>161</div></td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td><div>902</div></td><td><div>194</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td><div>3,856</div></td><td><div>854</div></td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td><div>538</div></td><td><div>384</div></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td><div>4,387</div></td><td><div>1,146</div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td><div>1,794</div></td><td><div>221</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td><div>923</div></td><td><div>393</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td><div>638</div></td><td><div>101</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td><div>401</div></td><td><div>115</div></td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td><div>331</div></td><td><div>61</div></td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td><div>155</div></td><td><div>187</div></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td><div>1,527</div></td><td><div>450</div></td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td><div>155</div></td><td><div>106</div></td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td><div>539</div></td><td><div>38</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td><div>834</div></td><td><div>525</div></td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td><div>592</div></td><td><div>128</div></td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td><div>363</div></td><td><div>160</div></td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td><div>289</div></td><td><div>165</div></td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td><div>315</div></td><td><div>201</div></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td><div>314</div></td><td><div>185</div></td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td><div>997</div></td><td><div>427</div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td><div>1,065</div></td><td><div>308</div></td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td><div>335</div></td><td><div>166</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td><div>717</div></td><td><div>510</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td><div>438</div></td><td><div>105</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td><div>23,023</div></td><td><div>7,401</div></td></tr></table></p><p>Future plans for the Better Energy Programme will be taken in the context of the Estimates provision for 2013 for my Department which will be decided in the context of Budget 2013.</p></reply>

Under the Act, and the related Social Housing Assessment Regulations, 2011, a new standard procedure for assessing applicants for social housing was introduced in every housing authority.  The Regulations contain, among other eligibility criteria, maximum income limits, which were subsequently amended upwards by the Social Housing Assessment (Amendment) Regulations 2011.  The income bands contained therein refer to the net income of households, that is , net of income tax, PRSI and the Universal Social Charge.  The maximum limits are &#8364;35,000, &#8364;30,000 and &#8364;25,000 for a single-person household, depending on the local authority area concerned, with additional allowances based on each additional adult or child in the household. </p><p>  These provisions, taken together, provide a reasonable basis for ensuring that households on low incomes have access to social housing support. Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.  The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this aim.</p><p>  The terms and conditions governing the operation, including eligibility terms, of annuity mortgages and the Home Choice Loan are set out under the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2009 and the Housing (Home Choice Loan) Regulations 2009 respectively.  These are available on my Department&#8217;s website: .  Access to credit is just one of a number of reasons for the low level of transactions in the housing market at present and wider economic sentiment is also impact ing on sentiment in the housing market. </p><p>  It is not the intention of these mortgage schemes &#8211; or of any other Government intervention in the housing sector &#8211; to incentivise or entice people into the market.  These schemes are designed only to facilitate credit worthy households who have been affected by conditions in the mortgage market.  The Home Choice Loan scheme is a temporary one which will be withdrawn once conditions in credit markets return to normal patterns. Recent data published by the Central Bank would indicate that that point has not yet been reached.</p></reply>

Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the Household Charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver. Residential property is defined in the Act as a building that is occupied or suitable for occupation as a separate dwelling.  Participation in an equity release scheme by a liable owner who is in receipt of a pension is not among the exemptions or waivers provided for in the Act.</p><p>  The exemptions from payment of the Household Charge are: </p><p>-	 Residential properties that are part of the trading stock of a business and have not been sold or been the source of any income since construction;  </p><p>  - 	 Residential property owned by a Minister of the Government, a housing authority or the Health Service Executive;</p><p>  - 	 Voluntary and co-operative housing;</p><p>  -	 Residential property subject to commercial rates and wholly used as a dwelling;</p><p>  -  	 Residential property owned by certain charities or discretionary trusts; and,</p><p>  -  	Residential property which an owner has vacated due to long-term mental or physical infirmity (e.g. elderly person that has moved into a nursing home). </p><p>The waivers which apply concern: </p><p>  -  	Owners of residential property entitled to mortgage interest supplement; and,</p><p>  - 	Owners of houses in certain unfinished housing estates.</p><p>The Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) is administering the Household Charge system on a shared service/agency basis for all county and city councils.  Instalment payments were available by direct debit only and persons opting to pay in this way had to register their details with the LGMA before 1 March 2012.  This deadline was necessary in order to meet banking requirements for direct debit arrangements.</p><p>  I have not issued any instructions to local authorities concerning staged payments of the Household Charge.  While there is no provision relating to ability to pay included in the Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011, the Act does place collection of the charge under the care and management of local authorities and application in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority. </p></reply>

My Department&#8217;s role is to provide a comprehensive legislative and waste policy framework through which the enforcement authorities, such as the City Council, operate.  Penalties available under the Litter Pollution Acts for litter offences range from an on-the-spot fine of &#8364;150, to a maximum fine of &#8364;3,000 on summary conviction, and a maximum fine of &#8364;130,000 on conviction on indictment. The maximum fines for continuing offences are &#8364;600 per day for summary offences and &#8364;10,000 per day for indictable offences.  A person convicted of a litter offence may also be required by the court to pay the local authority&#8217;s costs and expenses in investigating the offence and bringing the prosecution.</p><p>  Penalties for more serious dumping offences available under the Waste Management Acts are also substantial.  Persons who are found to be responsible for, or involved in, the unauthorised disposal of waste are liable to a maximum fine of &#8364;3,000 on summary conviction and/or imprisonment for up to 12 months, and to a maximum fine of &#8364;15 million on conviction on indictment and/or imprisonment for up to 10 years.  It is at the discretion of the local authorities, which have responsibilities for enforcement of both the Litter Pollution Act and the Waste Management Act, to decide whether a specific incident warrants the application of either Act.</p><p>Notwithstanding the very significant penalties outlined above, I am currently considering the introduction to the Waste Management Act of an on-the-spot fine for incidences of fly tipping/small scale illegal dumping, of a significantly higher quantum than that which exists under the Litter Pollution Act.</p><p>My Department has also recently run an anti-dumping campaign in the print media to raise awareness of the value of our countryside both environmentally and economically.  The campaign includes the contact details for the National Environmental Complaints hotline (1850 365 121) to encourage the reporting of instances of illegal dumping.  I believe that the combined efforts of the public, communities, local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency will produce a reduction in such instances and result in a cleaner countryside.</p><p>In July 2012, I published <i>A Resource Opportunity - Waste Management Policy in Ireland</i>.  This policy sets out a range of measures which will significantly revise the current regulatory regime to ensure, inter alia, that waste collected is managed in accordance with the waste hierarchy; that mandated service levels are delivered; and that Customer Charters are put in place by all waste collection providers.  Customer Charters will be required to clearly set out information for customers in relation to issues such as charging structures, procedures for dealing with customers who may fall into arrears, and arrangements for switching from one waste collector to another.  I have written to the waste management industry in relation to the development of such Customer Charters ahead of the development of the new regulatory regime.</p><p>  The work of developing new regulatory structures to give effect to these measures has commenced and my Department has begun engaging with a range of key stakeholders in relation to the detailed design of the new system.  It is my intention that the improved regulatory regime will aid local authorities to deliver both enhanced environmental performance and to ensure a quality service for consumers.</p></reply>

Pending the enactment of the legislation, my Department will be working with the local authorities to progress aspects of the metering programme including the carrying out of surveys of domestic connections.  The intention is that the public will be informed of the surveying through advertisements in local and regional newspapers, on local authorities&rsquo; websites and other media including radio in advance of the surveying commencing.  As the surveying will involve an examination of the service connection located at the perimeter of the property, there will be no requirement to seek access to individual houses.  The surveying work will be carried out by local authority staff.   </p><p>  The installation of water meters is due to commence in 2013.  Installation contracts will be awarded by Irish Water to private contractors who will be responsible for recruiting appropriately trained personnel to carry out the installation. </p></reply>

These SECs will assume many of the local and community development responsibilities of City/County Development Boards (CDBs) and they will be responsible for planning and overseeing all local and community development activity at local level.  It is envisaged that these new arrangements will deliver a more co-ordinated approach locally to identifying the needs of communities and citizens, and targeting resources in the most effective way to meet those needs. SECs will be established on a public-private partnership basis and will bring a broad range of socio-economic interests together in collaboration and co-operation at local level.  The exact membership of SECs is yet to be finalised but would generally comprise representatives of local government, other appropriate State agencies and local and community interests, including representatives of civil society and social and economic partners.   </p><p>  The <i>Action Programme for Effective Local Government</i> provides for the gradual wind down of City/County Development Boards (CDBs).  There is no longer sufficient rationale for the continued operation of CDBs, in view of the proposed introduction of SECs with planning and oversight responsibility for local/community development programmes, the establishment of Local Enterprise Offices that will provide a local enterprise support service, and the development of a broader, more direct role for local authorities in economic development generally.   </p></reply>

Work on the review is almost complete and I intend to issue a policy statement on homelessness shortly.  That statement will take account of demands on existing housing and will assess how best to continue providing services in a manner consistent with the elimination of existing homelessness and to ensure more effective prevention strategies.  On its conclusion, I will be indicating what I expect from housing authorities and other stakeholders in accelerating progress towards realising the ambition of eliminating involuntary long-term homelessness.  However, much progress has been made in otherwise implementing the strategy including <i>inter alia</i>  :</p><p>-the publication of a detailed Implementation Plan in April 2009, which set out a range of priority actions to be undertaken to deliver on the six strategic aims of the Strategy;   </p><p>-new legislative provisions in the Housing Act 2009 that came into force on 1 February 2010, which put Homelessness Fora and Homelessness Action Plans on a statutory basis, and are now being implemented at regional and local level;   </p><p>-the adoption in 2010 by the 34 City and County Councils of their statutory Homelessness Action Plans;   </p><p>-annual provision of current funding to provide for sufficient bed capacity to accommodate all those in need of emergency accommodation nationwide and to deliver on the commitment to eliminate the need for persons involuntarily to sleep rough;   </p><p>-  the on-going reconfiguration of existing emergency or transitional homeless facilities to provide a substantial number of secure long-term tenancies for homeless persons;</p><p>-the development of a scheme,<i> Support to Live Independently,</i>  to provide visiting supports for persons leaving homelessness which assists people to progress from homelessness to independent living in mainstream housing and forms an important element of follow up action to end long-term homelessness, by co-ordinating appropriate tenancy and other supports to meet each individuals&#8217; needs in their local community setting; and</p><p>  -the new homelessness on-line data and bed management system, PASS, which is operational in Dublin and is being extended nationally on a phased basis with work currently underway in other regions. </p><p>  The National Implementation Plan for the Homeless Strategy also provides for the development of a more devolved allocation-based system for the provision of accommodation-related funding to housing authorities with emphasis on increased decision making at local level, in lieu of the existing individual project based arrangements, to improve overall efficiency, value for money and greater local decision making in homeless services. </p><p>A Protocol has been put in place with Dublin City Council to provide delegation of responsibility in relation to the management of homelessness funding. Similar arrangements are being put in place in respect of the other statutory homelessness regions.   </p><p>My Department&#8217;s current funding provision for the running costs of homeless accommodation and related services for 2012 is &#8364;50 million, which, together with 10% provided from housing authorities&#8217; own resources, brings the total available funding to &#8364;55.55 million in 2012. This level of funding means that there will be no reduction in the provision of essential frontline support services.</p></reply>

Within that framework, local returning officers are responsible for all matters in connection with the actual conduct of elections and referendums, including the selection, appointment and training of polling station and count staff in accordance with the relevant provisions of electoral law. </p><p>  My Department issues guidance to Returning Officers in advance of each election and referendum.  The guidance emphasises that the smooth conduct of polls is dependent on maintaining a cadre of sufficiently skilled and experienced people.  Having regard to that overall objective, returning officers are advised to employ competent and efficient persons as polling staff and asked to give consideration, where possible, to employing suitable persons who are unemployed. </p><p>  In addition, at my request, my Department wrote to each Returning Officer on 4 October 2012, advising that, wherever practicable, the opportunity should be taken to employ unemployed persons at polling stations and in carrying out the subsequent counting of votes at elections and referendums so as to provide opportunity for work experience to unemployed persons.  I believe that this should apply particularly in relation to the Polling Clerk position, where the responsibilities of the post can be fulfilled under the guidance of the Presiding Officer.  Following the referendum on 10 November 2012, my Department will be writing to Returning Officers to ascertain the extent to which unemployed persons were engaged on that occasion and with a view to working with Returning Officers to address issues arising.   </p></reply>

My Department and individual local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that mortgage lending is prudentially based and that the capacity of a borrower fully to service a loan over the full term is realistically assessed and stress-tested. Provisions governing mortgage lending by local authorities are set out under the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2012 and associated credit policy. </p><p>  The regulations provide for an upper age limit for borrowers of 70 years and a maximum loan term of 30 years. The age limit implies that borrowers over 40 must have a shorter loan period which impacts on their monthly costs of borrowing. In these instances, capacity to repay over the shorter period rather than the age of the applicant is a determining factor in respect of a loan application.</p><p>  Persons in receipt of social welfare payments are not specifically precluded from purchasing their home under any tenant purchase scheme. However, if the applicants are applying to fund the purchase through loan finance from the local authority they must meet the criteria which apply to such loans. While, as a general rule, the credit policy provides that loans are not available to those in receipt of unemployment/social welfare benefits, an exception may be made where there is a primary income of a permanent waged/salaried nature and where the secondary income is from the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>  In such cases long term social welfare payments can be considered, provided the long term nature of the payment is confirmed. The final decision on whether to grant/refuse an applicant lies solely with the relevant local authority. All local authorities must satisfy themselves on the financial risk they are undertaking.   However, the relevance of the difference between projected mortgage repayments and current rental payments for a prospective purchaser is very limited. It takes no account, for example, of the fact that while rent levels can be adjusted to reflect changing household income, mortgage repayments cannot. Nor does it take account of the additional costs taken on when a household becomes a homeowner thereby assuming responsibility for the on-going maintenance of the home. </p></reply>

There was no existing comprehensive database of residential properties and their owners within the State prior to the Household Charge being introduced. The collection of the Household Charge via self-assessment declaration provides for the collation of such information in relation to residential property and will be an essential component for implementing a full local property tax. Local authorities are continuing to identify undeclared properties through appropriate data sharing provisions, and significant efforts have been expended in matching self-declared information with other datasets and in refining the resulting data.</p><p>  I also understand that the addresses and names used in the current batch of letters which are being issued by Local Authorities reminding people to pay the Household Charge have been based on a data matching exercise with the Property Registration Authority.  I understand that every effort has been made to try and ensure letters are sent to current property owners. However there are some instances where letters are being sent to previous owners of properties, due to the fact that the more recent property owners may not have registered their property with the Authority or the transfer of the property has not been completed. Thus in some cases the information contained within these datasets may not reflect the most recent and relevant details. As a consequence, the data matching exercise can give rise to situations in which people may receive a letter where they have already paid the charge. Due to differences in the formats of addresses between datasets, it has also been the case that some owners who have paid the charge are receiving reminder letters.   </p><p>  In other instances, letters have unfortunately been sent to deceased persons. I appreciate that receipt of such a letter may cause upset to relatives of a deceased person. However, in the absence of a comprehensive database, such instances, while regrettable, are also unavoidable if the Agency and local authorities are to continue their work in maximising compliance with a charge which funds essential local services for communities.  I understand that the letters which issued in recent weeks invite recipients who are not liable, or who have previously paid the household charge, or in the event of inaccuracy or error, to contact the Household Charge Bureau to allow the Agency to update their records accordingly.   </p></reply>

Where vacancies arise, local authorities, or approved housing bodies, have 3 months to re-let the unit. Where a new tenant is not in place within that 3 month period, recoupment under both schemes ceases until such time as a tenant is in situ.

The number of active approved housing bodies is considerably lower and 443 bodies have completed one or more than one housing project yielding a total of 25,363 housing units to date.</p><p>  In September 2009 the Centre for Housing Research published   the <i>Strategic Review of the Capital Funding Schemes for Voluntary and Co-operative Housing</i> by   Grant Thornton and Fitzpatrick Associates . The report recommended, <i>inter alia</i> , that the status of bodies in the voluntary and co-operative housing sector   be reviewed and, specifically, that approved housing b odies (AHBs) that have never received funding should have their approved status reviewed and withdrawn if appropriate, for example if the approved body never was, or is no longer, active.  My Department has recently rescinded the approved housing body designation of more than 80 inactive bodies that have also been wound-up with the Companies Registration Office. A further cohort of approved housing bodies, that appear to be inactive , is currently under examination and I expect to de-list more bodies in 2013 in order to present a more accurate picture of the size of the sector operating in Ireland.   </p></reply>

The 2012 Regulations prescribes a list of all such developments, which are based on a number of factors, including whether the development is in receivership, whether the developer is active, and:</p><p>  -	The state of completion of roads, footpaths, public lighting facilities, piped water and sewerage facilities and open spaces or similar amenities within the development;</p><p>-	  The extent to which the development complies with the terms of applicable planning permission;</p><p>-	The extent to which it complies with the provisions of the Building Control Acts 1990 and 2007;   </p><p>  -	The provisions of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1964 as they pertain to dangerous places and dangerous structures within the meaning of the Act;</p><p>  	The extent to which facilities within the development have been taken in charge by the local authority concerned; and,</p><p>-	  Where there is an agreement regarding the maintenance of such facilities, the extent to which this agreement has been complied with. </p><p>My Department has been working closely with the Local Authorities to have available a revised list of estates for 2013. Again, this will refer to relevant factors such as completion of roads, footpaths, public lighting facilities, piped water and sewerage facilities and open spaces or similar amenities within the development.  If any owners of homes in an unfinished housing estate, as specified in the 2012 Regulations and therefore entitled to a waiver under the 2011 Act, have been issued, in error, with late payment penalty notices I advise them to contact the Household Charge Bureau or their local authority to resolve the matter.   </p></reply>

A programme of work in this area is guided by the North South Market Development Steering Group with assistance from the Department&rsquo;s Market Development Programme.</p><p>-	Carrying out the Department&rsquo;s role as Accountable Department under the PEACE 111 and Interreg IVA Programmes.   </p><p>Engagement on the foregoing issues involves many officials in my Department at Assistant Secretary, Principal Officer, Assistant Principal Officer, Higher Executive Officer, Executive Officer and Clerical Officer levels spread across a number of business units. The degree of engagement by each individual or grade is determined by the frequency of Council meetings and the requirement to pursue our objectives through meetings of a number of North South working groups and committees.</p><p>  The Department operates within the staffing levels set by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform through the implementation of the Employment Control Framework and the moratorium on filling of vacancies by recruitment or promotion. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that the business units concerned are adequately staffed to discharge their North South and other responsibilities.   </p></reply>

This figure continuously fluctuates as households are allocated housing and new households apply for housing support. Detailed information on the latest statutory assessment of housing need, carried out in March 2011 and including a breakdown by housing authority, is available on my Department&#8217;s website &#8211; <font color="#0000FF">o</font>r on the Housing Agency&#8217;s website at .   My Department intends to carry a full Housing Needs Assessment in 2013, and will publish the results as soon as possible thereafter.  In terms of the delivery of social housing, the Government&#8217;s housing policy statement, published in June 2011, clearly identifies that the priority for Government will be to meet the most acute needs of households applying for social housing support.</p><p>  Delivery of social housing has been significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&#8217;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).   </p><p>The Department recently advised Kerry County Council that funding will provided for the construction of three single instance rural dwellings over the period 2012 to 2014. Capital allocations to Kerry County Council under the range of measures under the social housing investment programme in 2013 will be considered in the context of the budgetary provision for housing for 2013.</p><p>  I refer to the reply to Questions Nos 53 of 23 October and 440 of 16 of October respectively, for the most up to date information in relation to the delivery of NAMA units generally and in relation to units in Kerry in particular.   </p></reply>

The National Co-ordination Committee on Unfinished Housing Developments (NCC), which I chair, is charged with overseeing the implementation of the Report of the Advisory Group on Unfinished Housing Developments, together with the Government&rsquo;s response to the recommendations. The NCC includes representatives from the Irish Banking Federation, local authorities, the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, NAMA and the construction sector and real progress is being made with regard to the public safety works required to improve the living conditions of existing residents on some unfinished estates.</p><p>  The NCC was established in June 2011 and has met on 9 occasions, and a Progress Report was published in July 2012.  Under the Public Safety Initiative (PSI), my Department has made allocations totalling some &euro;3.549 million to 21 local authorities from the funding made available to address immediate public safety issues in 2011. The types of works that have been approved to date under the PSI include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting and other works to secure sites.  A provision of &euro;2m has been made for 2012 by my Department and to date, a total of &euro;1.897 million has been drawn down by local authorities.</p><p>  I anticipate that the progress made in tackling the challenges faced by residents of unfinished housing developments will be reflected in the 2012 National Housing Development Survey which was conducted over the summer months. This Survey report, which I expect to publish by the end of November, should provide a clear picture of the progress which has been made to date in tackling the issues surrounding unfinished housing developments.   </p></reply>

These savings have been achieved to date primarily from areas such as staffing and procurement and I expect that further efficiency savings will continue to accrue in these areas and also into the future following the examination of a shared services approach across a number of programmes, particularly in relation to treasury management, transactional HR, shared payroll systems, and ICT back office functions. This estimate does not include any reductions in expenditure due to reduced activity.</p><p>  The focus of the Group is on furthering efficiency gains and in this context, it is working closely with the local government sector in examining a wide range of business processes that could yield significant efficiency savings should they be delivered through a shared services or a lead authority approach.

It concluded, inter alia, that it is important that the rollout of the FixYourStreet initiative is beneficial to all local authorities; that it should avoid significant fiscal or staffing cost being incurred by local authorities in its operation and that it should be integrated with local business processes. The Group also recommended that where re-engineering of processes is required that this should be done with the intention of driving down overall administrative costs and optimising the customer service function.</p><p>  I am advised that six local authorities, South Dublin, Fingal, Galway and Kildare County Councils together with Dublin and Waterford City Councils have gone live on the <i>FixYourStreet </i>website. I am also advised that another 21 local authorities will go live shortly.</p><p>  The <i>FixYourStreet</i> website assist s residents in reporting problems with street lighting, drainage, graffiti, waste collection and road and path maintenance in their neighbourhoods, with a guarantee that the authority will respond within two working days. It incorporates interactive mapping, allowing users to locate on an online map the precise location of the problem or issue being reported.</p></reply>

It is a generally accepted principle internationally, and one which Ireland applies, that a person should seek asylum in the first safe host country in which they arrive.  The granting of refugee status in Ireland is considered in accordance with the definition contained in the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, as amended by the 1967 New York Protocol thereto, and as defined in section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended).  Any Syrian national who arrives in the State and who seeks protection will have his or her application considered in the context of the above mentioned legal framework.

The property is leased by the Office of Public Works (OPW) at a cost of &#8364;996,164 per annum.</p><p>  The lease for this accommodation expires in March 2013 and staff will have to be re-located before the expiry of the lease.  The PRA has been in continuing discussions with the OPW to finalise the proposed location of staff. The OPW are now looking at a suitable location. However, it is unlikely that the proposed location will be sufficient to accommodate all the staff currently located in the Setanta Centre and some staff will have to be re-located to the PRA's Chancery Street offices.</p><p>Following the Government Review on the viability of all decentralisation projects, it was decided, in the case of the Property Registration Authority, that the Authority should remain in situ in the new premises located at the Golf Links Road in Roscommon. The building was originally designed to accommodate 230. The number of PRA staff currently located in the Roscommon building is 77. Due to a number of factors the PRA has not been in a position to locate the planned number of staff in this building. These include the moratorium on recruitment, a proposed redeployment programme and the ongoing reduction in staff numbers required under the Employment Control Framework (ECF). In view of these circumstances, the PRA has been working with the Office of Public Works to   <font color="#2F2F2F">ensure the optimum utilisation of the accommodation by other suitable public sector occupants.</font></p><p>  For some months now, a small number of staff from the Roscommon Enterprise Board has been occupying part of the accommodation.  Approximately 50 staff from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are scheduled to re-locate to the Golf Links Road building in the early part of December 2012. The PRA will continue to work with the OPW to seek opportunities to fully maximise the occupancy of this building.</p></reply>

My most recent reply to Parliamentary Question 42802/12 on 9 October last is reproduced for the Deputy's information.</p><p><i>While I am not averse in principle to the establishment of an immigration regime specifically geared to the technology sector, it would have to be on the basis that there was concrete evidence of a particular skills deficit in the labour market that cannot be filled by Irish or EU citizens.  That labour market assessment would ultimately be a matter for my colleague the Minister for Jobs Enterprise and Innovation.  In this regard it should be borne in mind that the technology sector spans a broad range of skills with differing levels of supply and demand.</i></p><p><i>I would also envisage that applicants for any such programmes would be subject to a rigorous assessment of their qualifications and experience to ensure that their skill sets are appropriate for the sector in question.</i></p><p><i>In any event, the existing visa application arrangements are entirely flexible and designed to cater for the widest possible range of applicants who may wish to come here as workers, visitors, professionals and so forth.</i></p><p>  While I appreciate that the term &quot;Technology Visa&quot; is in common usage in respect of this issue, that description is somewhat misleading.  In reality what we are talking about here are employment permits and any person who is successful in obtaining such a permit can reasonably expect to be granted immigration status on foot of it.  My Department and the Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation are also working together to see how our collective processes can be streamlined.</p></reply>

I want to make it clear that I have been assured by the Garda authorities that if the incident referred to is reported to them it will be fully investigated, as would any such reports, in accordance with relevant legislation and having regard to the Garda Diversity Strategy which encourages victims to come forward to report race and hate crimes.</p><p>  There are significant provisions in the Criminal Law in place which Garda&iacute; may utilise in relation to investigations in this area. In particular, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 was enacted to prohibit incitement to hatred on account of race, religion, nationality or sexual orientation. Furthermore, section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 provides that any person who, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, by any means including by use of the telephone, harasses another by persistently following, watching, pestering, besetting or communicating with him or her, shall be guilty of the offence of harassment. In addition, section 5 of that Act makes it an offence for any person, without lawful excuse, to make to another a threat, by any means intending the other to believe it will be carried out, to kill or cause serious harm to that other or a third person.</p><p>  Any complaint of alleged on-line abuse, bullying or harassment is fully investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Computer Crime Investigation Unit is available to assist local Garda officers in the investigation of alleged offences.  Bullying in any form may amount to an assault or harassment and I therefore urge anyone subjected to bullying of whatever variety to contact the Garda&iacute;.</p><p>  I can also inform the Deputies  that assistance is available from a number of sources to help those affected by cyberbullying. The Safer Internet Ireland project is coordinated by the Office for Internet Safety in my Department. The body now called Technology in Education under the remit of the Professional Development service for Teachers (formerly known as the National Centre for Technology in Education) participates in the project. It operates www.webwise.ie which provides advice and information to parents and teachers.  The ISPCC and the National Parents Council (Primary) also participate.  Both organisations offer assistance through their confidential telephone helplines on how to deal with cyberbullying.  The Office for Internet Safety itself supplies very useful guides, including &quot;A Parents Guide to Social Networking Sites&quot; and &quot;A Guide to Cyberbullying&quot;.</p></reply>

The Private Security Services Act 2004 (as amended) sets out the activities in the private security industry which are, or will be, subject to licensing.</p><p>  Since the 1st October 2012, contractors providing security services in the access control and CCTV sectors require a licence from the PSA. I am informed by the Authority that contractors seeking a licence are required to provide a valid tax clearance certificate, evidence of having obtained a standard endorsed by the Authority and a certificate of incorporation, if applicable. The standard required for the access control sector is SR 40:2005 - an Irish Standard Recommendation for electronic security services.  For CCTV, both the SR 40 standard and PSA 2006:12 are required, the latter being the Authority's requirements for CCTV installation.  In addition, all sole traders, partners, company directors and shareholders with a holding of 5% or more are vetted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na before a licence issues.</p><p>  Contractors such as those in the access control and CCTV sectors are required to pay a licence fee to the Authority and the Deputy may wish to note that an instalment payment option to assist contractors with paying for their licence has already been introduced.  The PSA's licence fee structure is monitored by the Authority on a regular basis and I am advised that the Board of the Authority is, in fact, currently reviewing the licence fee structure and will consider it at its next meeting.</p></reply>

I am informed that as it appeared that the children have been residing in the State since 2007 without the appropriate permission to do so, the immigration service wrote to the person concerned on 19 April 2012 requesting documentation and information regarding the circumstances of her children's arrival in the State.  Some documentation was supplied in May of 2012, but the issue of the children's entry into the State was not adequately addressed. On foot of the receipt of a letter dated 16 October last from the legal representative of the mother concerned, she has again been requested to reply comprehensively to the queries raised by INIS last April. Upon receipt of the requested documentation and information, the case of the children concerned will be examined with a view to deciding on their future status in the State. Once a decision has been made, the decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

On 28 October 2012, RIA was providing accommodation for 4,917 persons in 36 centres located in 17 counties.</p><p>  The Value for Money Report and Policy Review - Asylum Seeker Accommodation Programme, published in 2010 - which was laid before the Oireachtas and is available on the Oireachtas website and RIA's website  <i>www.ria.gov.ie</i>  - indicated that the RIA should strive to keep its occupancy levels at 90% or more of its available capacity. The Report accepted that it is not possible for RIA to achieve 100% occupancy - due to family configuration, sickness requiring isolation, and so on.</p><p>  Given the current downward trend in the number of asylum seekers requiring accommodation, when a contract comes up for renewal a decision has to be made to seek to reduce its capacity, including adjusting capacity across a group of related centres, or to close it. RIA makes every effort to keep family centres open, preferring instead to reduce contracted capacities.  In some cases, because of economies of scale, a reduction in capacity is not an option and a centre has to close. This was the case with Lisbrook House in Galway which is in the process of being closed down. Another three centres have already closed down in 2012.  All of these closures, coupled with capacity reductions in 11 other centres, will provide a total reduction of 618 beds from the portfolio.  These reductions will enable RIA, based on current occupancy levels, to stay within the 10% spare capacity target recommended by the VFM report and will provide commensurate financial savings for the State both this year and in 2013.  RIA has no plans for further closures in 2012.</p><p>  RIA acknowledges that the closure of a centre can be disruptive for the residents concerned, particularly in the case of family centres.  The situation in 2013 will require constant monitoring to ensure that no more accommodation than is needed is being paid for.  If centres have to be either downsized or closed altogether I am informed by RIA that every attempt will be made to minimise disruption as far as practicable.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce a Bill that is in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Bill is at an advanced stage of drafting. Work is ongoing to properly align the provisions of the Bill with the principles contained in the UN Convention on supporting people with impaired capacity in making decisions and exercising their basic rights. I envisage that the title of the Bill will reflect this approach.</p><p>  In addition, an Inter-Departmental Committee on the UNCRPD monitors the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification.  At the Committee's request, the National Disability Authority, the lead statutory agency for the sector, are in the process of assisting the Committee to assess the remaining requirements for ratification so as to ensure conclusively that all such issues will be addressed.</p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that the UNCRPD will be ratified as quickly as possible once all the necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention have been met.</p></reply>

The Working Group also recommended that periodic payment orders should only be made where the court is satisfied that continuity of payment under the periodic payments order is reasonably secure.</i></p><p><i>  The successful operation of a statutory scheme for periodic payments requires the establishment of a financial infrastructure to ensure that continuity of payment is secure. In this regard the Working Group recommended that the State, through the agency of the National Treasury Management Agency, be empowered to provide injured victims with the necessary security for periodic payments either by the provision of annuities to insurers and others or in such other manner as may be appropriate. Alternatively it was recommended that consideration be given to the introduction of a statutory scheme whereby payments made under periodic payment orders will be statutorily protected and guaranteed. The NTMA has concluded an actuarial review on the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the State acting as an annuity provider to insurers and indemnity providers in personal injury actions to enable compliance with the security of payment principle. The NTMA report is being considered in consultation with the Minister for Finance with a view to the development of legislative proposals.&quot;</i></p></reply>

Section 12 provides for an inquiry to be held by a prison governor if a prisoner is alleged to have committed a breach of discipline. The governor will record the finding and the sanction, or record that the allegation was unsubstantiated. Section 13 lists the sanctions that may be imposed.</p><p>  Under Section 14, a prisoner who is found by a governor to have committed a breach of prison discipline and on whom a sanction under Section 13 has been imposed, may within 7 days of its imposition, submit a petition to me. I can then either affirm, modify, suspend or revoke the sanction imposed.</p><p>  Prior to March 2012 the record of each disciplinary inquiry was retained on each individual prisoner file. Therefore, it is not possible to provide the Deputy with the information prior to March as this would require the manual examination of individual records to determine the number who were specifically sanctioned for 56 days. Such an examination would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and can not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.</p><p>  However, a new Prisoner Information Management  System (PIMS) came into operation in all prisons at the beginning of March 2012 and all disciplinary inquiries are now recorded on this system. Accordingly, I can confirm that since the 2nd March 2012 to date a total of 282 prisoners were subjected to a sanction of 56 days loss of privileges as a disciplinary punishment. The entitlements which are withdrawn during this punishment period include all or part of the following; loss of gym facilities, tuck shop, personal phone calls, personal visits excluding family, receiving or sending personal letters and loss of evening recreation.</p><p>  The Deputy may be aware the Irish Prison Service has recently introduced  new Guidelines on the Imposition of Disciplinary Sanctions in Accordance with the Prison Rules 2007 to provide uniformity in the use of disciplinary sanctions and procedures throughout the Irish Prison Service. Under these guidelines prisoners should not lose the right to communicate with their families and the loss of family visits is not employed as a sanction in response to a breach of prison discipline. </p></reply>

In the overall context I am very pleased that arrangements have been put in place, with special funding being made available for that purpose, to allow the Garda authorities to purchase a significant number of new vehicles.  This has been done at a time of severe budgetary constrains and it represents a substantial investment in Garda transport.  I have no doubt that the provision of the additional 170 vehicles, which will be commissioned in December/January, will considerably strengthen the overall effectiveness of the Force in delivering a policing service throughout the country.</p><p>  The allocation of Garda transport is a matter for the Garda Commissioner in the context of his operational requirements.  In turn, at Garda Divisional level, the allocation of Garda vehicles is a matter for the Chief Superintendent who may make and revise arrangements for the deployment of vehicles throughout a Division in response to policing demands. This flexibility in allocating and re-allocating vehicles among stations, so as to best match resources with policing priorities, is crucial  to the efficient management of the Garda fleet.  </p><p>  I am assured by the Garda authorities that the deployment of all vehicles is subject to on-going analysis and review to ensure that available resources are allocated throughout the Force to meet policing demands as efficiently as possible, including the policing requirements of rural communities.</p></reply>

The system was launched by myself and the Garda Commissioner on 25 May, 2012, International Missing Children Day.</p><p>  CRI Alerts may be initiated by an Assistant Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when the following criteria are met: 1. The child is under the age of eighteen years; 2. There is a reasonable belief that the child has been abducted; 3. There is a reasonable belief that there is an immediate and serious risk to the health or welfare of a child; and 4. There is sufficient information available to enable the public to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in locating the child.</p><p>  The Garda Missing Persons Bureau, which is responsible for all data relating to missing persons, provides expert assistance and advice in all high risk missing persons cases.  The Garda authorities are satisfied that adequate resources, including staff and technology, are in place to deal with this issue and investigations are carried out in line with best international practice.  The services of Interpol and Europol can also be availed of during such investigations, if necessary.</p><p>  The relevant legislation relating to abduction in this State is to be found in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  Section 16 of the Act provides for an offence of abduction of a child by a parent where it is an offence for a person to take, send or keep a child under the age of 16 years out of the State<b></b>  or cause a child to be so taken in defiance of a court order or without the consent of each person who is a parent, guardian or a person granted custody of the child by a court unless a court has consented.  This section does not apply to a parent who is not a guardian of the child.  Section 17 of the Act provides for an offence of abduction of a child by other persons, where a person other than a person to whom section 16 applies, to intentionally take or detain a child under 16 years of age or cause such a child to be taken or detained, in order to remove the child from, or keep the child out of, the lawful control of any person having such control.  The legislation in this regard is being kept under ongoing review.</p></reply>

These persons included those whose applications for asylum were refused as well as those who were in breach of the provisions of immigration legislation.<br /><br />  In addition during 2011, just under 3,700 refusals of entry into the State for one or more reason in respect of 2,768 persons were recorded by the Garda National Immigration Bureau at airports and other ports of entry to the State. The number of persons removed under this category, excluding those who having been refused entry subsequently claimed asylum, together with other persons who were transferred under the Dublin Regulation to the EU member state in which they first applied for asylum and EU nationals who were returned to their countries of origin on foot of an EU Removal Order was 2,719.<br /><br />  In all cases, removals from the State, whether in respect of those who are removed on arrival at ports of entry or those already in the State, are conducted in accordance with the law. Removals are essentially operational matters for the Garda National Immigration Bureau who work closely with immigration officials of my Department in arranging the necessary travel documents and other papers required. In keeping with standard practice in other jurisdictions, some individuals are escorted to their country of origin or to a connecting hub. Chartered aircraft as well as scheduled commercial aircraft and ferries are used to effect removals.<br /><br />  The removal of illegal immigrants from the State is a necessary feature of the enforcement of immigration legislation with the purpose of upholding the integrity of the immigration system. In enforcing the law in this respect, Ireland is no different from other countries who also remove individuals who have no lawful right to remain within their territory.</blockquote>The principal nationalities of persons refused leave to enter the State and subsequently removed were China, Brazil, Bolivia, South Africa, Albania and Nigeria.</p></reply>

Over 270,000 applications have been processed so far this year.  Over the past few years the numbers of cases has risen from 218,404 in 2008 to 315,100 in 2011. The expected out turn for 2012 is 350,000.</p><p>  The current average processing time for vetting applications is 8 weeks.  However,  seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.</p><p>  I am very conscious of the need to keep this processing time to a minimum. I am confident that the current average processing time will be reduced over the coming months as a number of measures to ensure improvements in the time it takes for the processing of vetting applications take effect.  Most recently, there has been a redeployment of staff from another Government Department and the opening of a second vetting centre in Ennis, Co. Clare. </p></reply>

Both services are operated through community based organisations.  This has been done following a 12 month pilot which the Probation Service commenced in June, 2011 to test a range of restorative interventions based on the recommendations contained in the report of the National Commission on Restorative Justice.  A restorative justice project focussing on young offenders has also been developed in partnership with the voluntary and community sector in Limerick.<br /><br />  For my part, my focus is to encourage the use of, to the greatest extent possible, the menu of non-custodial options available to the courts.   I believe the restorative justice concept has a place in that range of available options and it is my intention to build on the progress being made.</blockquote></p></reply>

Revenue has adopted a comprehensive tobacco strategy which is published on Revenue&#8217;s website <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.  The strategy includes a number of programmes, which are designed to complement each other in targeting the supply and demand sides of the market for contraband tobacco in Ireland.  </p><p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provides ongoing support to the Revenue Commissioners in tackling this form of criminal activity and there continues to be close and effective liaison in this regard. As a feature of this, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to proactively target groups and individuals engaged in organised criminal activities, which includes those engaged in smuggling cigarettes. </p><p>  A Cross-Border Task Force, comprising of representatives from the Police Service of Northern Ireland, HM Revenue Customs, the Serious Organised Crime Agency (UK), An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Criminal Assets Bureau, which is chaired by the Revenue Commissioners is also in place to address this form of criminality.  Given all of the above, I have no current plans to conduct a review with the Garda&iacute; on the measures they have in place for enforcement in this area. </p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that the issue of cigarette smuggling remains one of priority for our law enforcement agencies and that significant successes continue to be made in tackling this illegal trade. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in the period from January to October this year, a total of 91m cigarettes and almost 4,0000kgs of tobacco have been seized by Revenue. In addition, during that period there were over 100 convictions for smuggling or selling of illicit tobacco products.</p><p>   With regard to the introduction of plain or standardised packaging for tobacco products I am advised by my colleague, the Minister for Health, that the Department of Health will continue to monitor recent international developments in this area which together with the forthcoming revision of the EU Tobacco Products Directive will inform future policy in this area.</p><p>  Given that the introduction of such packaging internationally is still at a relatively recent stage it would be speculative at this point to consider any impact its introduction might have on the illegal trade in tobacco products. However, what I can say in this regard is that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would welcome any appropriate initiative that would assist in further curtailing such activity.</p></reply>

Upon receipt, an initial examination of each application is carried out to determine if the statutory application is completed fully. Valid applications are examined to determine if the applicant meets the statutory residency criteria. Applicants with any shortfall in their residency are informed of this and will be able to reapply when they have the required residency.  Those whose applications successfully pass the initial assessment stage are informed that their application has been initially assessed and has proceeded successfully to the second stage of processing and that their case will be submitted to the Minister for decision as soon as enquiries are complete and all required documentation has been compiled. Applicants are also given a general timescale for processing which currently is that less complex cases which account for more than 70% of all applications will be decided upon within 6 months with a proportion of applications taking longer than this timeframe. If any further information or documentation is required from the applicant then this is requested in writing.</p><p>  When I came into office in March, 2011, I was determined to tackle the backlog that had built up in the processing of applications for citizenship.To this end, a series of more streamlined measures have resulted in a major increase in the volume of applications processed with some 22,500 cases decided so far in 2012, almost three times the volume in 2010. The Deputy will appreciate that, bearing in mind the volumes involved and the importance of processing cases as quickly as possible, it is not possible to provide specific timeframes to each applicant. In any event this information will not be known until each application is examined in detail.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that alongside the improvements in processing, in June 2011, I introduced formal citizenship ceremonies for the first time since the foundation of the State. The ceremonies, which are being met with universal approval, are held at regular intervals. They allow candidates for citizenship make their declaration of fidelity to the Irish nation and loyalty to the State and receive their certificate of naturalisation in a meaningful and dignified manner which befits the importance and solemnity of the occasion. As many as 4,000 candidates receive their certificate of naturalisation on each ceremony day. In dealing with such large volumes, it is necessary to structure the process in such a way as to ensure that these large scale ceremony days run smoothly and efficiently. As much notice as possible is provided to candidates and those who cannot attend are facilitated at a future ceremony.</p><p>  Finally, I think the Deputy will acknowledge that enormous strides have been made with dealing with citizenship applications since March 2011. The situation inherited by me upon being appointed was unacceptable and this has now been turned around to the extent that the new arrangements for granting citizenship have been universally welcomed. In the circumstances, I am somewhat surprised that a person who may have waited for a lengthy period to have his/her application processed would choose to travel outside the jurisdiction and not take up the request to attend a ceremony without good reason. As I indicated earlier, in any event, no person is denied citizenship by not being able to attend a ceremony; they are facilitated on the next available occasion.</p></reply>

Section 36 of the Prisons Act, 2007, which was brought into operation on 1 May, 2007, makes it an offence for prisoners to have unauthorised possession of or use of mobile telecommunication devices. Under the Act it is also an offence to supply such a device to a prisoner.  The penalties for such an offence, on summary conviction, include a fine not exceeding &euro;5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, and on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &euro;10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both. It is Irish Prison Service policy to report and hand over seizures of mobile phones to the Garda&iacute;.  Cell and area searches for contraband such as mobile phones take place in all prisons on a daily basis.  These include random, targeted and intelligence led searches.  These searches have been particularly effective and local intelligence indicates that the availability of mobile phones has decreased across the prison system.  As the Deputy can see the number of mobile phones seized in prisons has reduced, year on year, from 2009 and given the figure for the year to date it is expected that the final figure for 2012 will show a further decrease .  This is as a direct consequence of the security measures introduced, including a airport style scanners and x-ray machines, which are in operation at the entrances of all the relevant closed prisons.</p><p><table><tr><th>Prison/Place of Detention</th><th><div>2009</div></th><th><div>2010</div></th><th><div>2011</div></th><th><div>2012 (23.9.12)</div></th></tr><tr><td> Arbour Hill</td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td> Castlerea</td><td><div>70</div></td><td><div>43</div></td><td><div>42</div></td><td><div>21</div></td></tr><tr><td> Cloverhill</td><td><div>41</div></td><td><div>16</div></td><td><div>20</div></td><td><div>27</div></td></tr><tr><td> Cork</td><td><div>27</div></td><td><div>13</div></td><td><div>30</div></td><td><div>9</div></td></tr><tr><td> D&oacute;chas Centre</td><td><div>40</div></td><td><div>12</div></td><td><div>42</div></td><td><div>10</div></td></tr><tr><td> Limerick</td><td><div>309</div></td><td><div>133</div></td><td><div>100</div></td><td><div>108</div></td></tr><tr><td> Loughan House</td><td><div>78</div></td><td><div>155</div></td><td><div>104</div></td><td><div>48</div></td></tr><tr><td> Midlands</td><td><div>87</div></td><td><div>92</div></td><td><div>123</div></td><td><div>59</div></td></tr><tr><td> Mountjoy (Male)</td><td><div>904</div></td><td><div>742</div></td><td><div>420</div></td><td><div>226</div></td></tr><tr><td> Portlaoise</td><td><div>48</div></td><td><div>18</div></td><td><div>27</div></td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td> Shelton Abbey</td><td><div>103</div></td><td><div>88</div></td><td><div>77</div></td><td><div>51</div></td></tr><tr><td>St. Patrick's Institution</td><td><div>121</div></td><td><div>138</div></td><td><div>220</div></td><td><div>252</div></td></tr><tr><td> Training Unit</td><td><div>116</div></td><td><div>191</div></td><td><div>113</div></td><td><div>54</div></td></tr><tr><td> Wheatfield</td><td><div>228</div></td><td><div>76</div></td><td><div>48</div></td><td><div>17</div></td></tr><tr><td> Total</td><td><div>2,174</div></td><td><div>1,718</div></td><td><div>1,368</div></td><td><div>885</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

Indeed, when considering the sentence to be imposed on a sex offender, the  court is obliged by section 28 of the Act to consider whether to include post-release supervision. The court is required to have regard to the need for such supervision, the need to protect the public from serious harm from the offender, the need to prevent the commission of further sexual offences by the offender, and the need to rehabilitate or further rehabilitate the offender. The aggregate of the sentence of imprisonment and the supervision period cannot exceed the duration of the maximum prison term for the particular offence. Also, the period of imprisonment cannot be less than the court would have imposed were it not in a position to order post-release supervision.</p><p>  For the period of post-release supervision, the offender is required to comply with such conditions as are specified in the sentence for securing supervision by a probation officer. In addition, the court can include a condition prohibiting the offender from doing anything it considers necessary for the purpose of protecting the public. It can also impose a condition requiring the offender to receive psychological counselling or other appropriate treatment.</p><p>  It is important to view provisions relating to post-release supervision together with other provisions in the Sex Offenders Act 2001. The legislation also introduced the &quot;sex offenders' register&quot; and sex offender orders. Any person sentenced to more than 2 years imprisonment for a scheduled sexual offence is subject to indefinite notification requirements. Upon the application of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Circuit Court can make a sex offender order at any time after an offender's release from prison (or a sentence otherwise ceases to be in force) prohibiting him or her from doing certain things.  A sex offender order can remain in force for 5 years or such longer period as the court may provide.</p><p>  My Department has been conducting a wide-ranging review of the law on sexual offences. An examination of the Sex Offenders Act 2001, including a public consultation process, formed an integral part of that review. Arising from the review, I expect to bring legislative proposals to Government for approval shortly. These will include a number of measures to enhance risk assessment, notification requirements and the application of post-release supervision requirements.</p></reply>

These are matters which would fall primarily to be considered by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Social Protection.  </p><p>  With regard to the issue of illegal money lending it may be helpful if I briefly set out the measures currently in place governing money lending generally.  The regulation of licensed money lending is a matter primarily for my colleague, the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank of Ireland is the Competent Authority in this jurisdiction with regard to licensed money lending activity. Legislative provisions relating to the regulation of money lending are contained in the Consumer Credit Act 1995 and unlicensed money lending is an offence under that Act. Persons who engage in money lending and who do not hold the necessary licence granted by the Central Bank are committing an offence under section 98 of the Act.  Complaints concerning the operation of illegal money lenders may be made to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have power to bring prosecutions against unlicensed operators.  A person who is found guilty of an offence under the Act is liable, on summary conviction, to  a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, or on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &euro;100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.</p><p>  I have been assured by the Garda authorities that where offences under section 98 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 are disclosed, and are reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the matter will be the subject of investigation under the direction of the local District Officer, with relevant expert assistance available from the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation. </p><p>  I would therefore strongly encourage those who may have information concerning the operation of unlicensed money lenders to notify An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na whom I can assure the Deputy will take all measures open to them to enforce the law in this area.</p><p>  While I do appreciate the concerns expressed by the Deputy in relation to this particular case, insofar as such concerns relate to the operation of illegal money lending this is a matter which can be pursued by the Garda authorities as I have outlined above.  </p></reply>

Under the new Fees Order (Land Registration (Fees) Order 2012) which comes into operation on 1 December 2012, the fee will be &euro;130.</p><p>  Where the title to the &ldquo;dominant tenement&rdquo; (that is the applicant&rsquo;s lands benefitting from the right) is unregistered, an application for first registration of the title to those lands must be made. The first registration fees are currently &euro;85, rising to &euro;500 under the new Fees Order.  However, in appropriate cases, the title may be certified by a solicitor in Form 3 of the Schedule of Forms to the Land Registration Rules. If title can be and is certified in Form 3, the fee will be &euro;130 under the new Fees Order.  The first registration fee, where payable, would be additional to the fee for registration of the appurtenant right mentioned above.</p><p>  The Property Registration Authority can only process cases where the right is uncontested. In contested cases, or any other case, applicants may apply to the Court to have the right established. If successful, the Court Order is then lodged for registration of the right. The fee for registration of the right established pursuant to an order of the Court is currently &euro;25, rising to &euro;40 in the new Fees Order.</p><p>  What is set out above relates only to fees payable to the Property Registration Authority.  The Authority cannot comment on fees and costs that would be charged by a solicitor. </p></reply>

I am further informed that the area is subject to regular patrols by local uniformed personnel, augmented by uniformed and plain clothes units from the District headquarters in Ashbourne, together with the Divisional Traffic Unit and the Regional Support Unit as required.</p><p>  Local Garda management closely monitors such patrols, and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the communities in these areas to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources to provide the best possible Garda service to the public. While the situation is being kept under review, Garda management is satisfied that a full and comprehensive policing service is being delivered to the communities in the areas concerned and that the current structures in place deliver an effective and efficient policing service.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner has put Operation Fiacla in place in order to address incidents of burglary, aggravated burglaries and related offences throughout the country. Operation Fiacla is intelligence driven and specific burglary initiatives have been implemented in each Garda Region to target suspect offenders.  I am informed that as of 19 October, 2493 persons have been arrested and 1404 persons have been charged with burglary offences under Operation Fiacla.</p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also places great emphasis on the importance of the partnership between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the community in preventing and detecting crime, and maintaining a safe environment for everyone.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to invest time and energy in these partnerships and relationships to the benefit of all.  </p><p>  In this regard, during September the Garda Commissioner launched the second national public awareness week this year under the 'Garda Supporting Safer Communities Campaign&rsquo;. This important campaign highlights a range of key issues, in particular burglary prevention. The primary objective of this Garda Community Safety Campaign is to engage with, and raise awareness within communities of initiatives aimed at preventing crime, reducing the fear of crime and promoting community safety.</p></reply>

I am and my officials are frequently and closely engaged with our counterparts in Northern Ireland in respect of a wide range of matters relating to North-South criminal justice co-operation.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that under the Intergovernmental Agreement on Co-operation on Criminal Justice Matters I meet regularly with David Ford to discuss criminal justice matters of mutual interest or concern in the two jurisdictions; to consider the scope for and develop plans to achieve more effective co-operation and co-ordination on criminal justice matters between the two jurisdictions; to oversee and give direction to the work of the Working Group; to exchange information on other criminal justice initiatives taking place in both jurisdictions, and to approve and review progress against the annual work programmes on criminal justice co-operation.</p><p>  The Agreement established a Working Group of senior officials comprising representatives of my Department, the Northern Ireland Department of Justice and the various criminal justice agencies from both jurisdictions.  Its remit is to take forward current co-operation and to identify other areas in which co-operation on criminal justice matters could be enhanced or initiated.  A number of project groups are taking forward co-operation initiatives in relation to forensic science, registered offenders, probation and rehabilitation, victim support, youth justice matters and social diversity.</p><p>  In addition, the officials of my Department maintain close and ongoing contact with their counterparts in the Northern Ireland Office and the Northern Ireland Department of Justice in regard to the security situation and the ongoing threat posed by republican paramilitarism.</p><p>  Given that North-South co-operation is an integral and ongoing part of the work of a range of Divisions of my Department, it is not readily possible to disaggregate the relevant proportion of the working time of the officials involved.</p></reply>

The Deputy will appreciate that, in view of the volume of transactions using such devices as well as the global nature of communication by these means, the authorities would find it impossible to enforce a prohibition on the use of equipment for such purposes (assuming, of course, that a prohibition of such a kind was legally or constitutionally permissible). Nevertheless, bullying in any form may amount to an assault or harassment and may therefore be an offence under the Non Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997, as amended, or under the Post Office (Amendment) Act 1951, as amended. I therefore urge any one subjected to bullying of whatever variety to contact the Garda&iacute;. </p><p>  Assistance is available from a number of sources to help those affected by cyberbullying. The Safer Internet Ireland project is coordinated by the Office for Internet Safety in my Department. The body now called Technology in Education under the remit of the Professional Development service for Teachers (formerly known as the National Centre for Technology in Education) participates in the project. It operates www.webwise.ie which provides advice and information to parents and teachers.</p><p>  The ISPCC and the National Parents Council (Primary) also participate. Both organisations offer assistance through their confidential telephone helplines on how to deal with cyberbullying. the Office for Internet Safety itself supplies very useful guides, including &quot;A Parents Guide to Social Networking Sites&quot; and &quot;A Guide to Cyberbullying&quot;.</p></reply>

While the policing plan for 2013 has not yet been finalised, it will be laid before the House in due course.  Until then it would be premature to speculate on what it might contain.</p><p>  In preparing the policing plan, the Garda Commissioner reviews all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the operation of Garda Districts and Stations, in terms of resource allocation, the opening hours and possible closures. In addition, all Divisional Officers are asked to assess the level of activity in each Garda Station in their area. It must be stressed that the key objective of the review is to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources rather than secure modest cash savings so that as many Garda&iacute; as possible are deployed on front line operational duty rather than based in Garda Stations.</p><p>  In addition to this, the Garda Commissioner has introduced a range of measures aimed at tackling gangs involved in burglaries. These measures are encompassed in Operation Fiacla, which is particularly focused on identifying and targeting mobile gangs involved in burglaries around the country so as to disrupt their activities and bring them before the Courts. Specific burglary related initiatives are being implemented in each Garda Region in support of Operation Fiacla. This is a coordinated, intelligence led strategy designed to maximise organisational resources in order to proactively target prolific offenders. Under this operation, between February 2012 and October 2012, approximately 2,500 persons have been arrested and over 1,400 persons have been charged, reflecting the very substantial efforts being made to tackle this problem by the Garda&iacute;.</p></reply>

Prisons must function on a 24/7 and therefore it is necessary to operate a rostering system.  The IPS uses rostering to schedule an officer&rsquo;s basic working week over the periods outside normal working hours and is developing and implementing more efficient rosters.  There are no plans to remove employees from the rostering system.</p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also provides a 24/7 service and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na including Garda reserves and some civilian staff in the organisation work on a roster.  As the Deputy will be aware, a new roster system was introduced this year in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which more closely matches the deployment of resources with policing demands while at the same time protecting the health and welfare of the members.  Out of hours cover and on call arrangements which would not ordinarily be considered as employed on a roster basis are utilised across the Justice sector.  Such arrangements will continue to be a feature in the areas where they apply.</p></reply>

At this juncture there may be a requirement for a significant number of personnel based in Collins Barracks, Cork to be relocated rather than reassigned.  As part of the implementation process, personnel have been given the opportunity to indicate their preferred options in relation to relocation and these will be taken into account in the implementation of the reorganisation plan. In addition, a review system has been put in place whereby personnel who are unhappy with a proposed relocation can seek a review of a decision in this regard. While the maintenance of Defence Forces operational requirements must be prioritised within the reorganisation implementation process, within that context, all practical alternatives, including redeployment within an individual&rsquo;s existing location will be explored to minimise the requirement for geographic relocation.</p><p>  Opportunities will also be given for personnel to retrain and re-skill so as to be able to fill vacancies in their current locations, and this is being incorporated into the Defence Forces Training directive for 2013. However, it must be accepted that there is no painless way to fundamentally reorganise the Defence Forces whilst maintaining essential military capabilities and, undoubtedly, it will be necessary to mandatorily move some personnel whose units are being disestablished or relocated and who cannot be accommodated in their current location. This is a difficult process for many serving members of the Defence Forces, officers and enlisted personnel, who are being required to make decisions under the current reorganisation which they would not otherwise make or in different times have had to consider. However, this is the reality of the public service today and of the reforms taking place across the public service. </p></reply>

Historically, due to the nature of the allowance, it was not regarded as being subject to tax or income levy. During the course of a routine Revenue audit, when the Deputy was Minister for Defence, the taxation status of the allowance was raised as a possible issue. Following technical assessment, the Revenue Commissioners determined that the allowance, as then paid, constituted a &lsquo;round sum&rsquo; and was liable to taxation.

These reductions followed on the significant reductions achieved over previous years on this Vote.   Arising from the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, the Government&#8217;s decision to stabilise the strength of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) at 9,500 personnel has resulted in sustainable pay savings as reflected in the figures above. In addition, there were reductions in the number of Civilian Employees and Civil Servants employed. </p><p>  I initiated a major re-organisation of the Defence Forces in order to maximise the operational capabilities of the PDF within the revised strength level. The organisational structures that were in place for a PDF strength of approximately 11,500 personnel were clearly outmoded and no longer fit for purpose. In July this year, I accepted the Chief of Staff and Secretary General&#8217;s recommendation regarding new PDF structures and announced the details. Implementation of these revised organisational structures is ongoing.</p><p>  Measures to reduce costs and deliver greater efficiencies over the past three years have also included a further rationalisation and consolidation of the Defence property portfolio.<b></b>  Regarding the recent closure of the four military barracks - Clonmel, Cavan, Mullingar and Castlebar - military personnel occupied on security and support functions within these installations have been released for operational duties leading to a manpower efficiency gain of around &#8364;5 million p.a. In addition, there are direct cash savings of approximately &#8364;1.3m per annum arising from utilities, maintenance and security duty allowances in the four barracks.  Despite the reductions in funding, a key focus has been the prioritisation and maintenance of PDF operational capacity in order to ensure that the PDF retain the capacity to fulfil all roles assigned.</p></reply>

Whilst the Defence Forces are not a Principal Response Agency, as defined in the Framework for Major Emergency Management, they provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate Lead Department in the event of a natural disaster or severe weather emergency in its Aid to the Civil Authority (ATCA) role under the multi-agency Framework.  Representation on the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, by both my Department and the Defence Forces, ensures the fullest coordination and cooperation in the event of an emergency.  The Defence Forces are also represented on the eight Regional Working Groups that have been established under the Framework and, on an ongoing basis, designated members of the Defence Forces, based around the country, act as Liaison Officers to Local Authorities.</p><p>  The various procedures that are in place, both nationally and locally, were seen to operate very effectively during the Winter of 2010 as the Defence Forces made all assets, resources and capabilities available to the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning and responded to all requests for assistance received from the civil authorities during the periods of severe weather that occurred that Winter.</p><p>  Emergency planning in this country is structured around the &lsquo;Lead Department&rsquo; principle, which means that the Department that is responsible for an activity in normal conditions will maintain that responsibility in an emergency.  While there is no one national emergency response plan, there are robust processes in place for the inter-agency cooperation at the national, regional and local levels.  In April 2011, the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning approved guidelines for the activation and coordination of a national-level emergency/crisis response.  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the ability to fulfil all roles that are assigned to them by Government including provision of Aid to the Civil Authorities (ATCA) in any emergency situations that may arise.</p></reply>

The overall aim of the initiative is to create 250 jobs in the Killybegs area by 2014.   The five key areas identified for detailed consideration by the Group were:</p><p> - Promote Seafood Value Added Activity</p><p> - Enhance Ancillary Supports</p><p> - Develop Offshore Supports</p><p> - Promote Tourism and Marine Leisure and</p><p> - Promote Green Economy/Renewable Energy.</p><p>  Since the outset it has been accepted that any progress is dependant upon an integrated collaborative approach between private and public sectors.   Investments from both sides should deliver real jobs for Killybegs between now and 2014.</p><p>  At this point I can only report in detail on progress in the seafood sector, for which I have direct responsibility. I have recently consulted with BIM on this matter and have been advised that significant additional landings of Norwegian Blue Whiting were attracted to Killybegs this year and were processed in local pelagic processing plants.  This was made possible because of the landing facilities provided at Killybegs and the work done by the local processing industry, with BIM, to pioneer the processing of Blue Whiting for human consumption.  Annual landings of Blue Whiting in Killybegs are currently estimated at approx. 80,000 tonnes per annum with an estimated value of approx. &euro;41 M.  I am confident that increased quotas for this species can be secured for 2013.</p><p>  BIM has, in recent years, grant-aided equipment to facilitate the processing of this additional blue whiting.   The position is that in 2011, seven Killybegs processing companies invested &euro;4.9m in their operations. Of this amount, approved grant aid amounted to almost &euro;1.2m. This year so far, six Killybegs processing companies have invested a total of &euro;8.5m. Of this amount, approved grant aid amounted to just over &euro;1.5m.  It is expected that this investment combined with the increase in throughput will directly result in 47 new jobs by the end of this year and will be of continuing benefit to Killybegs in future years.   BIM is actively working with industry and processing equipment companies to develop new product formats which will increase the added value processing of this key stock.  I am anticipating that these new product trials will be significantly advanced during 2013.</p><p>  In addition to the welcome progress on the Blue Whiting fishery, work is ongoing on developing human consumption markets for the large quota of 58,866 tonnes of Boarfish which we have secured in recent years.  This fishery holds very significant promise for the processing industry in Killybegs.  During my trade mission to China earlier this year, trial shipments of this product were agreed between Irish processors and Chinese importers.  I am pleased to report that, as a result of these trial shipments, repeat orders have been secured by Irish companies from the Chinese market.  BIM, Bord Bia and the industry are this week developing further contacts in the Chinese markets at a trade fair in Dalian in China.  I understand from BIM that they expect 1400 tonnes of Boarfish to be processed for human consumption during 2012.  These orders will be delivered to both the Chinese and the African markets.</p><p>  I am also aware that the group met earlier this week to further review progress across a range of other areas outside of the Seafood area, for which I have direct responsibility. I am awaiting an update from that meeting on how matters are progressing in relation to these other key areas.</p></reply>

The Operational Programme (OP) seeks to implement the strategic investment priorities indentified in the National Strategic Plan for the Fisheries Sector, prepared in accordance with article 15 of the above Regulation.  Approximately &euro;42 million is available to Ireland from the EFF for the period of the OP.  This may extend up to 2015. </p><p>  Given the modest level of co-funding available to Ireland and the broad range of investment priorities identified in the Strategic Plan, a complimentary programme funded solely by the Exchequer was launched in 2010.  This Irish Seafood National Programme 2007-2013 provided public support to investments in seafood processing, aquaculture and certain other areas not covered by the OP.  The OP provided co-funded support primarily for the 2008 fleet decommissioning scheme, but also covered marine environmental protection measures and coastal development in non-fisheries activities.  </p><p>  The EFF Regulation required member states to produce an independent interim evaluation of national OPs in 2011.  This was submitted to the European Commission in June 2011.  The Interim Evaluation was conducted by consultants Fitzpatrick Associates.  The Evaluation noted the changed economic circumstances facing Ireland and the impacts this was likely to have on availability of Exchequer funding for measures included within the National Programme.  It also noted that the measures included in the OP were not likely to be sufficient to draw down the full &euro;42 million allocation from the EFF.  The Evaluation recommended the amendment of the OP to include most of the measures previously included in the National Programme, to ensure availability of supports to these important areas of the seafood sector and to ensure full draw down of EFF funds.  The recommendations were accepted and a revised OP was submitted to the European Commission in March 2012.  This is currently being delivered through schemes operated by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Bord Bia and Udaras na Gaeltachta.</p><p>  No EFF funds are returned to the European Commission.  Funds are transferred to Ireland annually based on claims submitted by my Department towards the end of each year.  I am confident that the broad range of measures now included in the OP, the bulk of which are to the benefit of private operators within the industry, will be more than sufficient to ensure full draw down of all the available EFF funds.</p></reply>

In relation to aquaculture licensing, the sustainable development of the industry and the creation of long term employment from aquaculture into the future can only take place if there is full compliance with the range of  EU and national legislation that impact on this area.  I am very conscious of the requirement to both ensure compliance with our obligations under EU law and to make progress on addressing the licensing backlog.   In order to meet these objectives, my Department, in conjunction with the Marine Institute and NPWS is investing significant resources into completing the Appropriate Assessment process.    I am confident that significant progress is being made which will facilitate determinations on a significant number of licence applications over the coming months. I also anticipate significant progress in relation to licence determinations in Non-Natura areas.</p><p>  In addition, as part of a general reform of licensing procedures and processes my Department has comprehensively updated aquaculture licence templates to make them 'fit for purpose' to meet the challenges and opportunities facing the industry.  Significant work has gone into devising this new updated suite of licences, creating a balanced set of rights and obligations for the industry suited to the current era.    </p><p>  Apart from the focus on progressing licence determinations in the bays, it is also intended to radically expand the production of Irish organic farmed salmon by creating new fish farming production areas in deeper waters. The placement of farms in deep waters will ensure that there is no impact on NATURA 2000 sites.    BIM estimates that just one of these production areas could generate over 100 Million Euro in exports p.a. and create 350 direct jobs.  A further 150 jobs will be created indirectly in the service sector, supplying fish feed, netting, transportation and other services.  </p><p>  BIM, working with the Marine Institute, is currently investigating suitable sites. An application for an aquaculture licence in respect of one of these sites in Galway Bay has been submitted to the Department by BIM.  This application is currently being assessed in accordance with the provisions of the 1997 Fisheries (Amendment) Act.  I am confident that the steps I have outlined above together with the work being done by BIM and the Marine Institute will result in the sustainable development and significant expansion of this important industry.</p></reply>

I am aware of the concerns currently being expressed by the sector, particularly with regard to feed costs. High feed costs, most notably cereals and compound feed remain an issue. Pig producers are especially affected by the increase in cereal prices since June 2009, given that cereals account for 75% of feed.  Contributory factors include weather events in the Black Sea region and the United States during recent years, currency fluctuations and general supply and demand factors including but not limited to, better diet and increased meat demand in emerging economies and the ongoing shift towards biofuels. </p><p>  The price of pigmeat and, of course, feed is ultimately determined by demand and supply considerations. You will be aware that, due to Ireland&#8217;s membership of the Single Market, unilateral actions or interventions to support individual sectors is not permitted. For my part however, I and my officials will continue to press the European Commission to make use of all the available market supports when circumstances require it, to ameliorate the worst effects of price volatility. Indeed the Aids to Private Storage Scheme introduced for pigmeat in 2011 played a significant role in putting a floor under pigmeat prices at that time.  This, together with release of cereal stocks from intervention, improved the situation somewhat at that time.</p><p>  From a National perspective, the &#8216;<i>Food Harvest 2020 Report</i>  &#8217;, which was published in July 2010, sets out the vision for the future of the food industry including the pig sector. The Report targets a 50% increase in the value of output by 2020. This is a target set by the industry for itself. I am personally chairing a High Level Group to ensure that the steps necessary to facilitate the development of the sector are taken. My Department and its agencies will, along with industry, play a central role in this regard. For example Teagasc, through its Moorepark pig research facility and the provision of FETAC courses in pig production and benchmarking pig herd performance, plays a critically important role in improving productive capacity at farm level. Teagasc have also circulated pig producers with a number of the options available to them to reduce feed costs and improve feed efficiency. This is particularly important given that feed is the largest single component of the overall cost of production. </p><p>  While input costs have increased significantly in recent years, the returns available to producers have also risen sharply. This has helped ameliorate the situation to some extent. At the end of October, prices were almost 24/c per kilo ahead year on year, which equates to an increase of more than 16%. Compared to the same week in 2010, per kilo prices have risen by over 40/c per kilo, or almost 31%. The forecast decline in the European sow population and consequent lower production and ongoing high demand for European pig meat internationally, should lead to even higher prices in the coming months. </p><p>  New EU Animal Welfare rules set down new standards in relation to the housing of sows and these are due to come into force on 1 January 2013. A significant number of producers have undertaken the necessary work required in order to upgrade their facilities in order to comply with the new rules. </p><p>  My Department is aware of the scale of the challenge facing pig farmers in respect of the new requirements. To this end, the Department introduced a Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) for Sow Welfare in June 2010. Grant-aid is available at a rate of 40% to eligible producers with a maximum investment ceiling of &#8364;300,000, i.e. a maximum grant of &#8364;120,000. A total of &#8364;13 million has been provisionally allocated to this scheme under the rural development Programme. It follows two earlier schemes in 2005 and 2007 and payments of &#8364;6.2 million have already been made under these schemes.  The provisions of the scheme were modified earlier this year to allow multiple applications from pig farmers with more than one sow house together with an increase in the ceiling to &#8364;500,000 for the first house and &#8364;300,000 for each of the next three. </p><p>  Furthermore, in order to ensure that as many pig producers as possible would be in a position to comply with the new EU animal welfare rules, I have extended the closing date for applications to end-January 2013.  All applications received during the period of this extension would now be included in a new final tranche for which a sum of &#8364;3 million has been made available.  The final date for completion of work and the lodgment of payment claims is 30 September 2013.  Applications from almost 120 producers, to the value of &#8364;13.86 million are currently being processed by officials in my Department.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department and its agencies will continue to work closely with the industry to ensure that it can continue to develop and grow in accordance with the targets in the Food Harvest 2020 Report.  </p></reply>

The network is made up of Special Protection Areas (SPAs) established under the EU Birds Directive, and Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), established under the Habitats Directive itself.  Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the Natura 2000 network was created under the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997 (S.I. 94 of 1997 as amended by S.I. 233 of 1998 and S.I. 378 of 2005).  These regulations transposed the EU Directives into Irish national law.  The designation of individual &lsquo;Natura&rsquo; sites has taken place on a rolling basis since establishment.  Since then aquaculture licence determinations in the order of 550 were made up to December 2007 (the date of the European Court of Justice ruling referred to by the Deputy).  This figure refers to all determinations made in relation to sites located both inside and outside designated &lsquo;Natura&rsquo; areas, having regard to the rolling nature of the designations.</p></reply>

In the negotiations to address the judgment a process was agreed with the European Commission which would lead to full compliance by Ireland with the relevant EU Directives.  This process includes the following steps:</p><p> - a detailed data collection in 91 Bays/Estuaries</p><p> - detailed analysis of raw data collected</p><p> - setting of Conservation Objectives by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) in respect of each site</p><p> - carrying out Appropriate Assessments of each licence application/fishery plan against the detailed Conservation Objectives set, and</p><p> - determination of Licences/Fisheries on the basis of the Appropriate Assessment and other relevant factors.</p><p>  My Department has been working closely with the Marine Institute, BIM, and NPWS to achieve full compliance through a multi-annual work programme.  A key factor of this Work Programme is the identification of prioritised bays based on the number of aquaculture sites, the ready availability of scientific data and other factors.  The prioritised list of bays is kept under continuous review by my Department so as to facilitate the use of scientific and other resources on a flexible basis across the full range of bays, if deemed necessary.  This approach is consistent with the maintenance of a prioritised list which, as previously indicated to the Deputy, includes Kenmare Bay.  </p></reply>

The advisory system must cover the Statutory Management Requirements (SMRs) and Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) associated with the cross-compliance regime.  In this regard, my Department is currently in the process of providing training for both existing and new FAS advisors on cross compliance, including any updates to regulatory requirements. As this training deals specifically with the requirements of the cross compliance regime, as such, it does not lend itself to including training on issues arising from reading difficulties or dyslexia.</p><p>  Nonetheless, my Department actively provides assistance in this area in that it has responded to the concerns of farmers with dyslexia by publishing the terms and conditions document for the 2012 Single Payments Scheme in larger print. An audio version of the terms and conditions document has also been made available on CD. These can be found on the Department&rsquo;s website or can be posted on request. The Department&rsquo;s website also has the &ldquo;BrowseAloud&rdquo; facility to read web pages aloud for people with literacy and visual impairments.</p><p>  Department officials are also available in all regions to provide assistance to applicants who have questions or concerns on any scheme operated by the Department.  The 2012 terms and conditions document provides details of telephone numbers and other contact details.  On a more general level, my Department has two Access Officers and an Inquiry Officer in accordance with section 26(2) of the Disability Act 2005. Access Officers are a point of contact for people with disabilities wishing to access Department services. </p></reply>

I launched an Irish &ldquo;discard&rdquo; atlas last year, which is a detailed compendium of discards by the Irish Fleet on a stock by stock and area by area basis.  The Atlas, compiled and produced by the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara with the support of Irish Industry, outlines a range of potential measures to help reduce discarding.   This was the first publication of its kind and places Ireland firmly to the fore in the debate on eliminating discards. </p><p>  Finding practical and implementable solutions to the wasteful practice of discarding fish is a major priority issue for me. It is all the more poignant as it is a major principle of the new reform of the CFP. Since taking up office as Marine Minister, I have worked tirelessly to influence and drive a change in policy which will lead to an end to discarding. </p><p>  I am conscious that any solution must be practical for fishermen and with that in mind I have worked closely with Commissioner Damanaki, my fellow Fisheries Ministers and members of the European Parliament in addition to consulting with our industry at home to ensure that proposals in the Common Fishery Policy to tackle discards would be workable and take account of the practical realities that would face fishermen at sea.  </p><p>  At the Council of Fisheries Ministers in June this year, I helped broker a general agreement among fisheries Ministers on the way forward for the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy including innovate measures to tackle the discard problem. </p><p>  Discarding was the most contentious element of those discussions and threatened to block the Council&rsquo;s efforts to reach agreement. A compromise approach which I tabled for consideration setting down a definitive timetable for the elimination of discards on a phased basis, offered a practical and progressive solution on the issue which was accepted by fellow Ministers.  We are awaiting the EU Parliament&rsquo;s position on the reform, including in relation to its approach to dealing with discards.   </p><p>  I will prioritise securing final agreement between the EU Fisheries Council and the Parliament on the CFP during the Irish Presidency during the first half of 2013.</p></reply>

The industry faces a number of challenges in the short and medium term and my Department will continue to assist the sector to resolve these issues.  New EU Animal Welfare rules set down new standards in relation to the housing of sows and these are due to come into force on 1 January 2013. A significant number of producers have undertaken the necessary work required in order to upgrade their facilities in order to comply with the new rules. </p><p>  My Department is aware of the scale of the challenge facing pig farmers in respect of the new requirements. To this end, the Department introduced a Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) for Sow Welfare in June 2010. Grant-aid is available at a rate of 40% to eligible producers with a maximum investment ceiling of &euro;300,000, i.e. a maximum grant of &euro;120,000. A total of &euro;13 million has been provisionally allocated to this scheme under the rural development Programme. It follows two earlier schemes in 2005 and 2007 and payments of &euro;6.2 million have already been made under these schemes. </p><p>  The provisions of the scheme were modified earlier this year to allow multiple applications from pig farmers with more than one sow house together with an increase in the ceiling to &euro;500,000 for the first house and &euro;300,000 for each of the next three. </p><p>  Furthermore, in order to ensure that as many pig producers as possible would be in a position to comply with the new EU animal welfare rules, I have extended the closing date for applications to end-January 2013.  All applications received during the period of this extension would now be included in a new final tranche for which a sum of &euro;3 million has been made available.  The final date for completion of work and the lodgment of payment claims is 30 September 2013. </p><p>  Applications from almost 120 producers, to the value of &euro;13.86 million are currently being processed in my Department. </p><p>  While planning issues are a matter for local authorities, my Department has made them aware of the deadline for compliance with the sow housing regulations. </p><p>  I and my Department are in regular contact with farm bodies, various national banks and the Banking Federation concerning the availability of credit to farmers, including those in the pig sector, who are under financial pressure. I am aware that, like many other sectors, farmers are finding it difficult to get credit due to the strict assessments introduced as a result of the global financial crisis and that pig farmers have particular issues regarding high feed costs. The banks do provide information online, via the Irish Banking Federation, as to the type of information that they require when making a decision on a loan request in the agriculture sector. However, farmers who are not satisfied with the service provided by their banks can ask for an internal review by the relevant bank and if they are still not satisfied can apply to the Credit Review Office to have their case reviewed. Despite concerns, a relatively small number of cases from the Agri-Food sector have come before the Credit Review Office. </p><p>  Over the last year I understand that some of the banks have been involved in organising information sessions and conferences to explain the credit facilities available in the sector and just recently one of the pillar banks announced its intention to expand its lending activity in the agri-sector. Nonetheless, I will continue to meet with relevant parties, including the Irish Banking Federation, on a regular basis to discuss all credit-related issues.</p><p>  My Department has been in regular contact with all pig producers to keep them apprised of the requirements and ascertain their intentions and will continue to monitor the situation closely. </p><p>  I am aware of the concerns currently being expressed by both the pig and poultry sectors, particularly with regard to feed costs. High feed costs, most notably cereals and compound feed remain an issue. Pig producers are especially affected by the increase in cereal prices since June 2009, given that cereals account for 75% of feed. </p><p>  Contributory factors include weather events in the Black Sea region and the United States during recent years, currency fluctuations and general supply and demand factors including but not limited to, better diet and increased meat demand in emerging economies and the ongoing shift towards biofuels. </p><p>  The supply side has been adversely affected by drought in the US during the summer which led to a 27% decline in the forecast corn harvest. This came after spring drought in South America and has been followed by a reduced harvest in the Ukraine after a poor summer. Indeed, the Ukraine announced a ban on wheat exports last week but has since modified this stance somewhat. </p><p>  Given that Ireland imports much of the feed used in both the pigmeat and poultry sectors, the impact of price increases in these commodities is acute. Domestically a number of initiatives have been explored and developed. For example Teagasc, through its Moorepark pig research facility and the provision of FETAC courses in pig production and benchmarking pig herd performance, plays a critically important role in improving productive capacity at farm level. Teagasc have also circulated pig producers with a number of the options available to them to reduce feed costs and improve feed efficiency. </p><p>  The price of pigmeat and, of course, feed is ultimately determined by demand and supply considerations. You will be aware that, due to Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the Single Market, unilateral actions or interventions to support individual sectors is not permitted. For my part however, I and my officials will continue to press the European Commission to make use of all the available market supports when circumstances require it, to ameliorate the worst effects of price volatility. </p><p>  Pigmeat remains the most consumed meat worldwide and I consider that the substantial trade surplus in pigmeat in Ireland and the measures being taken to improve efficiency and market access leave us well placed to avail of developing opportunities in international markets. </p><p>  In so far as international trade in Irish pigmeat is concerned, my Department has been extremely active in developing relationships in new and expanding markets in order to build the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long term trading relationships in the future. </p><p>  And of course Bord Bia continues, through its promotional activities, and through the pigmeat quality assurance scheme, to consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat on the domestic market and to expand its presence on EU and third country markets. </p><p>  While input costs have increased significantly in recent years, the returns available to producers have also risen sharply. This has helped ameliorate the situation to some extent. At the end of October, prices were almost 24/c per kilo ahead year on year, which equates to an increase of more than 16%.  Compared to the same week in 2010, per kilo prices have risen by over 40/c per kilo, or almost 31%. The forecast decline in the European sow population and consequent lower production and ongoing high demand for European pig meat internationally, should lead to even higher returns in the coming months.</p></reply>

I expect that the Irish dairy sector will fully exploit this potential following the abolition of milk quotas on the 1st   of April 2015.</p><p>  In the medium term, this means achieving the target of a 50 per cent increase in milk production by 2020, as set out by industry stakeholders in the Food Harvest 2020 report.  While this target is ambitious, it is one I believe that it can be achieved through a focused and determined implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations for the dairy sector.  </p><p>  At farm level this will require improvements in on-farm competitiveness through, for example, animal health and genetic improvement programmes, as well as increased efficiency through education and technology transfer. My Department is playing its part in this regard through its continued support for ICBF and Animal Health Ireland, and through the Dairy Efficiency Programme which has provided a financial stimulus for participants in dairy discussion groups. </p><p>  A processing sector with optimal capacity and maximum efficiency is also required, and in this regard, the capital investment plans of a number of the major players are already well advanced.  There also needs to be a continued focus on commercially relevant R&amp;D and marketing activities, and these aspects are being advanced through the activities of Teagasc and Bord Bia, in collaboration with the sector, with critical financial support from my Department.</p><p>  In this regard plans for the development of a dairy sustainability and quality programme to exploit the already strong quality and sustainability credentials of the Irish dairy sector are well advanced. Bord Bia&rsquo;s Origin Green Programme, which will involve industry players in signing up to achieving concrete sustainability targets will further develop the image of Ireland as a source of high quality food, including dairy produce.    </p><p>  With more than three quarters of Irish dairy production exported and with growth in global populations forecast to stimulate strong levels of demand for dairy products, I am working with the industry to raise the profile of both the Irish dairy sector, and the Irish agri-food sector generally in countries such as the US, in emerging markets in the Far East and North Africa and elsewhere.</p><p>  There will of course be challenges, and increased input cost and price volatility will mean that operators at farm and processing level will have optimise their cost base, and develop mechanisms to protect income, perhaps through medium or long term supply contracts, or through other hedging mechanisms. The industry in Ireland has a history or resilience and innovation and I am confident that it is well placed to meet these challenges. </p><p>  Bearing all of this in mind, I expect that the prospects and opportunities for the Irish dairy sector will expand significantly in the years following the abolition of milk quotas.</p></reply>

Apart from the promotional work of Bord Bia, these include initiatives such as the Beef Technology Adoption Programme, the retention of the Suckler Cow Scheme in 2012 and the advisory work of Teagasc especially in connection with the expanded BETTER Beef Farm Programme. I also chair the High Level Implementation Group set up to monitor progress on the 2020 strategy and take appropriate action to assist the agri-food sector to deliver the growth in output value envisaged for the various commodities including beef.</p><p>  While the great majority of our beef exports are destined for other EU member states, it is always beneficial to have a wide range of market outlets available for our high-quality beef products and my Department is working actively &#8211; in collaboration with the industry, Bord Bia and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade &#8211; to secure access to more third country outlets for Irish beef. As a result of these efforts, Ireland has reached agreements over recent years with the authorities in Israel, Tunisia, Morocco, Turkey, Egypt and Singapore which allow for the export of Irish beef. </p><p>  I have also been assiduous in developing links and nurturing relationships in new and expanding markets in order to build confidence in Irish production and control systems which will provide a platform for long-term trading relationships in the future. As part of that effort, I headed trade missions earlier this year to China and the USA, during which I raised the subject of access for Irish beef with my ministerial counterparts. The Deputy will be aware that the issue of access for Irish beef to both of these markets are priorities for me. </p><p>  Other targeted markets for Irish beef access include Japan, Korea and the North African and Middle East regions. My Department is engaging actively with the authorities in these countries in order to secure access for beef products. There is a strong demand for beef globally and my Department remains focused, in consultation with the industry, on ensuring that Irish exporters are able to fully exploit the opportunities that flow from favourable market conditions.</p><p>Exploiting the strong sustainability credentials of the grass-fed Irish beef sector will be a key element in the strategy to develop international markets for Irish beef. In this context, the 32,000<font color="#FF0000"> </font>  members of the Bord Bia Beef Quality Assurance (QA) Scheme are committed to actively measuring and reducing their carbon emissions. This is the only QA programme in the world that has an environmental element operating on a national basis. It is my belief that this important development will give Irish beef exports a genuine competitive advantage in securing premium product status in fiercely competitive foreign markets. Improved product offerings backed by appropriate marketing are the best route to greater market returns and increased viability across the supply chain for all stakeholders &#8211; particularly producers.</p><p>  In addition, the leading Irish beef processing companies have also embraced the concept of sustainability under Origin Green. This is a comprehensive national sustainability development programme, the first of its kind in the world, designed by Bord Bia to assist Ireland become known as the optimum source of sustainably produced food and drink. Industry recruitment commenced in June 2012 and to date 79 companies, accounting for over 50% of Irish food and drink exports, have signed up to the programme. Central to the Origin Green concept is a sustainability charter that will commit Ireland&#8217;s agri-food industry, including beef processors, to engage directly and robustly with the challenges of sustainable production: reducing energy inputs, minimizing their overall carbon footprint and lessening their impact on the environment.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-06a.2224.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012110600060#WRNN01000"><p>I am committed to supporting the sheep industry, which makes a valuable contribution to the overall agri-food sector.  In this regard I very much welcome the fact that the declining trend in numbers in our national flock has been reversed and that our sheep numbers are now increasing. This reflects a growing sense of confidence amongst our sheep farmers in terms of rebuilding breeding stock numbers which will ultimately lead to an increase in through-put. So far this year through-put has increased by over 182,000 compared to last year. However I am aware that market conditions for Irish sheepmeat, particularly for light lambs, are proving more difficult than in 2012 mainly because of the recession in Spain and Portugal.  As with other agricultural sectors the market performance of the sheep sector, is a function of supply and demand. The long-term future of the sector will depend on its ability to satisfy the market and in order to do this well it must focus on competitiveness, innovation and the demands of the consumer. </p><p>  The Food Harvest 2020 Strategy includes specific recommendations for the sheep sector. It envisages that over the coming years, demand for sheepmeat on the European market will outstrip production levels, which could provide opportunities for exporting countries such as Ireland.  This should provide the potential for better returns, provided the industry can continue the market and product diversification which has been evident in recent years.  At producer level there is likely to be improved price prospects, provided an increased focus on production, efficiency and product quality is evident.  Based on a renewed commercial focus by the sheep sector, building consumption on the domestic market and through the implementation of the recommendations of Food Harvest 2020, the industry has targeted a growth in output value of 20% by 2020. </p><p>  The recommendations of the report focus on farm competitiveness and the processing sector. On the farm side, they emphasise the importance of continuing to apply on-farm efficiencies and new technologies, breed improvement and the production of a quality product. On the processing side, the focus is on efficiencies, innovation and improved product range. </p><p>  There has been significant public investment in the sheep sector in recent years. Key supports included &#8364;7 million from the 2009 Single Farm Payment National Reserve under the Uplands Sheep Payment Scheme and &#8364;54 million for the three-year Grassland Sheep Scheme which commenced in 2010. The sheep fencing/mobile handling equipment scheme, one of five Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS), which was re-opened to applications last December, will enable many farmers in the sheep sector to complete the necessary investment works in order to maintain competitiveness and introduce increased efficiencies on their farm and so secure the future of their enterprises. Teagasc has also allocated almost &#8364;1.5 million for sheep research for 2012.  In addition, Bord Bia will also spend over &#8364;1.1 million this year on a promotional strategy for the Irish sheep sector which addresses the issue of safeguarding the future of the sector in the following ways:<blockquote>-  By encouraging Irish consumers to buy more Quality Assured lamb.<br /><br />-  By collaborating with its French and English counterparts in a campaign to reverse the decline in consumption of lamb on the French market, which accounts for over 50% of our exports.<br /><br />-  By working with individual exporter to increase the amount of exports to higher value markets such as Germany and Scandinavia and thereby reduce Ireland&#8217;s dependency on the French market. </blockquote>  All of the supports I have outlined have provided a significant incentive to farmers to maintain their production levels, which is vital for the future of a viable sheep industry in Ireland.</p><p>  On a positive note, sheepmeat exports to international markets almost doubled to 600 tonnes during the course of 2011. This generates a great confidence boost for Irish exporters.  While almost 99% of our lamb exports are to the EU, it is always beneficial to have a wide range of outlets available and to this end my Department, together with Bord Bia and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to work to secure access to more third country outlets for Irish lamb. I announced the opening of the Singaporean and South African markets to Irish lamb over the summer. There is strong demand for all meats globally at present and my Department and I remain committed in our efforts to ensure that the Irish sheep sector is able to take full advantage of all of the opportunities that will arise as a result of this demand.  </p></reply>

The very wet weather during the summer months resulted in reduced grass growth and a reduction in yield and quality across a variety of crops including cereals, potatoes and vegetables.   In many cases, housing of stock has taken place during the summer with the feeding of forage earmarked for the winter period. There was also a significant reduction in the volume of winter feed saved on many farms with farmers also increasing the feeding of additional concentrates.</p><p>  With regard to the cereal sector, yield and quality of crops and wheat in particular were significantly reduced compared to previous years. Prices remained strong throughout the harvest period, however, helping to offset some of the potential losses to growers.</p><p>  Poor ground conditions in late September and on into October has also hindered autumn sowing. There will still be an opportunity next spring to make up some of this shortfall through increased sowings of spring wheat and spring barley if weather is good and grower sentiment remains positive. Supplies of winter wheat seed are well below average because the quality of the seed crop was seriously affected. My Department succeeded in obtaining a derogation from the EU Commission to allow seed of a lower germination capacity to be planted. This derogation together with the lower planting levels has alleviated problems with seed supplies this autumn.</p><p>  Unfortunately the EU Commission does not provide funding to compensate for losses that arise due to the adverse weather conditions experienced this summer and due to the financial crisis the Irish Exchequer is not in a position to assist either. The European Union Solidarity Fund is aimed primarily at providing funding to Member States in the event of a natural disaster. </p><p>  In order to ease the financial pressures on farmers as a result of the bad weather, I sought and received EU approval for the advance payment of the 2012 Single Payment Scheme.  A total of &#8364;538 million issued last month under the Single Farm Payment to almost 88% of all applicants, when taken with the &#8364;173 million which has issued since 26 September 2012 in respect of the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, represents a significant financial boost for both the individual farmers who will receive these payments and also the wider rural economy. My aim continues to be to maximise payments to farmers at the earliest possible date, subject to the necessary requirements of the Schemes being met.</p><p>In addition, following contact with my colleague Mr. Phil Hogan T.D., Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, an extension was granted to spread chemical and organic fertilisers to 30<sup>th</sup> September and 31<sup>st</sup>   October 2012 respectively. This was aimed at alleviating some of the difficulties arising from housing of livestock over the summer and to allow extended autumn grazing of grass and a positive impact on the fodder shortage.</p><p>While the extended period eased the overall situation regarding the management of slurry, difficulties still persisted for farms located on heavier soils, due to animals being housed earlier and for long periods. In response to this, Minister Hogan announced on 26<sup>th</sup>   October 2012 a number of further measures to alleviate the difficulties experienced by farmers. These can be summarised as follows:<blockquote>-  The closed period was brought forward to allow spreading from 1 January 2013 in Zones A and B and from 15 January 2013 in Zone C. <br /><br />-  The spreading of livestock manures produced on farms is now permitted as an exceptional measure during the period 1 November to 16 November inclusive subject to a number of conditions being met. </blockquote>  Minister Hogan also announced an exemption, subject to certain conditions, from establishing green cover for a limited number of tillage farmers who had either ploughed or sprayed with a non selective herbicide and, due to the bad weather, were not able to sow a crop that they had planned to do.</p></reply>

The Food Harvest 2020 report sets out the strategic vision for the agri-food and fishing sector.  From a dairying perspective, the ending of milk quotas in 2015 represents an exceptional opportunity to increase milk output, and Food Harvest has targeted a 50% increase in milk production in the period to 2020.  This target is ambitious but I also believe it is realistic, because the dairy sector has the capability to expand at producer and at processor level.</p><p>  In that context, the Dairy Expansion Activation Group established to identify specific actions needed to deliver on the Food Harvest targets, has produced a Road Map setting out 55 actions required to achieve the 50% increase in milk production. Key areas for action include the identification of markets, the improvement of efficiency at processing level and improving production efficiency at farm level.  While many of these actions will be taken at commercial level, my Department and its agencies are working with industry to provide a framework to support the necessary development, and I am personally chairing the High Level Implementation Committee, in order to monitor progress and take appropriate action to support the successful implementation of Food Harvest 2020.   </p><p>  Ireland has access to markets worldwide for dairy products and exports some 85% of our dairy production to over eighty countries, with more than two thirds of that going to the EU.  It is clear that markets will have to be found for the increased production envisaged in Food Harvest 2020.  I have been very active in developing relationships in new and expanding markets in order to build the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long-term trading relationships in the future.  As part of that effort I have headed trade missions to China, the US and Algeria to further develop these important relationships.  In China I met my ministerial counterparts in the Agriculture and Quarantine Ministries to help raise the profile of the Irish agri-food industry, including the dairy sector.  I will continue to work with industry to raise the profile of the Irish dairy sector, and the Irish agri-food sector generally, in emerging markets in the Far East, North Africa and elsewhere.</p></reply>

Food Harvest 2020 aims to increase employment in the seafood sector as a whole, from the present approximately 11,000 to 14,000 by 2020.  </p><p>  I am advised by Bord Iascaigh Mhara that some 2,870 people are presently employed in the seafood processing industry.  Arising specifically from an investment of &euro;15.5 million by 21 seafood processing companies in 2012, with &euro;3.2 million in financial assistance under the Seafood Processing Scheme operated by BIM, 142 additional jobs and increased sales of value added seafood products of nearly &euro;44 million are expected to be created by 2015.  That is a significant level of investment by any standards, and together with previous investment of &euro;7 million by 21 companies in 2011 and &euro;2.7 by 8 companies in 2010, with the support of the Seafood Processing Scheme, is setting a clear path to achievement of the potential of the seafood sector to create sustainable employment in peripheral coastal communities. </p><p>  In relation to aquaculture, it is intended to radically expand the production of Irish organic farmed salmon by creating new fish farming production areas in deeper waters. The placement of farms in deep waters will ensure that there is no impact on NATURA 2000 sites.    BIM estimates that just one of these production areas could generate over 100 Million Euro in exports p.a. and create 350 direct jobs.  A further 150 jobs will be created indirectly in the service sector, supplying fish feed, netting, transportation and other services.  </p><p>  BIM, working with the Marine Institute, is currently investigating suitable sites. An application for an aquaculture licence in respect of one of these sites in Galway Bay has been submitted to the Department by BIM.  This application is currently being assessed in accordance with the provisions of the 1997 Fisheries (Amendment) Act.</p></reply>

These rules aim to eliminate technical barriers to trade in live animals and to allow market organisations to operate smoothly, while ensuring a satisfactory level of welfare protection for the animals concerned and a satisfactory level of control in relation to the health risks associated with the movement of animals. </p></reply>

The scheme provided an incentive for sugar processors to renounce sugar quota and dismantle the associated sugar processing plant and it provided compensation for affected stakeholders. Greencore, the sole Irish sugar processor and holder of the Irish sugar quota, decided to avail of this scheme and accordingly the company renounced the quota and dismantled the last remaining sugar factory at Mallow in compliance with the conditions of the scheme. This was a commercial decision taken by the Company having regard to the deteriorating market situation.</p><p>  The total compensation package negotiated in November 2005 in the context of the reform of the EU sugar regime, as modified in 2007, was worth &euro;353m to Ireland, made up of &euro;220m to beet growers, &euro;6 million to machinery contractors and &euro;127 million to Greencore plc. The beet growers&rsquo; share was made up of restructuring aid of &euro;53 million, diversification aid of &euro;44 million and &euro;123 million via the Single Farm Payment.   All elements of the Restructuring Scheme have now been implemented, not just within Ireland but across the EU. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-06a.2267.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012110600060#WRNN03900"><p>There is a symbiotic relationship between primary production in the beef and dairy sectors. The removal of milk quotas will lead to increased production from the dairy herd post 2015. Maximising the value of increased beef from the dairy herd following the abolition of quotas presents an opportunity for the industry that can be of considerable benefit to both producers and processors. Current initiatives involving both Teagasc and the industry have an important role to play in this regard.</p><p>  Nonetheless, specialist beef producers will continue to provide the vital raw material for high-quality Irish beef and my Department and the agencies under its remit have continued to provide an array of financial and infrastructural supports to underpin production in this sector. These include initiatives such as the Beef Technology Adoption Programme, which is designed to equip beef farmers with the knowledge to improve efficiency at farm level and the advisory work of Teagasc, especially in connection with an expanded BETTER Beef Farm Programme, which provides a best practice model for suckler farmers. Other supports include the retention of the Suckler Cow Scheme in 2012 and the provision of funding to support the work of ICBF in improving genetic quality in the beef herd.</p><p>These measures are underpinned by the efforts of Bord Bia to promote and market Irish beef on EU and international markets. Exploiting the strong sustainability credentials of the grass-fed Irish beef sector will be a key element in the strategy to develop international markets for Irish beef. In this context, the 32,000<font color="#FF0000"> </font>  members of the Bord Bia Beef Quality Assurance (QA) Scheme are committed to actively measuring and reducing their carbon emissions. This is the only QA programme in the world that has an environmental element operating on a national basis. It is my belief that this important development will give Irish beef exports a genuine competitive advantage in securing premium product status in fiercely competitive foreign markets. To remain competitive in the marketplace, especially in the markets of the major retailers, it is essential that we can continue to substantiate claims of high-quality, sustainable production.</p><p>  Bord Bia has made considerable progress in developing a Brand Ireland concept, supported by its Origin Green initiative. This ongoing voluntary programme will enable Irish food business operators, including those in the beef sector, to sign up to measurable sustainability targets in a range of areas in a manner which supports the already strong green image of the Irish agri-food sector in the marketplace. </p><p>  Ireland exports around 93% of its beef production with the vast bulk of it destined for other EU member states. Nevertheless, it is always beneficial to have a wide range of alternative market outlets available for our high-quality beef products and my Department is working actively &#8211; in collaboration with the industry, Bord Bia and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade &#8211; to secure access to more third country markets for Irish beef. As a result of these efforts, Ireland has reached agreements over recent years with the authorities in Israel, Tunisia, Morocco, Turkey, Egypt and Singapore which allow for the export of Irish beef. </p><p>  I have also been assiduous in developing links and nurturing relationships in new and expanding markets in order to build confidence in Irish production and control systems which will provide a platform for long-term trading relationships in the future. As part of that effort, I headed trade missions earlier this year to China and the USA, during which I raised the subject of access for Irish beef with my ministerial counterparts. The Deputy will be aware that the issue of access for Irish beef to both of these markets are priorities for me. </p><p>  Other targeted markets for Irish beef access include Japan, Korea and those in North African and Middle East regions. My Department is engaging actively with the authorities in these countries in order to secure access for beef products. There is a strong demand for beef globally and my Department remains focused, in consultation with the industry, on ensuring that Irish exporters are able to fully exploit the opportunities that flow from favourable market conditions.</p><p>  On the back of strong beef prices, the income of Irish cattle farms increased by 48% in 2011. Despite the considerable improvement in income, there are still large numbers of small, low-income cattle farms that continue to be highly dependent on direct payments. In the course of the forthcoming Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) negotiations, I am determined to secure the best possible outcome for Irish farmers, including beef farmers. A number of options will be available in relation to farm support measures under the revised CAP and I will ensure that livestock farmers will continue to benefit from these income supports in the future.</p></reply>

Certain elements of CAP reform, largely related to funding, are being dealt with as part of the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework for the EU budget.  These elements will be decided by Heads of State and Government and a special meeting of the European Council has been convened for 22/23 November for this purpose.</p><p>  In parallel, the Agriculture Council is now scheduled to meet on 28/29 November and the intention of the Cyprus Presidency is to seek what is known as a &#8220;partial general approach&#8221; (essentially the position of the Council) on the CAP reform regulations.  </p><p>  for my part, as we enter a crucial stage of the negotiations, my priority remains to achieve the best possible outcome for Ireland, focusing on four key areas.  These are:<blockquote>-  delivering a well-resourced CAP,<br /><br />-  retaining Ireland&#8217;s share of CAP funds,<br /><br />-  maximising payment model flexibility for Member States, and <br /><br />-  as much simplification as possible for the farmer and the administration, subject to proper financial and operational controls.</blockquote></p></reply>

The Department has taken a number of steps over the past year in tandem with some of the other State and industry organisations to both raise awareness of the problem and educate farmers and their families on the dangers of working in this industry.   </p><p>One such measure taken by my Department was the inclusion of a Farm Safety message with the Single Payment application packs, which were distributed in March of this year to over 130,000 farmers.  This was a joint initiative between my Department, the Health and Safety Authority and the Farm Safety Partnership Committee and led to each of those farmers receiving an individual reminder of the importance of farming safely,   and the potentially fatal consequences of not doing so.</p><p>  The HSA produced an excellent DVD earlier this year containing testimonials from 6 individual farmers who provide an emotional telling of their experiences on farm which led to either fatalities or serious injury.  This DVD has been widely circulated and is included in all training courses undertaken by my Department. </p><p>  Teagasc and the HSA distributed a leaflet entitled &ldquo;Safe Slurry handling&rdquo; at the ploughing championships in September which details the safe operating procedures for the agitation of slurry and details the dangers of slurry gas. </p><p>My Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, had a joint article in the Irish Farmers Journal of 3rd   November 2012 about the requirements for inspection of slatted units and the safety issues around this.  The Department&rsquo;s specification for bovine livestock units and reinforced tanks (S.123) gives detailed advice in relation to the safe agitation of slurry, and safe design of tanks.</p><p>  There is no single action or organisation that can solve this difficult problem that impacts so horrendously, on so many lives, each year. Since taking office, I have continuously strived to increase awareness of safety issues among farmers which I believe is the key to changing the way we all think about farm safety on Irish farms.  We must all work together with the single goal of preventing farm accidents and therefore saving lives and minimising serious injuries.</p></reply>

The Attorney General has responded with a detailed advice on the issue which I am currently examining.  The advice highlights the difficulties in relation to the Constitution and in relation to the laws of the European Community relevant to the question of implementing a system of administrative sanctions for fisheries.</p><p>  There are many significant differences between the legal systems in Ireland and that of other EU Member States. Ireland&#8217;s constitutional and legal position provides certain basic rights which must be respected within our system of justice.</p><p>Furthermore, European Union legislation requires that penalties for fisheries offences must be &#8220;<i>effective, proportionate and dissuasive</i>  &#8221;. That is, they must act as a deterrent and they must also ensure that there is no benefit gained by infringing the rules. </p><p>  Given the nature of the penalties involved, there is a general requirement under the Constitution that alleged breaches of fisheries control regulations must be tried in a court of law.

It has been estimated these industries together support in excess of 27,300 jobs and contribute approximately &euro;1.4 billion in economic output annually.  A recent study on the Horse Racing Industry commissioned by my Department and undertaken by Indecon Economic Consultants,<i> &ldquo;A review of certain aspects of the Irish Horse Racing Industry&rdquo;</i>, considered <i>inter alia</i>  the funding and management of the industry in Ireland.  The report confirms the importance and potential of the Irish Horse Racing Industry and affirms that with appropriate policies and structures in place the sector can contribute significantly to the economic and social development of the country and to the expansion of employment.</p><p>The Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund (the Fund) was established under section 12(1) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 (the Act) for the purpose of giving support to the horse and greyhound racing industries.  State funding provided through the fund is pivotal to the survival of the horse and greyhound racing industries.</p><p>Amounts paid into the fund are approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas in accordance with the provisions of Section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001</p><p>When the Horse and Greyhound Fund was established in 2001 it was expected that it would be fully financed from the revenue from excise duty on off-course betting.  However the reduction in the rate of excise duty charged on off-course betting (5% down to 1%) combined with an increase in on-line and remote betting (which are currently outside the tax net) has led to a severe decline in the revenue from duty on off-course betting.  Revenue from excise cuty on off-course betting has declined from &euro;68 million in 2001 to approximately &euro;27 million in 2011.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Finance has published the Betting (Amendment) Bill 2012 which, when enacted, will ensure that all bookmakers taking bets from Ireland will pay  betting duty on those bets in the same way that betting shops currently do. Betting Exchanges will also be subject to tax under the new arrangements but the calculation of the tax will differ from that applying to bookmakers.</p><p>The Indecon report, referred to above, made recommendations aimed at securing the viability and sustainability of the horse racing industry so that it can make the maximum contribution to the economy.  The report&rsquo;s recommendations covering such areas as the funding of the industry, the structure, size and nomination process of the Board of Horse Racing Ireland (HRI), the opportunities for streamlining the functions of HRI the Racing Regulatory Authorities (Irish Turf Club/Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee) and strategies to optimise the marketing and competitiveness of the sector are at present being addressed.</p><p>Details of the amounts allocated to the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund are presented in the Table below.</p><p>The Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Year</div></th><th><div>Amount paid in to H&amp;G Fund </div></th><th><div>Betting duty receipts</div></th><th><div>Exchequer top-up</div></th></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>in year</div></td><td><div>in preceding year</div></td><td><div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>&#8364;m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;m</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2009</div></td><td><div>68.128</div></td><td><div>36.700</div></td><td><div>31.428</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2010</div></td><td><div>59.264</div></td><td><div>31.000</div></td><td><div>28.264</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>57.290</div></td><td><div>31.000</div></td><td><div>26.290</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>56.290</div></td><td><div>27.051</div></td><td><div>29.239</div></td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><td>The Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund</td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th><div>Year</div></th><th><div>Amount paid in to H&amp;G Fund </div></th><th><div>Betting duty receipts</div></th><th><div>Exchequer top-up</div></th></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>in year</div></td><td><div>in preceding year</div></td><td><div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>&#8364;m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;m</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2009</div></td><td><div>68.128</div></td><td><div>36.700</div></td><td><div>31.428</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2010</div></td><td><div>59.264</div></td><td><div>31.000</div></td><td><div>28.264</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>57.290</div></td><td><div>31.000</div></td><td><div>26.290</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>56.290</div></td><td><div>27.051</div></td><td><div>29.239</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

Returns to beef producers in individual EU markets reflect not only the local supply / demand balance but also overall trading conditions within the internal market and trade flows to third countries.  Buoyant European cattle prices in 2011 and 2012 are attributable to a supply deficit throughout the EU and to strong global demand.  In fact, Irish cattle prices have exceeded the EU average level for most of the year to date, with the Irish price for the benchmark grade only dipping below the EU producer price in August when countries such as Germany and Italy experienced supply shortfalls which had the effect of driving up prices substantially in those markets.</p><p>  Trade with the UK is impacted by fluctuations in the euro/sterling exchange rate and the extent of Britain&rsquo;s import requirement which is forecast to increase in the short run consequent on a continuing decline in domestic beef production.  With consumption expected to remain stable and a continuing reduction in the size of national cattle herd, British beef imports are predicted to grow from 381,000 tonnes in 2011 to 417,000 tonnes in 2013. </p><p>  A number of factors have been identified to account for the differential between Irish and UK cattle prices.  These include a British consumer preference for indigenous beef product.  In any analysis of comparative prices, it must also be recognised that UK cattle prices are currently among the highest in the EU.  Moreover, a price differential makes Irish beef products competitive in the UK market such that Ireland supplies the bulk of the UK&rsquo;s import demand, notwithstanding additional logistical and processing costs incurred in shipping to that market. When comparing Irish and UK cattle prices, it should be noted too that there is a significant exchange rate effect making the current UK price for a particular grade appear even higher compared to a year ago.</p><p>  In the longer term, the industry aims to maximise returns for Irish beef through its repositioning and differentiation strategy that focuses on the key attributes of Irish beef: environmentally sustainable, grass-based production systems, full traceability, Quality-Assurance at all stages and superior eating quality.</p><p>  In the meantime, my Department and its agencies will continue to support the sector through its efforts to open new markets for Irish beef and to ease the import conditions in markets that are already open.  These efforts have yielded a number of positive results in countries such as South Africa, Tunisia, Russia, UAE, Singapore and Egypt over the past year or so. </p><p>  In this context, you will also be aware that market access for beef was the focus of my visits earlier this year to China and the USA and that my Department is proactively engaged with a range of third countries in an ongoing effort to secure and expand market access.  My Department will prioritise international market access for both beef and live animals.</p><p>  I can also assure you that my Department will continue to facilitate live exports which have a dual function in stimulating cattle price competition and serving a real market demand.  In this context, both the Libyan and Lebanese markets have recently been opened for live cattle from Ireland.  In the case of Libya, my Department is working closely with the relevant veterinary authorities to increase the age limit from 24 months to 30 months.  The Lebanese market is open for fattening and slaughter cattle and for breeding cattle under 36 months of age.  The Egyptian market is also open for fattening cattle under 20 months and to slaughter cattle under 30 months.  The resumption of trade with these countries will depend on commercial factors and the availability of suitable transport options.</p></reply>

The hotline shall be available on the number 116 000.&quot; The same Directive also requires Member States to &quot;ensure that citizens are adequately informed of the existence and use of services provided under the 116 numbering range, in particular through initiatives specifically targeting persons travelling between Member States.&quot;</p><p>  The Hotline service will operate on two levels: the reporting of a missing child to the relevant authorities, the garda&iacute;, and the provision of emotional support to parents of missing children. </p><p>  Under EU telecoms rules agreed in 2009, the 116000 number is reserved in all EU member states for a missing children hotline.  My Department established and is leading a cross-sectoral Project Team, including representatives of my own Department, the Department of Justice and Equality, ComReg and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to advance this matter.  Following cross departmental consultation and an examination of the issues involved by the Project Team, ComReg, which has responsibility for the allocation of this number in Ireland, has now allocated the number to the ISPCC. The ISPCC has been successful in securing EU Daphne funding to support the establishment of the line.</p><p>  The operation of the Hotline is now a matter for the ISPCC, who have made a successful application for funding to the European Commission.  The ISPCC also submitted applications for funding to my Department to cover 1) set up costs in 2012 and 2) running costs for the Hotline for 2013. The application  for 2012 has been approved and the application for running costs for 2013 and subsequent years will be considered in the context of the annual budget estimates process and in the context of the service needs.</p><p>  Officials from my Department are liaising with the ISPCC in relation to the establishment of the 116000 hotline.  This includes finalising Memoranda of Understanding between the ISPCC and key partners, namely my Department, the HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Draft Memoranda are under consideration at present.</p><p>  It is important to note that the 116000 number is not an emergency number. Emergency calls should always be directed to the 999/112 number in the first instance, where the relevant emergency responses, including the recently launched Garda Missing Children Amber Alert mechanism, may be activated. The establishment of the 116000 line will, however, be of valuable support and assistance to families of missing children and to missing children themselves.</p><p>  In the interim the ISPCC has developed, with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, an interim response that is currently heard if one rings the 116000 number. The number advises callers to report a missing child to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and if it is a child calling for assistance to contact the ISPCC.  </p><p>  It is essential that the Hotline service is operated in accordance with all best practice standards.  To fulfil this, the ISPCC has advised that a phased implementation will be necessary.  It envisages that the number will become operational in December 2012 from 22:00-16:00 7 days a week and will be operating on a 24 hour basis by February 2013.  This will be considered a 'pilot' phase.  This will give the ISPCC the time to complete the necessary training, develop and implement formal relationships with statutory authorities, overcome technical troubleshooting and prepare a 116 000 service launch and awareness campaign.</p><p>  It is intended that an official launch will take place on 25 May 2013, which is International Missing Children Day.  The service launch bears particular importance as it is crucial that the public understand this is a support service rather than an emergency service.  The service launch will comprise of a media and event launch, face to face outreaches by ISPCC service staff and promotional materials. </p></reply>

I have received Government approval for the approach I am taking in developing to this strategy as an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland&rsquo;s early years sector aimed at providing a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to age six.  </p><p>  One of the priority issues of policy which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the new strategy is the development of the child minding sector as a fully-integrated component of early childhood care and education, in particular for under-one age group.  As part of this, issues relating to regulation and inspection of child minding will be considered.</p><p>  At present pre-school services are regulated under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No.2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991.</p><p>  Services providing care for children who have not yet commenced primary school are required to notify their service to the pre-school inspectorate of the Health Service Executive (HSE) and are subject to inspection and report by the Inspectorate on a regular basis.  Services covered by the regulations include full-time, part-time and sessional services as well as childminders taking care of more than three pre-school children from different families in the childminder&rsquo;s home.  </p><p>  The national guidelines for childminders, compiled by the National Childcare Coordinating Committee which oversees the development of an integrated childcare infrastructure throughout the country, provide guidance to childminders on good practice, and assist them to decide whether they are subject to the regulations, as well as providing other useful information on the role of the childminder in the provision of childcare services.  In that context, city and county childcare committees encourage childminders to voluntarily notify themselves to their local committee and in 2011 there were over 1200 services notified in this way.  Work to encourage voluntary notification and the active involvement of childminders in training and information activities will continue.</p><p>  As is the case with all regulatory requirements, the child care regulations set the minimum standards which services are legally required to comply with.  However, my Department is pro-active in monitoring, promoting and developing the highest standards of care and education throughout the sector, including the regulatory environment, given the important role which these services play in this crucial phase of children&rsquo;s lives.</p><p>  The Children First national guidance for the protection and welfare of children, which I published in 2011, provides clarity and guidance for individuals and organisations in identifying and responding appropriately to child abuse and neglect. It also sets out what organisations that care for or work with children should do to ensure they are safe whilst in the care of the organisation.  The Government has committed, as a priority, to the introduction of legislation to underpin Children First.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that I published the heads of the Children First Bill in April 2012. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that organisations and professionals who work with children have a statutory responsibility to report reasonable concerns about the abuse or neglect of children in their care to the HSE child and family services.</p><p>  I asked the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children to consider the heads of the Children First Bill and make recommendations.  I received their comprehensive report in July and  I thank the committee for its work on this matter.  My Department is currently considering the broad range of submissions to, and recommendations of the committee, including those submissions pertaining to the issue of childminders, and I hope to be in a position to publish the Bill in the coming months.</p></reply>

In these circumstances, future adoptions from Ethiopia would require a bilateral agreement between Ireland and Ethiopia. The negotiation of bilateral agreements on intercountry adoption with states who have not ratified the Hague Convention is governed by Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010 which states that &quot;the Authority, with the prior consent of the Minister, may enter into discussions with any non-contracting state concerning the possibility of the Government entering into a bilateral agreement with that State.&quot;  </p><p>  The Adoption Authority delegation visit to Ethiopia in April of this year was an initial part of the Authority's deliberations on the feasibility and suitability of entering into discussions with Ethiopia on a bilateral adoption agreement.

Under the provisions of the legislation, such adoptions may take place up to the end of October 2013. </p><p>  As regards adoptions thereafter, Russia has not ratified the Hague Convention; therefore, future adoptions from Russia, beyond those provided for under the transitional arrangements, may only be possible under a bilateral agreement.  The negotiation of bilateral agreements on intercountry adoption with states who have not ratified the Hague Convention is governed by Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010. Any bilateral arrangements which might be entered into would be required by law to meet the minimum standards set out in the Hague Convention. </p><p>  It is the role of the Adoption Authority to make an assessment of whether the intercountry adoption legislation and practices in a non-contracting state, in this case Russia, are in compliance with both Irish legislation and the principles of the Hague Convention.  As part of this assessment the Adoption Authority has reviewed a draft bilateral agreement presented to it during previous discussions with its Russian counterparts and has provided me with an initial assessment in this regard.  I have asked the Adoption Authority to have further exploratory talks with the Russian authorities focussing on areas of concern in order that the Authority may progress its assessment of the situation and provide a definitive recommendation to me on the feasibility of formally opening discussion with the Russian Federation under Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010. The Adoption Authority, through the Irish Embassy in Moscow, have sought to meet the Russian authorities in this regard. The Russian authorities have indicated that they are not in a position to facilitate such a meeting until the first quarter of 2013. The Adoption Authority is following-up to secure an appropriate date. </p><p>  Further information on intercountry adoption from Russia can be found on the Adoption Authority website (www.aai.gov.ie). </p></reply>

The Referendum will not address all wider issues that impact on children.</p><p>  This Referendum is the fundamental backdrop to the wider Programme for Change for Children being pursued by the Government. These reforms focus on intervention to ensure the safety and welfare of children and to ensure that child protection services can respond proportionately to all child protection concerns. </p><p>Central to the Programme for Change for Children is the plan to take child protection services out of the HSE and establish a new dedicated Child and Family Support Agency. This Agency will be fully operational in 2013 and will mean a move to a situation where child and family welfare will be<b></b>  the sole focus of a single dedicated agency, overseen by a single dedicated government Department.</p><p>  The report of the Taskforce, which I set up to advise on how to best organise services for children in this country, was published in July of this year. This Taskforce report maps out an executive agenda for the development of services so that we can do the very best for parents, children and families. Ahead of establishment of the new Agency, an additional &#8364;21 million in funding has been made available to the HSE Child &amp; Family Services in 2012. This reflects the priority attached by Government to the reform of child welfare and protection services.</p><p>  Since February 2011, there has been an increase of 69 whole time equivalents (wte) and 86 individual child and family social workers and an increase in the proportion of children with an allocated social worker. </p><p>  The question of resource allocation in the areas of health and education are matters for my colleagues the Minister for Health and the Minister for Education and Skills. During the summer Minister of State Kathleen Lynch published the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services. This Review recommended a significant restructuring of the current disability services programme towards a model of person-centred individually chosen supports to enhance the quality of life and well-being of both children and adults with disabilities. This Government is committed to the protection of frontline services for pupils with special educational needs, in order to ensure that every child in the State, regardless of ability, can access education and to ensure that the individual requirements of pupils with special educational needs can continue to be met.</p><p>  Overall, the matter of resources for services to children will be considered by the Government in the context of the overall budgetary arrangements for 2013. While it is not open to me, in that context, to pre-empt decisions to be made by Government, I would point out that the Government continues to invest very significantly in services for children across a range of areas. The Government will continue this approach, to the greatest possible extent, in dealing with the serious financial challenges facing the country overall. </p></reply>

In line with the Programme for Government, my Department has made a significant commitment to maintaining the universal free pre-school year.  About 65,000 children, that is approximately 95% of children in the year before school, are availing of the free pre-school provision at this time.   </p><p>  In 2011, the ECCE programme cost approximately &euro;163 million.  Additional funding has been made available for 2012 when the cost of the programme is expected to rise to &euro;175 million to cater for changing demographics and provide for the increased number of children in the relevant age cohort. </p><p>  I am aware of the need to further develop the early childhood care and education sector.     However, any development that involved further provision of pre-school would require considerable additional funding and given the financial constraints under which the Government is currently operating it is not possible to provide for any enhancements to the programme at this time.  I am also very conscious that work is continuing on improvement of quality within the pre-school year. All of the available evidence indicates that the quality of the provision is key to good outcomes for children. I would therefore hope to invest further in quality before expanding the programme. </p><p>  Future developments relating to early years care and education will, of course, be considered during preparation of the new National Early Years Strategy 2012.</p></reply>

To examine the overall cost of long-term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating/setting prices, </p><p>3.

To make recommendations for the future operation and management of the scheme.</p><p>As the Scheme is statutory based, the implementation of any recommendations arising from the review may require significant amendments to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, 2009.</p><p>A considerable amount of preparatory work for the review has already been completed.

The Health Research Board (HRB) is a statutory body under the aegis of the Department of Health and is the lead agency in Ireland supporting and funding health research. It provides funding for and conducts research linked to national health priorities. The aim of this research is to improve people's health, build health research capacity and make a significant contribution to Ireland's knowledge economy. All research projects  submitted to the HRB are subjected to a rigorous international peer review process.</p><p>Funding provided through the HRB for research on cancer incidence, causes and treatment and  research on brain tumour incidence, causes and treatment  for the years 2009 , 2010 and 2011 is set out in the table below (figures provided by the HRB). These figures include funding provided  by the HRB to the All Ireland Cooperative Oncology Research Group (ICORG).</p><p><table><tr><th colspan="4">Cancer Research</th></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>2009<br />( 000)</div></td><td><div>2010 <br />(000)</div></td><td><div>2011 <br />(000)</div></td></tr><tr><td>HRB Research funding on cancer incidence, causes and treatment ( including ICORG funding)</td><td><div>&#8364;9,432</div></td><td><div>&#8364;7,709</div></td><td><div>&#8364;9,233</div></td></tr><tr><td>ICORG funding on cancer incidence , causes and treatment</td><td><div>&#8364;4,204</div></td><td><div>&#8364;3,432</div></td><td><div>&#8364;4,850</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td><div>&#8364;9,432</div></td><td><div>&#8364;7,709</div></td><td><div>&#8364;9,233</div></td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Brain Research</td></tr><tr><td>HRB Research funding on brain tumour incidence, causes and treatment  (including ICORG funding)</td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>&#8364;93</div></td><td><div>&#8364;185</div></td></tr><tr><td>ICORG  funding on brain tumour incidence, causes and treatment</td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>&#8364;5</div></td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td><div>&#8364;93</div></td><td><div>&#8364;185</div></td></tr></table></p><p>According to the HRB the level of research activity into the incidence, causes and treatment of brain tumours is very low in Ireland  relative to other research areas and cancer types (e.g. breast cancer). The relatively small proportion of studies in brain cancer is a consequence of various factors, such as a small patient population, the number of available specialist clinicians who are active in clinical research, and a generally low number of experimental treatments coming through the pipeline for brain cancer both in a local and global context. The figures concerning research  on brain tumours relates to those studies where the study is wholly or predominantly focusing on brain tumours. It is entirely possible that some of the projects highlighted in the broader &lsquo;cancer&rsquo; category may involve, in some way, a portion of research activity that relates to brain tumours.</p><p>In May 2013,  during the Irish  Presidency of the Council of the European Union,  Ireland will co-host, with the European Commission (DG Research and Innovation),  a conference on the future of brain research in Europe.</p></reply>

Live testing of the programme is now underway to ensure that all systems and processes operate effectively.  </p><p>  When fully implemented the programme will offer free screening to men and women aged 55-74 every two years.  As 50% of cancers within this age group are found in people aged 60-69 the programme will begin with this latter age cohort (a population of approximately 500,000).  It is anticipated that the first round will take up to three years to complete.  Over time the phasing of the programme will allow development of colonoscopy capacity to cater for the full 55-74 year age population.</p><p>  Fifteen candidate colonoscopy units have been identified around the country to support the screening programme.  Each candidate unit has responsibility to take a number of actions to become a screening colonoscopy unit which include achieving or be well on the pathway to achieving NHS JAG accreditation, demonstrating capability of meeting the needs of the screening programme in accordance with its Quality Assurance Standards and maintaining service requirements for symptomatic patients within national targets. </p><p>  The candidate colonoscopy units are:</p><p>  Cavan General Hospital; </p><p>  Connolly Hospital, Dublin; </p><p>  Kerry General Hospital,Tralee;</p><p>  Letterkenny General Hospital; </p><p>  Louth County Hospital, Dundalk;</p><p>  Mayo General Hospital, Castlebar; </p><p>  Mercy University Hospital, Cork; </p><p>  Midland Regional Hospital, Tullamore; </p><p>  Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Ennis; </p><p>  Sligo General Hospital; </p><p>  South Tipperary General Hospital, Clonmel; </p><p>  St James&rsquo;s Hospital, Dublin; </p><p>  St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital, Dublin; </p><p>  The Adelaide and Meath Hospital Dublin incorporating the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Tallaght;</p><p>  Wexford General Hospital.</p><p>  The process of approving the colonoscopy units is underway, and a key objective is to ensure that the screening programme does not interfere with the symptomatic colonoscopy services in these hospitals.  The NCSS is confident that there will be adequate capacity to provide this important part of the programme.  </p><p>  I regard the colorectal screening programme as a national priority. I am pleased that it will shortly commence, and I am committed to supporting it as it develops.</p></reply>

It is important to point out that generic medicines must meet exactly the same standards of quality and safety and have the same effect as the originator medicine. All of the generic medicines on the Irish market are required to be properly licensed and meet the requirements of the Irish Medicines Board.

This system will address the deficiencies of the paper based process and will also ensure that standardised work practices are implemented across hospitals. In the meantime, the Department has agreed, in principle, a system of improved cash-flow and accelerated payment with private health insurers.

The HSE estimates that the cost of new drugs in 2012 will be approximately &euro;15 million. Examples include the cancer drug, Ipilimumab, and the Hepatitis C drugs, Boceprevir and Teleprevir. The cost of new drugs between 2013 and 2015 is estimated to be approximately &euro;70 million per annum. It is estimated that the recent agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) will generate gross savings of up to &euro;116m in 2013.

Generic substitution allows pharmacists to substitute a cheaper generic equivalent, at the patient&rsquo;s request, when a more expensive product has been prescribed. Reference pricing involves setting a common reimbursement amount for selected groups of medicines, which will be done by the HSE. Only the reference price is reimbursed by the State. Eligible patients can avoid out-of-pocket payments by opting for a generic medicine at or below the reference price. </p><p>  Reference pricing coupled with generic substitution provides patients with an incentive to opt for the cheapest available product, but does not impose any unavoidable additional costs on patients. As more medicines come off patent, the introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing will ensure that both taxpayers and patients will benefit from increased competition in the pharmaceutical market. </p><p>  Savings will be achieved by limiting reimbursement to the reference price, allowing patients to opt for less expensive versions of the prescribed medicine, and promoting price competition between the manufacturers of interchangeable medicines.</p></reply>

The hospital will retain the level of services required to provide services in its 24 hour Emergency Department (ED), into the future. The newly opened ED and the two recently appointed ED consultants are testament to this achievement along with the upskilling and development of nursing posts to the role of advanced nurse practitioner.  The new ED provides the environment to deliver a range of services in an appropriate environment for both those attending as well as the staff who provide the service. </p><p>  Allied to that, there has been an expansion in consultant physician numbers in the hospital in conjunction with the impending opening of the new Acute Medical Assessment Unit and the associated relocation of cardiology services to new facilities within the hospital.  Tralee Community Nursing Unit was recently opened and this enabled the transfer of long stay care services from the acute hospital to more appropriate facilities, a move greatly welcomed by the community.  There has also been an expansion in consultant surgeon numbers.  These are just some of the positive developments that have taken place and are not the mark of a hospital with a doubt as to its future.</p><p>  Surgical services in Kerry General Hospital are currently delivering well in excess of the funded level of provision. Hospital management, in conjunction with the consultant surgeons, put measures in place to control the position or it would otherwise have placed the hospital in further financial difficulty.  Prudent management is required to ensure appropriate measures are in place to provide service to the funded level and not beyond. In this regard it is also important to be clear that at no stage has there been a reduction imposed or considered in relation to emergency surgery in the hospital.</p><p>  All clinical targets such as in-patient and day procedure activity have to be adhered to and where there are areas of activity over the service plan targets control measures are put in place to bring activity into line with the hospital service plan.  For example in Kerry General Hospital sixty theatre lists were removed over the summer period to control activity levels in line with resource and this will be extended as necessary.  This has culminated in a necessary planned reduction of theatre usage over the coming months.  </p><p>  It is acknowledged that there are significant challenges in delivering services in the current economic environment.  As with all public hospitals, there is an increasing demand for services at Kerry General Hospital.  Despite the high level of flexibility shown by the staff to maintain and improve the level and quality of service, the task is a constant and significant challenge.  The management team at Kerry General Hospital are aware of these issues and are constantly working to resolve them. </p><p>  The delivery of safe services has remained the priority across the Kerry Area in 2012 and the cooperation and flexibility of staff across the services, in line with the requirements of the Public Service Agreement, has yielded significant success.</p><p>  The Regional Service Plan 2012 set out an ambitious programme of reorganisation of services given the position that there would be a reduction in staffing and available funding.  The evidence as outlined for the Kerry Area shows that significant progress has been made in the majority of the targets as set out in the plan.  The hospital in particular is working with the requirements of the clinical programmes in acute medicine, surgery and emergency medicine, to be as efficient as possible in the face of the demand for the services, and will continue to do so to the year end.  </p><p>  With regard to consultant positions in the hospital, vacancies are being processed through the Public Appointments Service in order to replace staff who have retired.  Replacement positions in the areas of radiology, anaesthetics, and orthopaedic surgery are currently being processed in this manner.  Two replacement positions in paediatrics have recently been filled.  </p><p>  Finally, there should be no concern with regard to the future of Kerry General Hospital as a level three hospital, and the above outline of developments show that the hospital remains of significant importance in the network of acute services in the South area.</p></reply>

Generic substitution allows pharmacists to substitute a cheaper generic equivalent, at the patient&rsquo;s request, when a more expensive product has been prescribed. Reference pricing involves setting a common reimbursement amount for selected groups of medicines, which will be done by the HSE. Only the reference price is reimbursed by the State. Eligible patients can avoid out-of-pocket payments by opting for a generic medicine at or below the reference price. </p><p>  Reference pricing coupled with generic substitution provides patients with an incentive to opt for the cheapest available product, but does not impose any unavoidable additional costs on patients. </p></reply>

It set out 10 priority recommendations and many of these are already being taken forward. Areas of ongoing collaboration include - child protection, cancer research, health promotion, suicide prevention, radiotherapy services, paediatric congenital cardiac surgery and a range of initiatives under the Interreg IVA funding initiative.  The  Study was published on the websites of the Irish Department of Health and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  in Northern Ireland  last December. </p><p>  At a departmental level co-operation between  the two jurisdictions  is active and ongoing.  &quot;Transforming Your Care: a Review of Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland.&quot; also recommends co-operation on a number of key issues. My officials are liaising with their counterparts in the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  in Northern Ireland on how to progress these issues. </p><p>  A good example of North South cooperation is the development of new radiotherapy facilities at Altnagelvin Hospital, where it is expected that services will commence in 2016.  The Unit will provide more locally accessible and timely services and improve patient travelling times for patients in the North Western area, particularly patients in the Donegal area.</p><p>  The Minister has committed once-off capital funding up to a ceiling of &euro;19 million for the project and the HSE will fund the provision of radiotherapy services for patients from the Republic of Ireland.   These patients will continue to have their diagnosis, surgery and other treatment planning in either Letterkenny General or Galway University Hospital, or one of the eight designated cancer centres. Chemotherapy will also be provided in either Letterkenny or Sligo General Hospital.  Complex cancers, e.g. pancreatic cancer, will be managed at the designated cancer centres.</p><p>  With regards to paediatric congenital cardiac surgery in particular there have been two meetings between the Department of Health and the Department of Health and Social Services and Public Safety and contacts are continuing with a view to determining as soon as possible how best an all-island service might be established and how soon this could be realised if it is determined, through consultation, to be the optimum solution. Another meeting is to take place on 9th November and in the meantime a project team comprising the hospital, HSE and Department of Health in Dublin is working on the issue to establish precisely the requirement to put in place this all-island service.</p><p>   I am committed to working together with my Northern colleagues on issues of common concern and benefit. This is of particular relevance  in the current time when both jurisdictions are implementing change and pushing forward  health reform.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the agreement net liability between the two countries is calculated on a lump sum basis rather than an individual basis. The amount payable is the net difference between the costs to the Irish health services of providing care to those with only UK entitlements and the cost to the UK health services of providing services to those with only Irish entitlements.  The payment made in any one year is based on an estimate of the number of persons falling within categories eligible for reimbursement and for whom each country is liable and an estimate of the average cost of providing health care treatment.  The amount payable is agreed following compilation of the necessary data and discussions between the two administrations.  Payments are made in advance and are subject to final settlement once all necessary statistical and financial information is complete.  Total payments in any one year can relate to both final settlements in respect of previous years' liabilities and advance payments in respect of the current year.</p><p>  By far the largest part of the net payment received from the UK authorities on an annual basis relates to the provision of health care to UK pensioners and their dependants residing in Ireland.  The estimated number of pensioners for whom each country is liable was based on a survey by both administrations undertaken every three years, the most recent of which was completed in 2008.  Recently both administrations agreed in principle to work towards a form of pensioner registration which will form the basis for calculating pensioner reimbursement costs in the future and agreed interim arrangements, based on previous survey results trends, for determining pensioner liability pending the implementation of same.</p><p>  The amounts are received by the Health Service Executive as Appropriations-in-Aid and are offset against the gross funding requirements of the Executive at national level thus reducing the net liability to the Exchequer.  A net amount of &euro;270 million was received under the bilateral agreement in 2011.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, it has become necessary for the HSE to suspend certain products from its list of reimbursable items.  These include glucosamine, omega-3 triglyceride products, orlistat, and gluten-free products.</p><p>  Glucosamine is indicated for the management of symptoms of osteoarthritis.  The National Centre for Pharmoeconomics (NCPE) have assessed the cost-effectiveness of glucosamine on two occasions and concluded that it did not offer value for money to the HSE.  However, glucosamine products are available over the counter without prescriptions.</p><p>  Omega-3 triglyceride products (e.g. Omacor) have been identified both nationally and internationally as not being cost effective or being of lesser benefit to patients. However, these products are also available over the counter without prescriptions, as is Orlistat.</p><p>  Gluten-free products have become more widely available in supermarkets in recent years and tend to be significantly cheaper than products sold through community pharmacies.  A Supplementary Welfare Allowance Adult Diet Supplement may be awarded by the Department of Social Protection to eligible persons.  Persons wishing to apply for this allowance can do so by completing an application form which can be downloaded at the following link: .  Separate application forms are available for children. For persons who are not awarded a Diet Supplement, moneys spent on gluten-free foods can be taken into account for tax purposes.</p><p>  A full list of items available under the community drug schemes is available on the HSE's Primary Care Reimbursement Service website, www.pcrs.ie (choose 'List of Reimbursable Items').  In addition, the monthly updates (additions and deletions) to the product list are provided at the same location under ''.</p></reply>

Occasionally, due to logistical factors outside of the HSE's control, it can prove challenging to have the permanent replacement in situ prior to the existing contractor's departure but where this arises, temporary arrangements, such as the appointment of a locum or cross cover by other GPs in the locality, are put in place in the interim.</p><p>  In the case of unforeseen vacancies arising due to the sudden death of a GP, the HSE is required to put an interim arrangement in place to ensure continuity of service for patients pending the engagement of a replacement GP contractor(s).  This would involve locum cover or cross cover as mentioned above.In the case of sudden incapacity, the GP (where he/she is in a position to do so) would organise the interim cover arrangements and where he/she is not in a position to so do, the HSE would make the necessary arrangements pending either the GPs return to duty or the engagement of a replacement GP contractor(s).</p><p>  I should point out that at no time in any of the above scenarios are GMS patients left without a named doctor.  It is also worth noting that the enactment of the Health (Provision of General Practitioner Services) Act 2012 is of relevance in this context.

Since 2011 this 95% rate has been achieved for 6 in 1 vaccination.  This protects children against Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, Polio Hepatitis B and Haemophilous Influenzae type b.

The aim of the Review was to consider all the possible options for the earliest possible delivery of a new children's hospital. The group presented its report to me in June.</p><p>  Since the report has been presented to me I have been carefully considering its contents and the issues involved and have sought further detailed analysis on technical issues from members of the Dolphin Group with particular expertise in these areas. I will bring the report and supplementary analysis to Government shortly, with my recommendation. Together in consultation with my colleagues in the cabinet we will then make a decision on the location of the new children's hospital.</p><p>  While my Department has had informal contact with the individual referred to in regard to the new children's hospital, no independent report or formal advice has been sought from this individual nor from any other individual separate to the Dolphin Group. There is one process only. I can assure the Deputy that at the heart of any decision that is made in relation to the new children's hospital, the needs of the patient will be central to this process.</p></reply>

It is supported by a National Co-ordinating Group which has representatives from the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills in addition to other key stakeholders. The Programme is based on the recommendations of the <i>Report of the National Reference Group on Multidisciplinary Services for Children aged 5-18 Years</i> produced by representatives of the professions and management involved in delivering multi-disciplinary services to children which is available on the HSE website www.hse.ie. </p><p>  The Programme aims to address the following issues in relation to children&#8217;s disability services:<blockquote>-  Inequity of access to services due to inconsistent development of services;<br /><br />-  Environmental change arising from the reorientation towards mainstream education leading to increasing demand for health services to support inclusion;<br /><br />-  Increasing demand for services due to population growth and increased identification of children with disability;<br /><br />-  The need to re-align services with emerging primary care and integrated service structures.</blockquote>  Implementation of the Programme encompasses two elements:<blockquote>-  Ongoing work in co-ordinating and re-organising early intervention services for children aged 0-5 years into integrated, geographically based teams;<br /><br />-  Supporting the re-organisation of services for school-age children aged 5-18 years according to the same model.</blockquote>  The Programme is rolling out at national, regional and local level and involves representatives from the health and education sectors, statutory and non-statutory service providers and parents working together to see how current services can best be re-organised.  </p><p>  The HSE is working very closely with the education sector, which is fully involved in the development of the Programme, to ensure that, from the children&#8217;s and parents&#8217; perspective, the services provided by each sector are integrated. An Education and Health Working Group, comprising representatives of both sectors, is developing a framework for closer working relationships.</p><p>  Information concerning implementation of the Programme is available on the HSE&#8217;s Change Hub learning and development website www.hseland.ie. This includes an updated Project Plan covering 2011/2012 with updated targets, as identified in the HSE National Service Plan 2012. While significant progress has been made to date in rolling out the Programme, targets in some areas have not been met for a variety of reasons. Local Implementation Groups have now commenced in all but two areas. Quarterly reports on progress and achievement in meeting targets are monitored by the Programme&#8217;s National Co-ordinating Group.</p><p>  Decisions regarding any local re-organisation of services are the responsibility of the Local Implementation Groups (LIGs). These include stakeholders such as representatives of the service providers involved, parents and the educational sector representatives. Detailed local area action plans are being developed by the LIGs with the following objectives:<blockquote>- One clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need;<br /><br />- Resources used to the greatest benefit for all children and families;<br /><br />- Health and education working together to support children to achieve their potential.</blockquote>  The long term goal of this Programme is to bring consistency in service delivery and a clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need. Implementation of this Programme will have a positive impact on the provision of clinical services for all children requiring access to health related supports, regardless of where they live or which pre-school or school they attend. While the Programme supports the principle of providing access to mainstream education where appropriate, it also recognises a continuing role for special schools.</p></reply>

Numerous information sessions for parents' groups have also taken place.  </p><p>  The National Disability Databases assist in informing the regional and national planning of disability services by providing information on current service use and future service need.

These expert committees consider that aspartame is safe for use and have established an acceptable daily intake (ADI) for aspartame of 40-50 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day.  This ADI is applicable to both adults and children over the age of 12 weeks and therefore there are no additional restrictions on the use of aspartame in food particularly consumed by children. </p><p>  However, following some recent concerns regarding the safety of aspartame raised by several members of the European Parliament and the publication of several new studies on aspartame, EFSA is currently undertaking a full re-evaluation of the safety of the sweetener.  This will be completed by May 2013 following a period of public consultation on the draft evaluation report. This consultation period is planned to commence at the end of 2012.</p><p>  It should also be noted that the FSAI reviews all information on approved food additives such as aspartame on an ongoing basis. Based on current information available the FSAI consider that aspartame is safe for use.</p></reply>

There are always more construction projects than can be funded from the Exchequer's capital health care allocation.  The Health Service Executive is required to prioritise infrastructure projects within its overall capital envelope taking into account the existing capital commitments and costs of completion over the period.</p><p>  It is understood that the Deputy, in asserting that a PCC was to be delivered in Rowlagh by way of the HSE&rsquo;s capital programme, may be referring to lists reported in the media.  It is important to state that these lists related to work that was ongoing; that they were work in progress.  The prioritisation exercise is a dynamic process, constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances, including the feasibility of implementation.</p><p>  An assessment/evaluation of each proposed primary care centre location was undertaken with the infrastructural requirement evaluated under three headings: deprivation index, service priority and accommodation assessment.  The selection of a delivery mechanism was not, however, solely dependent on the resultant priority or ranking.  The delivery mechanism selected for each location was based on suitability and the availability of funding (insofar as it is known at any point in time).  The following considerations were taken into account:</p><p>  -Agreements for lease in place - where there were good prospects of the leased centre being delivered - these locations remained as lease strategy;</p><p>  -The size of the centre - the larger centres are more attractive to PPP bidders; </p><p>  -Extensions to existing facilities or refurbishment of existing buildings are not suitable projects for PPP.</p><p>  The change  in the delivery method for a potential PCC in Rowlagh/North Clondalkin was on the advice of the Head of Estates in the HSE, as PPP was considered to be the most expeditious method by which progress in this development could commence.</p><p>  The method and time scale for the delivery of PCCs is dependent on a number of factors and the list will continue to be reviewed and revised as necessary.  It is envisaged that approximately 20 of the 35 potential locations published as part of the Government's Infrastructure Stimulus Package will be progressed by way of PPP.  The current position is that the HSE is engaging with the NDFA as required to progress the Primary Care Centre Public Private Partnership Programme. The HSE is currently analysing the available sites in each location and engaging with the GPs in each location to determine their interest in participating in the primary care centre development.  It is not possible, at this time, to give start and completion dates for any of the 20  potential locations.</p></reply>

As an example, the Department is aware of reminiscence therapy in St Raphael's Centre, Youghal aimed at older clients and the introduction of care standards by the Daughters of Charity Services to support people with intellectual disability and dementia.</p><p>  However, the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services, which was published in July this year, recommended a person-centred supports model and an assessment of need process which addresses the needs of the individual at whatever point they are in the life cycle.  A person's requirements for supports and services should be re-assessed at the individual's request, at key transition periods or following a change in the individual's health or personal circumstances, in order to ensure that services are responsive to the changing needs of the individual.  This re-assessment process should be practical and capable of being integrated into an agency's person-centred planning and manpower utilisation and deployment planning process.</p><p>  The National Disability Databases assist in informing the regional and national planning of disability services by providing information on current service use and future service needs.  The Databases are managed by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department of Health.  The National Intellectual Disability Database Annual Report for 2011, points to a changing age profile in those people with disabilities.  This reflects an increase in the lifespan of people with intellectual disability and along with the general demographic trend, has major implications for planning for services designed specifically to meet the needs of older people with intellectual disability.  </p><p>  The Department has provided funding towards the Intellectual Disability (ID) Supplement to the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, which was developed with a view to bridging the information gap that currently exists in Ireland in relation to ageing amongst those with intellectual disability.  Over the next 10 years, the Supplement will chart and provide in-depth information on all domains of the lives of those participants, including their health, social, economic, environmental and psychological status.  The data which becomes available from the ID Supplement, will be available to inform the ongoing planning and delivery of services to people with intellectual disability as they age.</p></reply>

It is effectively a loan advanced by the State which can be repaid at any time, but which will ultimately fall due for repayment upon the applicant's death. In order to avail of ancillary State support, the HSE must register a Charging Order against the asset. The Charging Order is a simple type of mortgage which secures the money loaned by the HSE.</p><p>  The fact that an applicant to the Scheme has availed of an equity release scheme is not, of itself, a barrier to ancillary State support being approved. In such cases any money that applicant received from the equity release which is still in their possession would be taken into account during the financial assessment and any equity remaining in the asset may still be considered for the loan. However, the HSE does not have to approve an application for ancillary state support where it is not satisfied that there is sufficient equity remaining in the asset to ensure the security of the loan.</p></reply>

It must be recognised that Irish-trained doctors choose to go abroad for a variety of reasons, including further training. Many return having gained further skills and expertise.</p><p>  The number of Consultant posts in the public health service has increased by 31% since 2005, from 1,947 in 2005 to 2,580 in September 2012, reflecting the policy of moving to a consultant provided-service. </p><p>  The NCHD workforce currently stands at 4,889 WTE &ndash; its highest number in some years. This reflects intensive efforts by the HSE in recent years to maximise recruitment and retention and measures to make posts more attractive for candidates. Since 11th July 2012, 81% of NCHD posts are part of structured training schemes run by the postgraduate training bodies and funded by the HSE. Nineteen percent are service posts wherein doctors are required to participate in professional development programmes run by the postgraduate training bodies and funded by the HSE. </p><p>  Recent developments include a 30% increase in GP training places available, from 120 to 157 per year; the introduction of 40 additional intern posts in specialty areas including anaestheisa, general practice, emergency medicine and paediatrics; the development and implementation of a three-year Basic Specialist Training programme in emergency medicine, with 78 places available on the programme, and expansion in the number of Higher Specialist Training places in radiation, oncology and anaesthesia and intensive care medicine.</p></reply>

The key objective is to ensure safe service delivery to patients based on safe work patterns for doctors; b) Rostering arrangements provide for a safe level of medical cover, allow for sufficient handover time, ensure that training can be delivered satisfactorily, and meet service needs and EWTD requirements while allowing NCHDs a satisfactory quality of life; c) Medical education and training should receive due priority in rostering arrangements; d) Training principles agreed by the employers, the IMO and the training bodies in 2004 are incorporated in to rosters; e) A Consultant-provided service is introduced with increased promotional opportunities for NCHDs currently in training.</p><p>  The Medical Practitioners Act 2007 has resulted in meaningful and very positive changes in the way doctors are registered and the regulation of medical education and training.</p><p>  In relation to undergraduate training, the HSE has a statutory responsibility to facilitate the training of medical students - which it supports via a concord agreed with the University Medical Schools, a liaison group to coordinate all clinical placements and the establishment of 24 senior Academic Clinician posts in Medical Schools, jointly funded by the HSE and the Higher Education Authority.</p><p>  Regarding postgraduate training, the HSE also plays a very significant role in postgraduate medical education and training in conjunction with the Medical Council and 13 postgraduate training bodies.</p><p>  Since taking office, I have spoken many times on health research.  I passionately believe in the value of health research leading to informed action, be that for the individual patient or the service more generally.  Knowledge derived from research is paramount in providing the evidence base for better health policies and systems; systems that underpin effective and efficient health service provision.  Such evidence will be a key input to the creation of the fairer, more efficient health system that the Irish Government is seeking to create in this country for all of our citizens.</p></reply>

This course covers cancer prevention, referral and patient assessment, treatment and post-acute care.  The NCCP has also developed national GP referral guidelines and a standard referral form for breast cancer making the referral process more seamless and efficient. Voluntary agencies working in the area of cancer prevention also promote the need to be aware of the signs of breast cancer, so that early intervention can be offered.  </p><p>  I would encourage any woman irrespective of her age who has immediate concerns or symptoms to contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic breast cancer services in her area. </p></reply>

Plain packaging is one of the issues being considered in the context of the Tobacco Products Directive by the European Commission.  It is hoped that the Commission will publish this legislative proposal in the near future.  Recent international developments together with the forthcoming revision of the EU Tobacco Products Directive will inform policy direction in this area.</p><p>  I understand that the Revenue Commissioners will also examine the matter in light of any specific proposals that may be brought forward in the context of the revision of the EU Tobacco Products Directive.  Included in this examination is the requirement that packs of cigarettes must carry a tax stamp issued by Revenue.  I am advised that whether a pack of cigarettes carries a genuine tax stamp is a key means for distinguishing between legal and illegal products, irrespective of the way in which the cigarettes are packaged.  All tobacco products, whether legally produced, illicit or counterfeit are injurious to health and are therefore a threat to public health. I am concerned about the level of smoking in this country and it remains my objective that Ireland becomes a tobacco free society.  The Report of  the Tobacco Policy Review Group will identify further policy and legislative measures to be taken in order to reduce smoking prevalence in this country.  The Report is due to be published in the coming months.</p><p>  There is no doubt that the illicit trade in tobacco products poses a problem in this country. Combating this illegal trade is, therefore, a top priority for the Revenue Commissioners, who undertake a comprehensive programme of activity against it, aimed in particular at preventing importation of illicit product and prosecuting those involved in bringing it into the country or selling it here. Considerable success is being achieved in combating this illegal activity. In the period from January to October this year, for example, the Revenue Commissioners seized some 91 million smuggled cigarettes, along with almost 4 tonnes of tobacco. During that period there were over 100 convictions for smuggling or selling of illegal tobacco products.</p></reply>

In this regard, the HSE provides a range of services to women who continue to suffer the effects of having had this procedure. These services include the provision of medical cards, the availability of independent clinical advice and the organisation of individual pathways of care and the arrangement of appropriate follow-up.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, my Department has commissioned an independent research report in relation to the practice of symphysiotomy in Ireland. The Research included a consultation process involving patient groups, health professionals and in particular the women who have experienced symphysiotomy. It is expected that this report will be presented to the Department in the near future. </p><p>  It is intended that the research report will inform the Department&rsquo;s overall consideration of this matter, including the consideration of any actions that may be required and possible legal implications. It would be premature for me to make any other comments at this stage on what actions might be taken, prior to giving full consideration to the recommendations of the report.</p></reply>

The end point is that countries are recommended to develop plans or strategies preferably by the end of 2013.  We are now well advanced in developing this work.</p><p>  I established a National Steering Group, in April 2011, to develop a policy framework for the prevention, detection and treatment of rare diseases based on the principles of high quality care, equity and to be patient centred.  The policy will operate over a 5 year period, take account of the EU Council Recommendation on Rare Diseases (2009) and define priority actions subject to resource availability.  Similar plans are being drafted by individual countries across the EU, including in the UK.  The National Steering Group identified a number of areas relating to rare diseases which it is currently considering including centres of expertise, access to appropriate medication and technology, orphan drug development, research and information and patient empowerment and support.  In addition, the steering group consulted extensively with patients and key stake-holders in June and July of this year on the broad proposals and recommendations that will emerge.</p></reply>

Provisional statistics for 2012 to end-June 2012 only are now available.  MRSA statistics for 2010 and 2011 record 305 and 263 cases respectively.  The figure to end June 2012 is 128 cases.  The number of cases of MRSA has fallen by 55% between 2006 and 2011 (from 592 to 263 cases) and the downward trend is holding per statistical returns to date.</p><p><b>  Clostridium Difficile: </b>Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) or C. difficile associated disease (CDAD) has been a notifiable disease in Ireland since May 2008.  Prior to 2012 only new cases of CDI were notifiable.  The case definition for this disease has been revised and since 1st January 2012 both new and recurrent cases are notifiable.  Clostridium Difficile statistics for 2010 and 2011 record 1,693 and 1,848 cases respectively.  Provisional data for the first half of 2012  using the enhanced surveillance system which records both new and recurrent cases, indicates that there have been 939 cases of C. difficile.  It is difficult to comment on these figures in that some of the increase may be due to changed testing practices.</p><p>  The control of Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs) and antimicrobial resistance continues to be a challenge worldwide and the Department will continue to work at all levels to support healthcare policy development and assist healthcare providers in reducing same.</p></reply>

Under this system, most beds are either designated as public beds or private beds: there is a small number of non-designated beds, such as those in Intensive Care Units.</p><p>  Under the current  framework, private in-patients who occupy public beds in public hospitals are not levied the daily maintenance charge, which ranges from &euro;586 to &euro;1,046 in most public hospitals. </p><p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General reported in 2010 that 45% of in-patients treated privately by their consultants were not charged for their maintenance costs because they were not occupying designated private beds.</p><p>  As part of Budget 2012, I announced that I intended to bring forward legislation to provide for the charging of all private patients in public hospitals, irrespective of whether they occupied a public or a private bed.   In view of  the significant potential cost implications for private health insurers, I subsequently indicated that I would be prepared to postpone implementation of the legislation until 2013 provided that the funds targeted for the current year were raised through a system of improved cashflow from the private insurers.  Arrangements for this improved cashflow have now been agreed with the insurers, and the legal details are being finalised. </p><p>  In relation to charging all private patients in public beds, the issue will be dealt with as part of the budgetary process for 2013.  I will being legislative proposals to Government on the matter in due course.</p><p>  I am committed to keeping the cost of health insurance premia as low as possible.  With this in mind, my Department is working closely with the four health insurers, through Consultative Forum on Health Insurance.  The objective is to minimise costs, while always respecting competition law.</p></reply>

In terms of service delivery, we must concentrate on getting the best possible services for patients from the budgets available to us. This means we need to focus on how beds are used, on the throughput of patients, on reducing length of stay to international norms and on having as many procedures as possible carried out as day cases rather than inpatient work, thus maximising also the efficient usage of operating theatre facilities.</p><p>  Performance management by hospitals will be measured against a scorecard based on access, quality and finance.  This scorecard is part of the HSE&#8217;s Service Plan for 2012.  I will set the access targets<b><i>.  </i></b>  Quality targets will be determined by the acute medicine programme, which was devised as part of the HSE&#8217;s Clinical Programmes: this sets the standards and operational guidelines (including clinical care pathways, discharge planning, staffing, rosters) for managing and delivering acute medicine in hospitals. Its implementation is essential to the success of the SDU as it sets the standards and clinical performance against which the hospital is measured. Finance targets will be determined as the ability of the hospital, and later of Hospital Groups, to remain within budget.</p><p>  Performance management of hospitals, and later of Hospital Groups, against the financial, access and quality indicators, will be based on the CompStat (Comparative Statistics) management performance approach used in the New York Police Department. This combines monthly data across a series of metrics on hospital performance with monthly performance management and review meetings attended by area and hospital senior management. </p><p><b>Scheduled Care  </b>  The SDU Scheduled Care Team was tasked with improving access to elective surgery and lowering waiting lists. There have been significant achievements in Scheduled Care since July 2011 when the SDU was formed.  </p><p><b><i>Inpatient and daycase surgery  </i></b></p><p>  -Overall waiting list numbers have decreased from 56, 020 to 51, 955, a drop of 7%</p><p>  -The number of adults having to wait more than 12 months is down from 2,732 to 408, a drop of 85%</p><p>  -The number of adults having to wait more than 9 months is down from 6,277 to 2,342, a drop of 63%</p><p>  -The number of children having to wait &gt; 20 weeks is down from 1,712 to 670 a decrease of 61%</p><p><b><i>GI endoscopy </i></b></p><p>  The SDU began to tackle long waits for routine GI endoscopy services (i.e. scopes) in May 2012 and:</p><p>  -Since May 2012 overall waiting list numbers for scopes have decreased from 13,349 to  8, 904, a drop of 33%</p><p>  -Those having to wait &gt; 3 months (the target for 2012) have decreased from 5,062 to 1,711, a drop of 66% </p><p><b><i>Outpatients</i></b></p><p>  The initial priority for the SDU was trolley waits and daycases. It has now begun to work on improving access to outpatient services.  The SDU and NTPF are on trajectory to take over the reporting of outpatient waiting times from the HSE from Oct 2012. </p><p>  For the first time individual patient level waiting time data will be available at national level where data will be automatically extracted from all hospitals providing an outpatient service in the same format on a weekly basis. This is a major achievement by the SDU / NTPF in overcoming huge IT incompatability, data quality and other resource issues. </p><p>  The next step will be to reform the delivery of outpatient services in hospitals, critically examining processes and identifying areas for improved efficiency.</p><p><b>Unscheduled Care </b></p><p>  The SDU was tasked with improving access to emergency care. Very significant progress has been made with the result that for significant numbers of patients, the experience in our EDs has been markedly improved.</p><p>  -The number of patients waiting on trolleys in EDs has reduced by 22% from January to September, compared to the same period last year (or 13,450 fewer patients)</p><p>  -The number of patients waiting on trolleys has fallen from a record of 569 on 5 January 2011 to 144 on 26 October 2012</p><p>  -The 30 day moving average (average number of trolleys over 30 days) has fallen by 35% in 12 months, from 302 on 5 September 2011 to 197 on 7 September 2012</p><p>  -The SDU&#8217;s focus in relation to unscheduled care is now moving to patient journey time (attendance to admission/discharge) with that aim that 95% of ED attendees are discharged or admitted within 6 hours of registration and nobody waits more than 9 hours</p><p>  -The SDU is working intensively to develop best practice hospital sites for patient pathways through unscheduled care.</p><p>  With regard to a possible reward system, the principle of rewarding good hospital performance is one that I would generally endorse.  Hospital budget allocations for 2013 are being carefully considered and I may consider some type of reward system within that context.</p></reply>

The Council (also known as CORU) was established in March 2007 and is working to put in place the necessary structures for registration, education and fitness to practise for the 12 health and social care professions, including social care workers, designated under the Act.</p><p>  The first registration board to be established, the Social Workers Registration Board, which does not include Social Care Workers, was established in August 2010, and the associated Social Workers Register opened for receipt and processing of applications on 31st May, 2011. A second registration board, the Radiographers Registration Board, was established on 16th December, 2011 and its register is expected to be established in the near future. Three further registration boards, the Dietitians Registration Board,  the Occupational Therapists Registration Board, and the Speech and Language Therapists Registration Board are currently in the process of establishment and it is also proposed to establish the Physiotherapists Registration Board either before the end of this year, or in early 2013.</p><p>  It is proposed to establish the Social Care Workers Registration Board in 2013, although considerable work will be involved before it can open its register for receipt of registrants. All of the registration boards for the remaining designated professions should be established and their registers fully operational by 2015 or 2016 at the latest.</p><p>  Under the provisions of the 2005 Act,  there is a two-year transitional period from the date on which the register of the members of that profession is established, during which existing practitioners may apply for registration. The name of every registrant will be published in the register, which will be accessible on-line.  Only those registrants who have satisfied the registration board for their designated profession that they hold an approved qualification and are &quot;fit and proper&quot; to engage in the practice of the profession will be entered on the register.</p><p>  The State is currently funding the HSCPC in its establishment phase (&euro;1.937 million in 2012) and will continue to do so on a reducing basis to end 2015.</p><p>  The Council which is an independent statutory body is responsible for setting the level of fees and in doing this it is mindful of the requirement for it to become self funding by end 2015. </p><p>  The current fee structure is as follows:</p><p>  -	A registration fee of  &euro;100 for new graduates, who have obtained recognised professional qualifications within two years of applying for registration;</p><p>  -	An annual retention fee of &euro;295 for registrants, including those who paid the lower rate on graduation, is payable on the annual renewal date.</p><p>  Since the annual renewal fee of &euro;295 is subject to full tax relief it reduces to &euro;174 at the higher level of tax which compares favourably with fees levied by Union and professional bodies where no tax relief is applicable.</p><p>  All health regulators are self funding by way of annual fee income. The greater the registrant base the lower the annual fee charged. Given the enormous registrant base in teaching and nursing,  for example, the annual fee charged amounts to less than &euro;100 per annum. Health regulators are single profession regulators whereas the HSCPC is charged with regulating twelve disparate professions,  which can add significantly to operating costs. The twelve designated professions to be registered by the Council range in number from under 50 in the case of Clinical Biochemists to a high of 3,000 approximately for Medical Scientists, but only amount to about 20,000 registrants in total across all professions. This is an extremely low registrant base when compared to a registrant base of well in excess of 60,000 for nurses.</p><p>  The HSCPC is charged with extensive statutory functions under the 2005 Act,  registration being only one, and the annual fee of &euro;295 being charged by the HSCPC is considered the bare minimum required to enable the Council to operate. The fee is on a par with that charged by other health regulators and less than some in certain cases. </p><p>  In response to concerns about the level of fee, the HSCPC has reviewed the regulatory structure to establish what scope exists for further reductions in registration fees and operational costs and has adopted the following measures:</p><p>  -	Where an existing practitioner with the necessary experience and recognised professional qualifications, or equivalent, pays the registration fee of &euro;295 and is granted registration during the transitional period, also known as grandparenting,  the application fee will cover them for the remainder of the grandparenting period and one full year of retention of registration after expiration of grandparenting. This concession will only apply to existing practitioners availing of the transitional provisions set out in the Act;</p><p>  -	The Council has requested the HSE to put in place arrangements for the deduction of the registration fee from monthly salary thereby spreading the cost throughout the year;</p><p>  -	Finally, the Council has proposed significant restructuring of the way in which the designated professions will be registered and regulated to provide a more cost effective operating system. This will require the enactment of primary legislation in due course.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-06a.3002.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012110600060#WRBBB01500"><p>I am very aware that health insurance is becoming harder to afford, in particular for older people, as insurers increasingly tailor their insurance plans towards younger, healthier customers. The Government is committed to keeping down the cost of health insurance so that it is affordable for as many people as possible and is also strongly committed to protecting community rating, whereby older and less healthy customers should pay the same amount for the same cover as younger and healthier people.</p><p>  To support the principle of community rating, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to put a permanent scheme of risk equalisation in place. This is a key requirement for the existing private health insurance market and is designed to keep health insurance affordable for older persons and to maintain the stability of the market. I was pleased, therefore, to recently publish the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2012 on 18 October, to give effect to a new Risk Equalisation Scheme (RES) to be applied from 1 January 2013. An effective and robust RES is required in the Irish private health insurance market in order to protect affordability for those who need it most.  </p><p>  There can be little doubt that price increases will make it more difficult for persons who hold private health insurance to renew their policies. I have consistently raised the issue of costs with health insurers and am determined to address costs in the sector in the interests of consumers. I will continue to focus strongly on this issue. </p><p>  I would also strongly advise consumers to shop around for the health insurance plan that best suits their needs. Consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and to reduce their premium costs. All consumers should carefully consider the full range of plans and levels of cover available within the market, so that their own needs are fully met. Where customers wish to switch products, the relevant health insurance legislation ensures that switching is as easy and seamless as possible for customers. The evidence to date is that many people are changing their product choice or insurer following significant price or product changes. It is not open to a company to refuse a customer of another insurer the same level of cover. All plans are available to all customers, regardless of whether you are an employee of a particular organisation or not. Policy holders can switch to the same level of cover without waiting times for cover to apply. </p><p>  In addition to the choices available to consumers in the health insurance market, the Government's clear objective is for the health insurance market to remain as competitive and affordable as possible, as we move towards a new system of Universal Health Insurance.</p></reply>

Therefore people with a severe disability over 65 years of age are not eligible for the mobility allowance and the Health Service Executive is not authorised to pay the allowance to people outside of the eligibility criteria.</p><p>  The Department of Health has accepted the Ombudsman's recommendation to review and revise the mobility allowance so as to render it compliant with the Equal Status Act.</p><p>  The matter requires further consideration by Government in order to meet the requirements of the Equal Status Acts and to ensure no hardship for those currently in receipt of the Mobility Allowance.  The Department of Health is seeking further legal advice as to the options available to the Government.  However it must be acknowledged that the extension of the Allowance, as currently constructed, may have serious financial pressures on the health budget and may be unsustainable.</p><p>  The recommendations, if implemented would ignore the very serious financial constraints on the Department, the HSE and the State generally.

It is jointly funded by the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive, and operates under the auspices of the North/South Ministerial Council through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland and my Department here.    </p><p>  As I have previously stated, the decision to purchase the domain name &ldquo;Ireland.com&rdquo; from the Irish Times,  and an analysis of a business case in this regard are operational matters for Tourism Ireland Limited and its Board while the issue of accommodating existing @ireland.com email address holders in as helpful and fair a manner as possible is the responsibility of the Irish Times.    </p><p>  In terms of the business case for the purchase, I understand that Tourism Ireland firmly believes that having a simple domain name  like &ldquo;Ireland.com&rdquo; will have significant benefits to them. Primarily it is considered that, given the ease of recognition and memorability, the new domain name will deliver greater &ldquo;stand out&rdquo; for Ireland around the world. At present &ldquo;Ireland.com&rdquo; is a competitor with Tourism Ireland's discoverireland.com domain name for search engine traffic. Accordingly, the acquisition will be beneficial in accessing that traffic. Furthermore Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s business case for the project identified that cost savings will also be achieved through a reduction in their  paid search engine optimisation activity. I understand that Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s projections show that the costs of the acquisition will be fully recouped in just over three years.   </p><p>  Finally, with regard to &quot;The Gathering Ireland 2013&quot;, having a simple domain name like &ldquo;Ireland.com&rdquo; can only help in projecting an even stronger online presence to achieve our ambitious targets for visitor numbers next year and beyond.</p></reply>

In this regard, there have recently been two important announcements. As part of a recent tourism mission to North America to promote the Gathering, I met with United Airlines in Chicago and a new Chicago-Shannon route has been confirmed for next summer.  In addition, American Airlines recently announced that it is to begin a new daily service from Dublin to New York JFK from June 2013 in addition to its existing Dublin-Chicago route which operates six times a week.  These are very positive developments and discussions are continuing with a number of other carriers for additional capacity linked to both general traffic demand and the expected increased traffic linked to the Gathering.</p><p>  Current indications are that transatlantic capacity for summer 2013 will be higher than summer 2012, which was in the region of 27,500 seats per week. Tourism Ireland continues to work closely with Dublin Airport Authority to secure additional capacity.</p></reply>

The National Transport Authority (NTA) is the lead agency with responsibility for implementation of the recommendations of the Taxi Regulation Review Report.</p><p>  I will bring a proposal to Cabinet shortly for the publication a Taxi Regulation Bill, 2012, which will replace the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 and extend the regulatory framework to give effect to recommendations from the Taxi Review concerning enforcement. The enforcement regime provided for in the Bill will be based on an intensified approach to tackling non-compliance depending on the gravity of the criminal offence or compliance failure.</p><p>  Among other enforcement measures, the Bill will provide for the mandatory disqualification of taxi drivers upon conviction of certain criminal offences, which will complement existing Garda vetting of taxi drivers. The Bill will also provide for the temporary disqualification from holding a licence upon the accumulation of a specified number of demerits for specified breaches of the taxi regulations.</p><p>  Compliance with the taxi regulations is a prerequisite for operating in the taxi industry. As proposed in the Taxi Review the establishment of the PPSN as the key data reference number for data sharing will greatly strengthen the  investigation and enforcement capability of the relevant agencies: the NTA, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>  The Taxi Regulation Bill will also provide for the prohibition on the transfer of a vehicle licence, including in circumstance concerning the change of ownership of a company.</p><p>  Concerning vehicle standards and the age of some vehicles currently operating in the industry, the Taxi Review Group proposed to allow vehicles licensed before 2009 to continue to operate for up to fourteen years subject to a twice yearly NCT test. This will allow some time for vehicle owners and drivers to adjust to the new standards regime.</p><p>  It is acknowledged that some of the measures proposed by the Taxi Review may lead to increased costs for individuals. However this will be offset by the benefits to the industry in terms of  a better regulated and safer taxi sector.</p><p>  In considering the future approach to regulation of the industry, including the matter of appeals, the Taxi Review Group felt it was appropriate to propose measures allowing a right of reply to individual taxi operators and to the taxi industry. Action 33 proposes a review process concerning certain decisions particular to the individual and Action 34 would allow industry representative groups to make referrals to the Taxi Advisory Committee concerning the introduction of industry regulations, with Action 35 proposing a sub-committee to consider issues of particular concern to the taxi sector.</p><p>  The Taxi Advisory Committee which I appointed during this summer includes representatives of small public service vehicle and driver interests in line with the provisions of Section 54 of the Taxi Regulation Act, 2003.</p></reply>

LUAS BXD to Broombridge is designed to be a key element in an overall  integrated transport network for Dublin.  It will create a LUAS network by joining the LUAS Red and Green Lines and will also link with rail services from Maynooth and Dunboyne and with existing QBC schemes which enter or cross Dublin City Centre. It will also in time interchange with future key projects such as Dart Underground and Metro North.</p><p>  There has been extensive engagement between the RPA, Dublin City Council, Dublin Bus and the business community aimed at minimising the construction impacts of Luas BXD on all road users, including pedestrians, in the city centre area.  The ongoing engagement between the relevant agencies on these important issues, which now also includes the NTA, will intensify both prior to and during the construction of the project.</p><p>  An initial working group comprising the RPA, NTA and Dublin City Council has been established to work through the traffic management arrangements that will apply during the construction of the project. It is proposed that a wider Traffic Forum will also be established, which will include An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Dublin Bus, the main contractors undertaking the works as well as representatives of traders and businesses. It is intended that this Traffic Forum will be the main focal point for addressing traffic matters on the project and I will chair the meetings of this body.</p><p>  I understand that arrangements for the relocation of taxi ranks and bus stops affected by the construction works will be developed over the coming months in consultation with relevant stakeholders.</p></reply>

The NTA makes a payment to the two bus companies that operate the PSO services for those services.</p><p>  The legislation governing the licensing of commercial public bus passenger services, such as Expressway, is the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009. Responsibility for the licensing of Public Bus Passenger Services rests with  the National Transport Authority (NTA). The NTA published, in November 2010, new Guidelines for the licensing of public bus services which set out the basis for a reformed licensing system for commercial bus passenger services in the State. There is nothing to prevent Bus &Eacute;ireann from applying for an amendment to a licence in respect of such a service.  As part of its Expressway turnaround plan, Bus &Eacute;ireann is making changes to a number of its commercial services to meet the customer demand for limited stop services with quicker journey times and airport connections so that such services are commercially viable.  Failure to react to this market demand and competitive pressures would result in a reduction and/or loss of Expressway services and jobs.</p><p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann may also propose route changes to services provided by the company under its PSO contract with the NTA. Any such proposals are subject to negotiation with the National Transport Authority, who may accept, reject or modify any requested change to a PSO service. </p></reply>

In the interim, it is open to local authorities to continue to operate the scheme or a similar scheme from their own resources.</p></reply>

Most of this work is undertaken in the context of actively pursuing our priorities for advancing cooperation through the structures of the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC). As the Deputy will be aware the Council meets in both Transport and Tourism Sectoral formats. The last NSMC Transport meeting took place on the 5th October. Amongst the areas of ongoing North South cooperation discussed at this meeting were the mutual recognition of penalty points, progress on the A5/A8 road projects, the development and delivery of road safety strategies, cooperation in the area of enforcement of vehicle safety standards and current EU proposals with implications for the transport sector on the island.</p><p>  The next NSMC Tourism Sectoral is scheduled for the 28th November. Amongst the discussion items will be Tourism Ireland's Business Plan for 2013 and major tourism initiatives next year such as The Gathering Ireland 2013 and the UK City of Culture.</p><p>  With regard to staffing,  because of the importance of the work within the Department, in practice north/south cooperation is mainstreamed into day-to-day work right across the Department. The divisions and agencies dealing with various policy areas have regular interaction with their colleagues in Northern Ireland.</p><p>  As previously outlined to the Deputy, general North/South coordination is overseen within my Department  by the Tourism Marketing &amp; Impact Assessment Unit and is supported by 1 Principal Officer, 1 Assistant Principal Officer and 1 Higher Executive Officer led by the relevant Assistant Secretary. Responsibility rests with this unit as it also deals with the oversight of Tourism Ireland, the only North South body under the aegis of my Department. There are no vacancies in this unit at present.</p></reply>

These funding constraints mean that it will not be possible to progress a range of worthwhile projects for now. In the case of the M20 project,  had An Bord Plean&aacute;la approved the scheme, the NRA/Local Authorities concerned would have been required to exercise the CPO authorisation within 18 months or the approval would lapse.  The land costs involved would have been very significant.  For this reason I considered it prudent to stop the process prior to that happening rather than tie up so much capital in land acquisition at the expense of road maintenance and minor improvements.  The project has not, however, been abandoned but deferred in the light of the current circumstances.  When the financial position improves the NRA will re-examine the position in relation to this, and other worthwhile projects.</p><p>  For now NRA will have to work within its capital budget and assess and prioritise projects within that funding envelope. In this context I have referred the issue of the NRA response to an Bord Plean&aacute;la's decision on the Adare bypass to the NRA for direct reply.
