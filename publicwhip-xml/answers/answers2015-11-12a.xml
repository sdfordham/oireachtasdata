It was undertaken by my Department&rsquo;s Evaluation Unit under the guidance of an expert Steering Committee chaired by Dr. John O'Hagan, Professor of Economics at Trinity College.</p><p>The review commends the Council for its response to the economic crisis by significantly reducing administration costs; overhauling its organisational structures; and developing on its RAISE initiative, which helps arts organisations to diversify funding streams.</p><p>The review also highlights the need for the Council to expand its efforts to improve transparency around its decision making; give greater consideration to addressing the issue of regional balance in accessing the arts; and to engage more with stakeholders and establish the evidence-base for the societal benefits of its work.</p><p>The Value for Money Policy Review should act as an important tool for the Arts Council to improve its hugely beneficial work in funding arts organisations across the State.  It is available to download on my Department's website. </p><p>I am committed to ensuring that findings of the report are used to improve access to and support for the arts in Ireland.  I had a very productive discussion last month with the Chair and Director of the Arts Council on how this can be achieved.  My Department will build on the already positive engagement with the Arts Council to ensure that the recommendations are delivered.  We will do this in close consultation with the Arts Council using the normal governance arrangements including regular liaison meetings and the annual service level agreement, while respecting the statutory independence of the Council in making its funding decisions.</p><p>Indeed the Arts Council has already taken on board some of the key recommendations in its recently published strategy &quot;<i>Making Great Art Work</i>&quot; which sets out its plan for leading the development of the arts in Ireland over the next decade.  Further information on the strategy is available on the website of the Council at www.artscouncil.ie</p><p>This 10 year strategy will be followed by a series of 3-year implementation plans in which the Arts Council has committed to incorporating many of the detailed recommendations of the value for money review.</p></reply>

I am also very cognisant of the ongoing challenge of maintaining existing jobs, in addition to creating new jobs, in the Gaeltacht. In that context, I wish to acknowledge the important enterprise and employment function of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta as the regional economic agency for the Gaeltacht.</p>  <p>  I am well aware of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta's proposal to increase its capital budget over a period of time to &euro;12m per annum.  I am also very aware and supportive of the case advanced by the organisation that such an increase in funding would enable it to create an additional 300 jobs per annum.  The case for funding outlined specific measures including the upgrading of its existing property portfolio and the provision of new property solutions in a number of geographic and sectoral areas. </p>  <p>  In that context, I have been informed by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta that its property portfolio has achieved almost full capacity with only a small number of vacant property options available to existing and prospective clients.  With regard to the Gaeltacht in Co. Galway, I understand that there are a number of projects which require capital investment in order to address the specific needs identified by expanding enterprises. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy will be aware that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta's capital allocation for 2016 is &euro;5.687m.  While I am of course cognisant of the significant pressure on capital resources at this time, I am continuing to seek further funding for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta under the Revised Estimates process for 2016.</p></reply>

It seeks to encourage the investment of private capital in a number of small-scale, labour intensive projects to repair and conserve historic structures and to support the employment of skilled and experienced conservation professionals, craft workers and tradespeople.     Protected structures, proposed protected structures and structures that contribute to the character of an Architectural Conservation area will be eligible for assistance.  The minimum level of funding awarded will be &euro;2,500 up to a maximum of &euro;10,000.  The State&rsquo;s contribution to each project must be matched by a similar contribution from the private sector per application.  The scheme will operate through 2016 and will be administered by the local authorities.  All of which have been informed of their allocations and the process and timelines involved. </p>  <p>  The scheme is modelled on the Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme, which was very successfully piloted in 2014, that resulted in the leveraging of almost &euro;10 million in private sector investment and generated approximately 175 Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) jobs in the construction sector that year while helping to protect 540 historic structures protected under Part IV of the Planning and Development Acts.  Two thirds of the structures conserved under the scheme were privately owned properties with the remaining one third being structures vested in charities, trusts, voluntary groups or in public ownership.</p></reply>

This figure excludes an additional and separate &euro;0.378m allocated to the Heritage Council in 2015 as part funding for the National Biodiversity Data Centre.</p>  <p>  I refer the Deputy to my answer to priority question number 1 today with respect to the increase in funding for 2016.  As I pointed out there, my Department is currently considering the funding available for the protection and conservation of the built heritage in 2016 in the context of its overall allocation and I will publish details of funding schemes for 2016 as soon as these are finalised.  In this regard and in order to maximise all potential efficiencies, my Department in consultation with the Heritage Council, will be conducting a specific expenditure review of the Heritage Council in early 2016.</p>  <p>  As outlined in my 2016 Budget statement, I have secured an additional &euro;2 million for the heritage sector for next year.  This is being allocated to a scheme being run by my Department to support built heritage projects.</p></reply>

Nonetheless, I keep the competing priorities regarding the preservation and enhancement of the national heritage under on-going review having regard to the resources available to my Department.  In this regard, my Department, in consultation with the Heritage Council, will be undertaking an expenditure review of the Heritage Council in early 2016 with a view to identifying any further improvements that might be achieved in the delivery of heritage services.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s allocation to the Heritage Council in 2016 will be subject to the normal budgetary processes and final confirmation in the Revised Estimates.  It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports in 2016 and future years having regard to competing priorities for limited resources.</p></reply>

The Ireland 2016 Project Team has been working with the Department of Education and Skills to ensure that the programme reaches every school in the country.  The Education Programme was launched in September of this year and the response to date from educators and young people has been extremely positive and encouraging.</p><p>My Department has also been working with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to support the engagement of children and young people outside of the formal education sector.  Six consultations have taken place with children aged 8-12 and with young people aged 13-17 from around the country on the theme of <i>'Imagining Our Future'</i>.  The outcome of these consultations will be compiled in a report to be presented by children and young people to Ministers and decision-makers at a major young people's event next year.</p><p>Further details in relation to all of the events taking place under the <i>Youth and Imagination </i>strand of the <i>Ireland 2016</i>Centenary Programme can be found on the website .  As well as this comprehensive programme for schools, communities are also developing plans at local level for a whole range of events across the country and I hope that children and young people will also get involved in their local communities and take part in the various events.</p></reply>

The Government has now agreed to amend the legislation to reduce the period for the transfer of records to the National Archives from 30 years to 20 years.  Given that the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland have already moved to a 20 year rule I was cognisant of the importance of maintaining as far as possible synchronicity of release of records with the UK and Northern Ireland, in particular on Anglo-Irish matters.</p><p>In particular, the Government agreed to:</p><p>1. reduce from 30 years to 20 years the time limit for the deposit of Departmental records with the National Archives of Ireland; and</p><p>2. to implement the change on a phased basis, starting with the Departments of, The Taoiseach, Foreign Affairs and Trade and Justice &amp;amp; Equality; and</p><p>3. to extend the reduction to other Departments as resources permit; and</p><p>4. to engage with Government Departments to deal with the current backlog of records over 30 years old which have not yet been transferred to the National Archives.</p><p>These changes will be implemented following the enactment of the relevant legislation to amend the National Archives Act 1986. My Department, in consultation with the Director of the National Archives, have begun drafting Heads of a Bill, which I will bring to Government in due course.</p></reply>

Application for funding under these schemes is currently closed as all funding for 2015 has been allocated.  It is expected that schemes for 2016, which are currently being worked on, will be advertised before the end of the year or early in the new year.</p><p>I recently announced a new &euro;2 million investment scheme for the repair and conservation of protected structures.  This fund will operate on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme (BHJLS), which ran in 2014, and is expected to support a significant number of projects across the country and create employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas.  This announcement will come as a welcome boost to the custodians of heritage properties.</p><p>In 2015, under the Structures at Risk Fund, an allocation of &euro;624,000 was available,<i></i>to enable conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000, as amended, which are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  This fund which is administered through the local authorities encourages the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and helps to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.  The fund was open to two applications per local authority of which one application may be in respect of a privately-owned building.  The amount of funding available per project was subject to a minimum level of &euro;15,000 and a maximum level of &euro;60,000.  Since 2011, in excess of 130 structures have been safeguarded for the future as a result of the Structures at Risk Fund.</p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department also funds, provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  The announcement of any proposed grant schemes can be monitored on .  It will be primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports annually having regard to competing priorities for limited resources.</p></reply>

The broad aim of <i>Culture 2025</i>will be to reinforce the crucial role of culture in society by supporting the cultural sector and providing the conditions which will allow the sector to develop and flourish across all sectors of society. <i>Culture 2025</i>will seek to reflect the modern multi-cultural Ireland and will be uplifting, accessible, relevant and easy to communicate.</p><p>To facilitate public consultation on the proposed policy my Department published a discussion document on 8 August last.</p><p>My Department followed this up by holding a series of local workshops to enable people across the country to have their views heard. Meetings took place in Cavan, Cork, Galway, Limerick, Kilkenny and Dublin.</p><p>The Dublin event followed the participative World Caf&eacute; model and was held under the Open Public Debates programme.  Over 600 people have attended the consultation events and over 200 written submissions have been received.  The closing date for receipt of submissions was 31 October 2015.</p><p>My Department also established both an Experts Group and a Steering Group made up of cultural stakeholders who are inputting into the consultation and drafting process. </p><p>The feedback from the regional meetings and the submissions received will now be examined in detail as part of the process of drafting the cultural policy.  I intend that this will be a high level and living document to set out the framework of cultural policy for the next decade.</p><p>I intend to submit the policy document to Government in due course with the intention of publishing it early in the New Year.</p></reply>

Primary responsibility for the support and promotion of film-making in Ireland, in respect of both the indigenous sector and inward productions, is the responsibility of the Irish Film Board.  This includes assistance with locations for the making of films. In 2015, I approved a provision of &euro;14.6m for the Film Board, which maintained its funding at the same level as in 2014.  The allocation of resources from within that provision is a matter for the Film Board, as the statutorily independent agency responsible for the promotion and development of the Irish film industry.</p>  <p>  The other primary mechanism by which the Government supports the film industry is through section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 - the Film Tax Relief Scheme.  This scheme has undergone a number of improvements, which took effect in January this year.  These changes have been well received and were developed following consultations between my Department, the Irish Film Board, the Department of Finance and the audio-visual industry.  The intention is to ensure that Ireland remains competitive in attracting film projects.  The Film Tax Relief Scheme has been extended to the end of 2020 and in the recent Budget the Government announced an increase in the cap on this tax relief from &euro;50 million to &euro;70 million.  I am confident that these measures will increase the attractiveness of Ireland as a destination for film investment and allow the audio-visual production sector to maintain existing jobs and create new ones.  In this regard, Government Departments and public agencies are often key to assisting film companies in providing locations and other supports for film making. </p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental Group comprising officials from my Department and other relevant Departments and agencies was also established recently to examine and report on recommendations to increase foreign and domestic investment in Ireland&rsquo;s film and TV sound stage studio infrastructure in the face of growing demand for audio-visual content across multiple platforms.  This builds on the process commenced last year by the Irish Film Board, which sought expressions of interest in this regard.  The Group has been meeting on a regular basis since its first meeting in January of this year and its work is on-going.</p></reply>

Earlier this year the National Archives joined the Digital Preservation Coalition to better prepare itself for the development of a digital preservation strategy and to ensure it adopts the appropriate and relevant standards in this area.  The National Archives is in ongoing conversation with PRONI (Public Records Office Northern Ireland) and a member of the National Archives staff was on the review group for PRONIs digital repository in advance of its operational roll out.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the Office of Government Chief Information Officer and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are working with the National Archives on a strategy and associated plan in relation to the electronic management and preservation of digital records.  It is felt that a collaborative approach based on a pilot and phased implementation of electronic record keeping systems would have benefits across the civil service. </p>  <p>  To assist with this project, I was delighted to be in a position to provide the National Archives with a special allocation of &euro;150,000 in 2016 to commence work on the project.</p>  <p>  In addition, as part of the Decade of Commemorations programme, the Government agreed to provide funding for the first phase in a capital development plan at the National Archives.  &euro;8m has been made available for the purposes of this capital development, which will shortly go to tender. Construction is expected to start in 2016.  This development will address many of the longstanding issues with the National Archives headquarters.</p></reply>

In the course of my visit, I attended a number of meetings with provincial government, business and trade contacts in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.  My visit received a very positive response from the Canadian media and I was invited to participate in radio and television interviews for regional transmission throughout Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.  These represented a valuable opportunity to raise awareness of the Famine Commemoration and of contemporary cultural and trade links with Ireland.</p>  <p>  I was happy to note the high level of political interest in Ireland.  I met the Premier of Prince Edward Island, Mr. Wade MacLaughlan. I also met Nova Scotia's Minister of Culture and Heritage, the Hon. Tony Ince, and the Deputy Minister for Intergovernmental Affairs, Ms. Catherine Blewett.  In addition, I also met New Brunswick's Minister for Tourism, Heritage and Culture, Mr. Bill Fraser.  These meetings focussed on issues of common interest including employment, emigration and the Irish economy.</p>  <p>  My visit also afforded an opportunity to engage with the Irish community in that part of Canada and I received a warm welcome at a series of events organised by different chapters of the Irish Canadian Cultural Association.  My engagement with the culture, heritage and education sectors also included a visit to St. Mary's University, Nova Scotia, which offers several Irish language and culture based programs.</p>  <p>  The International Famine Commemoration provides an opportunity each year to remember those forced to leave Ireland at the time of the Great Famine and to honour their remarkable resilience in making a new life in Canada and elsewhere, often in the most difficult of circumstances. Their achievements are a source of great pride to their descendants, who remain very proud of their Irish heritage.  The Government acknowledges this and attaches great importance to the cultural and economic links between Ireland and Canada.  I am very pleased to have led this year's International Famine Commemoration in that context and look forward to the further development of economic and cultural links between our two countries.</p></reply>

The <i>Community Participation</i>strand of the programme is being led by local authorities across the country and I have been working closely with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Alan Kelly, T.D., in this regard.  Each local authority has appointed a steering committee and a dedicated &lsquo;Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme&rsquo; co-ordinator, to support engagement and facilitation within local communities to generate awareness of the national programme; and to develop and deliver a plan for a suitable programme of events and initiatives to take place at a county level in line with the national plans for Ireland 2016.  A series of public meetings in each county has taken place, at which members of the public came together to hear about Ireland 2016, meet those involved in their community, and to explore and learn about how they can get involved.

Further details in relation to the arrangements for these, and all of the State ceremonial events, will be published on the website, in the coming months.</p></reply>

The Programme will be an invitation to everyone on the island of Ireland and to the global Irish community to shape and engage in a diverse range of historical, cultural and artistic activities &ndash; all designed to facilitate reflection, commemoration, celebration, debate and analysis and an active imagining of our future.  Officials of my Department have facilitated an intensive consultation period over the last few months, including active engagement with schools, universities, colleges, business and voluntary organisations, arts and culture institutions, historical societies and representative groups &ndash; at home and in our Diaspora around the world &ndash; to inform, to stimulate debate and discussion about 2016, and to foster programme initiatives.  Work has been ongoing to implement a comprehensive programme and planning is well underway for the range of initiatives within the seven programme strands.</p><p>Among the key milestones achieved to date are the following:</p><p>- I was delighted to host the first of the State ceremonial events of the <i>Ireland 2016</i>Centenary Programme on 1 August to commemorate the funeral of O'Donovan Rossa in Glasnevin Cemetery, in the presence of President Michael D Higgins and the Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, T.D;</p><p>- An allocation of &euro;22 million in capital funding is being provided through my Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2015 for the &lsquo;Permanent Reminder&rsquo; projects.

Each of the local authorities has now developed a rich and diverse series of events and projects that will take place around the country next year.  Arising from this, I, together with An Taoiseach and my Government colleagues, launched 31 individual local authority plans on 8 October.

I was also pleased to recently approve a new post in the National Library for a security and facilities manager, which will be key to managing and planning the storage and security of the Library&rsquo;s collection.</p><p>It is widely acknowledged that the Library holds a significant amount of its collection in an historic Victorian era building, which would not meet modern standards in terms of environmental and other controls.</p><p>I will shortly be making a positive announcement about the development of a capital investment plan for the Library's Kildare Street building.

These sanctions, which were imposed on foot of reports from regional staff of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department, entail a reduction in the number of courses run by both clubs at their next meetings compared to the number of courses run at last year&rsquo;s meetings.  The meeting of Doon Coursing Club, one of the clubs I sanctioned, has now been cancelled by the Irish Coursing Club following a recent prosecution case taken by my Department against members of the Club for illegal hunting of hares on State lands.  I welcome this decision by the ICC as it an indication of the seriousness with which they view this issue.</p>  <p>  While the muzzling of greyhounds at coursing meetings is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, it is my understanding that the Irish Coursing Club has had mandatory muzzling of greyhounds at regulated coursing meetings since the early 1990s.  The muzzling of greyhounds has proved effective in reducing the number of hares injuries and deaths at coursing meetings.  For example, the percentage of hares released back into the wild after coursing meetings last season was the highest figure to date at 99.49%.</p></reply>

My Department provides significant support for the arts and film through its funding of the Arts Council and the Film Board while my Department provides capital supports for the development of arts and cultural infrastructure. Other financial and policy supports are also provided, for example, through the taxation system. I was particularly pleased that the Government introduced a 25% increase in the income ceiling for the artists' tax exemption for 2015. This important measure recognises the invaluable contribution which artists, including songwriters and composers, make to society and to the music industry.  The IMRO report entitled <i>The Socio-Economic Contribution of Music to the Irish Economy</i>, highlights the impressive contribution the music industry makes to the Irish economy. The report contains a broad range of recommendations for which several Ministers have responsibility. My Department is examining those of relevance to my areas of responsibility.</p><p>I am aware of the potential of the creative sector to contribute to sustainable jobs growth and my Department continues to work with other Departments in regard to the audio-visual and music sectors as part of the Government&rsquo;s overall objectives under the Action Plan for Jobs.</p><p>I would also like to add that my Department - through Culture Ireland &ndash; plays a major part in promoting Irish arts and music on the world stage.

The broad aim of <i>Culture 2025</i>will be to reinforce the crucial role of culture in society by supporting the cultural sector and providing the conditions which will allow the sector to develop and flourish across all sectors of society. <i>Culture 2025</i>will seek to reflect the modern multi-cultural Ireland and will be uplifting, accessible, relevant and easy to communicate.</p><p>To facilitate public consultation on the proposed policy my Department published a discussion document on 8<sup>th</sup>August last.</p><p>My Department followed this up by holding a series of local workshops to enable people across the country to have their views heard. Meetings took place in Cavan, Cork, Galway, Limerick, Kilkenny and Dublin.</p><p>The Dublin event followed the participative World Caf&eacute; model and was held under the Open Public Debates programme. Over 600 people have attended the consultation events and over 200 written submissions have been received.  The closing date for receipt of submissions was 31<sup>st</sup>October 2015.</p><p>My Department also established both an Experts Group and a Steering Group made up of cultural stakeholders who are inputting into the consultation and drafting process. </p><p>The feedback from the regional meetings and the submissions received will now be examined in detail as part of the process of drafting the cultural policy.

Participants are employed for 19&frac12; hours per week to provide certain services of benefit to rural communities.

This year I am in a position to provide a 75% Christmas Bonus payment for all welfare recipients, including pensioners.

The Court ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were cohabiting. Accordingly, couples who are married and cohabiting are treated identically to couples who are cohabiting but not married for social welfare purposes since the Social Welfare Act No 2, 1989. There are no plans to change this.</p>  <p>  I am unclear what the Deputy has in mind when he refers to the individualisation of the social payments system. If the Deputy means that one or both members of a couple who are cohabiting, could receive the full personal rate of the relevant social welfare assistance payment, irrespective of their partner&rsquo;s means, then this would be prohibitively expensive.</p>  <p>  The Report of the Working Group Examining the Treatment of Married, Cohabiting and One-Parent Families under the Tax and Social Welfare Codes looked at this area of social policy. They published their report in 1999. The Group found the individualisation of social welfare payments to be very complex and did not reach agreement on introducing total independent treatment. They found that full individualisation would carry with it significant cost implications. </p>  <p>  There is no current costing available and no plans to change the treatment of cohabiting couples.</p></reply>

These are that a person must:</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p>  <p>  - be without both hands or without both arms;</p>  <p>  - be without one or both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p>  <p>  - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p>  <p>  The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria. A successful applicant is provided with a Primary Medical Certificate, which is required under the Regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the Regulations. </p>  <p>  An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual. The Regulations mandate that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations. After six months a citizen can reapply for a Primary Medical Certificate if there is a deterioration in their condition.</p>  <p>  The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure. Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the repayment of excise on fuel used by members of the Scheme, the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;48.6 million to the Exchequer in 2014. This figure does not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme. In terms of the numbers of claims to the Scheme in 2014, there were 4,936 claims for Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT relief, and 12,338 claims in respect of the repayment of excise on the fuel element of the Scheme.</p>  <p>  I frequently receive correspondence from applicants who do not meet the qualifying criteria but feel that they could benefit from the Scheme. While I am sympathetic to those who do not qualify for Scheme, I cannot, given the scale and scope of the Scheme, expand it further within the current context of constrained resources.</p>  <p>  I recognise the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities, and I have managed to maintain the relief at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation. However, in the still challenging fiscal environment and given the scale and scope of the Scheme, I have no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

Countries in the preventive arm must attain the Medium Term Objective (MTO) or be on an appropriate adjustment path towards it.  The MTO is the central concept of the preventive arm that serves to ensure sustainable public finances and compliance with the 3% of GDP deficit criterion in all but the most unusual adverse circumstances. </p><p>If the European Commission observes that a Member State has a significant deviation<i><font color="#0000FF">[1]</font></i>from the MTO or the adjustment path towards the MTO, it will issue a warning to the Member State. Within one month of the adoption of a Commission warning, the Council will adopt a recommendation on the necessary policy measures and will set a maximum deadline of five months for implementation of the actions. If the situation is considered serious and urgent, a three month deadline may be set for effective implementation. Nationally, under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012, the Government must prepare and lay before the D&aacute;il a correction plan within two months. The plan must be consistent with the Council's recommendations. Under the Act, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is responsible for monitoring if a plan is required and if a plan is performing. </p><p>If the Member State does not take effective action within the relevant deadline, the Council can make a decision to this effect by a qualified majority vote. If the Council rejects the decision and there is still no effective action by the Member State, the Commission can bring forward the recommendation again after one month and it is deemed to be adopted by the Council unless there is a simple majority to reject it within 10 days. </p><p>This leads to the start of the sanction procedure for euro area Member States. Within 20 days of the adoption of a Council decision on no effective action, the Commission shall issue a recommendation for a new Council decision, requiring the Member State to lodge an interest-bearing deposit equal to 0.2% of the previous year's GDP with the Commission. The Commission's recommendation is deemed to be adopted unless it is overturned by a qualified majority vote.  The deposit may be reduced or cancelled by the Council on grounds of exceptional circumstance or reasoned request if the Commission recommend this approach. If the Member State subsequently takes effective action, the deposit plus interest will be returned. </p><p>I have outlined above the procedural consequences of a significant deviation from the MTO or the adjustment path towards the MTO. There are also a number of practical consequences of persistent failure to meet the MTO or the required adjustment towards the MTO.  In the first instance, the commencement of procedures relating to a significant deviation, let alone reaching the point of sanctions for failure to take effective action, would be likely to result in reputational damage with a series of increasing adverse reports from the European Commission and independent bodies such as the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council. There is also the unknown market reaction to such an event and how this would impact on the State's ability to borrow and the subsequent debt servicing costs.  Furthermore, going down this path would increase the risk that the State would not meet the 3% of GDP deficit limit in time and be made subject to the corrective arm of the SGP, which has its own suite of recommendations, monitoring and sanctions.</p><p>However, compliance with the obligations of the preventive arm of the SGP is not and should not be primarily about avoiding sanctions and the wider market consequences that would be likely to follow.  It is about ensuring sustainable public finances and lower debt levels.  Doing so is the best way to avoid future crises arising from domestic sources in our public finances and to protect ourselves against crises arising from matters beyond our control because it will assist in the rebuilding of our fiscal capacity or ability to borrow, if needed in the future. Finally, balancing the budget in structural terms allows the automatic stabilisers play a counter-cyclical role in supporting aggregate demand.</p><p>A deviation is considered significant if it is greater than 0.5% of GDP in one single year or 0.25% of GDP on average per year in two consecutive years</p></reply>

I assume that the Deputy is referring to tax reliefs in this question.  </p><p>The main relevant income tax reliefs given as a credit as of todays date is as follows:</p><p>- Basic Personal tax credit, </p><p>- Single Person tax credit (&euro;1,650 for 2015 and subsequent years) and</p><p>- Married Person or Civil partner tax credit (&euro;3,300  for 2015 and subsequent years);</p><p>- Widowed Person (no dependent children) tax credit (&euro;2,190 for 2015 and subsequent years);</p><p>- Widowed Parent or Surviving Civil Partner tax credit (&euro;3,600 if bereaved in 2014). This credit is available for the first five years after the year of bereavement; </p><p>- Age Credit,</p><p>- Single person, widowed or surviving civil partner (&euro;245 for 2015 and subsequent years);</p><p>- Married person or in civil partnership (&euro;490 for 2015 and subsequent yearas);</p><p>- Home Carer Tax Credit (&euro;810 for 2015 and subsequent years);</p><p>- PAYE Tax Credit (&euro;1,650 for 2015 and subsequent years);</p><p>- Incapacitated Child Tax Credit (&euro;3,300 for 2015 and subsequent years);</p><p>- Dependent Relative Tax Credit (&euro;70 for 2015 and subsequent years);</p><p>- Blind Person's Tax Credit (&euro;1,650 for 2015 and subsequent years);</p><p>- Single Person Child Carer Credit (&euro;1,650 for 2015 and subsequent years and claimants are also entitled to an additional &euro;4,000 on their standard rate band);</p><p>- Medical Insurance;</p><p>- Relief for interest paid on home loans;</p><p>- Relief for Health Expenses (Medical Expenses). Relief for medical expenses is given at the standard tax rate with the exception of nursing home expenses which are allowable at the individual's marginal rate of tax; and</p><p>- Home renovation incentive. HRI provides a tax credit for property owners for qualifying expenditure incurred on repair, renovation or improvement work carried out on a property.</p><p>The main corporation tax credit is:</p><p>- Research &amp;amp; development tax credit.</p><p>Other items which are technically tax credits include:</p><p><b>Credit for certain taxes withheld:</b></p><p>DIRT, or deposit interest retention tax, is a final liability tax. Under s.261(c) TCA, the grossed up interest is taxable under Case IV of Schedule D and the rate of income tax to be applied is to be the same as the rate at which DIRT was deducted. Under s.59 TCA, individuals are then entitled to a credit in respect of the DIRT deducted. This procedure effectively ensures that DIRT deducted from interest on relevant deposits is a final liability tax. If the credit for DIRT suffered was abolished then a double charge to DIRT would apply without other consequential amendments also being made.</p><p>Professional Services Withholding Tax, PAYE and Dividend Withholding Tax operated by Irish companies, are all also treated as credits when calculating an Irish person's tax payable for a year.</p><p><b>Credit for Double Taxation:</b></p><p>Foreign tax credits ensure that a person or company is not taxed on the same income twice in as a result of the interaction between the tax rules of two separate jurisdictions.  In Ireland, the mechanics for determining the amount of the credit are set out in Schedule 24 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Relief from the double tax charge is available by crediting foreign tax paid in the source country of the income against Irish tax payable on that income in the State; this is known as &quot;double taxation relief&quot;.  Relief for foreign tax forms part of the benchmark tax system and Ireland follows the international norm in this regard as Double taxation relief is the essential feature of our international tax treaties.  This relief is particularly important for open economies like Ireland where cross-border trade and activity is particularly prevalent.  .</p><p><b>Other credit reliefs:</b></p><p><b>S267J</b>Credit for foreign tax on interest or royalties received by a company from an associated company in Greece, Portugal or Spain in accordance with derogations given to those Member States under the Interest and Royalties Directive.</p><p><b>S634</b>Credit for tax where an Irish resident company transfers a trading operation carried on by it in another Member State to a non-resident company in return for securities in the non-resident company. In order to get relief, the company making the disposal must produce to the Revenue Commissioners a relevant certificate given by the tax authorities of the Member State in which the trading operation is situated. </p><p><b>S831</b>Credit from double taxation under the Parent Subsidiary Directive, which is concerned with relieving double taxation in the case of cross border dividend flows within the EU from a subsidiary to its parent company.</p></reply>

I am not aware of any jurisdictions that have abolished all tax credits. Furthermore, I am not aware of any analysis of the economic and social impacts of these specific measures. However the Deputy may be interested in researching further the tax systems in Latvia, Estonia and Hungary, as these all involve a flat tax element.</p>  <p>  It should however be noted that the abolition of tax credits, depending on what tax system remained, would be likely to have a negative impact for low-income earners.  Tax credits can be used to shelter tax liabilities from the first unit of taxable income and therefore, depending on their value, can allow low-income earners to significantly reduce their tax liabilities.</p>  <p>  With regard to the impact of a move to a flat rate tax of 23%, my officials have estimated that, in the context of the Irish tax system this would have a negative impact on progressivity.  </p>  <p>  A progressive income tax system means that those on higher incomes pay proportionately higher rates of tax on their income than those on lower incomes.  The European Commission compares progressivity of income tax by taking the OECD tax wedge for an individual earning 167% of the average wage and dividing it by the tax wedge for an individual earning 67% of the average wage. </p>  <p>  My officials have estimated that the replacement of the Irish income tax and universal social charge systems with a flat income tax rate of 23%, would result in the OECD progressivity measure for Ireland falling from its 2014 calculation of 1.79 to 1.  In terms of Ireland's OECD ranking on this progressivity measure, Ireland would move from 2nd highest in the OECD in 2014 to the bottom of the rankings, to share that position jointly with Hungary.</p></reply>

Generally, such proposals encompass either specific products, such as sugar sweetened drinks, or a range of food products with certain characteristics, such as foods with saturated fats above a certain level, foods with added sugar, or foods with added salts.</p>  <p>  In 2011, Denmark introduced a tax of DKK 16 (at that time &euro;2.15) per kilogram of saturated fat on all food products produced or imported into Denmark which exceeds 2.3g per 100g in saturated fat. This tax was provided for the in 'Danish Fat Tax Act 2011', which commenced on 1 October 2011. The Danish 'Fat Tax' applied to meat, certain diary products, animal fats, edible oils and other fats, margarine, spreadable composite products, and other products which are considered substitutes of the above-mentioned foods. </p>  <p>  The tax was  collected at the first point of supply in Denmark, and producers and importers of such products were required to register with the Danish tax authorities, to facilitate the collection of the Fat Tax. Such persons could use publicly available information which provided standards for the levels of specific foodstuffs, the amount of saturated fat based on technical analysis of the specific food product, or nutrition labelling. </p>  <p>  In November 2012, the Danish Government made a decision to abolish the Fat Tax, citing concerns relating to cross-border shopping and the significant compliance costs imposed on food producers, many of whom were small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>  <p>  In September 2011, Hungary imposed taxes on energy drinks, snacks with a salt content in excess of 1g per 100g, sweets, biscuits, and ice-creams. In January 2012, these food-related taxes were extended to chocolate with added and total sugar of greater than 40g per 100g and a cocoa content of less than 40g per 100g, to all sweetened products with added and total sugar of greater than 25g per 100g, and to syrups or concentrates with a fruit content of less than 25%. All of these taxes are imposed volumetrically, with the duty imposed a specific amount per quantity of the product itself, rather than the added sugar, added salt or saturated fat content as in the Danish case.</p>  <p>  I believe that Danish case indicates that it is feasible to introduce the types of tax referred to by the Deputy. However, the feasibility of a tax does not imply that it is desirable to impose one. I think any proposal would have to take into account, inter alia, the compliance cost for smaller producers of products such as meat and cheese, the requirements for additional Revenue resources to administer a tax of this nature, the possible cross-border effects and, not least, the potential impact of such measures on the Agri-Food Sector. </p>  <p>  I would also note that any tax introduced would have to comply with Article 110 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which prohibits Member States imposing internal taxation of any kind on products of another Member State in excess of that imposed directly or indirectly on similar domestic products. Furthermore, it is a requirement that a Member State must notify the Commission under Directive 98/34/EC ('the technical standards Directive') of a draft law to provide for the aforementioned taxes. Upon notification, the Commission and other Member States may raise concerns as to whether the draft law is a potential barrier to trade. In addition, such taxes may give rise to State aid concerns. While not insurmountable, these are matters which policy makers must be cognisant of when  designing a new tax or levy.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that Norway, France, and Finland currently impose a volumetric tax on sugar sweetened drinks. A number of other non-European Economic Area states impose special ad valorem taxes on soft drinks, including Norway, Australia, and Mexico.</p>  <p>  At this time, there is not enough publically available information to estimate the yield from a volumetric tax on added sugar, added salt, and saturated fats. </p></reply>

The Deputy is asking what would be the impact should alternative levels of revenue and expenditure be introduced rather than the measures announced per Budget 2016. In order to assess the potential implications my Department has used data based on the no policy change figures published in the White Paper on Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure for the year ending 31 December 2016. The resultant impact on a purely iterative/accounting basis of the proposed alternative measures submitted by the Deputy in this Parliamentary Question are outlined in the table below. <table><tr><th>-</th><th>Option 1</th><th>Option 2</th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>2016</td><td>2016</td></tr><tr><td>White Paper 2016 General government balance (% of GDP)</td><td>-0.8%</td><td>-0.8%</td></tr><tr><td>White Paper 2016 General government balance (&euro;m)</td><td>-1,858</td><td>-1,858</td></tr><tr><td>Proposed additional Expenditure (&euro;m)</td><td>-12,800</td><td>-8,700</td></tr><tr><td>Proposed additional Revenue (taxation) (&euro;m)</td><td>16,400</td><td>8,800</td></tr><tr><td>Projected General government balance (&euro;m)</td><td>1,742</td><td>-1,758</td></tr><tr><td>White Paper 2016 GDP (&euro;m)</td><td>222,514</td><td>222,514</td></tr><tr><td>Projected General government balance (% of GDP)</td><td>0.8%</td><td>-0.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Difference in balance compared to Budget 2016</td><td>2.0%</td><td>0.5%</td></tr><tr><td>Estimated GG Debt based on White Paper (&euro;bn)</td><td>206.2</td><td>206.2</td></tr><tr><td>Projected GG Debt based on Options 1 &amp;amp; 2 (&euro;bn)</td><td>202.6</td><td>206.1</td></tr></table></p><p>Source: Department of Finance</p><p>From this table it is apparent that option 1 would improve the general government balance (GGB) in 2016 compared to Budget 2016 by 2.0% of GDP while option 2 would improve the GGB by 0.5% of GDP. Assuming that the improvement to the balance did in fact arise as indicated, there would, all other things being equal, be a reduction in the borrowing requirements for the year leading to a comparable decrease in overall general government debt. Under option 1, no borrowing would be required to fund the Exchequer, and, assuming the surplus is used to repay debt, projected debt levels would be reduced by &euro;4.5 billion compared to the Budget 2016 forecast. Under option 2, there would be a reduction in the deficit of approximately &euro;1 billion compared to Budget 2016, thus reducing the projected debt by a similar amount. The nominal debt for 2016 under option 1 would then be circa &euro;202.6 billion and approximately &euro;206.1 billion for option 2 compared with &euro;207.1 billion forecast in Budget 2016. Based on the GDP levels in the White Paper, the debt levels would represent an improvement on the Budget 2016 forecasts of the order of 2.0% of GDP and 0.5% of GDP respectively. </p><p>It should be noted that the Gross Domestic Product presented in the table is the same as that utilised in the White Paper and consequently does not take into account the potentially numerous second round economic effects that would arise from the alternative expenditure and revenue aggregates proposed by the Deputy in his two questions.  Forecasting the overall impact on GDP, which could be significantly negative, would be a major task, which my Department is not in a position to carry out. For instance, much would depend on the precise composition of the revenue and expenditure measures, and these have not been clarified.</p></reply>

The imposition and removal of lending   restrictions is a matter for the Central Bank.</p>  <p>  Section 35 of the Credit Union Act, 1997 contains lending limits that apply to all credit unions, including a limit on the maximum outstanding liability to an individual member, and limits on the percentage of the loan book that can be outstanding for periods exceeding both five years and ten years. Under these provisions credit unions can lend up to 30% of their loan book over five years and up to 10% of their loan book over 10 years and may apply to the Central Bank for an extension to their longer term lending limits.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that as set out in the Feedback Statement on CP88 under the Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2015, credit unions will continue to be allowed to lend up to 30% of their loan book over five years and up to 10% of their loan book over 10 years, subject to a maximum maturity of 25 years. In addition, credit unions can apply to the Central Bank for an extension to their longer term lending limits (up to 40% of their loan book over 5 years and up to 15% of their loan book over 10 years). Approval will be subject to conditions set by the Central Bank. As indicated in CP88, the Central Bank is reviewing the conditions that currently apply for credit unions to be approved to extend their longer term lending limits. Data from the September 2015 Prudential Return indicates that lending over 10 years in credit unions accounts for 2.18% of total loans in the credit union sector. </p>  <p>  In February 2015 the Central Bank commenced a lending restriction review initiative, whereby credit unions that are subject to a lending restriction, but are satisfied that they have made the necessary improvements and have embedded these improvements in robust risk sensitive lending practices, could apply for a review of their lending restriction. The closing date for receipt of applications to review lending restrictions under this initiative was 30 September 2015. 59% of applications received have been reviewed by the Central Bank.  Of those which have been fully reviewed, 83% have had their lending restriction lifted and are now operating under the board's stated credit risk appetite. Approximately 40% of credit unions that applied, submitted their application in September and these applications are currently under review.</p>  <p>  Given a number of areas identified in feedback received on CP88 and through other engagements with sector stakeholders the Central Bank will engage with interested parties to participate in focussed dialogue in the coming months. One area of initial focus will be credit unions' aims regarding longer term lending including further developments on the provision of mortgages to members. </p>  <p>  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is absolutely determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement. </p></reply>

This represents approximately 99.83% of the total Ordinary Shares in issue. The forthcoming capital reorganisation will see the conversion of &euro;2.14 billion of 2009 Preference Shares into &euro;2.67bn worth of newly issued Ordinary Shares. The exact number of Ordinary Shares to be issued is currently the subject of discussion between officials of my Department and the bank. A current and fair calculation of the bank's underlying value will form the basis of this discussion. Therefore it is too early to give a precise number of Ordinary Shares that the State will receive, though given that the State currently owns such a high proportion of the Ordinary Shares, the percentage ownership of the company will not change materially.</p>  <p>  The State's 2009 Preference Shares are a perpetual instrument and there is therefore no predetermined maturity date - they are repayable at the option of AIB subject to the bank having sufficient capital and also receiving regulatory approval. The SSM approval for a redemption of &euro;1.36 billion of the Preference Shares for &euro;1.7 billion is conditional on the conversion of the remainder to Ordinary equity. This is a mutually beneficial arrangement which allows the State to begin monetising its investment in the bank while allowing AIB to normalise its Balance Sheet. The conversion of Preference Shares into Ordinary Shares does not in any way delay the return of capital from the State's investment in AIB, rather the opposite is the case. Conversion of a portion of the Preference Shares fast tracks the bank's ability to remunerate and redeem State aid through the bank's own cashflow and also opens up the possibility of the State monetising some of its equity investment through a sale process in the future. </p>  <p>  The conversion and redemption will bring to an end the annual payment of dividends on the Preference Shares. However it is important to note that the State will retain 99.8% ownership of AIB into the future and following this capital reorganisation we are confident that the bank will be capable of resuming ordinary dividends in the future helping to replace this lost income. The future payment of these dividends is a matter for the Board of AIB and their regulator and given the fiduciary and regulatory obligations involved I cannot be specific about the exact timing and quantum that might be involved.</p></reply>

It has been keen to facilitate other market participants in their attempt to get access to sites which could contribute to residential supply.  In this respect, NAMA, fully in accordance with its obligations under Section 10 of the NAMA Act to maximise the achievable financial return to the State through its management and disposal of assets securing its loans, has overseen the sale by its debtors and receivers of zoned sites with capacity to deliver approximately 11,000 new residential units in the Dublin area.  However, as the Deputy points out, to date just 900 of these units have been built or are under construction.  This may reflect a number of issues, including planning impediments, the difficulties surrounding commercial viability at current sales prices and costs, and the return expectations of some market participants who have decided not to build until prices are higher.  The consequence of these issues generally in the market place is that not enough new residential units are being built to meet demand. </p>  <p>  Against that backdrop NAMA's commitment to funding, on a commercial basis, additional residential supply not only helps it to obtain the best achievable return on its assets by enhancing disposal values but also helps in terms of making a wider social and economic contribution.  I am advised that, since the start of 2014 NAMA has funded the construction of over 2,000 new houses and apartments across 46 development projects in the greater Dublin area.  A further 2,200 new units are under construction across 39 development projects in the Dublin area and planning permission has been obtained for a further 4,400 new units, on which construction is expected to commence in 2016.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that, at my request, the NAMA Board has carried out a preliminary, high-level analysis of development sites controlled by its debtors and receivers with a view to identifying the scope for residential delivery over the five-year period to the end of 2020.  Based on this preliminary analysis, the Board has informed me that a delivery target of 20,000 residential units before the end of 2020 is potentially achievable.  This 20,000 is in addition to the 2,000 units delivered prior to my Budget announcement in October.  NAMA's commitment to funding additional residential supply, on a commercial basis, is a positive step and I am sure that the Deputy welcomes the announcement.</p></reply>

The reduction in the interest rates on the EU element of these loans, achieved in 2011, resulted in estimated savings of some &euro;9 billion over the initially envisaged lifetime of these loans.  The repayment of some 81 per cent of IMF loans, which was completed earlier this year, will generate further interest savings, estimated at over &euro;1.5 billion, over the original lifetime of these loans. The current interest rate on the residual IMF loan balance is just 1.05 per cent. </p>  <p>  There is limited scope for additional interest savings resulting from further early repayment of EU-IMF programme loans. </p>  <p>  Firstly, unlike in the case of the early IMF repayment of late 2014 and early 2015, Ireland would be subject to a break-cost charge were it to repay some of the other loan facilities early. These charges could negate any potential savings arising from a potential early repayment.</p>  <p>  In addition, the early repayment of programme loans to the IMF, EFSF, EFSM, United Kingdom, Sweden or Denmark would trigger automatic mandatory proportional early repayments to each of the other programme funding partners unless, as was the case with the early IMF repayment, the other lenders agreed to waive the mandatory proportional early repayment clause.  A condition of this agreement to waive this clause in the case of the early IMF repayment was that Ireland retains a significant element of IMF funding in order to maintain the IMF's participation in post-programme monitoring for the duration initially envisaged, which is out to 2021.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would add that as part of the recent re-financing of a &euro;5 billion EFSM maturity, resulting from the maturity extensions to EFSF and EFSM loans granted in mid-2013, the EU raised funding at a weighted average yield of just over 1.1 per cent and with a weighted average life of approximately 14 years. As of close of business Monday 9 November, the yield on the 2.4% Irish Government Treasury Bond maturing in 2030 was 1.80 per cent, approximately 70 basis points higher than the weighted average yield on the re-financed EFSM loan.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-11-12a.240.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111200059#WRH00300"><p>I assume the Deputy is referring to the comments made by Governor Honohan at the Small Firms Association annual lunch on 6 November last in the context of SME lending.  In relation to the question of banks being risk averse, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the recently published Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey April - September 2015 <i>)</i>.  A total of 1,500 telephone interviews were conducted with a random sample of Irish micro, small and medium SMEs.  The survey shows that, when pending applications are excluded, 85% of credit applications to banks were approved or partially approved. </p><p>In addition, both AIB and Bank of Ireland have increased new lending significantly year on year.  Bank of Ireland recently announced new credit approvals for Irish businesses to the end of September 2015 of &euro;3.6 billion, up c.13% on the same period last year.  Permanent TSB have also recently commenced lending to SMEs.  The Credit Review Office (CRO) continues to review loan applications which have been rejected by the banks and is overturning 55% of appeals.  I would encourage any SME who has had a credit application declined to avail of the services of the CRO ().</p><p>In relation to encouraging greater competition in the banking sector, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland's (SBCI) mandate and objectives include the fostering and driving of competition in SME lending through the provision of low cost long term funding to both banks and non-bank providers of credit to SMEs.  In doing so, it seeks to facilitate the growth of smaller participants and the entry of new market participants by providing them with the low cost liquidity that will enable them to compete with the larger banks.  SBCI funding is offered on substantially the same terms and the same price to all SME credit providers that are credible, credit worthy, can meet its operational requirements and pass on the benefit of the lower cost funding to their SME clients.  This creates a new forum for competition in the use of SBCI funding between banks and non-banks and enables emerging and newly entering SME credit platforms to grow their businesses.  Over 3,200 Irish SMEs benefited from SBCI loans in the SBCI's first seven months in operation (March to September 2015), borrowing &euro;110 million in total through AIB and Bank of Ireland. </p><p>More recently, the SBCI has announced its support for two strong emerging non-bank providers of credit to SMEs with a &euro;50 million facility now up and running with Finance Ireland, a provider of leasing and hire purchase financing for vehicles and equipment and a &euro;25 million facility with Merrion Fleet, which provides vehicles and fleet management services to SMEs at a lower cost.  Furthermore the SBCI has a pipeline of new SME credit providers that it intends to bring to the market over the next six months and beyond, which will further enhance competition and support new types of finance in the market.  Further details of the SBCI's current supported products and where they may be accessed are available on its website ).</p><p>The counter-guarantee amendments being brought forward by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to the Credit Guarantee Amendment Bill (2015) are intended to enable the leveraging of related EU financial instruments in this area, such as the European programme for competitiveness of SMEs, COSME; Horizon 2020 funding earmarked for SMEs; and the European fund for strategic investment, EFSI, administered by the European Investment Bank and European Investment Fund, better known as the Juncker plan.  This will allow Ireland to optimise its return from such major EU initiatives.</p><p>As regards interest rates charged by the banks to SMEs, the recent CBI publication, &quot;Microfinancial Review 2015:1&quot;, states that &quot;the mean rate on SME loans during 2014 was 5 per cent in Ireland, compared to 3.5 per cent in the euro area.&quot;  However, the report goes on to note that &quot;differences in the underlying lending composition, however, may be a factor here. For example, the data include restructured and renegotiated loans, of which there is likely to be an increasing share in Ireland.  Cross-country differences are also likely in terms of loan type and borrower type.&quot;  It should be noted that in the most recent Department of Finance SME credit demand survey, covering the six month period to September 2015, only 1% of SMEs that did not demand credit thought that it was too expensive to borrow.</p><p>Finally, I believe that competition is the best way to achieve a sustainable long term solution to the issue of high mortgage repayments and the Government has undertaken a number of initiatives in order to promote competition in the market.  For example, it introduced the changes to Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 in the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement Act) 2013 for new entrants.  This section regulates fees and charges and the changes mean that it does not apply for the first three years of operation of new entrants to the Irish banking sector. It is anticipated that new entrants will enter the mortgage market and bring welcome competition to this sector.</p></reply>

The OPW continues to have a statutory responsibility for the maintenance of this scheme.</p>  <p>  Works were carried out on this channel in late 2014 to facilitate the strengthening of the adjacent Flood Defence Embankment.  Works involved widening the existing channel to source material to strengthen the adjoining Flood Defence following the spring storms of 2014 where this flood defence became breached.  As a result of the widening of channel, the storage capacity has been increased, which has a positive effect on the drainage network in the area.  OPW will shortly investigate whether the channel requires additional maintenance works.</p>  <p>  Over the past 18 months, the OPW resources on the River Maine Catchment have been deployed in repairing, maintaining and improving flood defence assets (including sluice structures).  These assets provide protection against flooding to a large number of residences, and suffered extensive damage in the storms of 2014.  Work on the defence assets has been prioritised.

Any reduction is to be effected by the Minister for Health by regulation, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Section 10 of the Act also extends similar powers to any Minister of the Government and such powers have been exercised to reduce the payments in respect of services delivered, for example, by State Solicitors.   </p>  <p>  This measure, along with the other measures contained in the FEMPI Acts 2009-2013, continues in force and makes a significant contribution to meeting our international fiscal obligations including bringing the general government deficit below 3 per cent of GDP.  However, the measures provided under the legislation should only represent those that are critical to the achievement of our fiscal targets.  </p>  <p>  As was stated in my most recent annual review of those Acts, while any immediate reversal of the reductions would significantly compromise our ongoing progress towards ensuring fiscal stability and meeting our fiscal consolidation targets, the continuation by my colleague, the Minister for Health, of the measures applied to contracted Health Professionals under the Act will have regard to the need to commence the gradual unwinding of the measures, as for other groups affected.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the FEMPI Bill 2015 which is currently before the Oireachtas proposes the amendment of Section 9 of the FEMPI Act 2009 to provide that payments made to certain health professionals may be varied (other than by being reduced) by the Minister for Health with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  A similar amendment to the same effect is proposed for Section 10. </p></reply>

Following a decision taken at Cabinet on Tuesday 3<sup>rd</sup>November, it was decided to immediately establish an inter-departmental Task Force to examine the wide range of issues identified in the recent Guardian newspaper report and make recommendations on appropriate actions, based on a cross Governmental approach.  I chaired the first meeting of the Task Force on Thursday 5<sup>th</sup>November and my colleague Minister of State, Ged Nash, from the Department of Jobs, Employment and Innovation also attended the meeting.  Due to the complex nature of the issues arising, the Task Force includes high level representatives from the Departments of, Justice and Equality, Jobs Enterprise &amp;amp; Innovation, Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, BIM, the Naval Service, Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and my own Department. </p><p>In order to formulate the most appropriate and effective response, it is necessary to first establish a full understanding of the complex issues involved.  At the first meeting of the Task Force, the State Authorities shared information on their individual remits and experiences and committed to producing a co-ordinated response.  The meeting considered the complex issues arising from the Guardian article and among the key issues also discussed were information sharing, enforcement, permitting, licensing, exploitation, and trafficking.</p><p>As Minister with responsibility for chairing this cross Departmental Task Force, my main focus will be, to bring forward to Government a joined up State response in relation to the issues identified.  Where appropriate, I consider that <i>we need to take robust and proportionate immediate actions including any medium term changes to the regulatory and enforcement frameworks of the State.</i></p><p>The next meeting has been arranged for today, 12<sup>th</sup>November and I have invited a number of stakeholders to address the Taskforce.</p></reply>

The only source of funding available to the 2016 National Reserve will be from any unused funds from the 2015 National Reserve and from clawback arising from the sale of entitlements without land in 2016.  Therefore the resource will be limited.  It is however expected that the level of demand in 2016 and subsequent years will be significantly less than in 2015 which was the first year of operation of the National Reserve under the Basic Payment Scheme.  The EU Regulations governing the operation of the National Reserve set down that the priority for the allocation of entitlements from the National Reserve is given to the two categories of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant to farming&rsquo;. If there is sufficient funding available to provide a National Reserve in 2016, application forms and terms and conditions governing the scheme will be available in 2016 with a closing date of 15th May 2016.  The Young Farmers Scheme is available each year from 2015 to 2019.  Eligible young farmers may receive payment from the Young Farmers Scheme for a maximum of five years following the commencement of their agricultural activity.

The Commission, which was established on 31 October 2014, is the statutory body responsible for enforcing consumer protection and competition law in Ireland. </p>  <p>  During 2014, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation introduced the new Competition and Consumer Protection Act (No 29 of 2014). The Act provides for the making of provisions for regulating certain practices in the grocery goods sector.  I understand that the Department of JEI is currently finalising the implementation of Grocery Regulations under this legislation.  This, I hope, will guide the supermarkets in how they deal with producers in a fair and reasonable manner.</p>  <p>  The price levels struck by growers with retail outlets are entirely a commercial matter. Whilst it is not my role to set supermarket prices for agricultural products or to be involved in price negotiations between growers and retailers, I very much encourage greater co-operation and discussion between all parties in order to ensure the viability of the largest number of Irish growers possible.</p>  <p>  The Horticultural Forum was established to act as a voice for the edible horticultural sector to represent the interests of the sector in relation to issues facing Irish growers, which would include strengthening the position of growers in the supply chain.  Membership of the Forum includes growers, other stakeholders including companies involved in the marketing of edible horticultural produce, and representatives of Bord Bia, IFA &amp;amp; Teagasc. In order to avoid any conflict of interest, my Department is not represented on the Forum but is available to attend meetings and to provide technical assistance.  The Forum has a broad remit and has established a smaller steering group to direct its activities.  It has engaged a consultant to provide some guidance in respect of a number of areas of interest.  The Forum sets its own agenda and my Department is not involved in influencing what subjects it pursues.</p></reply>

Sheep farmers in County Galway will continue to benefit under the same wide range of schemes and supports that are available to sheep farmers in other counties in Ireland.  Payments under the former Grassland Sheep Scheme with unspent CAP Pillar 1 funds have been taken into account under the new Basic Payments Scheme (BPS). Many sheep farmers will also benefit significantly from the model of convergence to be applied in Ireland where those with a low initial value will see their entitlements increase over a period of time.</p>  <p>  Advance payments under the BPS commenced in Ireland on 16 October 2015, which is the earliest that payments can commence under the governing EU Regulations.</p>  <p>  The Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014-2020 under Pillar 2 of the CAP also contains various schemes that have been designed to support the sheep sector. Many sheep farmers continue to be significant beneficiaries from the Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) scheme. The ANC Scheme is worth &euro;195 million annually to some 100,000 farmers and in excess of &euro;1.3 billion over the life time of the RDP. Advance payments under ANCs commenced in Ireland at the end of September. The GLAS scheme in the RDP will also benefit sheep farmers. Access to GLAS is on a tiered basis with those in Tier 1 receiving top priority. These farmers are mainly those with Priority Environmental Assets, which include Natura land and Commonage. Therefore, many sheep farmers will qualify for Tier 1 access to GLAS as a result.</p>  <p>  I have made provision for improving efficiency and profitability in sheep production under Knowledge Transfer Groups, which has an overall budget of &euro;100 million. In addition to profitability, the emphasis will be on the key issues of business skills, environmental sustainability and herd health, with increased interaction between individual farmers and facilitators in order to customise information exchange. The experience of the nationally funded Sheep Technology Adoption Programme (STAP), in which 4,000 producers participated and with funding of &euro;3 million in 2015, informed the development of the sheep Knowledge Transfer Groups. STAP was continued for a third and final year in 2015, prior to the commencement of sheep Knowledge Transfer Groups in 2016. The farmer will receive a total payment of &euro;750 per annum for his participation.</p>  <p>  Capital investment schemes are being introduced under the TAMS II measure in the RDP, several of which will provide for sheep farmers including grant aided support for sheep housing and both mobile and fixed handling equipment for sheep. Furthermore, an amendment has recently been submitted to the European Commission to specifically include sheep fencing under the TAMS II scheme.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to support Sheep Ireland which receives an annual operating grant and infrastructure aid. The funding is given to cover a range of areas including data collection infrastructure, operation of a sheep breeding database, geneticists to design a genetic evaluation system that suits Irish grass based production systems and operation of a ram testing programme. Ongoing investment is required in all these areas, in order to provide reliable evaluations on rams and breeding ewes and to encourage better breeding in the sheep sector.</p>  <p>  In addition to these supports it is important for sheep farmers to try and gain the maximum returns from the market, and to date in 2015 the average factory prices are around 2% higher than the amount in 2014. The combination of buoyant prices, steady slaughtering supplies and increased carcass weights mean that the output of the sector is almost 4.5% ahead of last year in terms of economic value. Growth in the sector will come from an increase in consumer demand and export market opportunities as well as from improved technical efficiencies. Therefore my Department continues to search for new markets in cooperation with Bord Bia, Irish Embassies abroad and the meat industry. For example the market in Hong Kong opened for exports of sheepmeat in 2014 and exports of sheepmeat were valued at almost &euro;9 million in 2014.</p></reply>

The Schemes involved include the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and the Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) Scheme.</p>  <p>   Under EU Regulations, all applications must be subjected to robust administrative checks prior to payment. The main element of the administrative check is an area assessment. This is achieved by using the detailed database of individual land parcels.  This is known as the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) which currently records, electronically, some 1 million individual land parcels and which is required to be kept fully updated. </p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s systems in this critical area must meet demanding EU and national audit requirements. Only valid applications under the BPS and ANC that fully comply with the requirements of the EU legislation are paid. Consequently, all applications under the Schemes are subject to administrative checks.  Cases that do not pass the validation process go into error and cannot be paid pending a resolution of the error concerned. These errors include over-claims, dual claims and incomplete application forms. In addition, applicants under the ANC scheme must fulfil stocking density and retention requirements. My Department enters into correspondence, mainly through the issuing of query letters to farmers, in order to resolve these error cases. </p>  <p>  My Department has received approximately 120,000 applications under the BPS from applicants who currently hold entitlements and 102,000 applications from those eligible under the ANC scheme. </p>  <p>  In relation to the BPS and Greening Payment, I am pleased to confirm that advance payments began issuing in Ireland on 16 October 2015.   This is the earliest that payments can commence under the governing EU Regulations.  In addition, I can confirm that the level of the advance payment was set at 70% for 2015 rather than the normal 50%.  The increase in the advance payment for 2015 is, in particular, due to the difficulties encountered in the dairying and pigmeat sectors. </p>  <p>  Despite the extension of the closing date for the receipt of applications by two weeks, with a consequent reduction of the processing time available, Ireland is among the earliest to pay the BPS in the European Union and, to date, 107,875, farmers have received payments totalling &euro;680.1 million. </p>  <p>  In relation to the ANC Scheme, I can confirm that payments commenced, on schedule, on 23 September 2015 and that to date, 82,242 farmers have received payments totalling &euro;175 million.  There are no advance payments under this scheme.   </p>  <p>  As outstanding cases are fully processed and are cleared of any outstanding error, they will be processed for payment.  My Department is prioritising the processing of all such outstanding cases with regular payment runs continuing over the coming weeks for all fully processed cases.  Balancing payments under the BPS are scheduled to commence from 1 December.</p></reply>

The legislative basis for this is set out in SI 118 of 2014 which requires that all animals with a date of birth on or after 1 January 2013 must be tested for the presence of the BVD virus.  Excellent progress has been made on the programme to date with a very high percentage of herds complying with the requirement to test their calves and the incidence of persistently infected (PI) animals falling from 0.67% in 2013 to 0.46 % 2014, with a further reduction anticipated in 2015. However, there are still a relatively small number of farms on which persistently infected animals are being retained.</p><p>I should emphasise that the BVD programme is an industry led programme. Nevertheless, my Department provides significant financial supports to farmers to encourage them to dispose of their persistently infected (PI) animals promptly. Details of these supports are available at: </p><p>Following consultation with the BVD Implementation Group, earlier this year my Department issued almost 500 restriction notices to non-participating herds, as they had failed to comply with their legal obligation to test their calves for BVD. These notices have led to steady progress being made in reducing the number of retained PI animals. The restriction notices continue to be issued by my Department&rsquo;s local offices. </p><p>My Department also intends to write to herdowners informing them of the risks posed to them by the presence of PI animals on the farms of neighbouring farmers. These notifications will allow neighbouring farms to review their biosecurity generally and to take measures to protect their herds, including ensuring that boundaries are adequate to prevent nose to nose contact and grazing management (particularly of breeding animals) to minimise the likelihood of contact. </p><p>The epidemiological modelling work undertaken by AHI indicates that the eradication of BVD is achievable by 2020 provided that farmers remove PI animals in line with veterinary advice.</p></reply>

The Government recommended, when approving the publication of the Report, that it should in the first instance be the subject of a detailed discussion at the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform. </p>  <p>  The Committee held its first discussion on the Report on 13 July, 2015.  At this meeting the Committee agreed that my Department should prepare a report for the Cabinet Committee, in conjunction with relevant Departments, on the legal, financial and practical implications of the Report's recommendations.  Relevant Departments were contacted seeking their views on the Report's recommendations, asking them to identify any impacts and issues that may arise and timescales for implementation.  An analysis, based on observations received from the relevant Departments and agencies, of the recommendations contained in the Report of the Working Group has been prepared for the Cabinet Committee.</p>  <p>  One of the key recommendations in the report which goes to the heart of the length of time people spend in Direct Provision is the early enactment of the International Protection Bill and in that regard, the Government has decided to bring forward as a major priority legislation which will provide for the introduction of a single applications procedure for international protection.  This reform will simplify and streamline the existing arrangements and provide applicants with a final decision on their protection application in a more straightforward and timely fashion.  This is aimed at addressing one of the key issues identified in the report, that is, the length of time persons remain in the direct provision system.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that the Convention has a very broad scope across a number of policy areas with policy and legislative implications.  The provisions of the Convention and the legislative and administrative arrangements that would enable Ireland to ratify the Convention have been identified following consultations with Government Departments and agencies.  Last month I received Government approval to an action plan which, when implemented, will enable Ireland to ratify the Convention.  This 18 point plan is published on the website of the Department of Justice and Equality and each action has a time frame.  I also intend to include those actions in the new National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence.  I expect to publish the Strategy, which will cover a multi-year period from 2015, before the end of the year. </p>  <p>  A range of legislative reforms will implement elements of the Istanbul Convention.  These include the recently published Sexual Offences Bill, the Domestic Violence Bill, the Victims of Crime Bill, the Court of Appeal Act, 2015 and the Children and Family Relationships Act, 2015.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland is a dualist State, Article 29.6 of the Constitution providing that international agreements have the force of law to the extent determined by the Oireachtas.  It is essential therefore that the State is in a position to meet the obligations it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland.  Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.</p>  <p>  On 21 October 2015, Minister Fitzgerald and I published a roadmap to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the CRPD, which outlines legislative changes to be undertaken to enable Ireland to ratify the Convention, along with the estimated timeframe involved.  We also approved the drafting of an omnibus Bill to progress miscellaneous legislative amendments necessary to proceed to ratification, the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, the General Scheme of which will be published by the end of this year with a view to enactment in 2016.</p>  <p>  The Roadmap to Ratification is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  It sets out the considerable work currently underway to deal with outstanding barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification, including legislation governing decision-making capacity, mental health legislation, the law governing the administration of electro-convulsive therapy (ECT), amendments to the criminal law, and the removal of archaic and offensive references in legislation across Government Departments to persons being &ldquo;of unsound mind&rdquo;.  Other hurdles include the resolution of the constitutional issue concerning reasonable accommodation, and ensuring that the Convention&rsquo;s requirements are met in relation to deprivation of liberty.  These, along with any outstanding miscellaneous legislative amendments, will be resolved in the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.</p></reply>

The person currently has permission to reside in the State until 4 March 2016.</p>  <p>  Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in her absolute discretion, grant a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled.  One such condition is that the applicant is required to have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a further total residence in the State amounting to four years.  Periods for which an individual did not have the permission of the Minister for Justice and Equality to reside in the State, or periods of residence which were for the sole purpose of having an application for refugee status determined, or periods of residence where permission was granted for the purposes of study are are not reckonable for the purposes of satisfying the residency conditions for naturalisation.  It is open to any individual to lodge an application for citizenship if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements.  Detailed information on Irish citizenship and naturalisation is available on the INIS website at www.inis.gov.ie.  The website also contains an on-line naturalisation residency calculator which individuals may find of assistance in establishing if they meet the residency requirements.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

All death in custody reports are published on my Department&rsquo;s website. Furthermore, in September 2014 I published the Inspector&rsquo;s Omnibus Report of investigations onto the deaths of prisoners - 1st January 2012 to 11th  June 2014.</p>  <p>  I take the findings of these reports extremely seriously, as does the Director General of the Irish Prison Service. I am on record as stating that the death of any person in State custody must be thoroughly examined and I expect that the Irish Prison Service and indeed all the statutory agencies involved, will work hard to address the findings and recommendations in the Inspector&rsquo;s reports.</p>  <p>  The Inspector&rsquo;s investigations and reports are part of a three pronged process - the other aspects being the investigations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the investigations and Inquests conducted by the Coroners. I am satisfied that this process ensures that Ireland is in compliance with its national and international obligations and meets the strict criteria laid down by the European Court of Human Rights when interpreting the procedural requirements of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service is making arrangements for a full evaluation of all healthcare protocols and procedures in order to ensure full compliance. Means of developing and communicating all Standard Operating Procedures to ensure a greater level of awareness and standardisation throughout the prison estate are also being examined. </p>  <p>  In addition, the circumstances of each death in custody are subject to an internal review process by the suicide prevention group for the prison institution concerned. This group is chaired by the respective prison Governors, and includes representatives from all the services across the prison estate, including medical, psychology, chaplaincy, probation, education, and prison staff. The internal review fully covers the background and circumstances of each death in custody, and its objective is to identify any possible measures which may be implemented which can contribute to a reduced risk of deaths in custody in future.</p>  <p>  The Internal Review Reports are considered by the National Suicide and Harm Prevention Steering Group, which is chaired by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service. The Steering Group then ensures that the relevant findings of those reports are disseminated throughout the prison system.</p></reply>

The project will cover an employment support service incorporating an employer helpline, provision of advice and information around employment of people with disabilities, organising events, networking on disability, and using their mainstream channels to promote this work. </p>  <p>  I understand that the employer organisations have agreed to work together and jointly oversee this service, which one of the employer bodies has agreed to host and oversee day to day delivery of the agreed service.

Among the measures agreed under the Programme was the establishment of a Network of Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres (EROCs) which would be used to provide accommodation and meet the basic needs of asylum seekers relocated from hotspots in Italy and Greece while their applications for refugee status are processed.   </p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the EU relocation programme, persons considered for relocation who will be accommodated in EROCs upon arrival, must be from countries with a recognition rate for asylum of at least 75%.  Accordingly, the expectation is that a large proportion of relocated persons will qualify for refugee status within a very short time.  These new centres and the services to be delivered therein, must therefore be established in a manner that facilitates a fast throughput of people from arrival to determination of status while still ensuring they receive sufficient orientation on the societal context in which their applications are being processed and additional integration supports to help them integrate quickly into Irish society where refugee status is granted.  </p>  <p>  It is in this context that officials in my Department, responsible for implementing the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, were tasked with the sourcing of suitable accommodation and orientation services for the proposed network of EROCs.  This involves an assessment of information regarding available State properties provided by the Office of Public Works which is ongoing, and a request for expressions of interest from commercial accommodation providers, which was advertised in the national media on 9th October 2015.  I understand that approximately 40 expressions of interest have been received so far covering in excess of 80 locations nationwide offering a full spectrum of different accommodation types.  These commercial expressions of interest are currently being evaluated alongside the information provided by OPW in respect of State properties.  A key component of the evaluation process for both commercial and State properties will be a consideration of the suitability of the premises being offered, examining a range of factors. </p>  <p>  I expect this process in respect of state owned properties of the type referred to in the question, to be completed in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

In the main, these emergency situations arise out of hours. </p>  <p>  At present, out-of-hours emergency services for children at risk in the greater Dublin area are provided by Tusla through the Crisis Intervention Service (CIS). The remit of the service is to respond to crisis situations in which a child or young person requires immediate placement either due to child protection concerns or accommodation issues.  The service is delivered by Tusla's social work service. </p>  <p>  Outside the greater Dublin area, a more limited Emergency Place of Safety Service (EPSS) is provided for the Agency under a commercial arrangement by Five Rivers Ireland.  Under Section 12 of the Child Care Act, 1991, a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may remove a child to a place of safety where they have reasonable grounds for believing that there is an immediate risk to the health or welfare of a child.  Under the EPSS, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can access an emergency placement for such children found to be at risk out of hours.  The child is placed in a family setting until the following working day, when the local social work service assumes responsibility for the case.  The intention is to expand this service so that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can consult with a social worker out of hours.  This is presently not the case outside the greater Dublin area.   </p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that Tusla has confirmed that it is commencing the Emergency Out of Hours Service (EOHS) later this month.  The EOHS will incorporate the existing Emergency Place of Safety Service.  The key objective of the service is to co-operate with and support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the execution of their duties and responsibilities under Section 12(3) of the Child Care Act, 1991 and referrals made under Section 8.5 of the Refugee Act, 1996.</p>  <p>  The EOHS will provide the following services:</p>  <p>- A national EOHS Call Centre providing Social Work consultation and advice to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;</p>  <p>- Placements for children under Section 12(3) of the Child Care Act, 1991 provided on contract by an external contractor;</p>  <p>- Placements for children referred under Section 8.5 of the Refugee Act, 1996;</p>  <p>- Access by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to a local On-call Social Worker.</p>  <p>  Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are the key agencies empowered by law to protect and promote the welfare of children and they have separate yet complementary roles.  Mutual understanding and co-operation is essential in ensuring that these roles are carried out effectively and in a child centered manner. </p>  <p>  The protection of children in emergency situations outside normal working hours requires close joint working between the agencies.  It is important that children in these circumstances can be brought to an appropriate placement which in most cases will be a family setting.  The aim of the EOHS will be to ensure that the disruption and suffering to which children may be exposed in these situations is minimised and the rights of parents and guardians are respected.  The introduction of the EOHS will assist in maximising inter-agency co-operation and promoting the safety and welfare of children.</p></reply>

The programme is designed to be delivered for three hours per day, five days per week, over 38 weeks (183 days per year), and capitation fees are paid to participating services on the basis of this provision.  A standard capitation fee of &euro;62.50 per week per eligible child is paid to participating child care services with a higher capitation fee of &euro;73 per week paid to services with more highly qualified staff.  </p>  <p>  In participating services, preschool leaders are currently required to have a minimum of a Major Award at Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) (or equivalent) to qualify for the standard capitation rate and a Major Award at Level 7 on the NQF (or equivalent) and 3 years experience working in the sector to qualify for the higher capitation rate.  It is stressed that the higher qualified staff attracting the higher capitation rate must work directly with the children at all times during the ECCE sessions. </p>  <p>  My Department published a list of Early Years Recognised Qualifications earlier this year following a review of the qualification certification submitted in relation to staff working in early years services that are on contract to deliver the ECCE programme.  The service in question was in receipt of the higher capitation rate in the school year 2014/2015 based on a specific qualification and this service continues to receive the higher capitation rate in the current school year.  However, the qualification that this service provider submitted is not on the published list of awards that merit the higher capitation.</p>  <p>  The application of the service provider referred to by Deputy is being given further consideration and a letter confirming the outcome will issue to the provider in due course. </p></reply>

In that regard, the ED Taskforce Implementation Group, co-chaired by the Director General of the HSE, is charged with ensuring that all relevant areas of the health service, including acute, social and primary care optimise resources to deal with the challenges arising.  Significant progress has been made to date on the overall ED Taskforce plan, including a steady reduction in delayed discharges from hospital (577 on 10 November 2015, down from 830 in Dec 2014).  The wait time for Nursing Home Subvention Scheme funding has been reduced from 11 weeks at the beginning of the year to between 2 to 4 weeks.  This progress has been allied with increased provision for transitional care funding, home care packages and nursing home beds.</p><p>In preparation for the 2015/16 winter period, hospital groups have provided comprehensive winter resilience plans to the HSE, outlining how they will implement an integrated approach across primary, community, social and acute services to manage winter pressures.  This approach is intended both to avoid unnecessary admissions to acute hospitals and to expedite discharges from hospital efficiently.  Within hospitals themselves, a total of 129 beds which had been closed for refurbishment or for infection control purposes during 2015 are to be re-opened by the end of November.</p><p>A further 301 beds are being added to support the acute hospital system over the winter period across various locations, including Cork, Limerick, Drogheda, Galway and North Dublin - all areas which are regularly identified in the media as pressure points for the delivery of emergency care.</p><p><b>&euro;18m</b>in funding has been provided to support these developments.  The opening of additional capacity is contingent on staff recruitment and, at some sites, the completion of minor building works within very stringent timeframes.</p><p><b>Emergency Department Priority Actions</b></p><p>In addition the Groups and CHO&rsquo;s  are implementing the priority actions in the ED Task Force Plan to enable sustainable change.  These include:</p><p>-  Strong centralised operational processes within hospitals to drive bed management and discharge planning, such as &ndash; 'home by 11'; 7 day discharges; transfers to model 2 hospitals;</p><p>- Consistent access to senior decision making within ED to ensure appropriate admission and to enable effective discharge management on a 7 day basis;</p><p>- Timely and appropriate access to diagnostics;</p><p>- Delegated discharge and enhanced roles for nursing including expansion of ANP roles within ED &ndash; nurse prescribing;</p><p>- Achievement of the agreed targets for delayed discharges &ndash; 500 at national level;</p><p>- Effective management of demand and capacity requirements in relation to scheduled and unscheduled care; and</p><p>- Appropriate structures within Hospitals and with local community services to ensure an integrated and timely response to continuing care needs.</p><p>All hospitals have escalation plans to manage not only patient flow but also patient safety in a responsive, controlled and planned way that supports and ensures the delivery of optimum patient care.</p><p>I note that the emergency department in Kerry General Hospital has had some peak activity in recent weeks.  As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to investigate activity levels and trends in the emergency department in Kerry General Hospital and respond to you directly.

The previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable of all new entrants to public service recruitment grades (including teachers) by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011 and required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale.</p><p>  Subsequently, following the public service-wide review of allowances and premium payments, the Government decided to withdraw or modify allowances for new beneficiary public servants with effect from 1 February 2012. Under this decision, certain allowances were withdrawn for new beneficiary teachers, including qualification allowances. However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.</p><p>  These measures were implemented at a time of very difficult financial and budgetary circumstances for the State.</p><p>  Alleviation of the salary imbalance between those who entered the public service since 2011 and those who entered before that date began under the Haddington Road Agreement. Improved pay scales for post-1 January 2011 and post-1 February 2012 entrants to teaching were agreed and implemented under the terms of that Agreement. In addition, allowances payable to post-1 January 2011 entrants and such allowances as remain payable to post-1 February 2012 entrants were restored to pre-2011 levels.</p><p>  The Lansdowne Road Agreement will, through salary increases and a reduction in the Pension-Related Deduction, begin the process of restoring the reductions to public service pay which were implemented over recent years. The issue of equalised pay scales was not one which could be resolved in the discussions which lead to the Agreement. However, the flat-rate increases contained in the Agreement will be proportionately more favourable to new entrants to teaching (who are lower on the pay scale) than to longer serving teachers.</p><p>In addition, in order to address concerns about the casualisation of employment in the teaching profession, my Department implemented at the commencement of the 2015/16 school year the seven key recommendations of the Expert Group on Fixed-term and Part-time Employment in Teaching, which was established under the Haddington Road Agreement.  Circulars 23/2015 and 24/2015 detailing the arrangements and procedures for the implementation of the recommendations of the report were published on March 27th 2015.  One of the key features of the new procedures is that the qualification period for the granting of an initial Contract of Indefinite Duration (CID) is reduced from a period of continuous employment in excess of three years with the same employer to a period of continuous employment in excess of two years.</p></reply>

The staffing arrangements for the 2015/16 school year are set out in Circular 0005/2015.</p><p>  Under these arrangements a school's GAM/EAL allocation for the 2015/16 school year is based on its mainstream classroom posts for the 2014/15 school year. Appendix C of Circular 0005/2015 lists the GAM/EAL allocation for all schools.</p><p>  Schools have autonomy on how to deploy the resource between language support and learning support depending on their specific needs.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has recommended the introduction of a new resource allocation model for schools, which will allow schools to allocate resources to pupils taking into account their individual learning needs, as opposed to being based primarily on a diagnosis of a particular disability.A pilot of this new resource allocation model is currently taking place in a number of schools.</p><p>  In relation to school buildings, I want to assure you that funding is being made available as part of the Government's continued commitment to fund improvement and upgrading works in existing school buildings throughout the country. In this regard, I am pleased to be able to tell you that, earlier this month, I was able to announce that a minor works grant will be paid to primary schools later this year. I also announced that a multi-annual Summer Works Scheme will be run in 2016 and 2017.  The Summer Works Scheme for 2016 is now open for applications on the Esinet portal with full details of the Scheme itself on the Department's website www.Education.ie. The school in question can apply for funding under the 2016 Scheme for any high priority works needed to the building.</p><p>  In relation to funding, my Department provides capitation funding to all recognised primary schools.</p><p>  The amount of grant paid to an individual primary school for capitation and ancillary services is determined by the school's enrolment, subject to a minimum grant for both capitation and ancillary services in respect of schools with enrolments up to 60, and a maximum ancillary services grant in the case of schools with enrolments of 500 or more. I have no plans to change these arrangements.</p><p>  In 2015 the capitation grant is &euro;170 per pupil, and the Ancillary Services Grant is &euro;147 per pupil.</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that Circular 40/2009 clarifies issues relating to the allocation of funding for primary schools. The circular states that capitation funding provided for general running costs and funding provided for caretaking and secretarial services may be regarded as a common grant from which the Board of Management can allocate according to its own priorities.</p><p>  I do recognise however the need to improve capitation funding for primary schools having regard to the reductions that were necessary over recent years. In Budget 2015 I was able to secure the first increase in education spending in recent years and a further increase in education spending was achieved in Budget 2016.  I am determined to continue pressing the case for increased investment in education.</p><p>  While l am unable to meet the Principal and teachers of this school I hope the information provided in this answer helps to clarify the position for them regarding the issues raised in their correspondence.  if they have any further queries in relation to these issues they can contact my Department directly re same.</p></reply>

A number of specific measures have been, and will continue to be, introduced to reduce the amount of waste generated in the State and to increase the segregation of waste which cannot be prevented in line with Government policy .   The introduction of pay by weight charges for the collection of household waste is one such measure .    During the period in which local authorities were directly involved in the collection of household waste, a minority of individual Councils offered different levels of discount to selected households, based on different qualification criteria.</p>  <p>  As local authorities exited the waste collection market, some required the private operators which took on the Councils&rsquo; customers to provide a level of discount for existing waiver customers only, and even then for a limited time. The vast majority of contractual commitments for private operators to provide a waiver have now expired. In that context, the number of households in receipt of waiver discounts is likely to decline over time, especially as some householders were able to take advantage of special reduced offers elsewhere which actually undercut the waiver price. However, selected private operators still offer some level of discount to former waiver customers on a voluntary basis.</p>  <p>  In addition, a very limited number of local authorities make financial contributions towards the cost of, or pay for, the collection of waste from certain households. Again, the qualification criteria and level of support differ from area to area.

Deletion from the RPS may also come about where it has been decided that a more appropriate method of protecting a particular structure would be by including it within an Architectural Conservation Area.

The package of commitments on mortgage arrears announced by Government in May of this year included a number of amendments to the AHB Mortgage to Rent Scheme which will enable more properties to qualify for the Scheme, and make it more flexible and accessible to borrowers. The principal amendment to the scheme is to increase the valuation thresholds applicable which should enable more properties to qualify. These amendments took effect from 1 July 2015.</p><p>Since the Scheme began in June 2012 a total of 3,120 cases were considered to the end of October 2015.

The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established as an   independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants.</p>  <p>  Due to the quasi-judicial role of the PRTB it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the specifics of any case.  The PRTB, as an independent statutory body, will adjudicate each dispute on its own facts and merits and may grant redress and give specific direction as appropriate on foot of a determination order. Receipt of a determination order is the official notification to parties of the final outcome of a dispute resolution case. The order sets out the terms to be complied with, including any payments owing and the length of time given to comply. In making determination orders, the PRTB can make provision to allow for payment of awards in instalments to facilitate recovery of the award, based on the circumstances of the case.  A party who fails to comply with one or more terms of a determination order is open to having legal proceedings taken against him or her in the Courts.   </p>  <p>  Under the Act, enforcement of PRTB determination orders is a discretionary power and the Board exercises this power taking account of the circumstances pertaining to each case. While there is no legal obligation on the PRTB to enforce, the Board takes the issue of non-compliance with determination orders very seriously. In 2014 alone it referred 402 cases to its legal advisors for enforcement proceedings. It is also open to parties to pursue enforcement independently through the Courts, including the seeking of a garnishee order. It should be noted that going to Court does not of itself ensure successful enforcement and more particularly, recoupment of an award. In many cases the best option, and one which the PRTB facilitates, is for the parties to agree a schedule of payments.</p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 is currently before the Oireachtas and will amend the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to provide, inter alia, for the introduction of a new procedure to enforce a tenant&rsquo;s obligation under section 86 of the 2004 Act to pay rent pending the determination of a dispute.</p>  <p>  As part of the Government Housing Package announced on 10 November, the enforcement of PRTB determination orders will no longer have to be pursued through the Circuit Court, but may be pursued through the District Court. This will save landlords who are dealing with such situations considerable time and expense. This will allow the PRTB to deal effectively and quickly with tenants who do not comply with their statutory obligation to pay rent during the dispute process. The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 has passed all stages in the D&aacute;il, together with second stage in the Seanad , and will return to the Seanad for Committee Stage shortly.</p></reply>

Under this Direction , each of the identified housing authorities must ensure that at least the relevant percentage, referred to above, of the dwellings available for allocation under Section 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 during the specified period will be allocated to households that are qualified for social housing support (i.e. those who are on the record of qualified households) and that, on or before 1 June 2015, have been deemed by the authority to have one or more of the following needs:</p><p>(i) was in an institution, emergency accommodation or a hostel (i.e. a homeless household within the meaning of Section 2 of the Housing Act 1988);</p><p>(ii) has an accommodation requirement arising from an enduring physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual impairment (i.e. households where one of its members has a disability and as such is deemed to be a vulnerable household); and</p><p>(iii) was in accommodation that was unsuitable for the household's adequate housing on exceptional medical or compassionate grounds (i.e. including households the subject of domestic violence and young people leaving State care and as such deemed to be a vulnerable household).</p><p>A copy of this Direction is available on my Department's website at:<i></i>.</p><p>This Direction succeeds a previous similar Direction which applied from 27 January 2015 to 26 July 2015.

As is usual in major and broad ranging projects such as this, the project team involves a wide range of expert institutions and companies. CDM Smith is the lead consultant in the consortium engaged to carry out the programme of research and that consortium includes the British Geological Survey, University College Dublin, Ulster University, AMEC Foster Wheeler and Philip Lee Solicitors, each offering a particular specialism required by the project scope.</p>  <p>  The Terms of Reference for this research programme were agreed by a broadly based Steering Group following public consolation which yielded more than 1,300 submissions on the draft Terms of Reference. The EPA and the Steering Committee reviewed the submissions and the draft Terms of Reference were amended and strengthened after this public consultation. I understand that the contract for this programme of research was awarded following a robust evaluation process in compliance with public procurement guidelines, where the tender submitted by the CDM Smith headed consortium was evaluated as being the strongest bid. </p>  <p>  I am aware that there has been some comment on the fact that internationally CDM Smith has provided expert advice to oil companies involved in the development of unconventional gas resources. I should point out that CDM Smith has also provided advice to State bodies and regulatory agencies across its area of expertise. </p>  <p>  As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, it is common that a broad range of parties will seek to draw on the specialist expertise available from a firm such as CDM Smith. The fact that disparate entities seek to draw on such expertise, is generally seen as an indicator of a company's recognised experience. </p>  <p>  Queens University Belfast (QUB) was initially participating as part of the Research Consortium. I understand that due to a change in resources available in QUB, the tasks allocated to QUB were transferred to CDM Smith supported by the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland.

I am advised that the expected life span out of water, as it is currently understood and estimated, has since been exceeded and therefore the likelihood is that all of these clams are dead. However, it is not possible to definitively verify that each and every individual within the sample material is non-viable without a detailed and expensive analytical examination down to the level of each individual.</p>  <p>  IFI confirm that the material is in storage at its facility in Longford, isolated from other materials, to ensure as a priority that no bio-security risk is posed from this material while disposal advise is awaited from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</p>  <p>  While IFI has no statutory remit in relation to invasive species, I would be happy to facilitate a detailed briefing for the Deputy from IFI on interventions to date as they relate to matters within their remit.</p></reply>

A series of 84 public meetings around the country have taken place, facilitated by the local authorities in conjunction with the Ireland 2016 Project Team. Arising from this, I, together with An Taoiseach and my colleagues in Government, launched 31 local authority plans on 8th  October.  </p>  <p>  I am actively engaging with representatives of the various relatives groups and individual relatives to ensure that they will have a central role in a number of key State events.  The Ireland 2016 Project Team meet regularly with the 1916 Relative&rsquo;s Association and engagement is positive to date and a good working relationship is in place.</p>  <p>  The programme reflects the complexity and diversity of our history and of Ireland today.  As with all the key events in this Decade of Centenaries, this inclusive approach gives people across the island of Ireland the opportunity to explore, reflect on and build greater understanding of and respect for the many intertwined traditions on this island.  </p>  <p>  I, my officials and officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been meeting with various interested groups and organisations in Northern Ireland over the last number of months including local authorities to inform them of the various elements of the programme and I hope that people can engage with the various aspects of the programme that interest them in an appropriate way.</p>  <p>  For example, earlier this year, my team presented the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme in Queens University which was supported by the Community Relations Council and I was heartened to hear at the level of engagement from all communities represented at that public meeting.  I look forward to continued engagement on this over the course of the next few months.</p>  <p>  I and the Ireland 2016 project Team very much appreciate the enthusiasm and positive engagement from all stakeholders and look forward to continuing to build on these successful partnerships as the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme develops.</p></reply>

Primary responsibility for the support and promotion of film-making in Ireland, in respect of both the indigenous sector and inward productions, is the responsibility of the Irish Film Board.  This includes assistance with locations for the making of films.  In 2015, I approved a provision of &euro;14.6 million for the Film Board, which maintained its funding at the same level as in 2014.  The allocation of resources from within that provision is a matter for the Film Board, as the statutorily independent agency responsible for the promotion and development of the Irish film industry.</p>  <p>  The other primary mechanism by which the Government supports the film industry is through section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 - the Film Tax Relief Scheme.  This scheme has undergone a number of improvements, which took effect in January this year.  These changes have been well received and were developed following consultations between my Department, the Irish Film Board, the Department of Finance and the audio-visual industry.  The intention is to ensure that Ireland remains competitive in attracting film projects.  The Film Tax Relief Scheme has been extended to the end of 2020 and in the recent Budget the Government announced an increase in the cap on this tax relief from &euro;50 million to &euro;70 million.  This increase on its current level will help to attract further big budget productions to these shores.  I am confident that these measures will increase the attractiveness of Ireland as a destination for film investment and allowing the audio-visual production sector to maintain existing jobs and create new ones.  In this regard, Government Departments and public agencies are often key to assisting film companies in providing locations and other supports for film making.</p></reply>

The five themes, which underpin the programme &ndash; Remembering; Reconciling, Presenting, Imagining, and Celebrating - are intended to give people scope to think about the events of 1916 and its legacy in a way that is personal and meaningful to each individual.</p>  <p>  The programme reflects the complexity and diversity of our history and of Ireland today.  As with all of the key events in this Decade of Centenaries, this inclusive approach gives people across the island of Ireland the opportunity to explore, reflect on and build greater understanding of and respect for the many intertwined traditions on this island.  A number of elements of the programme will take place on an all-Island basis, including an all-island schools history competition, which was developed in partnership with the Department of Education in Northern Ireland, and will give schools the chance to explore any aspect of life or events in 1916.  There are other initiatives such as drama and song competitions which will engage children on an all-island basis.  It should also be noted that while the focus of the Ireland 2016 programme is on commemorating the events of one hundred years ago, this centenary is also a chance to celebrate all that has been achieved on the island of Ireland in the last one hundred years.  A formal state event will be held to mark the journey of reconciliation from Easter 1916 to Easter 2016, and highlight the importance of the Good Friday Agreement in that regard.  The significant role and influence of the diaspora on the events of one hundred years ago will be prominently acknowledged and we will also seek to celebrate the continued close ties with the vibrant diaspora we have today, as well as with Ireland&rsquo;s many friends overseas.</p></reply>

The programme is an invitation to everyone on the island of Ireland and to the global Irish community to shape and engage in a diverse range of historical, cultural and artistic activities &ndash; all designed to facilitate reflection, commemoration, celebration, debate and analysis and an active imagining of our future.  I am committed, together with my Government colleagues, to ensuring that, as we commemorate those who fought and those who died in 1916, we also acknowledge the many civilians and non-combatants who lost their lives, including figures such as Francis Sheehy-Skeffington.  An Interfaith Service will be held on 3rd April in Glasnevin Cemetery, where all those who lost their lives during the Rising, including civilian dead will be remembered.  </p>  <p>  Under the 'Community Participation' strand of the programme, the 31 local authorities have recently published their plans for a suitable programme of events and initiatives to take place at a county level following an extensive public consultation process.  It is envisaged that many local authorities will be hosting specific events and developing initiatives dedicated to commemorating all those who lost their lives, including civilians and children.</p></reply>

This has included intense and ongoing engagement with turf cutting interests, farmers, non-governmental organisations and the European Commission. </p><p>A long-term compensation scheme has also been introduced to compensate cutters for their loss arising from the cessation.  This cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme is comprised of a payment of &euro;1,500 per annum, index-linked, for 15 years, or relocation, where feasible, to a non-designated bog, together with a once-off incentive payment of &euro;500.</p><p>Some 3,149 applications for raised bog special areas of conservation have been received under this scheme.  8,521 annual payments have been made in respect of the applications received.  In addition,<font color="#FF0000"> </font>1,501 once-off incentive payments and 772<font color="#FF0000"> </font>turf deliveries have been made to applicants from these sites.</p><p>The draft National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan was published in January 2014.  It sets out how the raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed into the future and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed. </p><p>Notwithstanding the complexity involved, progress in relocating turf cutters to non-designated bogs is being achieved in a number of cases.  Potential relocation sites had been identified for each of the raised bog special areas of conservation where relocation may be required.  When relocation sites have been assessed as suitable, my Department has been seeking expressions of interest from turf cutters with a view to them moving to these sites. </p><p>For a number of these special areas of conservation, the relocation site identified may not be suitable or may not have the capacity to cater for the number of turf cutters who may wish to relocate there.  In such cases, and in the context of the finalisation of the National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, my Department, in consultation with turf cutting interests, is considering the available options in terms of relocation and the provisions of the EU Habitats Directive.  Under article 6.3 of the Directive, consent could only be given to cut turf on a raised bog special area of conservation where it can be shown that such cutting will not have an adverse effect on the site.  Under article 6.4 of the Directive, consent could only be given to cut turf on a raised bog special area of conservation for imperative reasons of overriding public interest. </p><p>Given the clear scientific evidence of the negative impact of turf extraction on raised bogs, it will only be possible to utilise the provisions of article 6.3 in a small number of cases.  Similarly, the flexibility provided for under article 6.4, if required, will only be applicable to a small number of sites.</p><p>Some 171 applications from Mouds Bog and 60 applications from Ballynafagh Bog in County Kildare have been received under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme for raised bog special areas of conservation. 463 annual payments, 199 turf deliveries and 46 once-off incentive payments have been made in respect of the applications received from these sites. </p><p>Discussions are ongoing between my Department and local turf cutters with a view to relocation from Ballynafagh Bog to a non-designated bog, which has been assessed as suitable for relocation. </p><p>Lattins Bog, also known as Mouds North Bog, in County Kildare, has been assessed as a suitable relocation site for turf cutters from Mouds Bog.  My Department had sought expressions of interest from qualifying applicants under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme with a view to relocation to this site.  However, the level of interest received in relocation to this site has been muted. </p><p>I am advised that discussions have taken place between external experts, engaged by my Department, and local turf cutter representatives with a view to examining whether turf cutting could take place on Mouds Bog where it can be shown that such cutting would not have an adverse effect on the site, in accordance with article 6.3 of the Habitats Directive.</p><p>The <i>Review of Raised Bog Natural Heritage Areas,</i>which is available to download from my Department&rsquo;s website at <i></i>, provides details on future arrangements regarding turf cutting on each of the 75 raised bog natural heritage areas.</p><p>Carbury Bog natural heritage area in County Kildare is one of the natural heritage areas which are to be conserved.  In the case of this bog, the review envisages the cessation of turf cutting on the site by 1 January 2017 to preserve its conservation value.  Turf cutting may continue on the bog until that date, on plots that have been cut in the five year period prior to the Government decision of 14 January 2014 on the review.</p><p>The cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme has been extended to land owners and turbary right holders affected by the restrictions on turf cutting in raised bog natural heritage areas.  No applications for compensation have been received, to date, in respect of Carbury Bog. </p><p>The Natural Heritage Area review also envisages the complete or partial de-designation of 46 existing natural heritage areas where turf cutting may continue into the future.  Hodgestown Bog natural heritage area in County Kildare is one of those de-designation cases.</p></reply>
