Implementation of this policy, as well as delivering substantial environmental benefits, is securing significant economic benefits for the State and our citizens. For example, the wind energy sector employs around 3,400 people in Ireland. In addition, the SEAI estimates that &euro;255 million in gas imports was avoided by wind energy in 2012 alone. Wind energy accounts for the largest proportion of our renewable energy resource. The development of wind energy projects must take account of the concerns of local communities in relation to the potential impacts of such projects in their areas. A range of measures are being taken in this regard. The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, in conjunction with my Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), is undertaking a targeted review of the Wind Energy Planning Guidelines to address key issues such as noise (including separation distance) and shadow flicker. I understand draft revised guidelines will be issued for public consultation in the next week or so, with a view to revised guidelines being in place from mid-2014.    I have clearly stated my view that renewable energy developers must ensure that they undertake effective and timely communication from the initiation of projects right through to commissioning and operation. It is essential that local communities are engaged and consulted on an on-going basis. </p><p>  Such an approach is of course also necessary in the development of community wind farms. I agree with the Deputy that there is real potential for wind farms to be developed and owned by local communities which would make an important contribution to improving public acceptance of the technology, and to ensuring benefits are delivered directly to the community in which a wind generation facility is located. </p><p>SEAI has taken a number of initiatives aimed at fostering social acceptance of wind energy and the development of community wind farms. The report commissioned by the SEAI &quot;To Catch the Wind: the potential for Community Ownership of Wind Farms in Ireland&quot;, provides a template for development of community wind farms. More recently, SEAI has commissioned research which will include guidance on the financial models for the execution of community wind energy projects. This research is nearing completion. All of this work develops the resource available to communities wishing to develop their own wind farms and avail of existing market supports such as the REFIT scheme and the European Agriculture Fund for Rural Development, to which community wind farm project developers may apply through the regional Leadership Partnerships.  </p></reply>

This decision was based on the advice I received that the current bids are not a fair reflection of the strength and potential of the Bord G&aacute;is Energy business.   As the Deputies may be aware, the Gas Regulation Bill recently completed its passage through the Oireachtas. The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the restructuring of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, including the sale of the Bord G&aacute;is Energy business. In the course of the debates on this Bill, several Deputies questioned whether the State should proceed with the sale of the Bord G&aacute;is Energy business and whether the sale would amount to a fire sale of assets. I have on several occasions reiterated to this House that there would be no fire sale and that disposals would be undertaken only when market conditions are right. </p><p>  The decision not to proceed with the current bids for the Bord G&aacute;is Energy business underlines my commitment and reflects my resolve to ensure that the State achieves value from the State asset disposal process. </p><p>  The sale process was led by Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann and overseen by a Government Steering Group which included officials from my Department, the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance, and the NewERA unit of the NTMA. I am advised that the process was conducted in a professional, open and transparent manner. The sale process has been underway for over six months, with every effort made to achieve an acceptable value for the Bord G&aacute;is Energy business. It was ensured that all bidders had ample time to submit their final offers.</p><p>The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I will now consider options for the the Bord G&aacute;is Energy business. The enactment of the Gas Regulation Bill keeps all options open, including a future sale of the company which would require this enabling legislation. My Department, along with NewERA, will work with BG&Eacute; to ensure continued investment in and development of Bord G&aacute;is Energy, which is a growing and successful business, while also completing the separation of Bord G&aacute;is Networks and Bord G&aacute;is Energy as required by the EU Gas Market Directive.   </p></reply>

EirGrid's consultations have involved opening five regional information centres at Midleton, Carlow, New Ross, Carrick-on-Suir, and Kilcullen, a lo-call project information telephone line, local radio advertising, and national and local print advertising. I understand that thirty-three open days were held within the project area over the last 16 months and that since autumn 2012, the Grid Link Project team has visited marts, shopping centres and agricultural shows, attending over 120 events to date where thousands of stakeholders have engaged with the team. </p><p>  I am also aware that EirGrid&rsquo;s report on Stage 1 of Grid West identified a number of route corridor options for the new line. Eirgrid recently announced the Emerging Preferred Route Corridor following extensive consultation on 16 potential route corridors. EirGrid have held five open days in October in Moygownagh, Ballaghaderreen, Swinford, Foxford and Carrick on Shannon to discuss the preferred route. Residents from the project area were invited to view maps of the route corridor options, and to provide feedback on any constraints near or on the corridors. EirGrid has also taken observations and feedback at a project information centre in Linenhall Street, Castlebar. The preferred route will be the subject of further public consultation between now and spring 2014. </p><p>  The current consultation process is a key opportunity for public input as no decisions have been made regarding the final routes of these electricity lines. EirGrid has stated that it will fully take on board information and views in relation to the projects which are still at an early stage. Ultimately, it will fall to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to determine whether the views expressed have been adequately taken into account in the final project design. </p><p>  The Government does not seek to direct the energy infrastructure developers to particular sites or routes or technologies as was made clear in the 2012 Government Policy Statement. That Statement emphasises that these are matters for the developers and for the forward planning process through regional and local development plans and at project level through the development management process. The Government does, however, require EirGrid to take account of all relevant national and international standards, to follow best practice and ensure value for money. </p><p>  EirGrid has confirmed that its planning applications will have to include a published formal assessment of the available alternatives as regards each project, for consideration by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p><p>  Conventional overhead line is still the most common solution adopted both worldwide and in Europe. In excess of 95% of high voltage transmission lines are overhead in Europe and construction of 400kV overhead lines is continuing in all EU countries.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-12-04a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013120400068#WRA01300"><p>The overarching objective of the Government's energy policy is to ensure secure and sustainable supplies of competitively priced energy to all consumers. Ireland is currently heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels to meet our energy needs. While it is acknowledged that fossil fuels will remain part of the energy mix for some time to come, progress is being made towards increasing the share of renewable energy in our energy requirements. The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources. Provisional figures for 2012 indicate that 19.6% of Ireland's electricity demand was met by renewables. To date wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. In 2012, 15.3% of Ireland's electricity demand was met by wind generation. At the end of quarter three this year, the total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid was over 2,100 MW. It is estimated that a total of between 3,500 and 4,000 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target. Currently, approximately 3,000 MW of renewable generation has taken up connection offers under the Gate 3 grid connection programme. The primary support mechanisms for renewable electricity in Ireland are the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff (REFIT) schemes. In order to facilitate the rate of build of renewable generation capacity required to meet the 2020 target, a number of changes to the REFIT 1 and 2 schemes were introduced in 2013.    Ireland&rsquo;s excellent renewable energy potential can also be developed for export. Expert advice and evidence shows that Ireland has the capability to achieve its national target for renewable electricity from onshore renewable generation alone, with capacity to spare. This means that there is potential for projects of scale, both onshore and offshore, that are aimed at the export market. Work is progressing well on negotiating an Inter-Governmental Agreement between Ireland and the United Kingdom for the export of renewable energy from Ireland to Great Britain. </p><p>  One of the key requirements for proposals of a significant scale for wind energy export will be the achievement of the necessary planning consents in Ireland. Planning permission for such projects, which will be determined by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, must await the putting in place of a clear national planning policy framework and I have asked my Department to prepare such a framework. The Renewable Energy Export Policy and Development framework, which will be developed over the next 12 to 15 months, will provide the opportunity to integrate relevant EU Directive requirements (including Strategic Environmental Assessment and Appropriate Assessment), trans-boundary dimensions and stakeholder participation within the context of a national framework. </p><p>  Separately and in order to progress the development of our wind energy resource, while at the same time ensuring that wind energy developments do not have a negative effect on local communities, the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, in conjunction with my Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, is undertaking a targeted review of the Wind Energy Planning Guidelines to address key issues of noise (including separation distance) and shadow flicker. I understand draft revised guidelines will be issued for public consultation in the next week or so, with a view to a revised document being in place from mid-2014. </p></reply>

I have no statutory function in the setting of electricity tariffs, whether in the regulated or non-regulated market. Prices in the electricity retail market are now fully deregulated. Price setting by electricity suppliers is a commercial and operational matter for the companies concerned. Electric Ireland has been offering a feed-in tariff to domestic microgenerators since February 2009. The scheme has now been extended to the end of 2014.Individual electricity supply companies remain free to make payment offerings in respect of surplus electricity supplied to the grid on a commercial basis. No other electricity supply company has chosen to enter the market and to offer a microgeneration feed-in-tariff, although the CER invited them to do so.  </p></reply>

However in the first instance, it is critical to draw a distinction between matters that, while inappropriate, are not generally criminal, and outright criminal activity, such as the possession, production or distribution of images of child abuse. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Justice and the criminal justice system have an excellent record in rooting out those who would create, share or profit from this type of material, and while I will help in this in any way that I can, these matters are the responsibility of Minister for Justice to deal with.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I met with representatives of the main Internet Service Providers to discuss developments in the UK in July, Following on from that, last week I announced the formation of the Internet Content Governance Advisory Group consisting of experts in the fields of child safety and online behaviour as well as technical experts and representatives from industry. This Group will consider the emerging issues around online content and its general impact on the lives of children and young people, including online bullying or harassment as well as the issues that arise from age inappropriate viewing of content. </p><p>  This Group will take submissions from the public or interested groups, and will produce a report for by the end of May 2014. Their objective will be to to offer recommendations aimed at protecting children and young people without limiting unduly their opportunities and rights online.The Forum will have regard to international best practice, including recent European Commission Reports and Council Conclusions in this area, and will also be asked to comment specifically on the recent report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee titled &lsquo;Addressing the Growth of Social Media and tackling Cyberbullying&rsquo;.</p></reply>

A further marketing exercise will be undertaken in 2014 on foot of the Government&rsquo;s commitment in Budget 2013 to provide additional Exchequer funding of &euro;57 million for the Better Energy Programme. The funding is anticipated to support the delivery of energy efficiency upgrades to approximately 17,000 homes under the Better Energy Homes scheme and another 14,000 homes experiencing energy poverty under the Warmer Homes scheme. </p><p>  The SEAI and my Department are open to new and innovative ways to promote and to ensure good homeowner awareness and engagement with both schemes. Currently, a variety of channels and media are used including print, radio and internet advertising, digital and social media, public relations and participation in national consumer exhibitions. The SEAI also collaborates with trade representative bodies and obligated energy suppliers under the Better Energy Programme in these promotions to increase their overall reach to homeowners. </p><p>  Due in no small measures to the successful promotion of the schemes, the SEAI is on target to deliver fully on their commitment to address 10,000 homes experiencing energy poverty and 12,000 homes under the Better Energy Homes scheme by the end of 2013.</p></reply>

These schemes were introduced to incentivise the development of renewable electricity generation capacity necessary to allow Ireland to meet its target of 40% of electricity demand from renewable generation by 2020. REFIT operates by providing a guaranteed minimum price for electricity exported to the grid over a 15 year period, thus giving the certainty project developers need to be able to finance their projects. REFIT is funded from the Public Service Obligation levy. The REFIT 1 scheme is now closed for applications. The REFIT 2 scheme was opened in March 2012 and will close for applications at the end of 2015.It is important to note that any project of a significant scale and specifically for renewable energy export, will require the signing of an Inter-Governmental Agreement which would have to ensure no net cost or risk to the Irish State or consumer. A support scheme for export projects will not be developed by Ireland or supported by Irish consumers. Any support mechanism that is proposed for the export projects will be a matter for the UK authorities. It is also important to note that the amount of energy to be procured by the United Kingdom and the mechanisms for sharing the resultant economic benefits, including an appropriate return to the Exchequer, are matters to be addressed in any potential Inter-Governmental Agreement. In the process of formulation of Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy policy, my Department takes full account, as appropriate, of renewable energy policies in other member states.  </p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services are available to all of our citizens and businesses. The Plan aims to deliver high speed broadband to all parts of Ireland through two principal means: (a) by providing a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and (b) by providing a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, there is evidence that industry is investing beyond the targets to which they committed in the Plan. eircom has extended its plans for the rollout of high speed services, with speeds of up to 100Mbps, to 1.4m premises, UPC has increased its minimum and top speed products to 120Mbps and 200Mbps respectively, and mobile operators are rolling out enhanced product offerings, including 4G mobile. Other operators continue to invest and ESB is currently considering the prospect of utilising its distirbution network to rollout fibre broadband services. </p><p>  These developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. </p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector over the coming years, the results of which will inform the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.</p><p>  It is the case, in Europe and elsewhere that all countries are seeking solutions to the challenge of rolling out quality broadband services. When making comparisons with other countries, care needs to be taken to compare like with like. In Ireland we have a highly dispersed low density population, in contrast to some other countries. Additionally, the manner in which broadband speeds are calculated is relevant. OECD publishes advertised speeds without reference to customer access. The speeds are the highest speeds marketed nationally. These comparisons do not necessary reflect universal public access to those speeds. </p><p>  The availibility and uptake of higher speed offerings in the market place in Ireland is evident, with the largest growth in subscriptions taking place in the category of speeds greater than or equal to 30Mbps, at 29.9% at end Q2 2013.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

About a quarter of Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development assistance is channelled through Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). This reflects the strong contribution which Irish NGOs are making to the fight against world poverty and hunger, and the broad support which they continue to receive from the Irish public. Funding is provided to support the long-term development work carried out by NGOs in developing countries, as well as emergency humanitarian assistance and development education programmes. Given the level of Government funding for the NGO sector, the issue of their internal governance arrangements is a matter of legitimate public interest.   It is important to note, however, that NGOs are independent organisations.  The salary levels of their employees are determined by the Board of the NGO and are typically funded from a variety of income sources, including general donations from the public, bequests and official funding.<font color="#004080"> </font></p><p>  In relation to the funding provided through the Irish Aid programme, the Department appraises funding applications from the NGOs and assesses the cost efficiency and effectiveness of their projects and programmes and the basis of their expenditure decisions.   Financing agreements between Irish Aid and NGO partners include clear parameters on certain cost categories, including administration costs. A limit of 6% of funding provided can be allocated to administration costs, with remuneration levels for senior executives<font color="#004080"> </font>being reviewed in the context of overall administration costs. </p><p>  In 2012, Irish Aid entered into agreements for a new series of programme grants with the larger Irish development NGOs for their long term development work over a four year period. These agreements require the NGOs to follow best practice financial reporting standards for<font color="#004080"> </font>staff salaries as set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice in place in the UK.  This British standard is currently used by Irish Aid, pending the regulation of the Charities Act 2009. In line with the standard, NGOs are required to set out in their published audited financial statements the number of staff receiving salaries above &euro;70,000.</p></reply>

Solid fuel is defined under section 77 of the Finance Act 2010, as amended and means coal or peat.  Coal is further defined to include coal and lignite, solid fuel manufactured from coal and lignite, and any other energy product within the meaning of Article 2.1 of Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 in solid form.  Peat means peat falling within CN Code 2703 of the Combined Nomenclature of the European Communities referred to in Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2658/87 of 23 July 1987, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2031/2001 of 6 August 2001 and includes any solid fuel manufactured from peat.</p><p>  I am advised by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government  that the Air Pollution Act (Marketing, Sale, Distribution and Burning of Specified Fuels) Regulations 2012 (S.I. No. 326 of 2012), specifies the environmental standards for coal placed on the market and provides the regulatory framework in relation to the distribution and sale of coal in the State. </p><p>  Under the Regulations, all coal bagging operators and certain solid fuel suppliers trading in bituminous coal must be registered with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Those who must register include all fuel wholesalers and distributors of bituminous coal but only those retailers for whom 50% or more of their total annual sales proceeds are from bituminous coal. However all retailers who trade in bituminous coal must ensure that their fuel wholesalers are registered with the EPA and must hold a record to this effect with their supplier's registration number. Furthermore, retailers who sell bituminous coal are required to hold a record setting out the registration number of the bagging operator who supplied the product. Retailers must also ensure that, where the unit of sale is a bag, then the bag must be sealed.  </p><p>  In particular, the Regulations also require that all bituminous coal sold outside smoky coal ban areas for residential use outside those areas must have a sulphur content of no more than 0.7% , which is lower than that in Northern Ireland and therefore bituminous coal supplied to Northern Ireland standards for sale on that market may not be sold in the State. Compliance with the Regulations will be enforced by the Local Authorities. A verification mechanism, SWiFT 7, has been developed by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) for the verification of sulphur content in coal. This provides for a robust mechanism to counter the sourcing of coal from Northern Ireland. </p><p>  Suppliers who produce and supply solid fuels in contravention of these regulations are subject to investigation and prosecution by local authorities and other State Agencies charged with enforcing the regulations and preventing such supply.  </p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of carbon tax on solid fuels, also advise me that on commencement of the carbon tax provisions under the Finance Act 2010, any Northern Ireland-based wholesaler of solid fuels selling into the market in Ireland will be obliged to register as a supplier and comply with the same regulatory requirements as wholesalers based in the State. Such suppliers will be obliged to make returns on solid fuels supplied in the State in the accounting period concerned and pay the amount of carbon tax due in respect of that supply. </p><p>  Therefore it is not my intention to defer the second phase of the carbon tax which is due for implementation in May 2014.</p></reply>

In recognition of these cost pressures, a number of support measures are in place to ease the burden on working parents. These include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which funds community childcare services to enable them to charge reduced childcare fees to qualifying parents, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme which provides free childcare places to qualifying F&Aacute;S and VEC trainees and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides for a free pre-school year for children in the year before commencing primary school. Generous entitlements to paid and unpaid maternity leave as well as child benefit payments are also provided.    The Department of Social Protection provides financial support to families on low pay by way of the Family Income Supplement (FIS) and to one-parent families through the one-parent family payment. </p><p>  In addition, a One Parent Family tax credit of &euro;1650 is provided.

For the years of assessment 2013 and 2014, in order to qualify for the <i>income tax exemption</i> a single individual&rsquo;s income must be less than &euro;18,000 or in the case of a married couple or civil partners, &euro;36,000.   These exemption limits are increased by &euro;575 in respect of each of the first 2 qualifying children and by &euro;830 in respect of each subsequent qualifying child living with the claimant.</p><p>  In addition, section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, provides for income tax relief in respect of qualifying expenses incurred in the provision of health care in a tax year against the income tax paid by an individual for that year. </p><p>  Health care is defined as the prevention, diagnosis, alleviation or treatment of an ailment, injury, infirmity, defect or disability, and includes care received by a woman in respect of a pregnancy.  It does not include routine ophthalmic treatment, routine dental treatment, or elective cosmetic surgery.   </p><p>  Relief at the standard rate of income tax is available to all taxpayers, regardless of age for such expenses where they have not been reimbursed under a medical insurance policy. However, the cost of maintenance or treatment in a nursing home, which provides 24-hour nursing care on-site, is available at the claimant&rsquo;s marginal rate of income tax. </p><p>Further details in relation to relief for health expenses are set out in leaflet IT6 which is available on the Revenue website at <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i></p><p>  Tax relief is also provided at the standard rate of income tax, regardless of age, for medical insurance premiums paid to cover a range of medical expenses. Since 2004, the relief also covers premiums paid on dental insurance policies for non-routine dental treatment. For the payments to qualify for relief, they must be made to an authorised insurer listed in the Register of Health Benefit Undertakings, established under the Health Insurance Act 1994.</p><p>  Since 2001, the relief is granted under a tax relief at source system to all holders of medical insurance irrespective of whether or not they have a tax liability to offset the value of the relief. The subscriber pays the premium net of tax relief and the insurer obtains a refund of the relevant amount from the Revenue Commissioners.   </p><p>  As you will be aware, from 16 October 2013, tax relief for medical insurance premiums has been restricted to the first &euro;1,000 per adult and the first &euro;500 per child insured.  Any portion of premium paid in excess of these ceiling will no longer qualify for tax relief. The new ceilings will ensure continuing support via the tax system for those who purchase standard policies, while reducing Exchequer exposure to more expensive policies.   </p><p>  It should be noted that there is no relief against Universal Social Charge for either health expenses or medical insurance premiums. However, it should be noted that payments from Department of Social Protection such as the State Pension are exempt from the Universal Social Charge (USC).    In addition, individuals aged 70 and over, provided their total income does not exceed &euro;60,000, are not liable to the top rate of charge and payments from the Department of Social Protection will not be taken in to account in determining if an individual has exceeded the &euro;60,000 threshold.  </p></reply>

Following this the NTMA established a specialist Banking Unit and a small number of skilled professionals were recruited from the private sector to create a team capable of dealing with the very significant banking sector challenges facing the State.   In March 2011, following a competitive tender process, the NTMA appointed a panel of legal firms (A&amp;L Goodbody, Arthur Cox and Matheson) under a framework agreement to provide legal services to the NTMA Banking Unit. As part of the same competitive tender process, the NTMA also entered into a general agreement with Arthur Cox to provide general legal services on an ad hoc basis to the NTMA Banking Unit. The appointments were made on the basis of agreed discounted hourly rates and/or fixed fees where appropriate. The agreements were awarded for a period of three (3) years and services were drawn down as and when required &ndash; accordingly, there was no contract value specified.</p><p>  In April 2011, the Minister for Finance announced the creation of a stand-alone unit accountable to him through the Department of Finance to provide State oversight of the banking system and drawing on the resources of the NTMA to carry out its work. The delegation of banking system functions to the NTMA was revoked with effect from 5 August 2011 and the NTMA Banking Unit has since then been seconded to the Department of Finance where they form part of the Department&rsquo;s Shareholder Management Unit. The agreements referred to above were subsequently novated to the Department of Finance with effect from January 2012 to support the performance of the Department&rsquo;s banking functions. The agreements explicitly provided for the novation of the agreements to other State entities; this possibility was explicitly provided for when the agreements were entered into.</p><p>  The work the various legal firms undertook for the NTMA Banking Unit prior to the revocation of the NTMA&rsquo;s banking functions on 5 August 2011 was principally as follows:</p><p>  i) banking and financial services advice, </p><p>  ii) capital markets including advice regarding bond issuances, </p><p>  iii) private and public company merger and acquisition advice, </p><p>  iv) EC and competition advice including State aid issues and general competition law compliance, </p><p>  v) insolvency and corporate recovery advice including liquidation, examination, and receiverships, </p><p>  vi) regulatory advice including advice on the licensing of credit institutions, categorisation and treatment of regulatory capital, </p><p>  vii) Employment law advice and</p><p>  viii) Litigation and dispute resolution advice including advice regarding corporate litigation.</p><p>  The agreements are due to expire in March 2014 and the Department of Finance will therefore be requesting tenders for a panel of legal firms to replace the existing panel in advance of that date.</p><p>  In the report into the Department of Finance&rsquo;s appropriation accounts for 2012 the C &amp;amp; AG commented as follows:</p><p>  &ldquo;The Minister for Finance delegated a number of banking system functions to the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) under Statutory Instrument (S.I.) no. 115 of 2010. This delegation was revoked with effect from 5 August 2011 under S.I. no. 395 of 2011 and the NTMA banking unit has since then been seconded to the Department of Finance. At the direction of the Minister, the costs of the unit, comprising staff costs and certain consultancy costs, continue to be met by the NTMA.&rdquo;</p><p>  The C &amp;amp; AG also commented in the C &amp;amp; AGs 2009 report, prior to the novation of the contracts, as follows:</p><p>  &ldquo;Administrative costs incurred by State agencies in relation to banking stabilisation measures have been substantial in absolute terms, but are small relative to the scale of the costs, financial commitments and risks associated with the banking stabilisation measures. Access to timely and professional advice is a vital input to decision making in this context. At the same time, it is important to ensure that sound procurement and contracting practices are followed to ensure that the expenses being incurred are no more than is warranted in the circumstances.&rdquo;</p></reply>

This confirmation is necessary to ensure Revenue has adequate time to set up any alternative phased payment mandates that property owners might wish to avail of for 2014, which is the first full year of the tax.   Revenue also advised me that it did not write to property owners who paid their 2013 LPT by direct debit or by deduction at source from salary/occupational pensions or from certain Government payments, because such options automatically apply in 2014.  The case to which the Deputy refers falls into the latter category as the person opted to pay his 2013 liability by deduction at source and this will automatically continue in 2014.   </p><p>  The person declared in his 2013 LPT Return that his property was valued within Band 3 (&euro;150,001 to &euro;200.000).

He should also provide relevant supporting documentation in respect of his claim, which can either be a copy of a professional valuation as at 1 May 2013 or details of sales/advertised prices of equivalent properties in his area around that date.  Revenue will review the valuation of the person&rsquo;s property once it receives the relevant documentation. </p><p>Revenue informs me it has tried to contact the person in question by telephone to explain why he did not receive written correspondence in respect of LPT for 2014 but has not been able to speak to him.

In the case of defined benefit arrangements, the schedule provides a formula for determining the capital value of uncrystallised rights (that is rights being built up but which have not yet been drawn down) with a view to establishing if an individual can apply to Revenue for a Personal Fund Threshold (PFT). Where an individual&rsquo;s uncrystallised pension rights on the specified date (which for the purposes of the latest revision to the SFT regime, contained in Finance (No.2) Bill 2013, will be 1 January 2014) exceed the new lower SFT of &euro;2m, the individual may claim a PFT from Revenue in order to protect or &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; those rights against any risk of chargeable excess tax when the pension is eventually drawn down. Under the current Finance Bill changes, a PFT may in no case exceed &euro;2.3m, the level of the existing SFT. Schedule 23B also provides a formula for determining the capital value of defined benefit pension rights at the point of retirement.</p><p>  In establishing the capital value of uncrystallised defined benefit pension rights for PFT purposes, the formula in schedule 23B distinguishes between defined benefit arrangements that provide for a separately accrued lump sum and those that permit a lump sum to be taken by way of a discretionary commutation of part of the pension. In the former case, the capital value is determined by establishing the annual amount of pension that the individual would receive under the rules of the scheme on the specified date (i.e. 1 January 2014) on the assumption that he or she retired on that date at their salary and service on that date and on the assumption that they had attained normal retirement age on that date. The gross annual pension so determined is then multiplied by 20 (the standard valuation factor) and added to the cash value of the separately accrued lump sum, calculated on the same assumptions, to arrive at the overall capital value of the pension rights. In the case of defined benefit arrangements with a discretionary lump sum commutation option, the capital value is determined solely by multiplying the gross annual amount of pension, determined on the same assumptions as above, by the standard valuation factor of 20. </p><p>  In order for the SFT regime to operate as intended, it is necessary for the capital value of defined benefit pension rights at the point of retirement to be determined in the same manner as the corresponding PFT calculation. In the case of a defined benefit arrangement with an option to commute part of the pension for a lump sum, this means that the capital value at retirement is the annual amount of pension multiplied by the appropriate valuation factors without having regard to any commutation decision that the individual may make.</p><p>  This ensures that the administrator of a defined benefit scheme, when measuring the capital value of an individual&rsquo;s retirement benefits from a defined benefit arrangement against, for example, the individual&rsquo;s PFT, is comparing like with like, as both the capital value of the PFT and the retirement benefits will have been calculated in the same fashion. Only in this way can any chargeable excess arising be correctly determined. The same approach to the calculation of the capital value of defined benefit pension rights at the point of retirement applies where an individual does not have a PFT, as clearly it would be incongruous if the method of calculation in respect of similar defined benefit arrangements were to vary depending on whether an individual had a PFT or not.</p><p>  It had come to the attention of the Commissioners that pension advisors and administrators had been interpreting the legislation in a manner that allowed the capital value of defined benefit pension arrangements with discretionary lump sum commutation rights to be calculated, at the point of retirement, on the basis of the annual amount of pension, after commutation for a lump sum, multiplied by the relevant valuation factor, plus the cash value of the lump sum so commuted. In light of that, I am putting it beyond doubt, by way of an amendment in Finance (No.2) Bill to the relevant formula in Schedule 23B, that this approach is incorrect and that, in such cases, the capital value calculation must be based on the annual amount of pension that would have been payable if no commutation of the pension had taken place.  	</p></reply>

The Credit Union and Co-Operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012, sets out comprehensive governance requirements for credit unions which are designed to provide a framework to improve governance standards in credit unions, with a particular focus at board of directors and management level.    The 2012 Act inserts a new section 63A into the Credit Union Act, 1997 requiring that the board of directors of a credit union shall appoint an individual to the role of manager of the credit union.</p><p>  Credit unions are not required to employ a manager but must ensure that an the individual appointed to the role of manager is capable of performing the functions of the manager set out in section 63A(4) of the Credit Union Act, 1997.</p><p>  The guidance on the fitness and probity regime for credit unions, which currently applies to all credit unions with assets of greater than &euro;10m, provides guidance to assist credit unions in ensuring that individuals taking up key positions, including the position of manager, are among other things competent and capable to take up the role.</p><p>  The Central Bank has developed a Credit Union Handbook to assist credit unions with the implementation of the new regulatory framework. The Central Bank also undertook a series of information seminars for credit unions in advance of the implementation of the new framework. Fourteen seminars where held in 7 locations around the country in July. In addition the Central Bank has issued a FAQ document which provides answers to questions relating to the implementation of the new governance and prudential requirements for credit unions and which is available on its website at www.centralbank.ie. </p><p>  Individual credit unions with queries can contact the Central Bank on an on-going basis.</p></reply>

The purpose of the Home Tuition scheme is to provide a compensatory educational service for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school or for children with a special educational need who are awaiting an educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for pre-school children with autism.</p><p> Children with autism between the ages of 2.5 and 3 are eligible for home tuition.  The home tuition continues from their 3rd birthday if no placement in a school based autism early intervention class is available for them. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a national network of Special Educational Needs Advisors who can assit parents in identifying school placements for their children, if required. As home tuition takes place outside the usual school structure it is important that home tutors are qualified to provide an educational programme.  It is appropriate therefore that the qualification standard in the Home Tuition Scheme generally reflects that required in a school environment.</p><p>  The qualification requirements for tutors providing home tuition to children have not changed. It remains the case that home tutors should be fully qualified teachers. When it is not possible to recruit a fully qualified teacher then alternative appropriate third level qualifications may be acceptable. However, from this year my Department has also required that, in addition to being qualified teachers, tutors must be registered or have applied for registration with the Teaching Council of Ireland. Tutors with acceptable third level qualifications will be eligible to apply for registration. Qualifications in psychology at the required level are acceptable for this purpose. Accordingly, those whose qualifications were acceptable in the past remain eligible, provided they have applied for registration with the Teaching Council. </p></reply>

That Department continues to pay the salary linked to his substantive grade, which is civil service Director. The Teaching Council reimburses that Department in accordance with the approved level for the post of Director the Teaching Council which is aligned with the civil service Principal Officer (Higher) Scale.  No additional cost arises to the Council  or my Department from this arrangement.  The Director's and other staff salaries are funded from within the Teaching Council's own resources. </p></reply>

The number of SNAs employed in a school depends on the allocation given to the school by the NCSE, based on its assessment of the special educational needs of pupils in the school.  If the Deputy requires further information regarding the methodology around the allocation of SNA resources to schools then her query should more appropriately be directed to the NCSE.</p><p>The NCSE does not have a role in setting the contractual hours of work of SNAs.</p><p>  The position regarding the working hours of full-time SNAs is as outlined in the standard SNA contract of employment, which was agreed by this Department, the Trade Unions (IMPACT and SIPTU) representing SNAs and the Management Bodies in 2005. In that context, the standard SNA contract has been designed to be flexible to cater for the different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools including primary, post-primary and special schools. No set hours were agreed but instead full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school in order to help with reception and dispersal of children and preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc. These times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school. </p><p>  In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total. Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days. These 12 days now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and/or the normal school year. </p><p>SNAs who are employed in a part-time capacity are paid a pro-rata amount dependent upon their level of hours of employment. Part-time SNAs are paid on the agreed divisor rate for pay purposes for part-time SNAs which is 32 hours. </p><p>  Furthermore, the issue of appropriate working hours for all public servants was one of the key aspects of the set of proposals for a public service agreement which were put forward by the Labour Relations Commission and which now form the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2016 (the Haddington Road Agreement). The specific text of the Haddington Road Agreement relating to working hours for SNAs is as follows:</p><p>&quot;SPECIAL NEEDS ASSISTANTSHoursUnder the terms of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, discussions took place that led to agreement on changed attendance arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) that give schools the option of an additional two hours working time per week from each Special Needs Assistant. Under the terms of this Agreement on increased working hours in the Public Service, the available requirements in schools for additional hours for SNAs is quite limited. Given issues such as the duration of the school day and operation hours, and the specific availability of individual SNAs the details of the utilisation of any additional requirements should be the subject of further discussions. These new attendance arrangements, allied to the provisions outlined in the above paragraph should be the subject of a review by the LRC in advance of the 2013/2014 school year, involving the Department of Education and Skills and IMPACT/SIPTU, in order to assess if the additional hours are being utilised in the most effective and appropriate manner and in order to achieve agreement on any changes deemed necessary in terms of the arrangement agreed for teachers. This will constitute the liability on Special Needs Assistants in respect of working hours for the purposes of this extension to the Public Service Agreement.&quot;</p></reply>

In such cases, the employer would be required to make any such redundancy payment required under the relevant legislation.</p></reply>

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Act and the making of valuations for local authority rating is his sole prerogative. There are two provisions in the legislation governing the assessment of valuations, i.e. revision and revaluation.</p><p>  Revision of valuation is the mechanism used to maintain existing local authority valuation lists. It is used to add new properties to the list, to amend the valuations of altered properties and to remove demolished or defunct properties from the list. The valuations of commercial properties at revision are determined by reference to the net annual values of comparable properties on the same valuation list. That is to say that they are compared with similar type properties in the same local authority area to ensure, in so far as it is possible, that they are all treated equally.</p><p>  In accordance with the 2001 Act, which came into force on 2nd May, 2002, a national programme is being rolled out progressively for the revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties in the State. The revaluation programme aims to provide up-to-date valuations for individual properties across all economic sectors that are subject to local authority rates. It is an important programme, especially given the significant changes in rental values following the economic downturn of recent years. The revaluation process is the mechanism whereby economic changes that take place in the property market are reflected in the valuation lists for rates purposes and in individual ratepayers&rsquo; rates liabilities. </p><p>  The purpose of a revaluation is to redistribute commercial rates liabilities among ratepayers based on up-to-date values. Following revaluation, there will be a much closer relationship between rental value and commercial rates liability. Even though property values have fallen generally, some ratepayers will gain while others will lose from the process of redistribution but, overall, there will be a fairer distribution of the rates burden.<font color="#000080"> </font>  In general, however, the relative gains to ratepayers have exceeded the losses in the revaluations carried out to date. </p><p>  The revaluation programme which has been completed in three County Council areas in Dublin began in November 2005 in the South Dublin County Council area and has since been rolled out to the areas covered by Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Councils.  The revaluation of South Dublin was completed in December 2007, Fingal was completed in 2009 and D&uacute;n Laoghaire- Rathdown was completed in 2010.  </p><p>  After publication of the valuations, the Act provides for an appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation and following the Commissioner&rsquo;s decision on this appeal, the ratepayer has the further option of making an appeal to the independent Valuation Tribunal. There is also a further appeal on a point of law to the High and Supreme Courts.</p><p>  As requested, the number of revaluations completed and the number of appeals to the Commissioner of Valuation arising from those revaluations is indicated in the following table. All appeals to the Commissioner arising from the revaluation have to be lodged within 40 days of publication of the new valuation list.  <table><tr><th>Local Authority<br /><br />Area</th><th>Number of Revaluations</th><th>Number of Appeals to <br /><br />Commissioner of Valuation</th></tr><tr><td>South Dublin County</td><td>6,304</td><td>725</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal County</td><td>5,676</td><td>819</td></tr><tr><td>DunLaoghaire- Rathdown County</td><td>                      5,165</td><td>1,148<br /><br /></td></tr></table></p><p>  The revaluation programme for the Dublin City Council area is currently underway and is expected to be completed by 31st December, 2013. Additionally, the revaluation of properties in all the local authority areas of Waterford and Limerick will be completed in 2013 and 2014 respectively.</p><p>  The Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2012 which had its second stage reading in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 11th October, 2012 and is currently awaiting Committee stage, provides for a number of initiatives</p><p>   to accelerate the overall revaluation programme, such as the piloting of a self-assessment scheme of valuation in one local authority area, which if it proves successful could be extended to other areas. There is also provision in the Bill to allow for the piloting of the assessment of valuations by contract valuers under an external delivery scheme. The Bill also contains provisions to streamline the overall process of revaluation and the appeal mechanisms available to ratepayers subsequent to the revaluation.</p></reply>

Along with taking equity stakes in companies, the State has invested heavily in stimulating the Venture Capital sector.  Three programmes have been run since 1994 and a fourth programme of &euro;175m was announced by the Government as part of Budget 2013 for the period 2013 &ndash; 2018. </p><p>  The Seed and Venture Capital Scheme&rsquo;s document, as with all Scheme documents under the Industrial Development Acts, are approved by both the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. This document gives Enterprise Ireland the legal authority to administer the Scheme. Enterprise Ireland in consultation with my Department determine the relevant thresholds and criteria for each call for expressions of interest under the Scheme as they are issued.  </p><p>  Enterprise Ireland staff manage the due diligence, investment process and back office functions that are required to manage the commitments the Government makes to Funds through the Seed and Venture Capital Schemes.  When making commitments to venture capital funds, the State invests on a &lsquo;pari passu&rsquo; basis with the private sector, equally sharing the risks and rewards.</p><p>  However, all of the various initiatives are independently managed by the private sector that make all decisions regarding investments in line with their strategy and the market opportunities they identify. </p><p>  The Seed and Venture Capital Scheme, the Development Capital Scheme, and Innovation Fund Ireland all form part of the suite of finance measures put in place through the Action Plan for Jobs to increase the availability of funding for SMEs and all operate under Schemes. </p></reply>

Along with supporting the more traditional models of financing, this would support the need for a broad and diversified range of financing mechanisms.  This is in recognition of the need for a mix of instruments to address the various types of company operating in Ireland and also the various growth phases of a company.</p><p>  The individual financing instruments should not be seen in isolation, but as a potential set of interacting policies.  Therefore, it is my view that this is not an &lsquo;either/or&rsquo; scenario.  </p><p>  However, in terms of costs for supporting the alternative financing mechanisms, it must be borne in mind that value for money and a strong justification for State intervention is a key consideration.  As many of the alternative forms of financing are relatively new and are only currently establishing a presence in Ireland, I am inclined to consider the various available options prior to intervening with taxpayers&rsquo; money in an effort to boost take up. Private sector initiatives have their place, and do not always necessarily require Government funding to be kick-started.  </p><p>  If Government funding is directed towards these types of funding models in the future, careful design of any intervention along with monitoring and evaluation will be required to ensure the optimal intended results are achieved.</p></reply>

It has also introduced a number of changes and improvements to the operation of the CRUs, including the introduction of dedicated e-mail addresses and the introduction of a new streamlined rent application form in September 2012 which has resulted in an increase in completed applications at initial stage thereby improving the processing times. </p><p>  The Department continues to keep the operational and organisational process of the CRUs under constant review with a view to managing operational efficiency and maximising service for the customer.</p></reply>

To qualify a person needs to:</p><p>  - enter insurable employment by age 55 for State Pension (transition) and age 56 for State Pension (contributory);</p><p>  - have paid 520 full rate social insurance contributions;</p><p>  - have a yearly average contributions of at least 10 for State pension (contributory), and at least 24 for State pension (transition).   </p><p>  The yearly average determines the weekly rate of payment. </p><p>An increase in the State pension  can be paid. This element of the State pension is means tested.  <font color="#2F2F2F">Any income the qualified adult has from employment, self-employment, savings, investments and capital (for example, any property except the person&rsquo;s home) is taken into account.  Where there is joint savings or investments with the spouse or partner, half of that amount is taken into account.  </font>   An increase for a qualified adult may be payable if the qualified adult has weekly income of less than &euro;310.00.  </p><p>  The assessment of means is a way of checking if a person has enough means to support themselves and what amount of payment, if any, they may qualify for.  The rules for assessing entitlement to an increase in the State pension for a spouse or partner (qualified adult) are provided for in social welfare legislation.  I&rsquo;m afraid that it is not therefore possible to exclude certain savings or investments on the basis that they have been set aside for a specific purpose, such as that outlined by the Deputy.</p><p>  Where a person does not meet the qualifying conditions for State pension contributory, they may apply for the means-tested State pension non-contributory.  The means test for State pension non-contributory takes into account the income and assets of both the claimant and his or her spouse or partner.   Capital, property (excluding a person's home), savings and investments are assessed as capital and a formula is then used to assess the weekly means from capital.   The weekly rate payable depends on the total weekly means of the person or couple.</p><p>  The formula for assessing means from capital is as follows:<table><tr><th>Capital </th><th>Weekly means assessed</th></tr><tr><td>First &euro;20,000 </td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>Next &euro;10,000 </td><td>&euro;1 per &euro;1,000 </td></tr><tr><td>Next &euro;10,000 </td><td>&euro;2 per &euro;1,000</td></tr><tr><td>Balance</td><td>&euro;4 per &euro;1,000</td></tr></table></p><p>  It is the policy of the Department to carry out regular reviews of benefits paid and where additional information is made available reviews of cases are carried out which may affect the benefit in payment. </p><p>In relation to caring and support from my Department, it is open to those who wish to avail of the carer&rsquo;s schemes to apply for and be assessed for same.  It is worth noting that the means test used in relation to the carers scheme is a more generous means test to that used for the qualified adult payment.  A person who is currently in receipt of a social welfare payment may also qualify for a half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance payment<font color="#FF0000">.</font>    I would encourage that those who need to avail of this scheme to apply for it.</p></reply>

When a death occurs, it is registered on foot of a certificate of cause of death supplied by a registered medical practitioner.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-12-04a.204.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013120400070#WRC04600"><p>The overall concern of the Government in this and previous budgets has been to protect the primary weekly social welfare rates. Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in relation to protecting people from poverty. To allow us to protect these core payments, we have had to look very carefully at other additional payments. The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen each year with the number of eligible customers also increasing significantly. In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance compared to almost 396,000 at the end of September this year, an increase of 25%. Each year almost 10,000 extra customers become eligible for the allowance because of the increased number of pension recipients. </p><p>  I am keenly aware of the impact on the Department&rsquo;s customers and particularly those who are living alone. While we are ending the telephone allowance the savings that this will provide means that we have been able to keep at the same rates the other elements of the household benefits package, including the free electricity/gas allowance and the free television licence. We have also retained the fuel allowance, free travel and the living alone increase. </p><p>  Of course it is important to be aware that Ireland&rsquo;s pensioners as a group have the lowest consistent poverty rate and, as a group compared to the rest of the population, are least likely to be at risk of poverty - pointing to the adequacy and importance of the State pension. Between 2004 and 2011, consistent poverty for older people (those over 65) fell from 3.3% to 1.9%. The &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; rate for people in that age group also reduced from 27.1% to 9.7% over the same period. </p><p>  The monthly allowances under the household benefits package are a contribution towards the cost of services; they are not intended to meet those costs in full. The ending of the telephone allowance of &euro;9.50 per month (or about &euro;2.20 per week) will not result in the automatic removal of any landline service linked to a personal alarm. Indeed, since the Budget announcement, I am aware that one telephone company has advertised that they will cover the value of the allowance. I would hope that other telephone companies will consider this. </p><p>  The telephone allowance was introduced at a time when telephones were expensive and uncommon and a landline service was the only option available to the customer. The market has changed enormously since the introduction of the allowance, with several companies providing a range of services and rates with bundled services including television, telephone and broadband and pay-as-you-go mobiles. There are also personal security services that use mobile technology rather than land lines.  My Department has no role in the funding or operation of the seniors alert scheme which provides grant support for the supply of equipment such as personal alarms, smoke detectors and security lighting to enable older people without sufficient means to continue to live securely in their homes.  The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government operates the scheme.  The budget allocation for 2013 was &euro;2.35 million. There has been no reduction in this funding in Budget 2014. </p></reply>

This compares to employees in respect of whom a combined 14.75% rate, under full-rate PRSI Class A, is paid giving entitlement to the full range of social insurance benefits including jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.</p><p>  Any person of working age who does not qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit may claim means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  Subject to means and other qualifying conditions, self-employed persons may claim jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or there is reduced demand for their services.  Typically over 80% of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance claims from self-employed persons have been awarded over recent years. </p><p>  Previously self-employed persons in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance have access to the full range of activation measures available through the State.  Given the scale of unemployment levels, the key objective of activation policy and labour market initiatives is to offer assistance to those most in need of support in securing work and achieving financial self-sufficiency.  This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.  Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people. </p><p>  However, many services are available to the formerly self-employed who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment. Some employment services, such as assistance with job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices, regardless of their social welfare status. </p><p>  Unemployed persons, including the previously self-employed, not in receipt of payments may also be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities, but are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course.  Springboard courses are open to people who were previously self-employed, regardless of their social welfare status.</p></reply>

My Department is in the process of reforming the one-parent family payment (OFP) scheme.  These reforms are predicated on activation and on getting people back into the workforce once their children have reached an appropriate age.A wide range of supports and services are presently available to lone parents who are clients of the Department and who pro-actively engage with the Department&rsquo;s activation process.  As part of the supports that are available to lone parents, my Department has provided funding to One Family for its &lsquo;New Futures&rsquo; programme for the 2011-2012 period.  In 2012, One Family obtained further funding from my Department for its &lsquo;New Futures &ndash; Securing A Career&rsquo; programme for the 2012-2013 period.     The recently introduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) transitional arrangement caters for OFP recipients who lose their entitlement to the OFP payment from July, 2013, onwards, who have a youngest child aged under 14 years, and who are entitled to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) payment.  These customers are exempt from the JA conditionality that requires them to be available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work.  They are also exempt from having to prove unemployment and can work part-time without restrictions and still receive the JA transitional arrangement payment &ndash; subject to a means test.  The exemptions from the full JA conditionality will remain in place until a recipient&rsquo;s youngest child reaches the age of         14 years.  At this point, should they continue to claim the JA payment, they will be subjected to the full JA conditionality.</p><p>  Recipients of either the JA payment or the JA transitional arrangement payment may qualify for other social welfare income support benefits at the same time as their primary payment.  They can also avail of a wide range of education, training, and employment supports, and are entitled to apply, subject to qualifying conditions, for subsidised child care through both the community childcare subvention (CCS) programme and the child care education and training support (CETS) scheme that are administered by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (D/CYA).  In addition, they can apply for the after-school child care scheme in the event that they take up employment, increase their days of employment, or commence certain employment programmes.  This scheme, which was announced in Budget 2013, and which is also funded by the D/CYA but jointly administered by my Department and the D/CYA, will continue to provide subsidised after-school child care places into 2014.</p><p>  I have also secured the agreement of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs on a new strand of child care support for customers of the Department, including lone parents, who are participating in the community employment (CE) scheme.  This new child care support will be provided via the CETS scheme.</p><p>  Lone parents can also qualify for the family income supplement (FIS).  FIS is an income support payment for families on low income that incentivises them to retain or increase their hours of employment.</p></reply>

This capability is referenced in both the Government's Strategy for Renewable Energy 2012 - 2020 and the National Renewable Energy Action Plan. The Strategy for Renewable Energy also outlines the opportunity, under Directive 2009/28/EC, for projects of scale both onshore and offshore that are aimed at export markets. The work programme under the Memorandum of Understanding, signed last January with the UK, will result in completion of consideration of how Irish renewable energy resources, onshore and offshore, might be developed to the mutual benefit of both countries in the 2020 timeframe.   In order to support this opportunity, the Renewable Energy Export Policy and Development Framework will ensure that any export of renewable energy must take account of Ireland's energy needs and long term strategic energy requirements. The framework will have regard to national strategies or policies and will provide the opportunity to integrate relevant EU Directive requirements (including Strategic Environmental Assessment and Appropriate Assessment).

Ireland is currently heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels to meet our energy needs. While it is acknowledged that fossil fuels will remain part of the energy mix for some time to come, progress is being made towards increasing the share of renewable energy in our energy requirements. The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources.</p><p>  The Renewable Energy Directive also requires that Member States set out in a National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) their trajectories towards meeting these targets. Ireland&rsquo;s NREAP, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, assumes Ireland&rsquo;s 16% target will be met incrementally at around 1% per annum. Provisional figures for 2012 indicate that 7.1% of our overall energy requirements and 19.6% of electricity demand were met from renewable sources.</p><p>  The primary support mechanisms for renewable electricity in Ireland are the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff (REFIT) schemes. These schemes are designed to incentivise the development of electricity generation capacity from a range of renewable sources including wind, biomass and hydropower.</p><p>  To date wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. In 2012, 15.3% of Ireland's electricity demand was met by wind generation. At the end of quarter three this year, the total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid was approx. 2,100 MW. It is estimated that a total of between 3,500 and 4,000 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target. Currently, approximately 3,000 MW of renewable generation has taken up connection offers under the Gate 3 grid connection programme. </p><p>  The development of the clean, indigenous, renewable energy resources, which Ireland is fortunate to have in abundance, holds the prospect of reducing our reliance on expensive fossil fuel imports, thereby improving our energy security, and opening up opportunities for the engineering, ICT and communication sectors with consequent potential for job creation. This potential is already recognised by the IDA and Enterprise Ireland in their clean technologies strategies.</p></reply>

The Irish system is connected to the electricity system of Great Britain system via two Direct Current (DC) interconnectors, the Moyle Interconnector and the East-West Electricity Interconnector (EWIC).The Moyle subsea interconnector links the electricity grids of Northern Ireland and Scotland. It went into commercial operation in 2002 and has a capacity of 500 Mega Watts (MW). The EWIC links the electricity grids of Ireland and Great Britain. It has a capacity of 500 MW, and therefore doubled Ireland and Northern Ireland&rsquo;s electricity interconnection with Great Britain when it went live in 2012. The two interconnectors allow market participants to trade electricity between the SEM on the island of Ireland and the British Electricity Trading and Transmission Arrangements (BETTA) market in Great Britain. EWIC&rsquo;s increasing of this island&rsquo;s interconnector capacity greatly enhances our ability to trade electricity with our neighbours and accelerates the integration of Ireland with other electricity systems.   Interconnector flows for EWIC and Moyle are based on the combination of offers submitted by interconnector users and the merit order for the SEM&rsquo;s economic dispatch. The "Available Transfer Capacity" of the Interconnector is considered and flows are determined by the market scheduling software based on economic dispatch under unconstrained unit commitment.</p><p>The SEM redesign project, currently underway, will enable market participants in the SEM and interconnected markets to trade electricity more efficiently across the interconnectors, in accordance with EU Third Energy Package legislation.

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms. Details of broadband services available in each County can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at   . </p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>  - a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and</p><p>  - a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, there is evidence that industry is investing beyond the targets to which they committed in the Plan. eircom has extended its plans for the rollout of high speed services, with speeds of up to 100Mbps to 1.4m premises, UPC has increased its minimum and top speed products to 120Mbps and 200Mbps respectively, and mobile operators are rolling out enhanced product offerings, including 4G mobile. Other operators continue to invest and ESB is currently considering the prospect of utilising its distribution network to rollout fibre broadband services. </p><p>  These developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. </p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector over the coming years, the results of which will inform the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

I have been supportive of its attempts to diversify its income streams and to win a wider range of commercial contracts offering higher margins.    Having invested in the computerisation of all post offices, An Post is well positioned to become the front office provider of choice for Government and financial services sector. Progress towards diversification within the financial services sector is already underway with the enhanced arrangement with AIB and the agreement with Aviva for the transfer of their branch offices personal insurance business to One Direct. In the context of the public sector transformation agenda I have stressed to my Government colleagues that the network is ideally configured for over the counter transactions. Any such developments would, of course, need to be subject to public procurement requirements as appropriate. </p><p>Overall, I see a strong future for the network by using its existing strengths to remain a significant player as a front office for Government services.   </p></reply>

However, Ireland now has the highest number of petroleum exploration authorisations in place since exploration began in our offshore more than four decades ago. With new company entrants this year including large independent oil companies such as Cairn Energy, Kosmos Energy and Woodside Energy, together with existing companies such as Eni, ExxonMobil, Petronas, RPS, and Shell, it is evident that that there is significant and growing capacity in the sector. This demonstrates that exploration in the Irish offshore is moving in the right direction.</p><p>In a similar manner, while the number of active minerals prospecting licences indicate the buoyant state of mineral exploration in Ireland, no new commercially viable deposits of minerals have been discovered in the last three years although there have been some encouraging results, particularly in Counties Limerick and Clare.

While I have no statutory function in the setting of energy prices, whether in the regulated or non-regulated market, I am acutely conscious of the impact of energy prices on citizens and businesses across Ireland. Similarly, I have no function in the setting of oil prices. The price paid at the pump by consumers is largely determined by taxation levels, the internationally traded price of crude oil and the consequent price that refined product is traded at in Europe, along with the level of competition in the retail market.    The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated and there is free entry to the market. Upward trends in global oil prices underscore the Government&rsquo;s commitment to delivering national energy efficiency and renewable energy objectives, which are aimed at moving the economy away from reliance on imported, carbon intensive fossil fuels such as oil. </p><p>Figures produced by the EU Market Observatory for Energy in its Oil Bulletin, in respect of prices in force on 25 November 2013, indicate that Ireland&rsquo;s petrol and diesel prices are very close to those in the other Euro area Member States, especially when differences in taxes and duties are taken into account. Further information can be found at : </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and gas markets, both wholesale and retail, are characterised by vigorous competition, regulated by the CER. Competition puts downward pressure on prices. Prices in the retail electricity market are now fully deregulated. Since 1 October 2011, the residential gas consumer segment is the only segment of the electricity and gas markets where prices are regulated. Prices in the electricity market and the unregulated part of the gas market are wholly commercial and operational matters for suppliers. </p><p>The latest analysis of Eurostat data published by SEAI relates to the last six months of 2012. The link to this analysis is at:  . It shows that half of Irish residential electricity consumers paid 7% more than the EU average for their electricity and a further 31% of consumers paid about 16% above the EU average. About 9% of households actually paid 5% below the EU average. Compared to other countries our ranking in these bands ranged from fourth to ninth most expensive. While Irish business paid up to 18% above the European average for electricity, the position for many medium firms, constituting over a quarter of the market, is they paid 8% above the EU average. Compared to other EU countries our ranking ranged from fourth to seventh  most expensive across the small, medium and large bands.</p><p>  As regards Irish residential gas<b></b>consumers, SEAI analysis shows that prices paid by the vast bulk of these consumers (94%) during the period were 6% below the EU average. Ireland&rsquo;s ranking in this band was 11th highest at end December 2012. Prices in the two other residential bands ranked from eleventh to sixteenth most expensive. Gas prices paid by Irish business ranged between 6% below and 5% above the EU average during the period. Compared to other countries our ranking in the five bands ranged from 10th to 17th most expensive.  </p></reply>

The Oil Bulletin is designed to improve the transparency of oil prices and to strengthen the internal market. The relevant link is:  .In addition to the weekly oil bulletins, the Commission also, on a less frequent basis, produces three maps of Europe with the euro prices for petrol, diesel and the varying national tax take for these two products in each of the 27 EU Member States.    The oil bulletin of 25 November 2013, shows the price of petrol in Ireland was at &euro;1.56 litre including taxes and duties (66c litre excluding taxes), while the price of diesel was &euro;1.49 litre including taxes and duties (71c litre excluding taxes). The weighted EU average for the 17 Member States in the Euro area for the same week was &euro;1.57 litre for petrol including taxes and duties (66c litre excluding taxes) and &euro;1.41 litre for diesel including taxes and duties (71c litre excluding taxes). As can be seen from the reports on the European Commission website, prices in EU Member States and the weighted averages fluctuate on a weekly basis.

The Act provided real security of tenure for tenants in the private rented sector for the first time and, <i>inter alia</i> , provided access for both tenants and landlords to an inexpensive, informal and independent dispute resolution process operated by the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB).</p><p>  Nine years on from the passing of the Act , however, it is clear that there are aspects of the legislation that require amendment in order to improve the functioning of the private rental sector, including in relation to the withholding of rent during the dispute resolution process. Currently, under Section 86 of the Act, rent continues to be payable pending the determination of a dispute but a termination of the tenancy may not be effected during this period.   </p><p>The <i>Residential Tenancies (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill 2012</i> builds on what has already been achieved by the Act and by the PRTB and is a key element in the delivery of the Government&rsquo;s housing policy. Amendments were introduced at committee stage of the Bill in the D&aacute;il , to provide for the introduction of a new procedure which will enable the PRTB to deal effectively with tenants who do not pay rent during the dispute resolution process. The amendments insert a new section into the Act which provide for a landlord, in such instances, to bring a complaint before the PRTB. On hearing this complaint, the PRTB can order the tenant to pay any rent due. The matter is then adjourned for a period of no more than 14 days to allow the tenant comply with the Order. Where the tenant does not comply the PRTB will have the power to terminate the tenancy irrespective of whether a notice of termination has been served.</p><p>  Essentially, the non-payment of rent issue is fast-tracked and any other aspects of the dispute will be dealt with in the normal way. The proposed new provisions will allow the PRTB to deal effectively and quickly with the small number of tenants who do not comply with their statutory obligation to pay rent during the dispute process. The Bill is currently before the Seanad.</p></reply>

This involved the purchaser entering into a shared ownership lease with the local authority on a property at a significant discount from market value. In these cases, as with all affordable housing sales, a clawback was introduced to prevent short-term profit taking on the resale of the house to the detriment of the objectives of the schemes. </p><p>  While it is not appropriate for me to comment on individual cases, I fully recognise that affordable home owners are in many cases impacted by the downturn in the same way as other home owners, for example in consequence of unemployment and possible negative equity. In such cases borrowers should actively engage with their lenders, whether a commercial financial institution or a local authority, to seek to avail of one of the options available to provide sustainable solutions to distressed mortgages. In this regard the mortgage arrears resolution process already in place in respect of commercial mortgages is now being implemented across all local authorities. In cases of acute mortgage distress homeowners also have the option of seeking to avail of the legal process now also in place to deal with personal insolvency .   </p><p>  A review of the operation of the shared ownership scheme is currently under way and further guidance and clarification will issue from my Department to local authorities shortly as a con sequence of this review process.</p></reply>

The 2014 capital provision includes &euro;40 million for local authority housing, &euro;40.9 million for voluntary and co-operative housing, &euro;3 million for Social Inclusion, &euro;109.4 million for Regeneration, Remedial Works, Retrofitting and Energy Efficiency and &euro;28.6 million for Private Housing Grants.</p><p>  In addition to the provision outlined above there were a number of announcements made on Budget Day which enhanced the 2014 allocation. It was announced that an additional &euro;30 million will be invested in local authority housing.  Approximately half of this investment will enable the construction of new infill developments in areas with high demand for social housing with the remainder invested in bringing long-term vacant units back into productive use. I intend to announce details shortly of the se   two measures with a view to having the investment programme up and running as early as possible in 2014. Budget 2014 also introduced a new &euro;10 million fund aimed at resolving unfinished estates where no development bond exists for carrying out essential public works. An additional &euro;10 million was also provided to augment the provision for Private Housing Grants.</p><p>  The majority of the provision for current expenditure will also be initialised for social housing provision through long term leasing and the Rental Accommodation Scheme. Delivery of social housing is significantly facilitated through these more flexible funding models, but the Government continues to be committed to other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. In addition, my Department and the Housing Agency are also engaged with NAMA to ensure continued delivery of housing units for social purposes. It is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units of social housing will be provided in 2014.

However, during the course of 2013 the Pathway Accommodation &amp;amp; Support System (PASS), which commenced operation in Dublin in 2011, is being extended nationally. When PASS is fully implemented it will provide good quality, timely data which will allow housing authorities to report in relation to the on-going extent and the dynamics of homelessness as it is addressed.</p><p>  In advance of the full implementation of PASS the most complete set of data available in relation to homelessness nationally is the Central Statistics Office&rsquo;s special Census report, <i>Homeless Persons in Ireland</i>, which was published on 6 September 2012. This report indicated that a total of 64 individuals were sleeping rough on Census night, 10 April 2011, while identifying a further 3,744 people as housed in accommodation defined as emergency, transitional or long-term. Of the total of 3,808 individuals included in the report almost 60% were in long-term or transitional housing arrangements. This report is available on CSO's website,    . </p></reply>

Upheaval and conflict in Syria in particular has seen the spectacle of many individuals travelling from Europe to the fighting and tragically a number of our citizens have lost their lives there.</p><p>  This is an issue of concern to the majority of European States and one to which I gave priority during the Irish Presidency of the Council of the  European Union. In that connection Ireland was successful in gaining the agreement of the Member States to carry out a review of the EU Strategy for Countering Radicalisation and Recruitment to Terrorism. Work is currently ongoing on this matter at various levels within the EU. One of the aspects to be addressed in the review is that of how best to manage the &quot;foreign fighter&quot; phenomenon. In addition, Ireland is also a member of a small group of like minded States, that was set up during the Irish Presidency to develop a response to this issue and I have met with my EU Ministerial colleagues in this regard. </p><p>  The development of appropriate responses to the foreign fighter phenomenon is at a very early stage across the EU. However, it is widely accepted that a key element in addressing this problem is a programme of pro-active engagement with the communities most affected with a view to persuading those inclined to travel that there may be more beneficial and positive ways of contributing to a resolution of the conflict than simply taking up arms.   In that regard, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operates one of the most forward thinking programmes of community relations and racial integration in Europe through its Garda Racial, Intercultural and Diversity Office. The Office is in contact with many of our minority communities through its network of Ethnic Liaison Officers and is there to discuss all matters of concern to these communities,  including those related to the conflicts in the Middle East. Furthermore,  An Garda Sioch&aacute;na is a member of the EU's Radicalisation Awareness Network which was set up by the EU Commission to develop responses and best practices in the field of radicalisation including a foreign fighters dimension and this work is continuing.</p></reply>

At this stage, arising from the additional &euro;5m being made available between October and December, the Garda authorities have arranged for the delivery of 305 new vehicles by the end of 2013.  These are in addition to the 133 new Garda vehicles already made available during the year. </p><p>  I understand that the specific details in relation to the deployment of these new Garda vehicles have yet to be finalised but the Deputy can be assured that they will be allocated as effectively as possible in line with operational circumstances, including the requirements of the stations referred to by the Deputy. This most recent investment will bring to &euro;18m the total amount spent on the Garda fleet for the three years 2012 to 2014.  This represents a very considerable financial investment in Garda transport, particularly at a time when the level of funding available across the public sector is severely limited.  It is a clear indication of my commitment to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are provided with sufficient resources to enable them to deliver an effective and efficient policing service.  <b><font color="#000080">    </font></b></p></reply>

The ICC has confirmed that it has systems in place to underpin the welfare of animals participating in coursing events. These include mandatory inspections of hares and coursing venues in advance of the commencement of an event. Greyhounds involved in coursing are subject to the provisions of the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 and the Code of Practice for the care and welfare of greyhounds, published by Bord na gCon.</p><p>The ICC has assured the Department that it goes to great lengths to ensure the highest standards are adhered to during coursing. ICC rules and regulations require the postponement of coursing meetings if the weather is unfavourable for example where snowfall or frost could impact negatively on the greyhound or the hare. The ICC has confirmed that a coursing meeting scheduled to take place on 23 November 2013 was postponed due to heavy frost. During extreme weather conditions, it is also the practice of ICC clubs to provide additional food for the hares living in the wild, within hare preserves protected by the ICC.  </p><p>  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, under the Wildlife Acts 1976 to 2012, has responsibility for the issue of an annual licence to the ICC and its affiliated clubs to capture live hares. These licences currently have a total of 26 conditions attached to them.  The conditions of these licences cover a range of items, including veterinary supervision at coursing meetings and a number of requirements attaching to the welfare of hares.</p><p>  The ICC ensures that a veterinary surgeon and a control steward are present at all coursing meetings.  In addition to this, veterinary staff from my Department and rangers from the National Parks and Wildlife Service (part of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht) carry out random monitoring inspections during the coursing season to verify compliance with the licences and the rules governing animal welfare.  </p><p>  As a further control, a Monitoring Committee on Coursing was established during the 1993/94 coursing season and is comprised of officials from my Department and representatives from both the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the ICC to monitor developments in coursing and in that regard the situation is kept under constant review to ensure that coursing is run in a well controlled and responsible manner in the interests of hares and greyhounds alike.</p><p>  A very high proportion (98.09%) of the hares captured for hare coursing were returned to the wild at the end of the 2012/2013 season. </p><p>  The systems that are in place are, in my view, effective, proportionate and are working well. The ICC has demonstrated its willingness in recent weeks to postpone an event due poor weather. Accordingly I see no need for any unilateral intervention on my part to suspend or prohibit hare coursing during adverse weather conditions. </p></reply>

In order to remain eligible, they, or their successors, must continue to farm. Other farmers, including new entrants to farming since the reference period, are also eligible for the Single Payment Scheme where they have received entitlements from the National Reserve or by way of a transfer.</p><p>  In order to qualify for payment under the Single Farm Payment Scheme, an individual is required to submit a Single Payment Scheme application form each year, declaring one eligible hectare of land for each eligible SPS entitlement held.  Applications were received from the person named under the Single Payment Scheme for years 2005 through to 2009, on which land parcel L12923018 was declared.  Following validation of these applications, it transpired that this parcel was also claimed by another applicant and, following standard procedure, where both parties were requested to confirm their entitlement to claim the said parcel, it was confirmed that the person named did not have the right to claim this parcel and his applications were amended accordingly.</p><p>The person named subsequently availed of his right to pursue the matter through the Office of the Ombudsman. This course ultimately proved unsuccessful.  </p></reply>

The development of a new Rural Development Programme under Pillar 2 will be a key support in enhancing the competitiveness of the agri-food sector, achieving more sustainable management of natural resources and ensuring a more balanced development of rural areas.</p><p>  A general EU co-financing rate of 53% is set out in the draft Rural Development Regulation but this rate may rise to a maximum of 80% for measures such as farm and business development, co-operation activities, and LEADER projects. Environmental type measures may be co-funded up to 75%. The total Exchequer funding that will be required to draw down the available EAFRD funding will depend on the types of measures included in the new Rural Development Programme and on the co-financing rates applied to these measures.</p><p>  There are a number of conditions attached to Ireland&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;313 million per annum.  The draft Regulation provides that at least 5% of EAFRD funding must be reserved for LEADER while the draft Common Provisions Regulation provides that 6% of EAFRD funding must be set aside to a national performance reserve. The funding set aside to the performance reserve will be allocated to each Member State following a performance review in 2019. The draft Rural Development Regulation also sets out that 30% of the total EAFRD amount must be reserved for environmental operations and climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. </p><p>  Work is currently ongoing in my Department to design the new Rural Development Programme (RDP) for the period from 2014 &ndash; 2020. In designing the new RDP, my Department must take account of the range of requirements set out in the draft Rural Development Regulation and the need to support key policy aims for the agri-food sector in the light of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy. In undertaking this work, a number of ex-ante analyses are being undertaken and a public consultation process has also taken place.</p><p>  While final decisions in relation to what measures are to be included in the new RDP have not yet been made, my Department is in ongoing contact with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the overall financing that will be required. I expect to make decisions in relation to the measures to be supported under the new RDP by the end of this year, and to submit a draft programme to the Commission in early 2014.</p></reply>

My Department is currently carrying out a comprehensive exercise by excluding ineligible features, such as houses, roads, scrub, rivers, etc. in land parcels declared by farmers. In the vast majority of cases, the exclusion has no impact on payments as the farmers in question have taken a prudent approach and reduced the declared area to take account of the ineligible feature. </p><p>  However, there are some cases where the level of over-declaration determined as part of this review process is greater than 20%. Under the provisions of the governing EU Regulations, an over-declaration of over 20% means that no payment can be made to the farmer in the year of application. Given the significance of such a finding for the farmer concerned, it is seen as prudent that a Department official visit each farm where the review has found an over-declaration of greater than 20%, in order to verify the position on the ground. </p><p>  All such applicants will be written to by my Department informing them of the outcome of the determination in their case. They will also be informed of the following options open to them.</p><p>  - Details of the dedicated telephone help-line to deal with calls from such applicants.</p><p>  - Confirmation of their right to seek a review of the decision in their case.</p><p>  - Informing them of the proposed visit by an official of my Department in order to establish whether the level of ineligible area determined is accurate.</p><p>  In other cases where farmers declare the ineligible area, which results in an over-claim, they are written to and provided with map(s) of the excluded ineligible areas. They are also informed of their right to seek a review of the Department&rsquo;s finding and to submit any information and documentation that they consider is relevant. It is a matter for each individual farmer to decide whether he or she will seek a review of the decision made in their case. Some farmers may take the view that the determination made is correct and not seek a review. In some cases where the farmer has sought a review of the determination, it may be necessary to visit the farm in order to verify the accuracy of the information submitted by the farmer as part of the review process. </p><p>  All applicants, whose eligible areas have been reduced as part of this process, have the right to seek an internal Department review of the determination in their case. If they are not satisfied with the outcome of this review they can appeal their case to the LPIS Appeals Committee, which is chaired by an independent Chairman.  </p></reply>

Revenue has advised me that the tax stamp, which contains a range of sophisticated security features, is a key means for them to distinguish between legal and illegal products, irrespective of the way in which the cigarettes are packaged. </p><p>  Research carried out by Revenue, in conjunction with the HSE National Tobacco Control Office, indicates that contraband represents the majority of illicit cigarettes and not counterfeit products. Figures from 2012 indicate that the proportion of smokers classified as having an illegal pack was 13%. These findings indicate that the level of consumption of illicit product is being contained, although Revenue remains determined to confront the illegal trade in tobacco products, to optimise levels of seizures of illicit tobacco product and to pursue those found to be involved in this illegal activity.  In this regard, Ireland is party to legally binding agreements between the EU and three major tobacco companies which aim to strengthen anti-smuggling measures. The Protocol to Eliminate the Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products was agreed at the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) Conference of the Parties in November 2012, and it is anticipated that Ireland will sign and ratify that protocol.</p><p>On the issue of standardised packaging, the Deputy will be aware that Government approval was received on 19th   November 2013 for the publication of the General Scheme of a new Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill 2013 and to proceed with the drafting of the legislation based on this General Scheme.  Australia was the first country in the world to introduce standardised packaging, in December 2012. We are in on-going contact with our Australian colleagues. While it is too soon to fully evaluate the impact of this policy in practice, there is a wealth of evidence on the effects of tobacco packaging in general and on perceptions and reactions to standardised packaging which supports the introduction of the measure. </p><p>  Finally, I would like to point out to the Deputy that tobacco consumption is today the greatest single cause of preventable illness and premature death in Ireland, killing over 5,200 people a year; that smokers die on average 10 years sooner than non-smokers; that one in every two children who experiment with cigarettes goes on to become a smoker, and that one in every two of them will die from a tobacco related disease. In this context, my priority is to reduce the consumption of tobacco across the board, to meet our policy target of making  Ireland tobacco free (i.e. with a smoking prevalence rate of less than 5%) by 2025. </p></reply>

This can result in a certificate of less than 1 or 2 years duration, depending on when the car was presented for a test.</p><p>  Currently, there is no legislation preventing the sale of a vehicle without a current NCT certificate. Consequently, potential purchasers need to be aware that the first NCT test on a vehicle they have purchased may result in an NCT certificate with an expiry date of less than 2 years. In a case where the expiry date of the current NCT certificate is more than 2 years in the past, the test due date is reset to the next anniversary of the date of the vehicle's first registration. However, in allowing such a period to elapse, the previous owner has committed an offence and may have been liable for prosecution as a result.</p><p>  There are no plans at present to change the existing regulations and I am advised that my ability to change the regulations as proposed by the Deputy would not be possible under the relevant EU directives. </p></reply>
