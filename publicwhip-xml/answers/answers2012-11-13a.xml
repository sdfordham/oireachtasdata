It should be noted that expenditure this year on child benefit, qualified child increases on primary social welfare payments, the family income supplement and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance is estimated to be just over &euro;3 billion as outlined in the table.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Year</div></th><th><div>Child Benefit</div></th><th><div>Family Income Supplement</div></th><th><div>Qualified Child Increases</div></th><th><div>BTSCFA</div></th><th><div>Total spending</div></th></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>&#8364;million</div></td><td><div>&#8364;million</div></td><td><div>&#8364;million</div></td><td><div>&#8364;million</div></td><td><div>&#8364;million</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012<br />(Estimated)</div></td><td><div>2,078.6</div></td><td><div>199.5</div></td><td><div>698.0</div></td><td><div>63.7</div></td><td><div>3,040</div></td></tr></table></p><p>The Government is conscious that these payments are an important source of income for families, particularly during a time of recession and unemployment.    Any plans to change the amount paid in respect of such payments will be a matter to be decided in a budgetary context and announced on Budget day.  I do not therefore propose to speculate on any possible approaches to child benefit payment rates changes, on whether it should be income-tested or on any question of compensating vulnerable families through increases in other payments at this time.</p><p>As part of the budget process, my Department conducts extensive analysis of the impacts of possible budgetary decisions and in particular of the likely impact on poverty outcomes.  The financial impact of proposals on various family types is also examined.</p><p>In relation to the question on &lsquo;debt arising from ordinary living expenses&rsquo;, I have assumed that the statistics quoted in the question relate to the recently published CSO report entitled &ldquo;Survey of Income and Living Conditions (SILC): Thematic Report on Children 2004 &ndash; 2010&rdquo;.</p><p>The publication does show that among several indicators of household deprivation, the indicator for those reporting that they are in debt from ordinary living expenses is higher in households with children (at 17.9%) than in households without children (at 6.5%).  I would point out that the social protection system already plays a very significant role in protecting vulnerable families from the problems associated with low-income including indebtedness.  For instance, the SILC data also show that the &ldquo;at risk of poverty rate&rdquo; for people living in households with children in 2010 decreased from 49.4 per cent when all social transfers were excluded to 18.7 per cent when all social transfers were included: a reduction of nearly 31 percentage points.  This clearly demonstrates the role that social transfers play in protecting people in households with children from poverty.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-13a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012111300058#WRA00700"><p>The current total of 421,490 persons on the Live Register includes over 80,000 casual workers in receipt of jobseeker&#8217;s allowance or jobseeker&#8217;s benefit.  It is recognised that a changing labour market has resulted in a move away from the more traditional work patterns, with a consequent increase in the number of casual workers.  In tandem many large employers currently have significant numbers of part time workers who are also being paid by the Department.  In acknowledgement of this trend, the Department has commenced work on the consideration of the future structure of the jobseeker schemes.  In this regard my Department&#8217;s work is being informed by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education report, <i>A Review of the Status of Casual Workers in Ireland</i> .  This report recommended increasing the flexibility of the existing jobseeker schemes by moving from the current days based system to a system of entitlement based on hours.</p><p>  However, increasing flexibility in the system could potentially, depending on the behavioural response, increase the number of people claiming a jobseeker&#8217;s payment thereby increasing the total cost of the scheme to the Exchequer. </p><p>  Other issues which are under active consideration are, aligning the jobseeker&#8217;s week to the calendar week and compensating for the loss of employment only or stated availability, whichever is the lesser.</p><p>  This work is complex and is taking place in the context of other social welfare reforms including the recognition of Sunday working for jobseekers, the current economic situation, and the considerable administrative change that implementation of reform to the jobseeker&#8217;s schemes will require.</p></reply>

This includes expenditure of &euro;2.08 billion on child benefit, some &euro;6.26 billion on pensions and &euro;3.44 billion on illness, disability and caring schemes.  In total, expenditure on these areas amounts to over 57% of the total expenditure of my Department.</p><p>  The Government is considering the appropriate level of expenditure on the wide variety and schemes and services operated by my Department in 2013 in the context of the forthcoming Budget. The outcome will be announced on Budget Day.  </p><p>  I recognise that managing expenditure in 2013 and beyond will be extremely difficult and requires a critical analysis of all expenditure items.  In this regard, I held a pre-Budget forum on Friday 12th October which was attended by thirty community and voluntary groups, including the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and groups representing people with disabilities.  I listened carefully to the groups&rsquo; views and proposals in relation to the forthcoming Budget and I am considering all submissions made to me in that regard, including written submissions made by Barnardos and the Society of St Vincent de Paul, and the report recently published by the Society of St Vincent de Paul, The Human Face of Austerity. </p><p>  As part of the Budgetary deliberative process, the Department will analyse, in so far as possible, the distributive and poverty impact of possible welfare changes to all welfare recipients including different family types including those with children and male/female poverty impacts.  Finally, the Department will prepare a similar analysis of the overall Budget 2013 tax and welfare packages when they are finalised.</p></reply>

To support their social inclusion and continued attachment to the work force, carers may engage in some limited employment, education or training, while still being regarded as being in a position to provide full time care.   From June 2006, the number of hours a person can engage in employment, self-employment, training or education outside the home and still satisfy the qualifying conditions, was increased from 10 to 15 hours per week.</p><p>  There are no plans at present for a further increase in the hours as this could have a negative impact on the person in need of full time care and attention.  The Department will continue to support carers and the people they care for within the resources available as set out in Government&rsquo;s National Carers&rsquo; Strategy.</p></reply>

The primary objective of the report was to gather information on the level of pension charges levied, to assess whether these charges are reasonable and transparent, to report on the findings and to make recommendations.   The report highlights a wide range of issues in relation to pension charges and identifies a number of serious problems.  It is fully recognised that the provision of pension schemes cannot be cost free.  However, there are major challenges to be addressed in the two main areas of reasonableness and transparency of charges. </p><p>  In recent years a number of initiatives have been progressed at Irish and EU level which focused on the area of disclosure and transparency of pension charges. These initiatives included the publication of the revised Consumer Protection Code by the Central Bank in 2012 and the recent consultation paper by the Pensions Board on pension simplification.  At EU level, my department will be monitoring development across a range of proposals which are currently under consideration and will be progressed during 2013.  The outcome of these developments will inform a review of relevant regulatory framework in Ireland.</p><p>  The report is a fact finding report, comments from interested parties and stakeholders are being invited over a 3 month period (i.e. by the end of January 2013).  These responses will be considered and a further policy and regulatory response, if necessary, will be brought to Government.</p></reply>

The Budget assigned to the National Advocacy Service in 2012 is &euro;3.2m   During 2011 the service was established across the country.  The service is managed by five Citizens Information Services in Dublin (Clondalkin), Westmeath, Offaly, Waterford and Leitrim and staffed by five Managers, 35 advocates (full-time equivalents) and five administrators.</p><p>  The aim of the National Advisory Service is to ensure that the voices of people with disabilities are heard and their rights safeguarded. The Service has a particular remit for people with disabilities who cannot self-refer, who are isolated in the community, or living in residential institutions.  It offers an independent advocacy service to help protect their rights, help them gain their entitlements, obtain a fair hearing and make positive changes in their quality of life. The experience to date is that in the majority of cases the co-operation of disability services providers is forthcoming and in cases where advocates have experienced some difficulties they continue to work with these providers to seek the best outcomes for their clients.</p><p>  As the National Advocacy Service has been in operation for almost two years, an independent review of the service is currently underway.  The review will encompass all aspects of the service, including whether consideration should be given to the provision of statutory powers for advocates or whether alternative approaches could be used to support the service assist people with disabilities to secure their rights and entitlements.  The review is due to be completed in early 2013.</p></reply>

There are currently 23,300 places (including supervisory positions) available on CE and the revised budget for 2012 is circa &#8364;340m.</p><p>  The programme addresses the multiple needs of people who are often far from employment ready and experiencing a range of social and economic problems by operating within local and community contexts and responding to the needs identified by a variety of community groups.</p><p>  The Department is committed to reforming CE to ensure delivery of service, value for money and the progression of the individual. The broad policy direction for CE in 2013 and future years will be based on the main action points coming from the CE Financial Review which has recently been completed and published by the Department. Officials are currently formulating business plans to address these action points. The Department is also currently finalising a report on the various activation programmes administered by it. This work will take place in the context of the Government&#8217;s activation strategy, most recently stated in <i>Pathways to Work. </i></p><p>With regard to the impact of Budget 2012 changes, the Department secured savings of approximately &#8364;9m for materials and training expenditure while maintaining CE activity at 2011 levels. There has been no reduction in the number of CE places for 2012 or in the hours of participation by CE participants and Supervisors on schemes as a result of the review.  It should also be noted that no scheme has closed as a result of the changes made to the materials and training budget for 2012.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  </p><p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for the State pension (contributory) easier by disregarding time spent out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme was introduced in and took effect from 1994.  Eligibility for the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is conditional on firstly meeting the standard qualifying conditions for State pension.</p><p>  Backdating the scheme to 1964 would involve considerable costs.  An analysis undertaken in the 2007 Green Paper on Pensions identified that to back-date the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme to 1953, the year when the unified system of social insurance was introduced in Ireland, would cost the Exchequer in the region of &euro;160m and to 1973/73, an estimated  &euro;150m.  Costs in relation to this scheme under the current rules, are expected to increase in the coming years due to the increase in female employment rates since 1994. </p><p>  It should be noted that women who do not qualify for a full rate pension may, if their spouse is in receipt of a State pension contributory, receive a qualified adult payment at a higher rate where they satisfy a means test.   A State pension non-contributory pension, which is a means tested payment, may also be payable.</p><p>  Time taken out of the workforce for homemaking and caring duties will continue to be protected by the current disregard.  While my Department will keep the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme under review, any improvements which could result in further costs for the Exchequer could only be considered in a budgetary context.</p></reply>

The rules of natural justice and fair procedures are applied by deciding officers when making decisions that could have an adverse effect on the person concerned.  The deciding officer must satisfy him/herself that the person: is aware of all the information that could adversely affect his/her entitlement; was notified that his/her entitlement was under review; was given an opportunity to comment and to submit any facts or information to correct any inaccuracy or incompleteness in the information; and any comments made by the person are clearly and fully considered before a decision is made.</p><p>  Deciding officers and others involved in the process will assist claimants as far as possible in making their applications but, as a matter of law, the burden of providing evidence to support a claim rests with claimants.</p><p>  Disqualifications and disallowances are issued to the customer in writing and include an explanation of the reason/s for the decision.  The disallowance/disqualification grounds, and reason/s for same, are outlined clearly and are sufficient to enable the appellant to lodge an appeal.  </p><p>  It is considered that issuing copies of claimants&rsquo; files or telephoning applicants prior to making a decision would place an unnecessary and unreasonable burden on resources in the Department and would impact on operating costs and processing times. Persons wishing to access their files are facilitated individually as requests are made.</p><p>  Persons are advised, in decision letters, of their right to seek a Departmental review of the initial decision and are advised as to how to lodge an appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).   Where a review is sought, the deciding officer re-examines the case and, taking account of any new facts or evidence, may revise his/ her decision.  In 2011, 42% of favourable decisions made following lodgement of appeal applications, were as a result of deciding officers revising their original decisions, which obviated the need for claimants to go through the full appeals process.  These revised decisions arose as a result, in most cases, of new facts or fresh evidence produced by the claimant after the original decision on his /her claim.  The figures illustrate that the review process is well understood and utilised.</p><p>  Decisions regarding the recoupment of overpayments are administrative in nature and do not fall within the remit of the SWAO.  However, before a recovery plan is put in place, the views of the customer are sought and taken into consideration.  The customer may also seek a review of the recovery plan.</p><p>  Deciding officers are reminded through ongoing training, guidelines and circulars that the decision of the appeals officer should be implemented without delay.  In a very small number of cases, changes in circumstances may come to light in the short period between the appeals officer making his/ her decision and its implementation, which would require revision of the appeals officer&rsquo;s decision e.g. cases where evidence of fraud is discovered.  There are also a very limited number of cases where the Chief Appeals Officer may be asked to review the appeals officer&rsquo;s decision.  The vast majority of appeals officers&rsquo; decisions are implemented on receipt of the decision.</p></reply>

The recommendations made in the report are now being examined in the Department and in the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).</p><p>  One of the recommendations relates to the independence of the SWAO.  The SWAO is a separate executive office with its own premises and staff which operates independently of the Department and the Minister.   The appeals process <font color="#2F2F2F">has a statutory basis in both primary and secondary legislation and Appeals Officers are quasi-judicial officers who are required to be free and unrestricted in discharging their functions. As far back as 1958, the Supreme Court found that Appeals Officers are required to free and unrestricted in the performance of their duties. The high level of appeals allowed (42% in 2011) is evidence of the indep</font>endence of the process.  There are no plans to take legislative steps to change the method by which Appeals Officers are appointed.</p><p>  The report also criticises the delays being experienced by appellants. As Deputies are aware there was a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals from 2009 to date which has placed extraordinary pressure on the SWAO. Significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, retraining retired experienced officers for 18 months ending December 2011, improving business processes and implementing a new operating model.  </p><p>  As a result of these measures, there has been significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from an average of 13,500 to 34,027 in 2011 and that the processing times reduced by an overall 10.2 weeks in the nine months to September 2012 as the oral hearing time is down by 12.5 weeks and the summary decision time is up by 2.3 weeks.  Of course, further improvement is needed.   In that regard, the Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012; there is a major programme of process redesign and modernisation currently underway in relation to many scheme areas which will reduce backlogs and will also reduce the time taken for the Department to respond to requests from the SWAO for submissions in relation to appeals; and it is planned to recruit 8 additional Medical Assessors in 2013.  All these measures together will reduce the waiting time for appellants.</p><p>  Concern was expressed in the report that the higher number of summary decisions in 2011 indicated a move away from oral hearings. I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that the increases in the number of summary decisions in 2010 and 2011 was a result of having eight very experienced retired appeals officers working exclusively on summary decisions which had the effect of front loading summary decisions.    The percentage of summary decisions was 69% in 2010 and 65% in 2011, the two years for which the retired officers were retained, and has since dropped to 56% in 2012.</p><p>  In relation to consistency and transparency in decision making, this is addressed in a number of ways by the Department through training and communication and in relation specifically to the SWAO it is the statutory responsibility of the Chief Appeals Officer to convene meetings of Appeals Officers for the purpose of ensuring consistency.</p><p>  The Department provides funding to a number of agencies involved in providing advocacy and information services to persons regarding their social welfare rights and how to process its systems.</p></reply>

Processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria. Schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness-related schemes, can take longer to process. Similarly, means-tested payments can also require more detailed investigation and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision making process.  As part of the Department&rsquo;s programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented in recent years. Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised.</p><p>  In addition, the staffing needs of the Department are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.  For example, ten additional staff are being assigned to deal specifically with a backlog in claims carers claims area. The Department will continue to source available staff to fill critical vacancies by way of redeployment, or transfer from within the Department and other Government Departments, taking account of the employment control framework (ECF) target, as determined by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I wish to assure the Deputy that prompt processing of claims remains a priority for me.</p><p>  In relation to appeals, there are ongoing efforts to reduce the processing times. The Department has appointed 15 additional Appeals Officers since 2010.  In addition, a further 10 Appeals Officers, formerly employed by the Community Welfare Services (CWS) of the Health Services Executive joined the Office as part of the integration of the CWS appeals services into the Social Welfare Appeals Office, bringing the total number of Appeals Officers now serving in the Office to 41.  The Office has also improved its business processes and IT supports.</p><p>  I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping the methods of operation by which the Social Welfare Appeals Office conducts its business under constant review, and that the processes are continuously being enhanced to reduce the backlogs in the Office and, overall, to reduce the processing times for dealing with appeals.</p></reply>

Changes have been made to the payment since its introduction in 1991, reflecting the changes taking place in society, the labour market and the expectations and realities of parents&rsquo; lives, and particularly of mothers, in terms of work and care.</p><p>  The aim of the reforms to the OFP scheme, which are currently underway are to prevent long-term dependence on social welfare support and facilitate financial independence among parents; recognise parental choice with regard to the care of young children, but with the expectation that parents will not remain outside of the labour force indefinitely.</p><p>  The Government recognises that the best route out of poverty for lone parents is through paid employment. The reforms underway to the OFP scheme will allow lone parents to access the supports and services provided by the Department through INTREO. Through this service clients will be offered an integrated service with access to activation supports. The service is based on a case management approach that leads the client through a continuum of interventions with the ultimate objective of assisting the client to find sustainable employment.</p></reply>

These limits were set after an analysis of the most up to date market data available. It is essential that rents are allowed to stabilise from a natural balance of supply and demand, rather than as a result of a rent control funded by the taxpayer.</p><p>  The Equal Status Acts 2000-2011 prohibit discrimination in the provision of services that are generally available to the public whether provided by the state or the private sector. Refusal by landlords to accept rent supplement tenants does not, however, fall within the area of discrimination as provided for under the equality legislation.</p><p>  The fact that approximately 89,000 people are currently in receipt of rent supplement of which 42,000 have been awarded during 2012 shows that a significant number of landlords are accommodating applicants of the scheme and that rent supplement recipients are able to access accommodation within the current limits, which is in operation since 2004, and the new Housing Policy Initiative. In March 2012, the Government approved in principle to transfer responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long term housing need from the Department of Social Protection, currently provided through rent supplement, to housing authorities using a new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).</p><p>  A multi-agency steering group chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has been established to develop proposals to give effect to this transfer. It is planned that pilot testing of HAP arrangements will commence during the second half of 2013 with general roll out and commencement of transfers from January 2014.</p><p>  The Department will continue to monitor the impact of the rent limits throughout the country but at this stage I have no plans to alter the current approach, in terms of introducing legislation to impose rent controls on residential properties or to bring forward the rent limit review. The Government will consider the appropriate level of expenditure on rent supplement<font color="#FF0000"> </font>in 2013 in the context of the forthcoming Budget.</p></reply>

These Regulations provide for the payment of social welfare benefits and pensions to a person other than the claimant or beneficiary. A person may be either nominated by the claimant or beneficiary to act as agent and receive the payment on his or her behalf or be appointed by the Minister. The Regulations specify the circumstances in which the Minister may appoint an agent and also set out the duties and responsibilities of the appointed person.</p><p>  In relation to the disability allowance scheme specifically, the Regulations as set in Statutory Instrument Number 378 of 2009 and previous legislation governing agency arrangements are fully implemented.  In May 2012 a letter issued to the agents of these customers who reside in approximately 75 residential care centres reminding them of their responsibilities and duties under the above Regulations.</p><p>  Issues with the agency arrangements are raised with the Department from time to time and the Department endeavours to resolve them having regard to the best interest of the customer.</p><p>  If the Deputy or Inclusion Ireland have concerns about any specific case, cases or residential institution, they should forward the details to my Office and I will arrange to have it investigated by the Department.</p></reply>

I am aware of the comment made by the National Advocacy Service. There are no specific exemptions to qualification for rent supplement for persons with disabilities with all customers being treated equally. Entitlement to rent supplement is subject to a number of qualifying conditions, one of which is that at the time of application for a rent supplement a claimant must:</p><p>  - have been residing in private rented accommodation, accommodation for homeless persons or in an institution for 6 months within the preceding 12 months of the date of claim, or have had an assessment of housing need carried out within the 12 months preceding the date of claim and have been deemed by a housing authority to be eligible for and in need of social housing support.</p><p>  Rent supplement is payable where a person has left institutional care and satisfies the conditions of the scheme. If the person concerned requires specialised housing due to the nature of their condition Department officials are empowered to pay rent supplement in excess of the prescribed rent limits, thereby fully supporting independent living.</p><p>  There have been instances where applications for rent supplement have been made where the applicants have either remained in intuitional care or have moved from one institution to another.  Rent supplement is not payable where an applicant is resident in an institution. An institution is defined as a hospital, convalescent home or home for persons suffering from physical or mental disability or accommodation ancillary thereto and any other similar establishment providing residence, maintenance or care for the persons therein.</p><p>  Under these circumstances, the responsibility for meeting the accommodation needs of the person concerned would be met by the body or organisation which is providing the maintenance and care of the individual.</p></reply>

There are some 400,000 customers in receipt of the household benefits package.  Between 2005 and 2011 the number in receipt of the electricity allowance rose by 20%.  The cost of the package was almost &euro;370 million in 2011.  My Department has engaged in discussions with utility companies and achieved some discounts for the Department in respect of both electricity and telephone payments.  However, it is important to note that my Department, in facilitating payment of electricity and telephone bills for certain categories of social welfare recipients, is not procuring the service directly.  As my Department&rsquo;s household benefit package only covers a proportion of utility bills, recipients must remain free to choose their own supplier and in this way obtain better value for money.  The 400,000 recipients remain individual customers of their respective utility companies, responsible in law for the payment of their bills.  This limits the ability of my Department to obtain greater savings.</p><p>  I appreciate the important role that these schemes play in promoting social inclusion and preventing isolation of older people and people with disabilities.  All of the schemes operated by my Department, including the household benefits package were examined in the context of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure and continue to be kept under review given the on-going need for savings and to target expenditure at those most in need.</p></reply>

The model will seek to address the child care requirements of children aged between 7 and 12 years (inclusive) both during the school term and the school holidays.</p><p>  Extensive work has been completed by the Group to quantify the level of school-age child care that is required to support the relevant social welfare income support recipients, in particular lone parents, for each year up to and including 2015.  An examination has also been carried out of existing child care schemes and of the capital investments already made by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in this sector. Based on these findings the IDG are engaged in detailed discussions to define an effective school-age childcare model and to determine the level of funding required. Once completed, the proposals will be submitted to Government for their consideration.</p><p>  I recently visited Sweden to study a number of items of interest to me.  I am particularly interested in the Swedish childcare system and what Ireland can learn from that model.  There are many aspects of the Swedish childcare system that are very impressive. My visit to a Reggio Emilia-inspired pre-school was one such example.  The school is very much a central part of the community and allows parents to avail of work and/or educational opportunities while their children are being cared for.</p><p>  The Swedish childcare model is a very comprehensive and expensive system. A more detailed examination of this and other international systems would be required to establish the most appropriate model for Ireland.</p></reply>

The aim of rent supplement is to provide short term income assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  The maximum rent limits were set after an analysis of the most up to date market data available. For all counties, major urban population centres were tested as part of the rents review to ensure that rent supplement applicants can access temporary housing arrangements whilst seeking employment opportunities. The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market.</p><p>  Analysis shows that for County Kildare, there are properties available within the maximum rent limits for rent supplement recipients.  The number of rental properties available in North Kildare is somewhat lower than the numbers available in the rest of the county and therefore impacts on the number of accommodation units available for rent supplement. The purpose of the rent limit review was to ensure availability of accommodation for rent supplement tenancies and not to provide rent supplement tenants with access to all housing in all areas.</p><p>  Latest figures show that there are approximately 4,300 rent supplement recipients in County Kildare. When compared with Census 2011 household data this shows that 36% of properties rented from private landlords are in receipt of rent supplement in County Kildare showing that it is possible to secure accommodation within the rent limits.  The Department will continue to monitor the impact of the rent limits throughout the country.</p></reply>

Plain English principles are applied to ensure that they are available in a simple, clear, easy to read format.   My Department operates a network of some 125 social welfare local and branch offices throughout the country.  Each local office has dedicated information officers providing information on all the Department&rsquo;s schemes and services and who are available to assist with the completion of application forms where required.</p><p>  The nationwide network of over 200 Citizens Information Centres also offers a drop-in service where callers can meet information providers face-to-face. Staff in these centres offer information, advice and advocacy to individuals on a wide range of public and social services, including the Social Welfare Appeals process.  In addition the National Advocacy Service, which was established under the Citizens Information Board in January 2011, provides an independent, confidential and free, representative advocacy service to vulnerable people with disabilities who cannot self-advocate, while supporting others to use mainstream services.   The aim of the National Advisory Service is to ensure that the voices of people with disabilities are heard and their rights safeguarded.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the assistance and support available to customers, through my Department&rsquo;s offices, through the Citizens Information Centres and the National Advocacy Service enables them to access my Departments schemes and services, including disability related payments, in a timely and effective manner that best meets their needs.</p></reply>

My Department currently provides a range of supports for family carers including carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit and the annual respite care grant, as well as secondary benefits such as free travel and household benefits.  There are almost 52,000 people in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance from my Department at an annual cost of over &euro;500 million. Of these, over 22,000 are getting half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance in addition to another social welfare payment at an annual cost of some &euro;90 million. There are over 1,600 people in receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit with an allocation of  &euro;23 million in 2012.</p><p>  In Budget 2012, the basic rate of all income supports for carers was maintained. The means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance is one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system. The income disregard is &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple.  A couple with two children can earn up to &euro;35,400 and qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance, as well as the household benefits package and free travel while a couple earning &euro;59,300 can still qualify for the minimum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance and additional benefits.  Carer supports were reviewed as part of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure and all of my Department&rsquo;s schemes are kept under review as part of the budgetary process. I have no plans to initiate a separate review of carer income supports.</p></reply>

Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum.  In 2011 it rose to 32,000. In the same period the number of decisions finalised increased from an average 13,500 to 34,027.</p><p>Currently the details of delays in the transfer of files for Appeals are outlined in the table:</p><p><bu>Table 1 - Files Awaiting Submission to SWAO as at 5th November 2012</bu></p><p><table><tr><th>Scheme</th><th>Files Awaiting Submission to Appeals</th></tr><tr><td>invalidity pension</td><td><div>3,688</div></td></tr><tr><td>jobseekers schemes</td><td><div>1,423</div></td></tr><tr><td>carers</td><td><div>1,131</div></td></tr><tr><td>SWA</td><td><div>892</div></td></tr><tr><td>Other schemes</td><td><div>794</div></td></tr><tr><td>domiciliary care allowance</td><td><div>747</div></td></tr><tr><td>disability allowance</td><td><div>398</div></td></tr><tr><td>child benefit</td><td><div>214</div></td></tr><tr><td>illness benefit</td><td><div>96</div></td></tr></table></p><p>The Department continues to examine what further improvements must be made to reduce processing times. When an appeal is received, it is acknowledged, the Department makes a submission to the SWAO on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant. Part of this process is a review by the Department of the initial decision in light of new evidences or information submitted as part of the appeal.  For example, in the case of schemes which include medical criteria, the time taken by the Department will almost always include a review by a different medical assessor to the one who initially examined the case.  In cases where a person&rsquo;s means are the issue, a further visit by a Social Welfare Inspector may be required.  All of this adds time to the process.</p><p>In effect the Department allows multiple reviews and submissions of fresh evidence to ensure the applicant gets every opportunity to make their case. A number of jurisdictions do not do this and inevitably restrict the opportunities of the applicant. Nonetheless, there is no doubt further improvement is needed and there are plans in place to do so.  In relation to the SWAO itself, the Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more claims in 2013 than will be finalised this year.  This will be achieved through the additional capacity generated as the newer Appeals Officers become experienced.  As things stand, with turnover of staff and additional new recruits, 25 Appeals Officers have less than 18 months experience.</p><p>There is a major programme of process redesign and modernisation currently underway in relation to many scheme areas which will reduce scheme backlogs and will also reduce the time taken for the Department to respond to requests from the SWAO for submissions in relation to appeals. It is also planned to improve the capacity of the Medical Review and Assessment Service through the recruitment of additional Medical Assessors in 2013.  All of these measures taken together will reduce the waiting times for appellants.</p></reply>

A major service delivery modernisation project has been undertaken to improve the efficiency of administration of the three scheme areas in question and to help to deal with the increased volumes. This involves the deployment of information technology solutions and associated business process re-organisation.  Full deployment of the new system for invalidity pension (IP) and carer&rsquo;s allowance (CA) is now completed and will be completed for disability allowance (DA) by the end of this month.  In tandem with the full implementation of the new system, comprehensive business process improvement exercises were recently completed in both IP and CA areas, the focus of which is to optimise performance and provide improved customer service.  New organisational structures were introduced and additional temporary staff were allocated to IP and CA areas to support these initiatives.</p><p>  I am pleased to say that the number of IP claims awaiting decision has decreased from 7,267 at the end of May 2012 to 4,560 at the end of October 2012 and continues to decrease.  The new process and structures were implemented in CA on 3 September 2012.  The number of claims awaiting decision there at the end of September was 10,322 and has reduced to 9,517 at the end of October 2012.  Furthermore, an additional 10 temporary staff are being assigned to expedite backlog claim clearance in CA.  It will take a number of months before the backlog is cleared but the process is continually monitored to ensure backlog eliminated in the shortest possible timeframe.</p><p>  The current average time taken to process new DA applications is 17 weeks.  Following the full deployment of the new system later this month, a similar business process improvement initiative will be commenced and a programme will be put in place to eliminate backlog of new applications. In the meantime, temporary staff  have been assigned to DA to support the modernisation project and overtime working is being operated as appropriate.  It should be noted that the time required to process a new application in each of the three schemes can vary depending on the complexity of the individual circumstances and the information provided by the claimant.  In addition, a request for a review or an appeal by  a person adds to length of time taken to deal with the claim.</p></reply>

The Government is concerned about the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners in China.  In April of this year, officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade met with representatives from the Falun Dafa Association of Ireland and discussed the ways in which human rights issues, including those relating to the Falun Gong, are raised with the Chinese authorities both by Ireland and by the European Union.</p><p>  Freedom of religious belief and expression is an issue which is discussed regularly with the Chinese authorities during both bilateral meetings and at European Union level.  At these meetings, the Government re-iterates the great importance Ireland attaches to human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.  Through the formal framework of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, which was established in 1995, the EU continues to share with China its experience in the field of human rights protection and promotion, and to urge China to take clear steps to improve the human rights situation.  At the most recent session of the EU-China human rights dialogue on 29 May 2012, the EU again raised the issue of restrictions on Falun Gong practitioners.  At this meeting, the EU also presented the Chinese side with a list of individual cases of concern, including those of several detained Falun Gong practitioners.</p><p>  During the Taoiseach&rsquo;s visit to China in March , he agreed a joint statement with Premier Wen Jiabao to establish a Strategic Partnership for Mutually Beneficial Cooperation between Ireland and China.  The Strategic Partnership, which is a major step forward in bilateral relations, provides for a strengthened political and economic dialogue between China and Ireland and promotes closer consultation and cooperation between my Department and its Chinese counterpart.  The Strategic Partnership reaffirms the commitment of Ireland and China to respect and safeguard human rights.  As set out in the joint statement, Ireland and China will conduct exchanges of expertise in governance and rule of law on the basis of equality and mutual respect.  We hope that, as China develops, it will be possible for further progress to be made in ensuring that individual rights are enjoyed by all China&rsquo;s citizens.  We will continue to address these matters in a frequent and regular dialogue, including the EU human rights dialogue and also bilaterally, in a spirit of mutual respect and cooperation.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s embassy in Slovenia is accredited to Bosnia and Herzegovina.   While an Irish diplomatic presence in Sarajevo would be desirable, the considerable financial pressures of recent years have led to further reductions in Ireland&rsquo;s already small diplomatic service. Severe resource and budgetary constraints mean that it will unfortunately not be possible to have a presence on the ground in Sarajevo during our Presidency.  However our Ambassador and the Deputy Head of Mission in Ljubljana have travelled to Bosnia and Herzegovina several times in the past year, and will continue to travel regularly, including to attend EU Heads of Missions meetings, and to report on developments there. </p><p>I am also pleased that the European External Action Service has built a strong presence in Sarajevo. Under the arrangements of the Lisbon Treaty, it is the EEAS rather than the rotating Presidency that takes the lead on the EU&rsquo;s relationship with Bosnia and Herzegovina. Nevertheless, Ireland will continue to take a strong interest in Bosnia and Herzegovina and we stand ready to support and assist the country in its progress towards its EU perspective, both during our Presidency and beyond.    </p></reply>

The Presidency staffing plan for the Permanent Representation in Brussels was prepared following a carefully coordinated inter-departmental needs evaluation.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains a roster of observers for election monitoring missions. We aim to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level in international observation missions for both elections and constitutional referendums. Irish observers participate primarily in missions organised by the European Union (EU) and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), but have also been involved in missions organised by the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the Carter Centre. So far in 2012, 57 Irish observers have been involved in missions organised by both the EU and OSCE, across 11 countries.</p><p>Observers who participate in missions supported by the Department are entitled to<font color="#FF0000"> </font>one pre-departure grant of &#8364;600 in every twelve month period to cover any costs incurred in preparing for the trip, including vaccinations and other medical expenses. For EU led missions, any additional costs are covered by the European Commission.Observer costs for OSCE-led Missions are met by the participating countries. In Ireland&#8217;s case, these funds come from the Irish Aid budget. </p><p>The election observation programme is subject to continuous monitoring to ensure it is efficient and effective and provides the best possible value for money. A list in tabular form of the costs for each Irish election observer funded by Irish Aid from January 1<sup>st</sup> 2012 to date is set out below. For obvious reasons, the costs associated with long-term observers (LTO) are higher than those for short-term observers (STO).</p><p>There are currently some 300 people on the Election Observation Roster. At present, the roster is not open for new members but I am aware that there are quite a number of individuals interested in joining the roster.I am keen to ensure that members of the roster will have the specific skills requested by the OSCE and the EU, including language skills. As previously stated, I have asked officials to carry out a detailed review of the roster and how it works, and to prepare proposals on future membership. I hope that the review will be completed in the near future.</p><p><b>Election Observation Missions 2012 to date</b></p><p><b>(57 observers on 11 missions)</b></p><p><b><i>COUNTRYORGANISATIONROLENAME COST&#8364;</i></b><b></b></p><p><b>January</b></p><p>KazakhstanOSCESTOPatricia Barker 3,643</p><p>KazakhstanOSCESTOPaddy Buckenham 3,193</p><p>KazakhstanOSCESTOPaul Cosgrave 3,643</p><p>KazakhstanOSCESTOMichael Humphreys 3,643</p><p>KazakhstanOSCESTOCecilia Keaveney 3,643</p><p><b>February</b></p><p>SenegalEULTODiarmuid Peavoy 0</p><p>SenegalEUSTOAidan O&#8217;Shea 0</p><p><b>March</b></p><p>RussiaOSCELTOMichael Verling17,029</p><p>RussiaOSCESTOGrattan Lynch 4,301</p><p>RussiaOSCESTOJulian Clare 3,756</p><p>RussiaOSCESTONoreen Kerins 4,301</p><p>RussiaOSCESTOChris Andrews 4,301</p><p><b>May</b></p><p>ArmeniaOSCELTOSean O&#8217;Callaghan 6,967</p><p>ArmeniaOSCESTOAnn Ormonde 3,304</p><p>ArmeniaOSCESTOBlaise Treacy 3,304</p><p>ArmeniaOSCESTOEdward Horgan 3,304</p><p>ArmeniaOSCESTOJames McNamara 3,304</p><p>ArmeniaOSCESTOTerence Fleming 3,304</p><p>ArmeniaOSCESTOBrian Fagan 3,304</p><p>ArmeniaOSCESTOEimear Friel 2,717</p><p>Serbia IOSCELTOOrla Cluff 6,827</p><p>Serbia IIOSCELTOPeter McMahon 3,685</p><p>AlgeriaEULTODorcha Lee 600</p><p>AlgeriaEUSTOMary Boland 0</p><p>AlgeriaEUSTOPeter Ballagh 0</p><p><b>July</b></p><p>Timor LesteEULTOMary O&#8217;Shea 0</p><p><b>September</b></p><p>BelarusOSCELTOPeter Donovan8,086</p><p>BelarusOSCESTONoel Brennan 2,775</p><p>BelarusOSCESTOJulian Clare 2,230</p><p>BelarusOSCESTOPatrick Finneran 2,775</p><p>BelarusOSCESTOFinbar O&#8217;Sullivan 2,541</p><p>BelarusOSCESTODeirdre Grogan 2,857</p><p>BelarusOSCESTOMark Long 2,857</p><p>BelarusOSCESTORebecca Moynihan 2,775</p><p>BelarusOSCESTOAnne Choiseul 2,775</p><p><b>October</b></p><p>GeorgiaOSCELTOEithne MacDermott 6,730</p><p>GeorgiaOSCESTOCecilia Keaveney 3,546</p><p>GeorgiaOSCESTOEileen McCabe 4,146</p><p>GeorgiaOSCESTOJohn O&#8217;Connor 4,122</p><p>GeorgiaOSCESTOPeter Emerson 4,146</p><p>GeorgiaOSCESTOConor O&#8217;Clery 4,122</p><p>GeorgiaOSCESTOJames Mallon 4,122</p><p>GeorgiaOSCESTOLes Allamby 4,122</p><p>GeorgiaOSCESTORichard McEvoy 4,122</p><p>UkraineOSCELTOSeamus Martin11,473</p><p>UkraineOSCELTOMichael Verling10,746</p><p>UkraineOSCESTOEric Byrne 3,258</p><p>UkraineOSCESTOGeraldine Power 3,425</p><p>UkraineOSCESTORaymond Dunne 3,425</p><p>UkraineOSCESTOCiaran Kinsella 3,425</p><p>UkraineOSCESTOFionnuala Brennan 3,425</p><p>UkraineOSCESTOKevin Grogan 3,425</p><p>UkraineOSCESTOJulian Clare 2,825</p><p>UkraineOSCESTOThomas Bellew 2,827</p><p><b>November</b></p><p>Sierra LeoneEULTOColm Fahy600</p><p>Sierra LeoneEUSTOMichael Coyne600</p><p>Sierra LeoneEUSTOMichael Boyle600</p></reply>

In 2012, I approved grants of &pound;5,698,400 (just over &#8364;7m)<b></b>in respect of<b></b>  113 organisations of which &pound;4.485 million (&#8364;5.5m) relates to organisations providing welfare and information services to the Irish community, particularly the elderly.  </p><p>  The organisations funded provide a range of services, from informal community networking groups for senior citizens, to outreach services and advice in accessing entitlements.  The ESP funds many professional services that provide expert advice and assist Irish people access the relevant supports provided in relation to social, housing and medical needs to name but a few.  This support has had a very tangible and positive impact on Irish communities in Britain, in particular on the lives of our vulnerable citizens, a point acknowledged by, amongst others, the Simon Community and the British-Irish Inter-parliamentary Body. </p><p>  I welcome the publication of Fresh Perspectives &#8211; a needs analysis of the Irish Community and am delighted to see both the Federation of Irish Societies and the London Irish Centre working together to improve the lives of Irish people in the UK.  The ESP is the lead supporter of both of these organisations who are the largest recipients of ESP funding in Britain receiving &pound;475,000 (&#8364;590,000) and &pound;448,500 (&#8364;550,000) respectively in 2012.</p></reply>

In identifying the main priorities of the Presidency, the Taoiseach and I have asked all members of the Government to use the Presidency to focus on the jobs and growth agenda across all policy formations.  Tackling unemployment, and particularly youth unemployment, and creating the conditions for sustainable economic growth, will be the core priorities of the Irish Presidency.     The General Affairs Council, which I will chair, deals with a broad range of cross-cutting issues including the EU&#8217;s future financing.  During the Presidency I will work to deliver on a complex EU budgetary process.  My aim is to ensure that the Union supports a range of programmes and initiatives that can underpin economic recovery, growth and job creation, and promote greater social inclusion and regional cohesion.  The future enlargement of the EU will also figure prominently on the General Affairs Council agenda during the Presidency.  EU enlargement is good for European stability and peace and, as Chairperson, I will work to make progress in this area.  </p><p>  To stimulate job creation and growth across the EU, the Irish Presidency has already identified key policy areas aimed at making sure that the Single Market, which has delivered so many benefits for consumers and business over the past two decades, is better equipped to deal with the rapidly evolving digital economy.  Our Presidency will also place a strong emphasis on promoting greater coordination of, and support for, the Union&#8217;s research and innovation agenda, to ensure that the EU can become more globally competitive.  But Europe also needs to look beyond its own borders to facilitate more exports which can sustain and create employment and economic growth.  This is why Ireland, as Presidency, is placing a strong emphasis on moving the EU external trade agenda forward.  A meeting of Trade focusing on the on the EU-US trade relationship will take place in April 2013.  We hope to deliver a mandate for EU-US trade talks.</p><p>The Irish Presidency will support the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and the European External Action Service in promoting the Union&#8217;s values of peace, democracy and respect for human rights abroad.  These values were explicitly recognised in the awarding of the Nobel Prize to the EU.  Much of the Foreign Affairs Council agenda will be taken up with responding to current events, but issues such as the ongoing crisis in Syria, and the Middle East Peace Process are likely to feature prominently on the Council agenda during the Presidency. Ireland places a very strong attachment to development aid, and this is why, as Presidency, we will host a number of events in Dublin including an informal Ministerial meeting and an international conference in Dublin, bringing together the themes of hunger, nutrition and climate justice, working in close cooperation with Mary Robinson Foundation.  During our Presidency we will work to advance agreement with partners on the EU approach to the post-2015 framework for international development as we look beyond the 2000 Millennium Development Goals<i>.</i></p><p>  Work on preparing for the Presidency is now entering its final weeks.  While the agenda is considerable, we look forward to meeting the challenges and seizing the opportunities that the Presidency presents to create a better Europe for citizens in Ireland and across Europe.  </p><p>I will continue to have meetings with partners from other Member States and the institutions.  During this month we are hosting visits from several high-level groups and Committees from the European Parliament to discuss our approach to the Presidency and to build on the already constructive working relations that we have with MEPs.  </p></reply>

At the NSMC Plenary meeting which took place on 2 November 2012 in Armagh, I had the opportunity, together with my colleagues, to review progress across a range of areas of already existing North South cooperation.  I have also been working with my Government colleagues in identifying further areas of North/South economic co-operation, and actively supporting them in pursuing these with the Northern Executive.  This has been taking place both inside and outside the formal structures of the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC).   Particular areas which have been identified include the agri-food sector; higher education; cooperation on reducing duplication which can ease budgetary pressures for both administrations; and conflict resolution.  My officials have been working to advance the North West Gateway Initiative, which is of particular importance to that region.  Consideration is also being given to working together to build trade links with Asian economies, especially China and India. </p><p>  The areas of sport and tourism are further areas where we can seek to expand cooperation.  Those two areas dovetail well.  Tourism is vital to both economies and it is important to maximise the benefits of major initiatives such as the Titanic centenary, the Gathering 2013, and Derry&rsquo;s City of Culture celebrations.</p><p>  The Government is fully committed to exploring ways of increasing the level of North/South co-operation across the full range of activities for which we have responsibility and to broadening contact with all relevant organisations and groups in Northern Ireland.</p><p>  We continue to make a case to our colleagues in the Northern Ireland executive for progress with regard to the Second and Third Terms of Reference of the St. Andrews Review which look to the future of North/South cooperation. In our view, this is now overdue.  Most recently, I raised this issue with the Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister when I met him in Belfast on Sunday.</p></reply>

The Council adopted strong conclusions which made clear that the EU continues to stand by the Syrian people in their courageous struggle for freedom, dignity and democracy. </p><p>The absolute priority remains stopping all violence and ending oppression.   The Council expressed its full support for the efforts of the UN/Arab League Joint Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, to secure an early ceasefire and promote an overall political settlement. There was clear agreement within the Council on the necessity for the international community, including the UN Security Council and the main regional powers, to uphold their responsibilities and work alongside Special Envoy Brahimi.  While it is regrettable that his call for a pause in the fighting on the occasion of the <i>Eid al Adha</i>   festival was not observed on the ground, we must continue to support his efforts in pursuit of a peaceful and orderly political transition.</p><p>  No political solution in Syria will happen without a wide consensus among those opposing Bashar al-Assad&#8217;s oppressive rule.   The Council urged all opposition groups to set aside their differences and agree on a set of values and common objectives towards a genuine political transition.</p><p>  The Council also expressed deep concern concerning the spill-over effects of the crisis on neighbouring countries.   It strongly condemned the shelling by Syrian forces of Turkish territory, including the attack on the border town of Akcakale on 3 October, and warned again about the dangers of further militarisation of the conflict while calling for the flow of arms to Syria to be curbed.</p><p>  The rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation was also discussed.   The Council recalled the moral imperative for the international community to step up assistance to all affected populations in Syria and neighbouring countries.  Ireland, for its part, is already making a substantial contribution to humanitarian relief efforts, having provided &#8364;2.45 million in assistance to date which has been principally channelled through UNHRC, ICRC and WHO.  At the end of August, the Minister of State for Development Cooperation, Joe Costello T.D., visited Zatari refugee camp in Jordan in this connection.</p><p>  The Council also approved a further round of restrictive measures targeted against the Assad regime and its supporters, giving the Syrian Government&#8217;s continuing failure to end repression and to desist from waging war and inflicting horrendous suffering on its own people. </p><p>  While EU sanctions have been effective in increasing pressure on the regime, I nonetheless continue to believe that the most effective measure which could be taken now to end the violence in Syria would be the imposition of a comprehensive arms embargo by the UN Security Council.</p><p>  The European Council, which the Taoiseach attended in Brussels on 18/19 October, also adopted brief Conclusions on Syria which essentially endorsed those adopted by the FAC on 15 October. </p></reply>

Both banks were required to sanction lending, including lending for working capital purposes, of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion this year and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks achieved their 2011 targets. The Head of the Credit Review Office (CRO), Mr John Trethowan, stated in his recently published ninth quarterly report that &ldquo;&euro;3.5bn of sanctions for each bank is a very challenging target, however the remaining five months typically show more lending activity and I am of the view that, after a slow start to the year, the targets will be a challenge but still may be achieved.&rdquo;   In terms of rejection rates from banks in general, the CRO can review decisions by the pillar banks to refuse, reduce or withdraw credit facilities (including applications for restructured credit facilities) from &euro;1,000 up to &euro;500,000. The Credit Review Office is overturning 55% of the decisions referred to them, supplying over &euro;9.5m of credit, supporting 813 full time and 46 part time jobs in the SME sector.</p><p>  The Relationship Frameworks provide that &ldquo;the board of each bank will determine the bank's strategy and commercial policy..&rdquo; but I am aware that the banks provide a range of products for Irish SMEs and also support and help SMEs through various initiatives. For example, the banks have implemented common application forms for business credit and worked on developing cash flow planners. </p><p>  I would encourage all businesses to keep open communications with their bank and to take advantage of the services available to them. </p></reply>

This assurance, provided by the banks, would cover the direct transfer of funds provided in State Aid towards the reduction of deficits in the banks pension schemes. The institutions do contribute, as required by law and regulation, to pension schemes in the normal way. Deficits that exist in pension schemes in the institutions are being reduced generally through increased employee contributions and reductions in future benefits.    The Deputy will appreciate, however, an institution&rsquo;s funds are not generally segregated by source for distribution in specific ways. It is very difficult in terms of a banks funding to categorically state that State Aid  does not indirectly find its way through normal employee contribution or pre State Aid contractual arrangements into pension funds. However, in terms of the principal at issue I am assured by the institutions that none of the institutions has used State funds directly to off-set deficits in defined benefit pension scheme funds.</p></reply>

The Central Bank has further advised that in July 2011, it received information, which increased its concerns regarding the integrity of client investments managed by Custom House Capital Limited.  The Central Bank then decided to impose further directions on the firm and in July 2011 to seek the appointment of High Court Inspectors to investigate the affairs of the firm. </p><p>  An independent review of the Regulatory Regime for the Safekeeping of Client Assets was published by the Central Bank earlier this year and is available on the Central Bank website. The Central Bank has fully accepted the specific recommendations contained in this independent review and is in the process of implementing all of the necessary changes required. However, no amount of skilled supervision or enhanced audit can absolutely guarantee that determined or deliberately concealed efforts to misuse client holdings can be prevented. </p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that there are several existing powers in place and extensive new powers proposed to ensure adequate monitoring and early action by the Central Bank to prevent the loss of client assets as occurred in the case of Custom House Capital.</p><p>  I have already brought forward a very wide range of statutory powers to enable the Central Bank to deal with such an issue across the financial service sector under the Central Bank Reform Act 2010, the MiFID Regulation 2007, The Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011 (in respect of credit institutions) and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011, including a substantial number of new proposals for Committee Stage of the Bill.  </p><p>  The Central Bank Reform Act, 2010, sets out a far-reaching regime for the Central Bank to set out and enforce standards of fitness and probity across the financial service sector, including standards of honesty, integrity and ethical judgement, which apply to those in key management positions.  The Act provides for sanctions, at the discretion of the Central Bank, of suspension, or even, prohibition orders, following an investigation and due process.  In terms of addressing poor management, the code applies similar requirements in respect of skills and experience.  Regulated financial service providers who fail to uphold these standards could find themselves subject to administrative sanction, up to and including a &euro;10m fine or suspension/removal of authorisation.</p><p>  The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill, 2011, also sets out a number of new provisions that are relevant. The fitness and probity provisions are reinforced by the whistleblower protections proposed in the Bill, which place an onus on those performing pre-approval controlled functions to disclose information relating to offences, prescribed contraventions, and breaches of Irish financial services legislation or the destruction of evidence.</p><p>  The Authorised Officer powers proposed will allow the Central Bank full access to any information it needs, including the ability to question individuals and access premises.  The Central Bank will also have, for the first time, the statutory right to attend meetings of regulated financial service providers and related undertakings, where necessary.  </p><p>  The proposed Skilled Person powers under Part 2 of the Bill will allow for independent and objective analysis of issues within a regulated financial service providers or related undertaking, including client asset requirements.  This power has been specifically identified as important in the Central Bank&rsquo;s recent internal report on safeguarding client assets.</p><p>  The Bill will also give the Central Bank far-reaching powers of direction, which can be issued on grounds including where the regulated financial service provider is conducting business in such a manner as to jeopardise or prejudice monies held by or controlled by it on behalf of customers; these directions may also apply where the rights of customers are being prejudiced or jeopardised.  In such cases the Central Bank can issue very strong directions regarding the suspension of business or modifications to practices, among other things.  Such directions are enforceable through the High Court if necessary.  </p><p>  Furthermore, the Bill will provide the Central Bank with the power to make regulations setting out the standards to be met, and the procedures, systems and checks to be adopted, by regulated financial service providers for dealing with and holding the assets and money of customers.  This includes provisions on the safeguarding of customers&rsquo; rights, in particular in the event of insolvency; the use to which customers&rsquo; assets and money may be put; and the management of customer accounts.  Again these regulations will be enforceable through the administrative sanction procedure, as enhanced under the Bill.</p><p>  Committee stage of the Bill as published, will propose further regulation-making powers to the Central Bank which are specifically targeted at enabling the Central Bank to support the protection of client assets including greatly enhanced information gathering powers to allow the Central Bank to ensure that it can demand information from regulated firms.  These powers should facilitate investigations on compliance with client assets requirements.</p><p>  The Bill also proposes a means of restitution, via a Central Bank application to the High Court, where a person has been unjustly enriched or where others have suffered loss or other adverse effects arising from the commission of an offence or a prescribed contravention.  This provision is proposed to be further enhanced at Committee Stage in a way which will make it applicable to managers who commit offences or prescribed contraventions.</p></reply>

Other lenders have committed to reconsidering the issuing of such products.  The decision to introduce a negative equity type product is a matter for each mortgage lender.  However any institution offering such a mortgage facility may do so only in accordance with criteria set out by and with the prior approval of the Central Bank.     The Central Bank also advised me that, following the issue of the report of the Inter-Departmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group in September 2011, which included a recommendation on trade down mortgages, several lenders contacted the Central Bank with regard to offering negative equity mortgages.  This included trade up, trade down and trade down where the customer was in arrears.  While the provision of negative equity mortgages may facilitate people moving homes and generate transactions in the housing market, it is not expected that there will be a large take up of this product.  All sales must comply with the affordability and suitability provisions set out in the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.</p><p>  I expect that the Central Bank will continue to assess the impact of these measures as part of their general oversight of the banks&rsquo; activities in the mortgage market.</p></reply>

As such, the director is legally bound to act in what he or she believes are the interests of the separate legal entity that is the institution itself. These are the directors so called fiduciary responsibilities. To address the scope for actual and perceived conflicts between the fiduciary duties of the directors of financial institutions under company law and the wider public interest in circumstances where those institutions have received huge financial support from the State, legal clarity, not just to the role of the public interest director but to that of the entire boards of those institutions, was provided under Section 48 of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010. It provides that the overriding duty of directors of the covered institutions relates to the public interest as set out in the Act. </p><p>  Accordingly, public interest directors do not have a formal reporting relationship to the Minister or to the Department of Finance. As Minister for Finance, I am strongly committed to ensuring that the boards of the covered institutions act at all times in a manner fully consistent with key public interest objectives for the banking sector.</p></reply>

This represented a growth rate of 1.6 per cent over the 2011 level of nominal GDP, based on the prevailing 2011 GDP estimates from the CSO. In the interim however, the CSO has revised up its estimate of 2011 nominal GDP to &euro;158,993 million which will increase the starting point for my Department&rsquo;s next formal forecast for 2012 nominal GDP, set to be released shortly. On a purely technical basis however, 2012 nominal GDP was estimated at &euro;162,500 million (rounded to the nearest &frac12; billion) in the recent Maastricht returns by applying the 2012 SPU nominal growth rate to the revised CSO base for 2012.</p><p>  The &euro;14.1 billion deficit the Deputy refers to is the Exchequer deficit as of end-October 2012 and this is the most up to date assessment of the Exchequer cash position. The most recent estimate of the General Government deficit for 2012 is &euro;13.6 billion or 8.4 per cent of GDP, as set out in the recent Maastricht Returns. This is a significant improvement on the underlying deficit of &euro;16.7 billion or 10.7 per cent of GDP recorded in 2010. Importantly also, this latest 2012 deficit estimate is within the 8.6 per cent of GDP limit set by the ECOFIN Council in December 2010. The eighth quarterly review of the EU/IMF Programme also concluded that it was likely that Ireland would meet its 2012 deficit target.</p><p>  My Department will be publishing its updated economic and fiscal forecasts shortly.</p></reply>

These rules include reference to defined benefit pension deficits as these can affect the capital base of regulated entities.    In a letter from the Financial Regulator to industry in 2005, banks were informed that those applying IAS 19/FRS 17 are allowed to add back to Tier 1 Capital the amount of the defined benefit pension liability that has accrued in relation to Irish pension schemes in their financial statements and to deduct an amount equal to the sum of (i) the Deficit under the Minimum Funding Requirement plus (ii) three years Supplementary Contributions.  A subsequent letter issued by the Financial Regulator in 2009 amended the treatment of the Deficit under the Minimum Funding Requirement element such that credit institutions were required to include at least the Minimum Funding Requirement in its calculation of pension risk under Pillar 2 capital calculations.</p><p>  The draft Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) requires the removal of most prudential filters, including the Irish DB scheme pension filter detailed above. Article 461 of the draft CRR, relating to transitional provisions, provides for regulated entities to apply a phased approach to filters and deductions &ldquo;required under national transposition measures for Articles 57, 61, 63, 63a and 66 of Directive 2006/48/EC&rdquo; with a five year implementation period. The transitional provisions are the subject of on-going negotiation between the European Parliament (EP) and Council. </p><p>  The capital base and capital requirements of the PCAR banks were assessed under PCAR and included in this assessment was forecast deductions for defined benefit pension deficits and subsequent capital filters under base and stress scenarios. The FMP report did not disclose details of the assumed levels of deduction for pension deficits. The focus on the PCAR was the forecast income, capital requirements and losses (particularly loan losses) in the three-year period.</p><p>  The Central Bank included in the PCAR the forecast deduction for defined benefit pension deficits and subsequent capital filters under base and stress scenarios. In addition the Central Bank considered the implications of Basel III (namely CRD IV/ CRR). The PCAR tolerance levels and capital basis were set in accordance with the Central Bank&rsquo;s definition of Core Tier 1 under the prevailing Capital Requirements Directive rules as at end-March 2011.</p><p>  It is important to note, that the quality of capital in the Irish banking system has increased significantly as a result of lower tier capital buy backs and Government equity contributions. Whilst it is clear that the Basel III rules impose more conservative deductions than is currently the case, following a recapitalisation to levels determined by the 2011 PCAR, the FMP report stated that all four banks should comfortably meet Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio on a phase-in basis under both the base case and stress case scenarios. The combined surplus to the minimum phase-in Common Equity Tier 1 under the PCAR base case under PCAR was estimated at the time as circa 13.3bn and 3.7bn under the stress case. Three of the banks would also meet the full 2019 minimum standard in the 2013 base case scenario. </p></reply>

Had the transfer of assets not taken place, the early retirement component of the voluntary severance could not have proceeded as it would have required a cash contribution from the bank. The voluntary severance scheme in the bank overall is expected to result in annual savings to AIB in excess of &euro;200m which is a critical component of AIB&rsquo;s return to long term viability. It is highly likely, that in the absence of the early retirement scheme, the bank would have been unable to achieve its target staff departure figures on a voluntary basis which would likely have required the need for significant numbers of compulsory redundancies.   AIB informs me that for an employee retiring at age 60 with 40 years pensionable service and an annual pension of &euro;529,000, AIB estimates that the capital value accumulated in a fund to provide this annual figure would be approx. &euro;10.5m.</p></reply>

This restriction was introduced in the April 2009 supplementary budget as part of an urgent revenue-raising package aimed at stabilising the public finances. The reduction in the level at which interest could be claimed for residential rental properties reduced the cost of this relief to the Exchequer by an estimated &euro;95 million in a full year.</p><p>  The context in which the 2009 measure was introduced, i.e. the need to stabilise public expenditure, still exists.

I confirm again that neither the banks nor the Government have an accurate means of establishing the underlying ownership of securities issued by the banks under the ELG as of a particular point in time. As these securities are freely tradable once issued it is not possible to trace their ultimate ownership. These securities are traded and dealt through market participants and settled by clearing house systems. An issuer does not have any access to the records of the clearing house. At maturity, the Bank will instruct its paying agent to transfer the funds due to the clearing house who will then distribute the funds to the holders of the securities as per their records. Even where the bank is presented with lists alleging to represent names of bondholders I am informed there is no way for the bank or anyone else to completely verify the accuracy of such lists.  Unfortunately, this makes it impossible for me to answer your question directly. It is therefore not possible to provide you with a schedule of financial institutions with recourse to the German sovereign exchequer who may have been the holders of such securities.</p></reply>

Since those forecasts were published, the global economy has worsened and international forecasting agencies have revised down their growth forecasts for 2013 in most of Ireland&rsquo;s trading partners. This is likely to lead to lower-than-previously expected demand for Irish exports, and my Department is likely to revise down its real GDP forecast for 2013. Nonetheless, the outturn for nominal GDP throughout 2012 has been better than expected in April and, broadly speaking, nominal developments drive revenue performance.   The achievement of fiscal targets is driven by a range of factors, including overall economic performance as well as specific developments which effect revenue and expenditure patterns in a given year.</p><p>  Despite likely lower growth this year than originally estimated at budget time, we are on track to meet fiscal targets. A similar situation arose in 2011. Real GDP growth in 2011 was a little lower than originally forecast in December 2010, but we still managed to meet all our fiscal targets without the need for additional consolidation measures during the course of 2011.  My Department will publish revised economic and fiscal forecasts in the coming days.</p></reply>

This is clearly stated in publications and in replies to Parliamentary Questions.    The vast majority of married income earners choose to be assessed jointly as one tax unit for income tax purposes. While it may be possible, with the assistance of significant development to the existing computer-based databases and costing model, to produce income statistics for income tax based on individual earners, this is problematic for various reasons, in particular given the facility for married couples to transfer credits and, in part, the standard rate band.</p><p>  It is therefore not possible to provide the Deputy with the information he has sought. The Deputy may, however, wish to refer to the reply to Parliamentary Question No 42354 answered on 3rd October 2012 which sets out the information currently available on the income distribution and tax liabilities of income earners estimated by reference to the income tax year 2012. Again the number of earners shown in the table in the reply counts a married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment as one tax unit.  In the interests of consistency, I am reluctant to alter the way income tax statistics are currently presented. Furthermore, I am not convinced that presenting income tax statistics in a manner different to the way income tax is actually assessed and collected provides significant additional value.</p></reply>

Illegal activity in this area, particularly the criminal activity associated with laundering marked fuel, imposes significant costs on the community and poses a serious threat to tax yield and to legitimate businesses.  As part of its strategy to curb illegal activity in this area, earlier this year Revenue introduced strengthened licensing requirements for traders in auto fuels and a new licensing requirement for traders in marked fuel oil from 1 October 2012. In addition, from January 2013, there will be a new requirement for all fuel traders to make monthly returns of oil movements.  These requirements are considered essential in protecting legitimate traders and curbing illegal activity. The licence fee is a flat rate excise duty of &#8364;250 and it applies to traders licensed to keep, deliver, deal in or sell marked fuel and auto fuel in respect of each premises from which they operate. This rate has not changed since 2001.  </p><p>  Revenue has had a number of meetings with trade representatives to explain the new licensing procedures and reporting requirements.  These representative organisations have indicated their support for these initiatives, recognising their role in tackling fuel fraud and tax evasion and addressing the concerns of compliant traders who face unfair competition from illicit traders.  In designing the new system, Revenue was conscious of the potential compliance burden on traders, particularly small traders, and the new reporting requirements, for example, allow for aggregate reporting of marked fuel deliveries to domestic users. Revenue has communicated with traders to explain the new system and has published detailed information on its website at <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>.  I am assured by Revenue that the new monthly return (ROM1) is relatively straightforward and that they have scheduled a series of seminars for traders throughout November to explain how the new system will work in practice and to clarify any queries they may have.</p><p>  The laundering of marked fuel and its subsequent sale to motorists through retail outlets and other means is a serious, multi-faceted problem with significant consequences for the exchequer, legitimate traders, unsuspecting motorists and the environment. Trading in marked fuel, which is taxed at a lower rate than road fuel on condition that it is used only for specified off-road activities, carries certain responsibilities. As Minister for Finance, I fully support the comprehensive set of measures being implemented by the Revenue Commissioners to ensure more effective control of the distribution of road fuels and marked fuels, including the new licensing requirements and the new electronic reporting system for oil movements. </p></reply>

This applies to any agreement other than a housing loan.  Section 52 (3) of the Act states that &ldquo;where the consumer exercises the entitlement, the creditor or owner shall allow a reduction in the total cost of credit under the agreement."   Section 52 (6) of the Consumer Credit Act 1995,  states that "the Minister for Finance may, after consulting the Bank, make a regulation prescribing a method or formula for calculating the reduction in the total cost of credit under agreements generally or any class of agreement."  In the absence of such a regulation, the Rule of 78, which deals with agreements whose cost is calculated at the outset of the loan, is commonly used to calculate the amount of the rebate due in the event of the early repayment of the agreement.</p><p>  However, since the introduction of the EC (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations 2010 (SI No. 281 of 2010) on 11 June 2010, Sections 52 and 53 of the Act will not apply to credit agreements entered into from that date, that fall within the scope of the Regulations. This is due to the dis-application of those sections by virtue of Regulation 4 of SI No. 281 of 2010.  Regulation 4(2) dis-applies Part V of the Act to credit agreements that fall within the scope of the SI.   Regulation 19 of SI No. 281 of 2010 sets out the requirements in relation to early repayment. </p></reply>

It should be noted that any corresponding data returned by PAYE taxpayers in the income tax return (Form 12) is not captured in the Revenue computer system.  However, any PAYE taxpayer with non-PAYE income greater than &euro;3,174 is required to complete an income tax return (Form 11).</p><p>  The estimated relief claimed has assumed tax forgone at the 41% rate for 2010 in the case of individuals and 12.5% in the case of companies.  The figures shown correspond to the maximum Exchequer cost in terms of income tax and corporation tax. </p><p>  Corresponding data cannot yet be provided for 2011 and 2012, as the tax returns for these years are either in the early stages of being filed or are not yet due.</p><p>  I would like to remind the Deputy that Finance Bill 2012 contained two measures related to property reliefs designed to reduce the ongoing cost of these schemes to the Exchequer and to eliminate it in as short a time as possible. </p><p>  With effect from 1 January 2012, a USC surcharge was introduced on all investors with annual gross incomes over &euro;100,000.  The surcharge applies at a rate of 5% on the amount of income sheltered by property reliefs in a given year and will be in addition to any normal USC payable on this income.  This USC surcharge applies to all investors with this level of gross income regardless of whether they invested in Section 23 type investments or accelerated capital allowance schemes.</p><p>  In addition, investors in accelerated capital allowance schemes will no longer be able to use any capital allowances beyond the tax life of the particular scheme where that tax life ends after 1 January 2015.  Where the tax life of a scheme has ended before 1 January 2015 no carry forward of allowances into 2015 will be allowed.  The delayed implementation of this measure is designed to give individuals time to adjust to the absence of the carry forward provision. </p><p>  There are now only two property based tax incentive schemes remaining in the tax code: the Mid-Shannon Corridor Tourism Infrastructure Investment scheme (only 80% of expenditure can qualify in certain areas) and the Qualifying Specialist Palliative Care Units scheme, which was not commenced.</p><p>  All other such schemes have been terminated, subject to transitional arrangements for certain schemes where projects were already in the pipeline.  However, due to their nature these reliefs continue to entail ongoing costs on the Exchequer in terms of tax foregone.</p></reply>

The strategy employed by Revenue to tackle this illicit trade is multi-faceted: it includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, development of analytics and detection technologies, and optimum deployment of resources at point of importation and inland, in order to intercept the contraband product and to prosecute those involved.  Interception at the point of importation is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages.  Revenue enforcement officers also target this illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.</p><p>  Revenue also carries out regular multi-agency operations, particularly in relation to large maritime importations.  Revenue both provides and receives intelligence from other Customs Administrations and works closely with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, in its efforts to tackle the illicit sale of tobacco at an international level.  This international cooperation and sharing of intelligence and expertise plays an important role in combating illegal tobacco smuggling on a global basis.</p><p>  In 2010 and 2011 seizures of cigarettes were, respectively, 178.4 million and 109.1 million.  Seizures of other tobacco products in those years were 3,367 kilograms (2010) and 11,158 kilograms (2011). Seizures to date in 2012 amount to 91.4 million cigarettes and 4,041 kilograms of tobacco.</p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that their office and the Tobacco Control Unit of the Department of Health commissioned surveys in 2009, 2010 and 2011 to establish the level of the illicit trade in tobacco.  The surveys for 2009 and 2010 estimated that 20% of cigarettes consumed in the State had not been taxed in this jurisdiction.  This figure was further broken down as 14% illicit product and 6% legally imported by passengers arriving into the State from other jurisdictions.  These findings were based on the 2006 Census population figures.  By applying the most up to date population data, the 2011 census population figures, which have recently become available, IPSOS MRBI have now revised the illicit percentages to 16% for 2009 and 15% for 2010.  The recently published results from the IPSOS MRBI survey for 2011 indicate that illicit consumption accounted for 15% of the market. </p><p>  The illegal trade in tobacco products is a serious threat to the Exchequer and to legitimate businesses and the Deputy can be assured that the Revenue Commissioners will continue their extensive work against smugglers and sellers of illicit products.  My Department will continue to liaise closely with Revenue on the matter.</p></reply>

The purpose of the report, which I requested, was to identify new possible structures to improve initial teacher education in Ireland so that it is comparable with the best in the world.</p><p>  The international panel of education experts recommended that teacher education be provided in six &quot;centres for teacher education&quot;.  Currently there are 19 state funded providers of ITE (and three non-state funded) offering more than 40 college programmes in primary and post-primary teaching.  The new collaborations recommended by the international panel will mean that a smaller number of centres for ITE exist, but that they offer education across multiple sectors from early childhood to primary, to post primary to adult education.  These centres for teacher education will also possess a critical mass in terms of research capacity which is not always possible in smaller institutions.  The new configurations will mean strong research bases can be created in each centre.</p><p>  The HEA has been requested to consult with the relevant parties and to prepare a detailed plan on how to implement the recommendations of the Panel. I understand that this process has started and a plan is expected by the end of the year.  I will fully consider the implementation plan from the HEA when received.</p></reply>

As you are probably aware, there is a specific commitment in the Programme for Government to address the very serious issue of homophobic bullying in schools and this is part of the working groups remit.  I invited stakeholders and all interested parties to submit their views for consideration by the Working Group. Over 60 submissions have been received. The outcomes and recommendations from the Forum, along with the submissions received from interested parties, are assisting the working group in its deliberations.</p><p>  The Group is chaired by a Principal Officer in my Department's Central Policy Unit and includes representatives from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Irish Second-Level Students' Union, GLEN (Gay and Lesbian Equality Network) and BeLonG To Youth Services. My Department's Inspectorate, School Governance Section and my office are also represented on the Group.</p><p>  Over the last few months, the Group has been consulting with a range of stakeholders and with colleagues in Scotland and the UK. The Group are working on an action plan recommending further measures that can be taken to effectively tackle bullying in schools. I expect the Group to submit the action plan to me by the end of November.</p></reply>

Some 66 grant awarding authorities were involved, all using a variety of application, assessment and payment processes.  Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) replaces all of these with a centralised, and on-line system of application. The centralisation of the service enables the introduction of service level improvements on an incremental basis, which heretofore was difficult given the number of agencies involved. An example of this is that all new student grants approved for this academic year will be paid by electronic funds transfer on a monthly basis directly to students' bank accounts, rather than by cheque to the relevant college. The introduction of the on-line application is an enormous improvement on the cumbersome paper-based application form that preceded it.  By introducing devices such as drop-down menus, compulsory fields and individual-relevant questions, it has ensured a much higher level of quality of completion at that part of the process.</p><p>  However, I understand from SUSI that what it could not have anticipated was the level of incorrect or incomplete supporting documentation subsequently submitted in support of applications.  This has created bottlenecks in the system which SUSI is currently dealing with. My Department is ensuring that it has the resources and personnel to do so. Payments to new students commenced on the 19th October and will continue on a weekly rolling basis as grants are approved and bank details are supplied online by the student to ensure that students receive their payments as soon as possible.</p><p>  A full review of the first year of operation of the grants system as operated by SUSI, a unit of City of Dublin VEC is planned in advance of the opening up of the application process for the 2013/14 academic year.</p></reply>

The HEA allocates this grant to institutions for free fees and core grant funding and other specific earmarked initiatives.  Institutions receive a grant in lieu of tuition fees for full time eligible EU students - based of certified returns from the institutions.</p><p>The HEA uses a Recurrent Grant Allocation Model (RGAM) to determine the amount of core funding (grant) provided to each University/Institute of Technology.  Core funding is allocated on a formulae basis using this model and the general principle is that core funding allocations should be fair, simple, transparent and applied consistently across HEI's.  Core funding allocated through the RGAM is based on price group-weighted student numbers. These include full-time and part-time, undergraduate and postgraduate students. Student numbers are weighted to reflect different subject areas as different subject areas have different costs. Some access and research metrics are also used.  Institutions are ultimately allocated a block grant, and the internal allocation of same is a matter for each institution as an autonomous body.</p><p>Details of the recurrent grant allocated to each

Core staff numbers were further reduced in 2011 bringing the total reduction against 2008 to c. 9% by end December 2011. (It is to be noted that over the same period, overall public sector numbers decreased by 7.2%). As further reductions are required in the sector in 2012, it is anticipated that total core staff numbers will have been reduced in total by a minimum of c. 10% by end December 2012.</p><p>  In the context of reducing staff numbers outlined above, full-time student numbers increased by 17,000 or 12%.between December2008 and December 2011 . Furthermore, institutions have continued to engage proactively with sectoral labour market initiatives e.g. Springboard.</p><p>  Some of the decrease in funding has been addressed through the internal reform of institutions; through mechanisms that have stimulated increased productivity, such as the Croke Park Agreement, and through institutions' diversification of their funding base to include income from philanthropic and commercial sources. Institutions are continually engaging in shared services and procurement initiatives to effect savings. The HEA has emphasised the need for all HEIs to review the full range of services they provide and their associated cost structures with a view to reducing or eliminating unnecessary or unsustainable costs particularly in the area of unnecessary programme duplication.</p></reply>

There has also been progress in increasing access specifically among young people aged 17 to-19 years of age. This has increased from 44% in 2004 to 50% according to the latest HEA estimates. This progress is due to better levels of retention and performance of students in second level, including those in schools being supported through the Department's DEIS programme.</p><p>  Work supporting the return to education by mature students has included the development of new part-time and flexible learning options under the Springboard initiative. Overall 16% of higher education provision in 2011-12 was on a part-time basis, a significant improvement from the outset of the National Access Plan, when it was just 7%.</p><p>  Support is also available through the Fund for Students with a Disability and the Student Assistance Fund. In 2011-12 the fund for students with disabilities provided funding for some 6,849 students. In 2010-11 over 8,301 students were supported from the Student Assistance Fund.</p><p>  Access has also been advanced through the broadening of routes of admission that act as alternatives or supplement the leaving certificate. Since 2009, a Higher Education Access Route (HEAR) for students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds and the Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) for those with a disability has operated successfully as part of the main CAO applications process. </p><p>  There has also been increased access to higher education by students with further education awards and/or who are mature students. 15% of entrants in 2011 were mature students aged 23 years of age or older, compared to 12% in 2008.</p></reply>

They will also have the option of being paid a pensionable allowance of &euro;1,592 for supervision and substitution which, in return for providing 12 additional hours per year over and above the existing requirement, will bring their starting salary to &euro;32,294. </p><p>  Teaching is one of the few areas within the public sector which does not face a moratorium on recruitment and opportunities for employment remain.

A review of the scheme is ongoing.</p><p>  Children with autism in mainstream classes are eligible to apply for home based tuition, but can, in limited circumstances participate in their school's programme if they can be accommodated within the school's existing autistic unit(s) and without incurring the need for additional resources. The number of classes providing the July extension should not exceed the number that is provided for by the school during the normal school year.</p><p>  I also advised the Deputy previously that the school to which he refers had proposed to facilitate eligible children from mainstream classes by establishing a separate class in the school for the month of July 2012. In view of the mitigating circumstances and the likely incommode to parents, these additional resources were approved to the school in question as an exceptional matter for 2012 only. The school was however, advised that going forward the school based programme would be restricted to children within the specific units/classes, within the school.</p></reply>

Work on this study will commence in late November 2012. The mid-term evaluation will review the programme performance to date to establish the progress which the Programme is making toward achieving the objectives as set out in the PEACE III Operational Programme.   The study will also draw conclusions on the programme&rsquo;s efficiency, effectiveness and impact and make recommendations for the direction and structure of  any potential PEACE IV Programme, taking into consideration the Europe 2020 objectives.</p><p>  My Department, and the Department of Finance and Personnel in Northern Ireland, have asked the SEUPB to begin the process of preparing programme proposals for the 2014-2020 round of EU programmes.  We have asked the  SEUPB to conduct this work on the assumption that there would be a successor programme for both PEACE and Interreg.</p><p>  I would stress that discussions on new EU programmes and funding are ongoing in Brussels in the context of the negotiation of the Multiannual Financial Framework and that final decisions have not yet been made.  The Irish Government remains committed to a new PEACE Programme, however.</p><p>  The programme preparation process has begun and SEUPB has organised consultation events across the eligible region.  There is additional opportunity to provide feedback to the  SEUPB by 20 November 2012.  Under the guidance of a programme development steering committee representing government departments, local representatives and social partners, the SEUPB will draft programme proposals and a further consultation period will then commence.</p><p>  The SEUPB will also be carrying out an ex-ante evaluation study for a PEACE IV (2014-2020) Programme. This study, which is a regulatory requirement, will be carried out in parallel with the drafting of the new PEACE IV programme.  This evaluation will ensure that the Operational Programme clearly articulates the intervention logic and the contribution of the programme to the Europe 2020 strategy.</p></reply>

No. 418/2011 - Finance (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order 2011, personal property and land vested in or held in trust by a body corporate immediately prior to its dissolution (other than personal property or land held by such body upon trust for another person) becomes property of the State in the person of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform until such time as the company is restored to the Register or the Minister waives (under Section 31 of the Act) the interest vested in him.  This mechanism acts as a fail-safe so that property is never ownerless.</p><p>  The interest acquired by the Minister is described as a defeasible interest as it may be defeated by restoration of the company.  Neither company nor property law require comprehensive and fully up-to-date asset records to be lodged with the Company Registration Office and the Property Registration Authority.  Consequently, the only persons with a complete view of the assets held by a company at the time of its dissolution are the directors and officers of the company.  As a result, the Minister only becomes aware that assets have vested in him by virtue of the State Property Act once he has been notified by an interested party.  Administration of matters relating to real estate is delegated to the Office of Public Works.</p><p>  The outcome of the situation described above is that the Minister/OPW can only become aware of properties that vest in the Minister when applicants write seeking a waiver in relation to a particular property and provide evidence of the properties vesting in the Minister. Even in such situations, information may only be made available on a particular property which may have vested in the Minister and information on further properties may not be made available.  Furthermore, even though a company may be dissolved, the properties held by the company may not necessarily vest in the Minister, for example, they could be held on trust.  Where no applications for waivers are received in relation to particular companies dissolving, no information is available on properties which could vest in the Minister.</p><p>  Section 31 of the State Property Act, 1954 permits the Minister to divest himself of property which devolved to the State under Section 28(2).  Upon receipt of an application, the Minister may waive the right of the State to such property as he thinks proper having regard to all the circumstances of the case.  In general, the Minister will waive his interest in any such property where it is established that the applicant has a moral or quasi-moral right to the property in question.  Where common interests apply, for example in the case of roads in housing estates, the Minister generally waives in favour of the relevant local authority.  Notwithstanding the power to waive, it must be remembered that the primary mechanism available to the directors and beneficial owners of a company to regain control of their property is to restore the company to the register.  In support of the legal policy underpinning the Companies Acts, the policy in relation to waivers is that the Minister does not waive in favour of the former directors of the dissolved company.</p><p>  Bearing all these matters in mind, a list setting out details on the lines requested by the Deputy is currently in preparation and will be forwarded to him by the Office of Public Works as soon as possible.</p></reply>

It is part of the Government&#8217;s modernisation of presenting information on how public money is spent, allocated and accounted for and is a natural development of the Performance Budgeting initiative that was rolled out to almost all Departments at the start of this year and published in the Estimates document in February. These initiatives set expenditure in the context of Departments&#8217; strategic goals, as set out in their Statements of Strategy, and present performance information, both in terms of actions and impacts, alongside the financial and human resources information that was already included in the Estimates.  Both the Performance Budgeting initiative and <i>Ireland Stat</i> meet the Programme for Government commitment for greater accountability and transparency and build performance information into the heart of the budgetary process.</p><p>  Furthermore, these initiatives represent a considerable streamlining of information and reporting of what Government Departments and Agencies are doing and achieving with public money. In particular, Performance Budgeting replaces the requirement to produce Annual Output Statements, a process that involved a degree of administrative burden on Departments and Offices as they had to reshape how information was presented in the Estimates to match the structure of their Statements of Strategy. There is now a single, coherent way of presenting the complex array of information that relates to each specific policy programme.</p><p>  As I have already noted, the development of <i>Ireland Stat</i> is very much part of my Department&#8217;s ongoing work on the Performance Budgeting initiative and I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the <i>Ireland Stat</i> initiative was in the main developed using the skills and knowledge of the officials in my Department. The technical aspects of the <i>Ireland Stat</i> development were managed in-house using internal Systems Development expertise. There are no staff allocated whole-time to running <i>Ireland Stat</i>: a small team from the Central Expenditure Evaluation Unit, part of the newly established Irish Government Economic &amp; Evaluation Service, were involved in the selection of the indicators and the overall website structure, as one element of their broader work programme, in close liaison with colleagues working on the overall programme of public sector reform. Their work has been informed by international best practice in this area. External consultancy services were retained for the specialist website design and the supporting graphics, for a total cost of just under &#8364;5,100.</p><p>  As <i>Ireland Stat</i> is at a pilot phase there is a public consultation under way and details regarding this consultation are available from the <i>Ireland Stat</i> website. Following a complete review of the pilot project a decision will be made as to whether or not <i>Ireland Stat</i> should be extended to encompass all strategic programmes. Should the decision be taken to extend the project across all programmes, then the work required to develop and sustain the website will be streamlined within the existing work of Departments.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-13a.569.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012111300067#WRM02200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 317 to 319, inclusive, together. </p><p>  The <i>End October Exchequer Statement</i>, which was published on 2 November and which is available on the Department of Finance website, shows that net voted capital expenditure at end October was &#8364;2,037m, which is &#8364;336 million or 14.2% behind the published profile.</p><p>  The actual roll-out of capital expenditure is a matter for individual line Departments and their agencies, operating within the annual allocations approved by Government and the delegated sanction arrangements issued by my Department.</p><p>  Information from Departments indicates that the bulk of their remaining capital budgets will be spent by year end and that the level of savings available will be small. This spending pattern is in line with trends from previous years which show that the bulk of capital expenditure takes place in the last quarter of the year.</p><p>  The potential for end year savings is dependent also on the decisions which will be taken shortly in relation to capital carryover. The capital carryover facility is an arrangement under which Departments are permitted to carryover unspent capital (up to 10% of their allocation) into the following year. This facility is an integral part of the rolling multi-annual capital system. The carryover facility means that moneys which would have been lost to the capital programmes and projects concerned under the annual system of allocating capital can now be made available for spending on programme priorities in the following year.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, capital spending has general characteristics which influence the allocation drawdown pattern. Expenditure on capital projects typically occurs in large tranches at fixed milestones, unlike current expenditure which is generally continuous throughout the year. Obviously, this affects the phasing and profiling of capital expenditure.</p><p>  It is important to note that the profiling of capital expenditure is carried out by individual Departments on the basis of the likely timing of payments related to capital projects and programmes which they deliver. Job creation is not a factor of the profiling exercise. However, job creation and labour intensity of individual projects are factors that are taken into account when deciding on the allocation of capital to Departments.</p></reply>

Current Government policy is to issue employment permits for the employment of non-EEA nationals for specific vacancies and in response to employer demand for strategic skills and labour shortages in designated occupations in key economic sectors such as health care, information technology and financial services.</p><p>  Ireland has to compete with other countries for migrant labour, particularly in respect of high-level skills. Skills required in the high-tech sectors are in demand and in short supply globally. While increasing the supply of high-level skills from domestic sources is the most sustainable way forward in the long term, in the short term, there continues to be a need to supplement Ireland&rsquo;s skills stock through employment permits and to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s employment permits system is geared towards attracting such skills.</p><p>  The Department of Justice and Equality is responsible for the implementation of policy in relation to the admission of non-EEA nationals to the State and their residence in the State.  However, the employment permit regime provides for control of Ireland&rsquo;s labour market as well as powers for enforcement of employment rights. Deputies will be only too aware that economic migrants are a vulnerable class of people. Therefore, any actions affecting inward economic migration should be cognisant of the need to ensure that such migrants are protected and made aware of their employment rights.</p><p>  The Employment Permits regime is supporting the enterprise sector and significant levels of applications are successful particularly those based on high skills levels. Figures indicate: a reduction in total applications in line with economic circumstances, but an increase in Green Card applications, in line with a greater emphasis on high value skills; and an increase in the proportion of applications in respect of ICT job roles with applications in respect of ICT job roles being more successful than the norm. Over 90% of ICT related applications are successful and over 1,000 ICT related applications have been approved so far this year.  My Department has reviewed its processes with a view to attracting more ICT related applications and is confident that significant improvements can be made shortly which will greatly enhance the employment permits regime, for example, in conjunction with Forf&aacute;s, a review is underway of the Green Card Employment Permit Scheme which is used by Ireland to meet labour market requirements where skills shortages have been identified by reference to analyses undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs. An interim review of the four core employment permit types - Green Cards, Intra-Company Transfers, Work Permits and Spousal/Dependents - is being conducted with a view to improving the throughput and quality of employment permit applications. Such an initiative would favour the ICT sector in particular as it would include a streamlining of the documentary process, a reduction in the time it takes for applicants to prepare a successful application, and a significant reduction in processing times.  Closer interactions are being cultivated with the Department of Justice and Equality with a view to providing a more coherent service across the employment permit regime and visa regime including policy convergence, greater information sharing and unified communications from both Departments in respect of labour market access.  I intend to announce a range of improvements in this regard shortly.</p><p>  It is also the Government&rsquo;s ambition that Ireland should take advantage of the opportunities for employment in the ICT sector and that every opportunity is afforded to our graduates and unemployed to prepare them with the skills required to work in that sector. Employment Permits are but one way of increasing the level of ICT skills available in the labour market. Building Ireland&rsquo;s ICT skills capability will require improving the domestic output of skilled ICT graduates and my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills has already put in place plans to establish an overarching target of doubling the annual output from honours degree ICT undergraduate programmes to 2,000 graduates by 2018.  These plans involve actions to: increase the domestic supply of honours degree graduates in the short term through expansion of conversion; and boost the longer term supply and quality of graduates from the higher education system.</p><p>  Finally, work is also proceeding with regard to the preparation of new employment permits legislation which will provide for more flexibility and targeted instruments in support of the economy&rsquo;s evolving skills needs. Heads of Bill were approved by Government last April and since then, my Department has been engaged with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel (OPC) in order to progress the drafting of the Bill.</p></reply>

The EU Framework Programmes have been an important element in the internationalisation of Irish research, offering Ireland's SMEs, multinationals, and research institutions valuable opportunities to participate in high-calibre research collaborations with our European counterparts.  FP7 is built largely around collaborative research (Cooperation) and mobility of researchers (People).  However, it also contains a number of innovative elements, the most important of which is &ldquo;Ideas&rdquo; which provides the funding for the European Research Council. </p><p>  In order for Ireland to extract the maximum benefit from the opportunities available within FP7, a National Support Network has been put in place, headed by a National Director for FP7 based in Enterprise Ireland who leads a team of national contact points for various elements of the Programme.  This support structure ensures that a coordinated and coherent approach is adopted towards FP7 across all of the Government Departments, agencies and other organisations involved.  Through this support structure, a mix of guidance, advice and financial assistance is available to encourage researchers and companies, large and small, to avail of the opportunities within the Programme. </p><p>  In the period from the beginning of 2007 when the Seventh Framework Programme began to June this year, the latest period for which data is available, almost 6,000 applicants from Irish based organisations took part in FP7 proposals requesting European funding.  Of these, almost 1400 applicants have been successful, giving an overall Irish success rate of over 23%.  Funding awards to Irish participants to date is &euro;438 million, covering a period of five and a half years.  </p><p>  Five areas account for 65% of the funding: Information &amp; Communication Technologies (&euro;89.5 million); Health (&euro;64 million); Marie Curie (Mobility Programme) (&euro;62 million); Nanoscience, Nanotechnology, Materials &amp; Production Processes (&euro;38 million); and European Research Council (&euro;34 million).</p><p>  Agrifood (&euro;28m), Research for the Benefit of SMEs (&euro;26m), Security (&euro;18m), Transport (&euro;17m), Energy (&euro;16.5m), Research Infrastructures (&euro;16.5m), Environment (&euro;14m), Science in Society (&euro;7.5m), Space (&euro;2.7m) and Socio-Economic Sciences &amp; Humanities (&euro;2.4m) follow, while other areas have resulted in funding of less than &euro;1 million per area to date. </p><p>  Based on recent national investment in research, Ireland is participating in the Framework Programme from a far stronger position than ever before.  A critical mass of research activity has developed in both the public and private sectors, and the design of FP7 suits the needs of Irish researchers in many ways.  It has been adapted to encourage industry participation, the application process has been simplified, industry-specific targets have been set and higher funding rates have been agreed.  The high level of activity of Irish researchers (academic and industry) and the Irish success rate ahead of the overall EU average are very positive indications of our strong participation in FP7.</p></reply>

That is why the Government has decided to implement an ambitious reform in the delivery of service to small and micro business.  This will include: Development of a new Small and Micro Business Division within Enterprise Ireland (EI) as a centre of excellence in the provision of supports to the small and micro enterprise sectors; Dissolution of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs), and the transfer of their functions, assets and liabilities to Enterprise Ireland (EI); Establishment of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) to provide a high quality, innovative, &#8220;one-stop-shop&#8221; support service for small businesses within Local Authorities, and providing early access to the services of national bodies; and Integration of key local authority business services into the Local Enterprise Office and promotion of a local environment in which enterprise can thrive.</p><p>  A high level Implementation Working Group (IWG) chaired by my Department is currently progressing the range of issues involved, including a focus on functions, structures and staffing, all of which will form the basis of a detailed and ambitious Service Level Agreement between Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities.  A project plan is also in preparation which will set out clear milestones and timelines for implementation.  I will shortly publish a Consultation Document seeking input from interested parties on the rollout of the new arrangements.</p><p>  Pending the introduction of these proposed new arrangements, micro-enterprises employing fewer than ten persons, in County Meath can, as their first port of call, continue to contact the Meath County Enterprise Board (CEB) on: </p><p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) continues to work with companies in County Meath to help them grow their business.  In 2011, approximately 4,300 people were employed on a full time basis in Enterprise Ireland client companies in Co. Meath and some &#8364;2.3m was paid to companies in the County for job creation and retention and business development purposes.  EI has to date, approved funding of over &#8364;1m in support of Community Enterprise Centres (CECs) in Navan, Kells and Trim.  In addition, EI Programmes such as the EnterpriseSTART Workshops, the &#8216;New Frontiers&#8217; Entrepreneur Development Programme and the &#8216;Get Export Ready&#8217; Programme are all available to businesses in Co. Meath.  Details of these Programmes can be found at Enterprise Ireland&#8217;s website </p><p>  To improve access to credit for entrepreneurs and micro-enterprises, and to facilitate the growth and expansion of viable businesses from all industry sectors which have been refused access to credit by banks, the Government recently established the Microfinance Loan Fund.  The Fund is open to entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs of all ages, across the country. </p><p>  Microfinance Ireland, (MFI), the company set up to operate the Fund, is  working closely with the CEBs and Enterprise Ireland and are very conscious of the particular difficulties entrepreneurs face with regard to credit history, previous business experience etc. and where they can assist entrepreneurs, they will do so.  However, the potential viability of the business proposal is the dominant factor in any credit decision made by Microfinance Ireland.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 also includes a number of specific measures aimed at supporting employment in the retail sector including: a renewed focus on prompt payments to business; an assessment of the potential for future development of the retail sector; the introduction of a Statutory Code of Practice for Grocery Goods; and the acceleration of the programme of revaluation of commercial premises which will provide a basis for the adjustment in commercial rates.  My officials and I meet with representatives of the retail sector to hear the challenges they face.  These engagements will assist us in implementing the above commitments in the Action Plan for Jobs and in identifying any further actions that can be taken to support the sector.</p></reply>

This is the forum in which overarching industrial relations matters are discussed in the Department.  It is composed of representatives of management and staff in the Department.  The Staff Side includes local representatives and trade union officials for all recognised staff representative bodies in the Department.  The Departmental Council is the internal monitoring body for the implementation of this Department&#8217;s commitments under the Public Service Agreement.</p><p>  In addition, updates on progress under the Public Service Agreement are periodically provided to the Department&#8217;s Partnership Committee.  The Partnership Committee is composed of management, trade union and staff representatives.</p><p>  Staff and union representatives can also put forward proposals for reform within the Departmental Council and the Partnership Committee. </p><p>  In addition the reform of the State&#8217;s Workplace Relations structures, announced by me in July 2011, provides significant opportunities for consultation, dialogue and input from staff.  The Reform Programme will deliver a two tier Workplace Relations structure by merging the activities of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), the Labour Relations Commission (LRC), the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) and the Labour Court into a new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).  The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court. </p><p>  The Workplace Relations Reform Programme Office was established in September 2011 in order to progress the Reform Programme and to date substantial progress has already been made with a number of important priority actions that were identified by the Minister having been successfully delivered within the target timescale. </p><p>  The Programme Office is conscious of the importance of effective communications with staff under what is a major change management initiative.  In this regard, the Programme Office has engaged extensively with all staff that has been affected by the Reform Programme including staff members that are serving in the lower grades of the public service.  A number of specific measures have been introduced in this regard, including: </p><p>Project Teams, comprising representation from all Workplace Relations Bodies, have been employed to progress all reform initiatives (Single Contact Portal, Website, Complaint Form and ERS).  Membership of these Teams is open to all grades. EAT, LRC, NERA, Labour Court and Equality Tribunal representatives on Project Teams are required to keep their respective staff (at all levels) apprised of developments under the Reform Programme.  </p><p>The Director of the Workplace Relations Reform and Liaison has held a number of briefing sessions directly with staff of the Bodies.  He also gave briefings to the Departmental Council and Partnership Committees of DJEI and the Partnership Committee of the Equality Tribunal.</p><p>The Programme Office is working directly with the relevant staff of the Workplace Relations Bodies as part of a major review of business processes.  Workshops have been held with staff to map existing processes and design future business processes.</p><p>Progress under the Reform Programme is posted to a dedicated content area on the DJEI Intranet and on NERAnet.</p><p>Public Consultation documents have been made available to staff in advance of publication.</p><p>Internal communication and collaboration tools and technology is employed to support the establishment of the new structures, keep staff of the Bodies up to date on progress under the Project and encourage and facilitate discussion on the reforms.</p><p>A Newsletter charting progress and developments generally is published by the Programme Office on </p><p>Staffing Requirements for the new WRC and Labour Court: It is important to put in place the right staffing levels and skills to support the operations and activities of the WRC and the Labour Court.  It will be 2014 before the reform is fully complete and the long-term staffing requirements of the WRC and the Labour Court are in place.</p><p>  The Department has recognised that it is very important to consult and work with staff and their representatives to provide as smooth a transition as possible through the process.  In this regard, a Consultation Paper entitled the Proposed Staffing of the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court was circulated to all staff in August, 2012.  Feedback on this document was facilitated by, among other means, a series of meetings during September and October with all the staff of the Workplace Relations Bodies.  The Consultation Paper was also circulated to the unions representing staff.  Taking into account any feedback received it is intended to produce a Structures and Staffing Plan for the new WRC and Labour Court in November, 2012.  The plan will be made available to the Workplace Relations Implementation Group and various stakeholders when finalised.</p><p>  As can be seen from the foregoing there has been extensive consultation with staff within the existing Workplace Relations Bodies in relation to the all aspects of the Reform programme.  The objective is to ensure maximum engagement with all staff as the reforms progress and to ensure that all staff, including those serving in the lower grades, have had the opportunity to make a meaningful and valuable input into the Reform Project.</p></reply>

Within this wide-ranging system, a general principle is applied that only one social welfare benefit should be payable at any one time.  This approach serves to maintain the equity of the social welfare system and, indeed, is common to social security systems across the world.  It is against that background that the payment of half-rate illness benefit and half-rate jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in addition to a widow/er&rsquo;s contributory pension was abolished for new applicants from the end of January 2012.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently approximately 89,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;436 million in 2012.</p><p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant.  Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs.  There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.</p><p>  However, rent supplement payments can, at the request of the tenant and with the agreement of the Department, be paid directly to the landlord.  If the Department were to introduce a system whereby all rent supplement payments were to be made directly to landlords the efficiency of the scheme would be significantly affected.  For example, the Department would potentially have to create a formal relationship with some 89,000 additional clients, the landlords.  This would involve greater complexity and significant resources to deal with a new set of third parties.  It would not be an effective use of resources to have departmental staff negotiating rental agreements for those with a short term need.</p><p>  It is open to the landlord to bring to the attention of the Department any instance where they suspect that a tenant is receiving rent supplement and is not paying their rent.  Where the Department becomes aware that a person is not using rent supplement to meet the accommodation costs, payment of the supplement is suspended and the matter investigated.</p><p>  Where a landlord has a grievance in relation to the non-payment of rent by a tenant, s/he may apply to the Private Residential Tenancies Board to have the dispute resolved through the Board&rsquo;s dispute resolution process. </p></reply>

This area is serviced by the new Intreo office at Kings Inns St and developments there have reduced the extent to which supplementary welfare allowance has been paid in cases where people have made applications for both jobseekers allowance and benefit.  This has reduced the compliance impact for clients and eliminated duplication that was previously a feature of the process.  Additionally it has allowed former community welfare officers become involved in the Intreo process, including in activation case management to enhance our clients&rsquo; employability and life chances.</p><p>   To further consolidate this we are moving to a system where a number of community welfare units will operate together out of one location, in this instance the Marino Health Centre.  This will allow us to offer an ongoing service with the equivalent availability to the public as the previous arrangements system and this will be kept under review to ensure that such availability is proportionate to our clients&rsquo; requirements.  </p><p>  The effect that this will have on local residents is that some clients will have to travel a longer distance to reach the Health Centre, and others a shorter distance but a more consistently-resourced service will be available at the consolidated location in Marino.</p><p>  This new service will be fully operational in Marino Health Centre from Tuesday 20th November 2012. </p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.

The rent limits for North and South Tipperary are set out in the following tabular statement. These limits were set after an analysis of the most up to date market data available.  Any price differential between North and South Tipperary was based on the analysis of their respective local rental markets.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 89,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;436 million for 2012.</p><p>  Rent supplement is calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent, has an income equal to the basic supplementary welfare allowance rate, less a specified weekly minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</p><p>  The &ldquo;top up&rdquo; payments referred to fall into two specific categories. Where a person has an additional income above the rate of supplementary welfare allowance they are, in certain circumstances, allowed to top up their rent as they will still have sufficient income to meet their basic needs after paying their rent.</p><p>  The second type of top up payment can occur where the application to the Department declares a rent lower than that actually being charged by the landlord. There has been no evidence presented to the Department showing widespread or systemic &lsquo;false declarations&rsquo; of rent supplement through the use of illegal top-ups. </p><p>  Any instance of false declarations should be reported to the relevant Department representatives who have specific legislative powers to deal with such offences. </p></reply>

To date 6,617 people have completed or are currently on work placements.  This figure includes supervisory/team leader positions.  As a new initiative, T&uacute;s continues to be monitored and developed and to date has proven to be effective in meeting its objective.  I have no proposals to alter the arrangements in place either for the selection of participants, the duration of their engagement or the eligibility requirements relating to the recruitment to supervisory or team leader position.  </p><p>  I consider the engagement of 12-months to be adequate to meet the objectives of the initiative and to provide these work placement opportunities to as many of those on the live register.  It is essential that we ensure that as many unemployed people as possible are able to benefit from this initiative and this would not be facilitated by extending the duration of existing placements.</p><p>  T&uacute;s is being delivered through the network of local development companies and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta (Implementing Bodies) and participants are identified by the Department using a random selection process. As directed by my Department, the Implementing Body must conduct an assessment of each participant&rsquo;s skills, work experience, level of education and needs.  Following profiling and interview, the Implementing Body identifies the type of work placement most suited to the participant&rsquo;s skills and needs and matches the participant to the available positions offered by the community, voluntary and not-for-profit sector locally.  The Implementing Body must ensure that the activity builds on the individual&rsquo;s capabilities and has the potential to move the participant towards employment.  Given the limitations of the placement providers, it is not always possible to get a suitable work placement match.</p><p>  Eligibility for both participants and supervisory/team leader positions on T&uacute;s is confined to those on the Live Register for at least 12 months and in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  These provisions are to ensure a targeted approach to those currently affected by long-term unemployment.  I consider the approach reasonable given the current employment environment.</p></reply>

The cost of this scheme has increased by over 160% since 2005 when 265,000 people were in receipt at a cost of &euro;82 million. The current fuel season commenced in October this year and will run for 26 weeks until April 2013.   The fuel allowance assists pensioners and householders on long-term social welfare payments with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the winter season. The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses. It is not intended to meet those costs in full.   In order to qualify for fuel allowance a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, satisfy a means test and be living alone or only with certain excepted people.  The purpose of these qualifying conditions is to ascertain the ability of applicant households to meet their normal heating requirements out of their own resources and to ensure the maximum amount of support is targeted at those most in need of assistance.  The nature of a means test means that there will always be a cut-off point above which a person will not qualify. I am satisfied that the current criteria for the scheme ensure that the resources are targeted at those who need them most. I have no plans at this time to restructure it in the manner proposed.</p></reply>

FIS is payable to the parent who is working or where both parents are working, to the parent with the higher employment income. </p><p>  In the case of parents who are separated, a parent who is wholly or mainly maintaining a former spouse and child(ren) can qualify for FIS.  However, only one FIS payment can be made in respect of any family. Furthermore, a person included in one particular family for any period for FIS purposes shall not be regarded as a member of any other family during that period. Current provisions do not therefore allow for FIS payment to be divided between parents and I have no immediate plans to amend the legislation in this regard.</p><p>  Where a question arises in determining the residence of a child for FIS purposes, an investigation of specific circumstances may be carried out and if the Deputy wishes to have a particular case considered, he can arrange to have it brought to the attention of my Department for consideration.</p></reply>

In the first case, where a social welfare claimant is in receipt of maintenance payments from a spouse/partner, housing costs incurred by the social welfare claimant (e.g. rent or mortgage payments and/or home improvement loan) up to a maximum of &euro;95.23 per week may be offset against the maintenance payment, with half the balance of the maintenance being assessed as means. These arrangements ensure that there is always an incentive to receive a maintenance payment.</p><p>  In the second case, where a social welfare claimant is paying maintenance to another person, whether on a voluntary basis or on foot of a Court order, their means for social welfare purposes are their means before they meet any obligations they may have to pay maintenance i.e. no account is taken of such payments in assessing the means of the maintenance payer. Thus, for example, in the event of the payer having income from employment or self-employment, the income from these sources is assessed without regard to any maintenance paid to another person. If maintenance payments were taken into account, any reduction in these means as a consequence of maintenance payments to another person would, in effect, result in the welfare system subsidizing or possibly fully meeting these payments. </p><p>  Where a person has maintenance obligations on foot of a Court order and they find that they can no longer afford to meet those obligations, for example because their circumstances have changed, it is open to that person to seek to have the Court review the order in light of their changed income position. </p></reply>

It is taking on average 25 weeks at present to process applications.  It should be noted that this is an average, with some claims being processed significantly quicker and other claims taking longer.  Including a number of additional temporary staff allocated to assist with backlog elimination, there are currently 32 staff plus supervisors engaged in the processing of new carer&#8217;s allowance claims.</p><p>  I acknowledge that the time taken to process carer&#8217;s allowance claims at present is not satisfactory but I am satisfied that the Department is taking appropriate action to resolve the situation.</p><p>  Carer&#8217;s allowance section has recently completed a major service delivery modernisation project to improve the efficiency with which it processes applications from clients for carer&#8217;s allowance.  The project involved the development of IT functionality and associated business process re-organisation.  Full deployment of the new system for Carer&#8217;s Allowance was completed in June 2012.</p><p>  Following the completion of the modernisation project, an in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project was completed for the carer&#8217;s allowance scheme.  This project focused on optimising output and customer service and the reduction of backlogs.  The outcome of the review is the division of work into two streams.  One concentrates on dealing with new claim intake and processes these without delay and the other on the backlog which is ring-fenced with a clear and targeted plan for its elimination.  Implementation of the plan commenced on Monday 3 September and will be closely monitored and managed to ensure it achieves its objectives.  A noted increase in the number of new claims processed was achieved in September and October, where claims processed substantially exceeded claim intake, and this increase continues into November.  However, it will take a number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.

It should be noted that this is an average time, with some applications being processed much quicker and some applications taking longer.  The corresponding average time taken to award applications in 2011 is not available as applications were being processed on two separate systems while the modernisation process was underway.  The average times taken to process applications in 2008, 2009 and 2010 were 15 weeks, 9 weeks and 8 weeks respectively.</p><p>  I acknowledge that the time taken to process carer&rsquo;s allowance claims at present is not satisfactory but I am satisfied that the Department is taking appropriate action to resolve the situation.</p><p>  Carer&rsquo;s allowance section has recently completed a major service delivery modernisation project to improve the efficiency with which it processes applications from clients for carer&rsquo;s allowance. The project involved the development of IT functionality and associated business process re-organisation.  Full deployment of the new system for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance was completed in June 2012.</p><p>  Following the completion of the modernisation project, an in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project was completed for the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme.  This project focused on optimising output and customer service and the reduction of backlogs. The outcome of the review is the division of work into two streams. One concentrates on dealing with new claim intake and processes these without delay and the other on the backlog which is ring-fenced with a clear and targeted plan for its elimination.  Implementation of the plan commenced on Monday 3 September and will be closely monitored and managed to ensure it achieves its objectives. A noted increase in the number of new claims processed was achieved in September and October, where claims processed substantially exceeded claim intake, and this increase continues into November.  However, it will take a number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level. The allocation of available resources to this task continues to be monitored in order that the backlog is eliminated in the shortest possible timeframe.</p></reply>

In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p><p>  In order to qualify for the payment the Department must be satisfied as to the person&rsquo;s income or potential income. All facts and evidence are taken into consideration and every case is fully investigated and a decision taken on the individual circumstances of the case. The customer does not need to stop self-employment in order to qualify for payment.  However if their self-employment has stopped, evidence of cessation may be requested. While claims are processed as quickly as possible, delays may occur where information or documentation is not furnished in a timely manner.</p></reply>

I informed the House that Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) had advised that options in respect of Reendonegan Lake are being reviewed.  This will involve discussions with the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), amongst others, as the lake was previously an inlet of the sea.</p><p>  In addition, following this consultation, any works proposed on the foreshore solution will require a licence from the appropriate Department.</p><p>  In assessing the appropriate long term solution for Reendonegan, there is an imperative to ensure that it is appropriately engineered and takes into consideration issues such as access for works, access for landowners in the long term, use of the lake, costs involved and sources of funding.  These processes and the consultation and licensing I have referred to cannot be prudently completed in a hasty manner and without very careful consideration.

This can be done through a number of mechanisms including statistical transfer and joint projects.</p><p>  I have met on several occasions over the past twelve months with the then UK Energy Minister Hendry and with Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed Davey.  The meetings covered a number of issues including the prospect for renewable electricity trading between the jurisdictions in the context of the framework provided by the Renewable Energy Directive.</p><p>  Exploring renewable trade was already agreed at a high level at the 2011 June British Irish Council summit and had been progressed in the interim at the British Irish Council working group level.</p><p>  In June this year at a meeting in London with Minister Hendry, both sides agreed to work towards concluding a Memorandum of Understanding around the end of the year which will be an important step in relation to the proposition of cross border renewable trade between the two jurisdictions.  This was further progressed at my most recent meeting with Secretary of State Ed Davey on 20 September following the official launch of the East West Interconnector.</p><p>  Increased interconnection between the two islands offers Irish developers the prospect of being able to access a much larger electricity market.  The electricity market in GB is around ten times the scale of the electricity market in Ireland.  In the short term there are opportunities for on and offshore wind and biomass projects, but in the medium to longer term as technologies mature and become commercially deployable, there will also be opportunities for wave and tidal developers.</p><p>  There are currently a number of potential project developers that have expressed interest in renewable export.  Several of these developers have met with me to indicate their interest in developing the business of renewable electricity exporters.  These developers have also underlined to me the need to progress the bilateral discussions with the UK.</p><p>  In developing the Memorandum of Understanding, officials from both sides are examining a range of issues around the electricity market, regulatory and technical grid areas to underpin the creation of cross jurisdictional renewable electricity trade.  We are working to develop the terms of such an agreement in a way which ensures a mutually beneficial arrangement with the UK and to ensure tangible economic benefits for Ireland.</p></reply>

The objectives of this further research are to:</p><p>- establish if shale gas exploration and extraction involving the use of the fracking technique can be carried out in a manner that will not cause significant environmental pollution.</p><p>- identify all possible environmental risks associated with the fracking technique and to ascertain if these risks are manageable and,</p><p>- identify best practice with respect to environmental protection for the use of the hydraulic fracturing technique for the exploration and extraction of shale gas.</p><p>  It is anticipated that following the engagement of the relevant experts, the study will take in excess of twelve months to complete, leading to a potential publication date in 2014. </p><p>  In February 2011, onshore petroleum licensing options were awarded to Tamboran Resources PTY Ltd (over parts of counties Cavan, Leitrim and Sligo); Lough Allen Natural Gas Company Ltd (over parts of counties Cavan, Leitrim, Roscommon and Sligo) and Enegi Oil plc (over parts of County Clare).  All three were granted for a two-year period commencing on 1st March 2011 and ending on 28th February 2013.  These Licensing Options are preliminary authorisations and the agreed work programmes allow the companies assess the petroleum potential of the acreage largely based on studies of existing data.  The only works authorised by my Department are the work programmes relating to these three Licensing Options.</p><p>  For information, Licensing Options are not exploration authorisations and no applications have been made to date proposing the use of hydraulic fracturing in exploration drilling.  As I previously stated the use of hydraulic fracturing in exploration drilling will not be authorised until there has been time to consider the second stage of the EPA research.  </p></reply>

Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date is liable to pay the Household Charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver. It is a matter for an owner of a residential property to determine liability. Liability for the Charge is not contingent on receipt of any form of invoice detailing the services provided to, or received by, a liable person.</p><p>  The Local Government Management Agency is administering the Household Charge system on a shared service/agency basis for all county and city councils. There was no existing comprehensive database of residential properties and their owners within the State prior to the Household Charge being introduced. The collection of the Household Charge via self-assessment declaration provides for the collation of such information in relation to residential property and will be an essential component for implementing a full local property tax. Local authorities are continuing to identify undeclared properties through appropriate data sharing provisions, and significant efforts have been expended in matching self-declared information with other datasets and in refining the resulting data.</p><p>  The Agency and local authorities will continue their work in maximising compliance with a charge which funds essential local services for communities. Non-compliance by liable owners means reduced resources for local authorities to use to support communities and places a greater burden on those owners who do pay the Charge.</p><p>  It is an offence to fail to declare a liability and also to fail to pay the Charge.</p></reply>

The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides that income from the Household Charge is to be paid into the Local Government Fund. The proceeds from the Household Charge are being re-distributed on an equalised basis to local authorities within the context of the annual allocations of General Purpose Grants.</p><p>  General Purpose Grants contribute towards meeting the reasonable cost to local authorities of providing services to their customers. Some &euro;651m in General Purpose Grants had been allocated to local authorities for 2012. It has been necessary for me to reduce General Purpose Grant funding to local authorities in the third quarter of this year in light of the level of compliance with the household charge.</p><p>  It is estimated that there are some 1.6 million residential properties potentially liable for the Household Charge. As such, if collected in full, the Household Charge has the potential to raise &euro;160 million annually. As of 9 November 2012 some &euro;109m had been collected nationally. A total of &euro;15,695,292 was withheld from the Quarter 3 General Purpose Grant payment. For county and city councils, this represented a reduction of between 1% and 3% of the total General Purpose Grant allocation for 2012. </p><p>  I am keeping the income generated from the Household Charge under constant review and those local authorities that achieve a collection rate of 65% or above will suffer no further reduction in their General Purpose Grant allocation for 2012. However, it is up to individual local authorities to address any potential funding shortfalls arising from non-compliance with the legislation and to pursue those who may have a liability and initiate court proceedings, where it is considered appropriate. Non-compliance by liable owners does, however, result in reduced resources for local authorities to support communities and this places a greater burden on those owners who do pay the Charge.</p><p>  I am confident that the level of General Purpose Grants, together with other Government grants and subsidies and income raised from local sources, is appropriate to meet the costs of providing a reasonable level of local authority services to communities.</p></reply>

However, Putting People First also recognises the importance of retaining the bottom-up approach, which characterises our local development model and focuses on targeting those most in need and facilitating meaningful community participation. I am satisfied that while the recommendations concerned will be challenging for all sectors, they will ultimately achieve the objective of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of services for citizens and communities.</p></reply>

The Household Charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge. Having done so, I consider that a liable owner has discharged his or her primary responsibilities under the Act.   </p><p>There was no existing comprehensive database of residential properties and their owners within the State prior to the Household Charge being introduced. The collection of the Household Charge via self-assessment declaration provides for the collation of such information in relation to residential property and will be an essential component for implementing the   Local Property Tax. Local authorities are continuing to identify undeclared properties through appropriate data sharing provisions, and significant efforts have been expended in matching self-declared information with other datasets and in refining the resulting data.   </p><p>I understand that the addresses and names used in the recent batch of letters which have been   issued by Local Authorities reminding people to pay the Household Charge have been based on a data matching exercise with the Property Registration Authority. </p><p>I also understand that every effort has been made to try and ensure letters are sent to current property owners. However there are some instances where letters are being sent to previous owners of properties, due to the fact that the more recent property owners may not have registered their property with the Authority or the transfer of the property has not been completed. Thus in some cases the information contained within these datasets may not reflect the most recent and relevant details. As a consequence, the data matching exercise can give rise to situations in which people may receive a letter where they have already paid the Charge. Due to differences in the formats of addresses between datasets, it has also been the case that some owners who have paid the Charge are receiving reminder letters.   </p><p>In other instances, letters have unfortunately been sent to deceased persons. I appreciate that receipt of such a letter may cause upset to relatives of a deceased person. However, in the absence of a comprehensive database, such instances, while regrettable, are also unavoidable if the Agency and local authorities are to continue their work in maximising compliance with a charge which funds essential local services for communities. </p><p>I understand that the letters which issued in recent weeks invite recipients who are not liable, or who have previously paid the household charge, or in the event of inaccuracy or error, to contact the Household Charge Bureau to allow the Agency to update their records accordingly.</p></reply>

The Committee includes representatives from the Irish Banking Federation, local authorities, the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, NAMA and the construction sector.

The types of works that have been approved to date under the PSI include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting and other works to secure sites. Under the PSI, my Department has made allocations totalling some &euro;3.549 million to 21 local authorities from the funding made available. A provision of &euro;2m has been made for 2012 by my Department and to date, a total of &euro;1.897 million has been drawn down by local authorities.   </p><p>The Public Safety Initiative provides funding only in instances where a developer has abandoned the development. As the developer in question in this instance has gone into liquidation, the responsibility for the maintenance and resolution of issues surrounding the development are matters for the liquidator and financial institutions involved, and my Department has no remit in this regard. However, my Department has been in contact with Clare County Council and I have been advised that proposals to finish off the development of Gleann Cora are at an advanced stage.   </p></reply>

A specific element of cost reduction in this context is the need to limit expenditure in respect of training and attendance at conferences. The Action Programme proposes that each local authority will, subject to maximum thresholds set in law, determine a limit on the overall training budget and that a specific proportion of this will, in turn, be ring-fenced in respect of individual councillors. The review, which will take into account the views of the Standards Commission, will be completed to provide for the revised payments for councillors elected in 2014, at the latest.</p></reply>

The two principal sources of revenue for the Local Government Fund are the proceeds of motor tax and the income from the Household Charge.  The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides that income from the household charge is to be paid into the Local Government Fund.  The proceeds from the household charge are being re-distributed on an equalised basis to local authorities within the context of the annual allocations of general purpose grants.</p><p>  General purpose grants contribute towards meeting the reasonable cost to local authorities of providing services to their customers.  Some &euro;651m in general purpose grants had been allocated to local authorities for 2012. It has been necessary for me to reduce general purpose grant funding to local authorities in the third quarter of this year in light of the level of compliance with the household charge.</p><p>  It is estimated that there are some 1.6 million residential properties potentially liable for the household charge.  As such, if collected in full, the household charge has the potential to raise &euro;160 million annually.  As of 9 November 2012 some &euro;109m had been collected nationally.  A total of &euro;15,695,292 was withheld from the Quarter 3 general purpose grant payment.  For county and city councils, this represented a reduction of between 1% and 3% of the total general purpose grant allocation for 2012.</p><p>  I am keeping the income generated from the Household Charge under constant review and those local authorities that achieve a collection rate of 65% or above will suffer no further reduction in their general purpose grant allocation for 2012.</p><p>  In line with previous years, it is my intention to inform local authorities of their 201 3 general purpose g rant allocations following the announcement of Budget 2013.  I will seek to contribute to the general purpose funding of local authorities to the maximum extent possible, having regard to the current pressures on the public finances and motor tax income.</p></reply>

The making of such bye laws is a matter for decision by individual local authorities , including town councils, and is a reserved function of the elected members under Section 199 (5) of the Act.</p></reply>

The ten day time frame is a guideline to ensure applications are lodged in a timely manner.</p><p>  In a case such as the one referred to by the Deputy, the Visa Office will always endeavour to facilitate, where possible, by expediting the processing of the visa.  In 2011, over 70% of visa applications processed by the visa office in London were done so within one week of receipt. In exceptional cases where a genuine urgency is demonstrated, visas can be issued in an even shorter period. In the case of persons who intend to travel regularly to Ireland, it is open to them to apply for a multiple entry visa.</p><p>  Another option available to the person concerned, should he meet the statutory requirements, is to make an application for naturalisation under section 15A  - naturalisation of spouses of Irish citizens - of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  My Department is constantly seeking ways in which the visa system can facilitate ease of movement for visitors and business travellers between the UK and Ireland, whilst maintaining the integrity of the Common Travel Area (CTA).</p><p>  In tandem with the Visa Waiver Programme, work is ongoing, through regular Common Travel Area Forum meetings between Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and the UK Home Office, on the development of a short stay Common Travel Area visa which would allow tourists and business visitors to travel to the CTA and freely move between Ireland and the UK. It is anticipated that such a visa will prove an attractive option for tourists and business visitors, particularly in the context of the island of Ireland by facilitating visitors to travel freely between Northern Ireland and Ireland without the need for a separate Irish or UK visa.</p></reply>

The strategy prioritises the building of partnerships with diverse communities.  The commitment of the Garda authorities in this regard is further illustrated by  the work of the Garda Racial and Intercultural office, (GRIDO). This office  has responsibility for coordinating, monitoring and giving advice on policing relating to Ireland's diverse communities and works closely with organisations that represent diverse communities.</p><p>  The services of The Garda Racial, Intercultural and Diversity Office (GRIDO) are available to any person who perceives a crime as racist. In such cases the GRIDO office will assist victims and investigating Garda&iacute; to ensure that the incident receives the appropriate attention. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has appointed 320 Ethnic Liaison Officers in every Garda district in the Country.  These ELOs are given specialist training to work with minority communities.  A list of ELOs appointed nationwide is available on the Garda website . The GRIDO also monitors crimes which have a racist motivation on a constant basis so as to ensure that all such crimes are properly recorded and investigated.  In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&#8217;s policy on the services and support provided to all victims of crime can be found in the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Victims Charter which was revised in 2010 and is available at .  The Charter states that in relation to victims of racist incidents An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will accurately record the incident, investigate the complaint and put victims in contact with the Garda Ethnic Liaison Officer in their area.</p><p>  I strongly support the efforts of the Garda&iacute; to engage with the diverse communities in our modern society. I am assured by the Garda authorities that all reports of racist incidents are fully investigated and I would encourage anyone who has concerns about such incidents to contact the Garda&iacute; directly.</p></reply>

The word "hatred" is defined as "hatred against a group of persons in the State or elsewhere on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the travelling community or sexual orientation". The State's prosecutorial authorities have not brought to my notice any difficulties in bringing prosecutions under the 1989 Act.</p><p>  In addition to the foregoing legislation, where criminal offences such as assault, criminal damage, or public order offences are committed with a racist motive, they are prosecuted as generic offences though the wider criminal law. The trial judge can take aggravating factors, including racial motivation, into account at sentencing.</p><p>  A review of the 1989 Act was concluded in December, 2008 with the publication of research entitled &quot;Combating Racism and Xenophobia through the Criminal Law&quot; by the Centre for Criminal Justice, University of Limerick.  The research was commissioned by the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism and the National Action Plan Against Racism steering group.</p><p>  The report made only one recommendation regarding the criminal law - the introduction of racially aggravated sentencing. It stated that changes in the criminal law would be insufficient by themselves to address racism. The authors commented that it was clearly established, at both the national and international level, that greater dividends would ensue from more substantial investment in social and education measures.</p><p>  The introduction of racially aggravated sentencing would involve a restructuring of penalties for basic criminal offences (assault or criminal damage, for example) to increase sentences, and have wider implications for the criminal law. There are numerous other factors which can be considered aggravating.</p><p>  In this jurisdiction, the legislature enacts criminal laws which usually provide for maximum penalties in the form of a fine or imprisonment, or both. In general, there are no statutory sentencing guidelines.  Within our legislative framework, the determination of penalty in any individual case is largely a matter for the trial judge, taking case law, including appealed cases, into account.  This allows the courts to take all the circumstances of the offence and all the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors into account.  The gravity of the offence, the facts surrounding the commission of the offence, the criminal record of the accused and the impact on the victim are among the critical factors taken into account before a sentence is imposed.  The judge must take into account the circumstances of the offence and the offender. Moreover, the Director of Public Prosecutions can appeal against the sentence imposed if she believes it to be unduly lenient.</p><p>  In all the circumstances, I have no plans, at present, for legislative initiatives in relation to hate crime. However, more generally, the Government is committed to a strategic review of penal policy. This review is underway and will include an examination of sentencing.</p></reply>

When complete, this assessment will be submitted to the Attorney General for her consideration. I am informed that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will not be in a position to outline his intentions as regards ratification of the Convention until this process is complete. </p><p>  My Department is working with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and others such as the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a view to implementing additional procedures for the employment of private domestic workers in diplomatic households. The purpose of the additional procedures are, taking account of international best practice, to provide for  employment terms and conditions for domestic workers in diplomatic households that demonstrate respect for Irish laws and good employment practice.</p><p>  With regard to the issue of forced labour, the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 which came into effect on 7 June 2008 criminalises the trafficking of persons for the purposes of labour exploitation. Section 1 of the 2008 Act defines labour exploitation in relation to a person (including a child) as follows: (a) subjecting the person to forced labour; (b) forcing him or her to render services to another, or (c) enslavement of the person or subjecting him or her to servitude or a similar condition or state.</p><p>  For the purposes of the Act, the term &quot;trafficks&quot; is broadly defined; for example, the commission of an offence does not require cross border movement or illegal entry into the State. It includes recruitment; taking a person into one's custody, care or charge; and providing the person with accommodation or employment. Officials in my Department will shortly be submitting to me a report providing an analysis of whether the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 is sufficient to cover all circumstances in which forced labour could occur and I will be considering this Report in the near future.</p><p>  I am informed by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation that, normally, an <i>au pair</i> arrangement is a private, voluntary arrangement between the parties concerned - a private household or sponsor family and a private individual &#8211; on the basis of a shared understanding.  Although circumstances can differ from case to case, an <i>&#8220;au pair&#8221;</i> is assumed not to be an employee because there is no contract of employment between the householder and the person in question.  If a contract of employment does exist then this places the arrangement on a different footing.  In general, where people have concerns that employees may be exploited or receiving less than their statutory entitlement the matter should be reported to the National Employment Rights Authority for investigation. A Code of Practice for Persons Employed in Other People&#8217;s Homes was developed by the Labour Relations Commission under the Industrial Relations Act 1990 and promulgated in 2007.  The Code sets out certain employment rights and practices for persons employed in other people&#8217;s homes and encourages good practice and compliance with the law in such employment situations.  In any proceedings before a court, or a workplace relations dispute resolution body, a code of practice shall be admissible in evidence and any provision of the code which appears to the court, body or officer concerned to be relevant to any question arising in the proceedings shall be taken into account in determining that question. In addition to this code of practice which applies specifically to live-in employees, it is important to note that domestic workers are protected by virtue of the fact that the full suite of employment rights legislation, including that of redress for violations of their employment rights, apply to domestic workers in the same way as they apply to other categories of employees in Ireland.  In addition, the National Employment Rights Authority has carried out a programme of inspections involving domestic workers as well as continuing to respond to any complaints it receives from domestic workers.</p></reply>

Ill health retirements can include those who retire following illness or injury on duty which gave rise to mental health issues such as anxiety or depression. In the same period a total of 429 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na retired. 1.17 % of those who retired did so on ill health grounds.</p><p>  There are a number of supports available to staff in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who suffer mental health issues. These supports include an Employee Assistance Service and also an Occupational Health Service.  When management become aware that a staff member is suffering from a mental health issue, that member is immediately referred to the Occupational Health Service (O.H.S.). It is the duty of the Chief Medical Officer to determine fitness for duty or otherwise. The O.H.S. will meet the staff member at the earliest opportunity and if necessary refer them to an independent specialist advisor, a panel of whom are retained to provide this service to the O.H.S.  In addition to this referral, local management must conduct a thorough investigation into the source of the members mental health issue and report this to Human Resource Management. This allows for a comprehensive approach to managing such ill health issues.</p></reply>

In particular, the Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) in the  Bill,  allows  for  the  settlement of secured debts, such as mortgage debt.  Section 100 of the Bill as passed by the D&aacute;il on 7 November  2012,  provides  for  the  treatment  of  the  principal private residence in a PIA.</p></reply>

Operation Fiacla is intelligence driven and specific burglary initiatives have been implemented in each Garda Region to target suspect offenders.  I am informed that as of 19 October, 2493 persons have been arrested and 1404 persons have been charged with burglary offences under Operation Fiacla.</p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also places great emphasis on the importance of community partnerships in preventing and detecting crime, and maintaining a safe environment for everyone.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to invest time and energy in these partnerships and relationships to the benefit of all.</p><p>  In this regard, during September the Garda Commissioner launched the second national public awareness week this year under the 'Garda Supporting Safer Communities Campaign'.

All options to avoid the need for personnel to relocate are being explored as part of this process.  Personnel are being offered the opportunity for reassignment within their current locations where this is feasible, together with opportunities for re-training and re-skilling.  In addition, a review system has been put in place whereby personnel who are unhappy with a proposed relocation can seek a review of a decision.  Inevitably, given the scale of the reorganisation, it will be necessary for some staff to move to new locations.  </p><p>  The creation of a new two Brigade structure for the Army under the reorganisation has resulted in Combat Support Units being reduced from nine units to six.  The Field Engineer companies based in McKee Barracks fall into this category, and the Headquarters element and Field Engineer Company are being relocated to Custume Barracks, Athlone.  Forty-five personnel from within the 2 Field Engineer Company will therefore have to move with their unit to Athlone, or be reassigned to alternative appointments available in other Units in the Dublin Area.  Pending the full rollout of the reorganisation plan it is not possible to say how many personnel can be facilitated though reassignment process.  However, there is no question of families being moved or being required to move arising from the reorganisation and this is a matter for each individual to decide.  The reality is that many Defence Forces personnel currently assigned to McKee barracks are not resident in Dublin and commute on a daily basis, which is a common feature across both the public and private sector of a modern, flexible and mobile working population in Ireland today.</p><p>  All members of the Defence Forces reassigned under the Defence Forces Reorganisation Plan 2012 are entitled to Change of Station Allowance in circumstances where they meet the qualifying criteria.  It is not possible at this point to estimate the total figure that will require to be paid in Change of Station allowance as this will be contingent on a number of factors including whether individuals will actually opt to physically relocate home or not. </p><p>  The Government is very much aware that the major re-organisation currently underway is a difficult process for many serving members of the Defence Forces and their families, who are being required to make decisions under the current reorganisation that they would not otherwise have to make, or in different times have had to consider.  Unfortunately, this is the consequence and reality of the reforms necessarily taking place across the public service today.  It must be reiterated that there is no painless way to fundamentally reorganise the Defence Forces whilst maintaining essential military capabilities and it has become necessary to mandatorily move some personnel whose units are being disestablished or relocated and who cannot be accommodated in their current location.</p></reply>

For checks involving animal identification and registration, the maximum advance notice permitted under EU regulations is 48 hours, provided the purpose of the inspection is not jeopardised.  For SMRs dealing with feed, food and animal welfare, no advance notice is permitted under governing EU regulations.</p><p>  As a general rule and following requests from the farming organisations, my Department tries to integrate inspections, including all of the cross compliance inspection elements, with a view to avoiding more than one visit to a farm.  This, however, has implications for the degree of flexibility available to my Department to give advance notice.  Nonetheless, in respect of those elements of an integrated inspection for which advance notice is possible, the farmer can request deferral of those particular elements to a separate inspection.</p></reply>

Agricultural land is defined as any area taken up by arable land, permanent pasture or permanent crops and which is used for an agricultural activity.  In addition an applicant must ensure that agricultural land is maintained in good agricultural and environmental condition. </p><p>  Farmers can keep grassland in good agricultural and environmental condition by conducting an agricultural activity on it such as grazing, harvesting forage crops, or by topping.  Grasslands continue to be eligible where it is evident that the stocking rate used by the applicant on the land is sufficient and, for example, can keep rushes under control and avoid their proliferation.  In such situations, the reality is that there may not be a necessity to cut rushes. </p><p>  Where a farmer cuts rushes as part of management practice, with the exception of certain designated lands, there are no restrictions on when this is done.  In terms of the conduct of inspections, my Department makes appropriate allowances for the effect of prevailing weather conditions in individual cases.</p></reply>

In carrying out these land eligibility inspections, Member States may make use of satellite imagery.  My Department makes use of such imagery to carry out a proportion of land eligibility inspections.</p><p>  When the available images do not permit a satisfactory verification of the land use or area of a parcel(s) applied for by an applicant, perhaps due to cloud cover, it is an EU requirement that a ground inspection must take place.  These inspections are generally limited to verifying the area of the particular parcel(s) where the position is unclear from the imagery available (unless 80% or more of the area was unclear).  The results obtained are used, in combination with the clear satellite imagery, to finalise the eligibility inspection of the entire areas declared.</p></reply>

The herd keeper is the natural or legal person responsible for tending to and keeping animals on a day to day basis, whether on a permanent or temporary basis. This is a non financial role and therefore it is not possible to make payments to herd keepers, unless they have also registered an interest as owner. </p><p>  Under the TB and Brucellosis Eradication Scheme, where payment of grants are likely to exceed &euro;10,000 in any 12 month period, a Tax Clearance Certificate must be provided in respect of all persons registered as having an interest in the role of herd owner during the period concerned before any payment can issue.  In the case in question, there was only one person registered as the herd owner at the time the animals were removed as reactors and since this person has been unable to provide a Tax Clearance Certificate, my Department is not in a position to issue the outstanding payments.  </p></reply>

The first finding of the disease  was confirmed on 12 October 2012 in County Leitrim.  My Department has been resolute in its efforts to stop the spread of this disease and to prevent further infection.  The consignment, made up of some 30,000 plants imported from continental Europe, was planted over 11 sites.  The ash trees at each of these 11 sites were cut and destroyed by burning without delay last month.  Symptoms were found initially on the site in Leitrim and then subsequently in a small number of trees in a site in Galway, two sites in Tipperary, a site in Meath and a site in Monaghan, all from this one infected batch.  This work was undertaken with the co-operation of forest owners and forestry contractors and supervised by Departmental Forestry Inspectors.  </p><p>  Voluntary measures agreed with forestry stakeholders, the nursery sector and hurley makers to prevent the importation of infected material from the continent has now been superseded by robust legislation.  This legislation, introduced simultaneously with Northern Ireland, makes it an offence to import plants from areas known to have <i>Chalara fraxinea. </i>  Furthermore, the movement of plants within the country are now also subject to plant passport requirements.  Legislation, was also signed into law, which control ash wood movement into Ireland, including firewood and hurley ash.  Under the legislation ash wood may enter the State if (1) it comes from an area free of the disease or (2) its free of outer round surface (including bark) or (3) its kiln dried below 20% moisture. </p><p>  In terms of future actions, site surveys of the ash estate are continuing this week.  These surveys on the health of our ash trees will focus on sites which are at most risk from infection.  These will include recently planted forests which used material imported ash plants from the continent.  Examinations of ash imported wood and planting material will also be increased to enforce recently enacted legislation.</p><p>  In relation to specific biosecurity measures to be observed where the disease is suspected or where ash surveys are being carried out the Department currently recommend the following hygiene measures.  In relation to footwear, it is recommended to wash off all soil and plant debris from boots.  Boots should then be sprayed with disinfectant and used water should be disposed of onto an area where the water will not run into a watercourse.  In relation to clothing, it is recommended to check all clothing and remove any plant material.  Soil and plant debris should be washed off all tools and equipment with disinfectant.</p><p>  Forest owners, forest nursery staff and members of the public have been asked by my Department to be vigilant for the disease and report with photographs if possible, any sites where there are concerns about unusual ill health in ash trees to the Forest Service. </p></reply>

The Committee comprise representatives of industry and processors and is chaired by the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation (IS&amp;WFPO).  The Department is not represented on the Committee nor is any other State agency.  However, the Marine Institute advises the Committee from time to time on scientific issues relating to the stock and was very involved with the Committee in the preparation of a Rebuilding Plan for the Stock which was accepted by the Minister and submitted to the EU Commission.  </p><p>  As part of the recovery plan for Celtic Sea Herring stock the CSHMAC recommended the establishment in 2006 of a restricted fishery for vessels under 50ft in overall length in the Dunmore East spawning area to assist with the provision of scientific information on the stock.  From 2007 to 2011, 8% of the overall Celtic Sea Herring quota was allotted to the fishery.  In the years to 2007 to 2010 an average of 25 vessels booked into the fishery, a number of which subsequently chose not to participate.  In 2011 this increased to 40 vessels and in 2012 the number booking in increased to 72 vessels.  Most of these vessels had never participated in the Sentinel Fishery before.</p><p>  As part of the revised Ministerial policy on Celtic Sea Herring announced in June 2012, the proportion of Herring quota allocated to the Sentinel was increased to 11% of the national quota, which is the maximum amount that the fishery can sustain, as advised by the Marine Institute.  At the same time, a whitefish and shellfish preclusion was introduced for participants for the duration of the fishery.</p><p>  As the maximum quota to this fishery is restricted by the scientific advice available, the possible quota allocations are greatly impacted of the number of vessels booking in.  The CSHMAC, having regard to the number of vessels booking-in and the amount of quota available, recommended a set of management arrangements agreed by all industry representatives on the committee for 2012.  I accepted these recommendations.</p><p>  In view of the changes to herring fisheries in 2012, I provided vessels booked into the fishery with the opportunity to book out of the fishery, without penalty, by Friday 9 November as the individual allocations available were known at the time.  The arrangements in place including the size categories of vessels for allocations, were recommended by the CSHMAC.  The Department brought the matter to the attention of the CSHMAC, who has advised the that tier categories are set out on a pilot basis for 2012 and the committee intends to propose changes to area of categorisation for 2013, including the issue of imperial Vs decimal vessel sizing.  </p><p>  Until I have an opportunity to examine the proposals from the CSHMAC and decide on clarifications, if any, to the current situation, the imperial measurement system will continue to apply.  It is important to point out that any changes introduced will be based on a full evaluation, taking account of the situation of all vessels and the proper and rational management of this fishery.  Accordingly, the possible impact of any changes on individual vessels can not be anticipated.</p></reply>

A fine following a conviction in the District Court will not exceed &euro;5,000 and forfeiture as specified in Section 28 (6).   Maximum fines on conviction on indictment are set in Tables 1 and 2 of Section 28 of the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006 including forfeiture as set out in Section 28(5) and in Section 44(b) of the Criminal Justice Act, 2007.  In terms of severity, subject to the maximum fines set out in the Act, the level of fines are determined by the Courts.   In relation to the fines set by the Courts, I have sent the request to the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority which is the responsible authority for the operation of sea fisheries control, for direct reply. </p></reply>

A second outbreak in an adjacent breeding flock was subsequently advised. We have been advised that both flocks have been depopulated. It has also been confirmed that there have been no imports of hatching eggs or day old chicks originating from the breeding flock.  This disease has never been recorded in the State. </p><p>  Fowl typhoid is specific to poultry and is not regarded as a zoonotic disease (it is not communicable to humans) or a food safety risk. Chickens are the most commonly affected species, but the disease can also infect turkeys, game birds, guinea fowls, sparrows, and pet birds.</p><p>  My Department has ongoing monitoring and contact with the relevant stakeholders in Northern Ireland, including officials in Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland.  Under the Poultry Health Programme, my Department tests all breeding flocks for fowl typhoid at movement and point of lay. In addition poultry for further production are tested prior to export. If fowl typhoid is suspected in a poultry farm that is approved for trade, approval will be suspended, and no further trade in poultry or hatching eggs originating from the farm can take place. Approval will be withdrawn if fowl typhoid is confirmed. It is obligatory to notify any suspicion of fowl typhoid to my Department.  An information leaflet on fowl typhoid has been posted to my Department&rsquo;s website and is available at www.agriculture.gov.ie.  This is in addition to the brochure on Biosecurity Information for Registered Poultry Flock Owners also on the website. The industry and all stakeholders are advised to take all appropriate biosecurity measures.  My Department is currently investigating whether manure from this farm has been used in this jurisdiction. </p></reply>

The number of social workers employed in the Children and Families Service area at the end of February 2011 was 1231.

Consequently the number of social workers assigned to the Children and Families Service area will continue to be subject to change as the mapping/classification of posts into care groups is further refined between now and year end.</p></reply>

The universal nature of this programme is critical for childhood development by providing every child with early learning and preparation for school. In this context the funding for the pre-school year was increased from &euro;163 million in 2011 to &euro;175.8 million in 2012 to cater for changing demographics.</p><p>  The objective of the ECCE programme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to eligible children in the year before they commence primary school. Services participating in the programme are required to promote age-appropriate activities and programmes within the S&iacute;olta framework for early learning. They are also encouraged to implement the Aistear curriculum which has been developed for children aged 0 to 6 years. </p><p>  The ECCE programme has been extremely successful to date with almost every pre-school service in the State involved in its delivery and approximately 66,000 eligible children participating.  Access to quality and affordable child care has a major impact on the lives of children, and this programme has been particularly important for those children who may be socially or economically disadvantaged and would not otherwise be in a position to avail of quality pre-school care and education. </p><p>  Future developments relating to early years care and education will, of course, be considered during preparation of the new National Early Years Strategy 2012.</p></reply>

The other two units are Gleann &Aacute;lainn (Cork) and Coovagh House (Limerick).  Special Care involves the detention of a child for his or her own welfare and protection in a Special Care Unit.  Special Care Units offer higher staff ratios, on-site education as well as specialised input such as psychology services.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-13a.1289.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012111300067#WRZ00500"><p>The Universal Service Directive requires Member States to "make every effort to ensure that citizens have access to a service operating a hotline to report cases of missing children. The hotline shall be available on the number 116 000."  The same Directive also requires Member States to "ensure that citizens are adequately informed of the existence and use of services provided under the 116 numbering range, in particular through initiatives specifically targeting persons travelling between Member States."  The hotline service will operate on two levels: the reporting of a missing child to the relevant authorities - in this case, the Garda - and the provision of emotional support to parents of missing children.  Under EU telecoms rules agreed in 2009, the 116000 number is reserved in all EU member states for a missing children hotline.  My Department established and is leading a cross-sectoral Project Team, including representatives of my own Department, the Department of Justice and Equality, ComReg and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to advance this matter.  Following cross-departmental consultation and an examination of the issues involved by the Project Team, ComReg, which has responsibility for the allocation of this number in Ireland, has now allocated the number to the ISPCC.</p><p>  It is important to note that the 116000 number is not an emergency number.  Emergency calls should always be directed to the 999/112 number in the first instance, where the relevant emergency responses, including the recently launched Garda Missing Children Amber Alert mechanism, may be activated.  The establishment of the 116000 line will however, be of valuable support and assistance to families of missing children and to missing children themselves.  In the interim the ISPCC has developed, with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, an interim response that is currently heard if one rings the 116000 number.  The number advises callers to report a missing child to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and if a child is calling for assistance, to contact the ISPCC.  It is essential that the hotline service is operated in accordance with all best practice standards.  In order to fulfil this, the ISPCC have advised that a phased implementation will be necessary.  They envisage that the number will become operational in December 2012 from 22:00-16:00, 7 days a week, and will be operating on a 24-hour basis by February 2013.  This will be considered a 'pilot' phase.  This will give the ISPCC the time to complete the necessary training, develop and implement formal relationships with statutory authorities, overcome technical troubleshooting and prepare a 116 000 service launch and awareness campaign.  It is intended that an official launch will take place on 25 May 2013, which is International Missing Children Day.  The service launch bears particular importance as it is crucial that the public understand this is a support service rather than an emergency service.  The service launch will comprise of a media and event launch, face to face outreaches by ISPCC service staff and promotional materials.</p></reply>

This programme requires that staff members acting as pre-school year leaders hold a child care qualification equivalent to FETAC Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland.  A higher capitation rate is available to sessional playschool services participating in the ECCE programme in which all child care workers have qualification levels above the minimum requirements for the programme.  In terms of our European counterparts, I would like to refer the Deputy to the EC Communication COM (2011)66 on Early Childhood Education and Care: Providing all our children with the best start for the world of tomorrow.  This Communication recognised that "while there has been progress in many Member States towards more professionalised and specialised staffing of ECEC, this starts from a low base in many countries and improving this situation will be an important part of any expansion of ECEC services".  This EC communication concluded by proposing "an agenda for work among Member States on key issues related to access and to quality, supported by actions by the Commission".  This agenda includes "Promoting the professionalisation of ECEC staff".  Ireland will participate fully in this EC agenda.  The issue of training and qualification standards is currently being considered in the context of the Early Years Strategy.</p></reply>

Following several attempts to get clarification from CARA in this regard, a delegation from the authority visited India in June 2012 to discuss various issues relating to intercountry adoption with the Indian authorities. The delegation met with representatives of CARA and with representatives of a number of diplomatic missions in India.  The authority sent me a report on this visit on 5 November last.

Some 600 organisations are funded each year.  These services aim to support people to deal with difficulties they are experiencing in their relationships, to help children whose lives have been affected by parental separation and to support families who have experienced the death of a family member.  Over 17,000 individual counselling sessions were delivered within Family Resource Centres in 2011.  Of these individual counselling sessions, over 4,000 concerned bereavement.  In 2011, the Family Support Agency provided funding of &euro;8,800 to the organisation in question under the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations for the provision of counselling services.  In addition, the Family Support Agency last year provided &euro;10,000 to the Irish Childhood Bereavement Network to fund a scoping study on the feasibility and necessity of a bereavement network.  I subsequently launched such a Network in July 2012.  The Network is a hub for those working with bereaved children, young people and their families and aims to improve access to bereavement information, allow for the sharing of expertise, knowledge and experience and improve the range and quality of bereavement support available to children, young people and, crucially, those caring for them.  In this respect it is very welcome.  The Network is being hosted for an initial period by the Irish Hospice Foundation.  It will be the subject of an interim review after two years and an evaluation after five years.  The organisation referred to by the Deputy was part of the Steering Committee which oversaw the development and completion of the scoping study on the establishment of the Irish Childhood Bereavement Network.  The Network is in the early stages of development and is currently inviting members, with a target of 70 members set for the first year.  I am advised by the Family Support Agency that it provides funding to many of the members of the Network and that any collaboration which improves efficiencies is to be welcomed.  Finally, the Deputy will wish to note that the Government has previously announced that the functions of the Family Support Agency will transfer to the new Child and Family Support Agency upon its establishment in 2013. </p></reply>

This is being achieved by staff and management, at all levels, working together to build an increasingly integrated public service which is leaner and more effective and focused more on the needs of the citizen.  As a Minister in a small Department, I am very aware that the commitment, skill and knowledge of the people working with me are critical assets and an integral part of the Department's resources.  As such, I am anxious to ensure that staff at all levels are fully engaged with delivering strategic objectives for the Department.  I understand the Deputy is particularly interested in staff engagement at clerical and executive officer level in contributing to the reform agenda.  I am happy to inform the Deputy that these grades were represented in the development of my Department's Statement of Strategy which will guide the Department in responding flexibly and innovatively to changing circumstances.  Staff at all levels are talented and committed.  It is through their efforts that ambitions for children and young people set out in this Strategy will be achieved.  The human resource policies in my Department allow for full staff engagement on matters involving them.  For example, clerical and executive staff are involved in the Business Planning process in their respective units across the Department where clear goals and performance indicators for the year ahead are developed and agreed.  A new Partnership Committee has recently been established which involves a continuous commitment by employees to identify improvements in quality and efficiency and an acceptance by management that employees are stakeholders with rights and interests to be considered in the context of major decisions affecting their work and employment.</p></reply>

This objective is realised through a range of Home Care supports, or other measures such as Day or Respite Care facilities. These services are core to not only supporting the preferred wishes of many vulnerable older people , but also can alleviate pressures elsewhere in the wider care system.  In addition, we also support access, as appropriate, to Long or Short-Term Residential Care. </p><p>  The demand for these services, which are often delivered in partnership with non-statutory agencies, will continue as the demographics, and the complex needs, of older people change. For example, at present, there are approximately 535,000  people over age 65 (11% of total population).  This is projected to rise to about 775,000 by 2021, 910,000 by 2026, and to around 1.4 million by 2041 (22% of the total population).  The number over age 85 is expected to quadruple from approximately 110,000 in 2006 to 444,000 by 2041.  The capacity of the Health Service Executive to provide approved levels of services for vulnerable older people is continually reviewed in the context of overall resources available at particular times. In this regard, 2012 has been a very challenging year for the health services generally, and the reality is that this will continue to be the position for the foreseeable future.</p><p>  It remains the case, however, that investment in this area is significant by any standard, as the HSE Service Plan 2012 provided in the region of &euro;1.4 billion overall for Services for Older People. This includes Long Term Residential Care, Home Care Supports and Day or Respite Care.  All measures are being taken by the HSE to ensure that as many people as possible continue to receive appropriate services, in line with assessed individual needs.  The position in relation to 2013, or beyond, is obviously subject to the annual Estimates process, in the light of evolving resources and services priorities for the health sector overall.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the difficult economic situation to be overcome, we intend to carry through insofar as possible the commitments relating to older people contained in the agreed Programme for Government.  These include a review of Fair Deal to consider, amongst other things, an extension of the scheme to community based services and to other sectors (Disability and Mental Health), together with its overall sustainability.  The review will be completed in 2013.  We will also complete the National Positive Ageing Strategy, so that older people are recognised, supported and enabled to live independent full lives. This measure will set the strategic tone for future years, across a number of Government Departments and agencies.</p><p>  The Department of Health reviews on a regular basis the projected future requirements for the health service, including policies and services relating to older people. This process also takes account of relevant external studies or reports, which often can make a constructive contribution on how we as a society might meet the changing requirements of older people across all of Ireland in future years. </p></reply>

This function is currently being carried out by the HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) which was established in 2005 on foot of a recommendation in <i>Reach Out</i> our National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention.  The role of the National Office is to oversee the implementation of <i>Reach Out</i> and to coordinate suicide prevention initiatives around the country.  Its work is centred around evidence based interventions.  The NOSP is advised and guided by an implementation group comprising individuals with considerable knowledge and expertise in the areas of suicide prevention, mental health promotion and bereavement support.</p><p>  In 2011, the total funding available nationally through the HSE for suicide prevention was about &#8364;9 million of which &#8364;4.1 million is administered by NOSP and is used to fund voluntary and statutory agencies delivering services in the area of prevention, intervention, postvention and research.  The remaining &#8364;5 million is available regionally to fund Resource Officers for Suicide Prevention, Self-Harm Liaison Nurses in Hospital Emergency Departments and local suicide prevention initiatives.  In 2012, an additional &#8364;3 million (part of the special allocation of &#8364;35m for mental health) has been made available to NOSP to introduce further suicide prevention initiatives<i>.</i></p><p>  It is widely accepted that suicide is a complex issue and that there are no easy or single interventions that will bring a guarantee of success.  International evidence shows that suicide prevention requires a collective, concerted effort from all groups in society.  Solutions, therefore, involve the whole community, a large array of voluntary organisations, specialist mental health professionals and mental healthcare provided by general practitioners and others in primary care.  The overall expenditure in time and resources in this area is significant and is under constant review.  I believe that a commitment to evidence based programmes and partnerships with a common purpose is what is required to address the issue of suicide and this role is being carried out at present by the existing National Office.</p></reply>

The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive service reforms and provide the maximum possible benefit to patients.</p><p>  To assist my Department in advising the Government on the formation of hospital groups, in June this year I appointed Professor John Higgins to chair a Strategic Board on the Establishment of Hospital Groups.  The Strategic Board is composed of representatives with both national and international expertise in health service delivery, governance and linkages with academic institutions.</p><p>  A Project Team was established to make recommendations on the composition of hospital groups, governance arrangements, current management frameworks and linkages to academic institutions for the consideration of the Strategic Board.  The consultation process to inform the project team has been rigorous and comprehensive.  It has included meetings with every acute hospital, including consultations on two separate occasions with each hospital in the South East region; it has involved the receipt of a significant volume of formal submissions from hospitals, clinicians, regulatory bodies and citizens, all of which have been considered.</p><p>  The organisation of hospital services nationally, regionally and locally will be informed by the on-going development of the HSE Clinical Programmes and by the Smaller Hospitals Framework, which defines the role of the smaller hospitals and  is intrinsically linked to the on-going work regarding the development of hospital groups.</p><p>  The work on hospital groups is not about downgrading hospitals.  It is about bringing together groups of hospitals into single cohesive entities to allow maximum flexibility in management, budgets and service delivery; it is about ensuring that hospital groups are broadly comparable in size and scope so that they can attract high-quality staff and trainees across all health care specialities and professions; it is about creating efficiencies by using common business processes and economies of scale and avoiding unnecessary duplication; most importantly of all, it is about maximising the range of services available to deliver internationally comparable quality care for patients, regardless of where they live.</p><p>  I am hopeful that I will receive the report of the Strategic Board on the Establishment of Hospital Groups later this month and that I will be able to bring this matter to my cabinet colleagues for decision shortly thereafter.  Finally, it should be remembered that the hospital groups are an interim, collaborative measure pending the legislation required to establish hospital trusts: before those trusts are established, the composition and functioning of the Groups will be reviewed and if changes prove necessary then they will be made with Government approval when the hospital trusts are being formed.</p></reply>

The HSE is overspent by &euro;374m to the end of September and on the basis of the latest information available, would have a deficit in the region of &euro;500m at the end of the year if current run rates prevail unless additional cost containment measures are undertaken.  There is intensive engagement between my Department and the Health Service Executive to address the excess expenditure.  In the short term, to address the 2012 position, I have instructed the Executive to impose cash limits on agency and overtime.  Furthermore, there will be more rigorous management of absenteeism, travel and subsistence will be limited, and stock management will be intensified in order to better manage cash.  My Department is also undertaking a number of measures to address the deficit, which include an acceleration in the collection of private health insurance income, savings from the agreements with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association and the Medical Defence Union.  Further initiatives include the use of capital to fund revenue on a once-off basis and the transfer of Department funds to the HSE on a once-off basis.  I have also instructed the HSE to review all pay and non-pay savings targets with a view to further targeting all areas which do not compromise patient safety.</p></reply>

They also reduce the dangers posed by discarded needles through the strong emphasis on the exchange of used supplies for new.  As well as the direct benefits of needle exchange services, they also bring injecting drug users into contact with health professionals thereby facilitating opportunities to avail of further treatment options. </p><p>  Needle exchange services are broadly available in the Dublin area through the HSE and voluntary sector organisations.

As minimum unit pricing is a mechanism of imposing a statutory floor in price levels for alcohol products that must be legally observed by retailers, its primary function would be thus to discourage at risk levels of alcohol consumption.  This recommendation - along with the others - are being actively considered as part of the development of concrete proposals on the basis of the National Substance Misuse Strategy report; and it is hoped to submit these to the Government for consideration and adoption as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The term of office of each of the fourteen members and the Chairperson of the Tribunal "shall be for a period as is specified by the Minister when appointing such member".  </p><p>  Ministerial appointments are made on the advice of the Attorney General.  The briefing fee, payable on a once-off basis when new members take up their respective appointments, is &euro;10,000.  This was reduced from &euro;17,526 in June, 2012.  The remuneration for members is approved by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  The Tribunal carries out judicial type functions and is therefore very different to a typical State Board.  It hears claims in relation to persons infected with Hepatitis C or HIV through the administration within the State of infected blood or blood products.  Claims are dealt with by the Tribunal by way of an in camera oral hearing before two members of the Tribunal and the Chairperson.  The Tribunal was set up in order that claimants could have their cases heard in a confidential, person centred, fashion.  The brief fee reflects the considerable work that each new member must undertake to familiarise themselves with the Tribunal process, the outcome of previous Tribunal hearings and precedents set to ensure a level of consistency among claims heard.</p></reply>

A second registration board, the Radiographers Registration Board, was established on 16th December, 2011 and its register is expected to be established in the near future.  Three further registration boards, the Dietitians Registration Board, the Occupational Therapists Registration Board, and the Speech and Language Therapists Registration Board have been established with effect from 1st November 2012.  It is also proposed to establish the Physiotherapists Registration Board either before the end of this year, or in early 2013.  All of the registration boards for the remaining designated professions should be established and their registers fully operational by 2015.  Under the provisions of the 2005 Act,  there is a two-year transitional period from the date on which the register of the members of that profession is established, during which existing practitioners may apply for registration. </p><p>  The Council which is an independent statutory body is responsible for setting the level of fees.  The e current fee structure is as follows: </p><p>A registration fee of  &euro;100 for new graduates, who have obtained recognised professional qualifications within two years of applying for registration;</p><p>An annual retention fee of &euro;295 for registrants, including those who paid the lower rate on graduation, is payable on the annual renewal date.</p><p>  Since the annual renewal fee of &euro;295 is subject to full tax relief it reduces to &euro;174 at the higher level of tax.</p><p>  All health regulators are self funding by way of annual fee income with operational costs being determined by the complexity and breadth of statutory functions specified in its legislation. e greater the registrant base the lower the annual fee charged.  Given the enormous registrant base in teaching and nursing, for example, the annual fee charged amounts to less than &euro;100 per annum.  Health regulators are single profession regulators whereas the HSCPC is charged with regulating twelve disparate professions, which can add significantly to operating costs. e twelve designated professions to be registered by the Council range in number from under 50 in the case of Clinical Biochemists to a high of 3,000 approximately for Medical Scientists and 5,550 for Social Care Workers, only amount to about 20,000 registrants in total across all professions. is an extremely low registrant base when compared to a registrant base of well in excess of 60,000 for nurses.</p><p>  The HSCPC is charged with extensive statutory functions under the 2005 Act, registration being only one, and the annual fee of &euro;295 being charged by the HSCPC is considered the minimum required to enable the Council to operate.  The fee charged by the HSCPC, which  is mindful of the requirement to become self funding by end 2015, is on a par with that charged by other health regulators and less than some in certain cases.  It is calculated approximately on the basis of the overall projected costs of the agency when fully operational divided by the total number of registrants and then further reduced to &euro;295 to take account of the Council's phased establishment.  The State is currently funding the HSCPC in its establishment phase (&euro;1.937 million in 2012) to offset the current shortfall in income from registration fees and will continue to do so on a reducing basis for the next 3 years.</p><p>  In response to concerns about the level of fee, the HSCPC has reviewed the regulatory structure to establish what scope exists for further reductions in registration fees and operational costs and has adopted the following measures:</p><p>Where an existing practitioner with the necessary experience and recognised professional qualifications, or equivalent, pays the registration fee of &euro;295 and is granted registration during the transitional period, also known as grandparenting,  the application fee will cover them for the remainder of the grandparenting period and one full year of retention of registration after expiration of grandparenting is concession will only apply to existing practitioners availing of the transitional provisions set out in the Act;</p><p>The Council has requested the HSE to put in place arrangements for the deduction of the registration fee from monthly salary thereby spreading the cost throughout the year;</p><p>Finally, the Council has proposed significant restructuring of the way in which the designated professions will be registered and regulated to provide a more cost-effective operating system is will require the enactment of primary legislation in due course.</p></reply>

Indeed, I am very much of the view that the new Directive will considerably strengthen the protection of animals still needed for such research and safety testing.  The Directive needs to be considered in its entirety to appreciate the full scope of the protections afforded to animals.  These include mandatory provisions that will minimise the number of animals used and require alternatives to be used wherever possible, while ensuring a level playing field for EU industry and enhancing the quality of research conducted in the EU.  The "Three Rs" principle of replacing, reducing, and refining animal testing is firmly anchored in the new legislation and I endorse this development.</p><p>  The new Directive will be transposed into Irish law during November and will become operational from 1 January 2013.  I would also like to advise the Deputy that the Irish Medicines Board is to be designated as the Competent Authority for Directive 2010/63/EU.  The transposing regulations will set out enforcement provisions, including penalties, that will apply when the provisions of the Directive are not complied with.  These penalties will be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.  I would, finally, like to draw the attention of Deputies to the comments of European Environment Commissioner Potocnik who has said that the European Union will, once the Directive is transposed, have the highest standards of experimental animal welfare in the world.</p></reply>

It is envisaged that there will be an urgent care centre or urgent care centres based on consideration of the geographical distribution of attendances and acuity of the patient. The location and number of such centres will be given careful consideration and this will be done urgently to reach a decision as soon possible.</p></reply>

In order to develop the Action Plan arising from the ORP Review, working groups composed of staff from all grades were established to ensure that decisions to address organisational issues were informed by input across all grades.  In turn my Department's Action Plan under the Public Service Agreement drew very significantly on the cross-grade input already made to our ORP Review.</p><p>  A new Partnership Committee was established in 2011 and its role is to actively contribute to the running of the Department through facilitation of effective communication at all levels in the Department.  It facilitates the sharing of ideas in relation to many issues of concern to staff.  Staff at all levels are encouraged to contact the Committee with any issues that can be dealt with by the Partnership process.    The Partnership Committee is currently considering the re-establishment of a Staff Suggestion Scheme to provide a further opportunity for staff to contribute to Departmental reform and other relevant issues.</p><p>  In addition to the above my Department engages with the Departmental Council, which includes representatives of all relevant trade unions, on a regular basis on all matters relating to the reform of the Department.</p></reply>

Countries which are recognised for having a quality B&amp;B product, such as England, Scotland, Wales, France and New Zealand, do not require mandatory registration.  </p><p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has been working in recent years with the sector on the establishment of a voluntary classification and categorisation system, supported by a new brand that,over time,should be readily identifiable to domestic and international tourists, allowing them to choose an establishment that meets their individual expectations in terms of facilities and standards. </p><p>  It is F&aacute;ilte Ireland's view that the best approach to support the development of the sector is to ensure that voluntarily listed and approved B&amp;Bs have advantages over those who choose not to carry F&aacute;ilte Ireland accreditation.  In this regard,it is important to point out that unapproved unlisted operators are obliged to comply in the same way as the approved listed sector with requirements in the area of taxation, planning, fire and safety and hygiene. On the other hand, they do not have access to official marketing through Discover Ireland and the Tourist Information Offices, nor do they have access to the various training and business skills initiatives that are available to the approved sector.</p></reply>

Of these, 37 are directly related to existing actions incorporated in the Department&rsquo;s Public Service Agreement Action plan, for example: </p><p>  -the review and streamlining of the PQ process.</p><p>  -Shared services i.e. payroll, HR &amp; ICT functions between Department and agencies and reducing resources in central divisions as shared services come on-board.</p><p>  -Review of overtime costs, making better use of IT and systematic reviews of salary allowances etc. to identify efficiencies and restructure work to reduce costs.</p><p>  The remainder of the suggestions made practical proposals for specific implementation measures by Divisions within the Department. The Department has in place a dedicated subgroup of the Department Council Forum who meet on a quarterly basis to discuss and propose updates to the Public Service Agreement Action Plan.  </p><p>  In addition, in late 2011 a staff attitudinal survey was conducted from which the results and an implementation plan for the key recommendations were submitted to the Department's Management Board in March 2012.   The ongoing implementation of these recommendations is monitored by the Department's Partnership Committee, which includes representatives of all staff levels in the Department.</p></reply>
