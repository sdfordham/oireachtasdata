Following the commencement of the remaining provisions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Policing Services and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 and related Regulations on 1 January 2017, this power of appointment formally vested in the Authority.</p>  <p>  On 25 January 2017, the Authority advertised a competition for appointment to the rank of Assistant Commissioner in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The competition proceeded in accordance with the governing Regulations and the Authority&rsquo;s &ldquo;Statement of Practice for the Conduct of a Selection Competition for Appointment to the Rank of Assistant Commissioner in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rdquo;.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that a key element of the process was the establishment by the Authority of a selection board which included an external Chair.  Following short-listing of candidates, preliminary interviews and a final competitive interview the Authority established a panel of five candidates for appointment in the order of merit determined by the selection board.  The person placed first on the panel was appointed at the meeting of the Authority on 23 March 2017. </p>  <p>  Clearly, this is a new beginning as it represents the first time that there has been an appointment to the senior ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by a statutorily independent body.  It was also the first time that appointment to Assistant Commissioner was open to the ranks of Inspector, Superintendent and Chief Superintendent in both the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  I am delighted that the major change in the system of promotions to these ranks envisaged when the Authority was being established has now come to fruition.  I would like to congratulate the Authority and its staff on the successful organisation of the selection competition.  The Authority is currently conducting a competition for appointment to the Chief Superintendent rank.</p></reply>

The declaration seeks to reduce migratory flows and disrupt smuggling networks along the Central Mediterranean route by working with the main country of departure, Libya.  The European Union (EU) will seek to, <i>inter alia, </i>build capacity for the Libyan coast guard and relevant agencies, disrupt smuggling rings, support local development in Libya, ensure adequate reception centres in Libya, support the International Organisation for Migration in stepping up voluntary returns, and enhancing outreach to migrants in Libya.</p><p>A principal objective of the Malta Declaration is the stabilisation of Libya.  The EU Trust Fund for Africa is the main funding mechanism the EU is using to support stabilisation in Libya, and I understand an additional &euro;200 million has been made available in 2017 to give priority to migration-related projects concerning Libya.  </p><p>As to the restrictions on consideration of Irish visa applications from residents of Libya, these were put in place in August, 2014 due to the political and security situation in Libya.  In doing so, all relevant considerations including the ongoing security situation in Libya and the potential economic impact of the restrictions were taken into account.  There is provision for a small number of exceptions to the extent indeed that 109 visas were granted to Libyan nationals in 2016, and 96 in the previous year.  As with any visa application, each application is assessed individually based on its own merits and having regard to all the information put forward for consideration.</p><p>The position has been kept under review by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department.  Ultimately, an appropriate balance must be struck between State security and individual applicants who wish to come here.  I have asked my officials to look again at the restrictions in place to consider if there may be some scope to extend the categories of applicants who may be considered for visa processing.</p></reply>

That report was chaired by then Senator Martin McAleese and it is commonly referred to as the McAleese report.  The material in the Report relates to 10 different institutions which were run by 4 different Orders of nuns over a period of 70 years.  The religious congregations involved gave full access to the Inter Departmental Committee and its report provides a wealth of information, in anonymised form, for those interested in research .  </p>  <p>  The McAleese report specifically states that it was agreed that the most appropriate course of action would be that the archive of the Committee&rsquo;s work would be deposited with An Taoiseach and that is where the archive is held.  The records provided by the religious congregations concerned were returned to them and are not part of the State archive.</p>  <p>  The records held in the State archive and by the religious congregations contain very sensitive personal data.  In relation to the records held by the religious congregations, I am informed that a person who had been in the Magdalen Laundry concerned will be given access to their own records.  As regards general access, that is a matter for the congregations themselves subject to the Data Protection Acts.  In relation to the State archive there are no plans to make it available publicly at this time and, at all events, the records are subject to the Data Protection Acts.</p></reply>

The budget assigned to the Board for the use of private solicitors where necessary has also been increased.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Legal Aid Board that three of the board's law centres - Smithfield, Dublin 7; Seville House, Galway; and Popes Quay in Cork - are directly involved in protection cases and a number of additional staff have been assigned to those offices.  Another office, the Refugee Documentation Centre, provides information services to all of the bodies involved in international protection cases.  While it is not the practice to name individual staff, I understand that staffing levels in these offices has increased from 64.3 FTEs in December 2015 to 76.6 FTEs at the present time and the board plans to recruit two additional staff for Smithfield in the near future.  They are also considering the need for additional solicitors.  The Deputy will appreciate that each law centre undertakes a range of civil legal aid work in addition to the international protection work and I am assured by the Board that these arrangements are proving sufficient at present but the matter is kept under ongoing review.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-30a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017033000054#WRA01800"><p>I refer the Deputy to my response to her Question No. 62 of Thursday, 16 February in which I explained Ireland's obligations under the Geneva Convention.  Persons who claim protection in the State will have their application fully considered under the International Protection Act 2015 which gives effect to the State's obligations under the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.  Ireland, of course, has no role in the US policy or procedures for dealing with persons who seek asylum from the US authorities.  This is solely a matter for the US authorities.  </p>  <p>  I assume the Deputy raises the matter in the context of the US preclearance arrangements that exist at Dublin and Shannon airports.  The matter has been examined by a cross Departmental group consisting of the Departments of Transport, Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Justice &amp;amp; Equality.  The group had access to legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General.  </p>  <p>  The preclearance arrangements are set out in the Aviation (Preclearance) Act 2009.  Specifically, Section 12 of the Act provides that a person who is refused preclearance to travel onwards to the United States, shall be deemed for the purpose of the Aliens Act 1935 and the Immigration Act 2004, to have arrived at the frontier of the State.  In many cases, the persons are Irish citizens or EU nationals subject to Free Movement and once this is established they are not subject to any further immigration requirements. </p>  <p>  In circumstances where a person is refused leave to board a US bound flight, he or she is reverted to the Garda immigration authorities and the case is considered by Garda immigration officers in the same manner as if they had presented at the frontier of the State seeking permission to enter the State.  For those subject to immigration controls under the Immigration Act 2004, as is normal in these cases, each case is examined on its individual merits to determine if the person is to be given permission to enter the State.  Accordingly, the provisions of the Geneva Convention in respect of such persons are considered under Irish law by Irish immigration officers.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-30a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017033000054#WRA02100"><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. </p><p>This plan is well on course to be achieved.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p><p>I am advised that, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, there has been a total intake of some 1,400 new recruits with another 600 scheduled to enter the College by the end of this year.  I am informed by the Commissioner that some 839 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide,<b></b>45<b></b>of whom have been assigned to the Kildare Division.  I am also informed that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - a net increase of 700 in the total Garda strength since recruitment recommenced. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Kildare Division in the coming years.</p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.</p><p>For ease of reference I have provided, for the record, a breakdown of the detailed information requested in relation the number of newly attested Garda allocated to the Kildare Division, since the first attestation of trainee Garda in April 2015 and the number of Garda assigned to the Kildare Division on 30 September 2014 and 28 February 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available.  <table><tr><th></th><th>Personnel Strength</th><th>Number of newly attested Garda</th></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>301</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>312</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>316</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>326</td><td>10</td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-30a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017033000054#WRA02400"><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the Garda Commissioner is primarily responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources available to her, including in relation to Garda stations.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na District and Station Rationalisation Programme gave rise to the closure in 2012 and 2013 of some 139 Garda stations, including Leighlinbridge in Carlow and Ballyragget, Inistioge and Johnstown in Kilkenny, following the completion by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of a comprehensive review of its district and station network.  That review was undertaken with the objective of identifying opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation.  I have been advised by the Garda authorities that the closures have allowed front line Garda to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility and in a more focused fashion, particularly with regard to targeted police operations. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits the Government to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  A cornerstone of this commitment is the Government plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  Revisiting the decisions made to close Garda stations is also part of that commitment. </p>  <p>  In this context, I have requested the Garda Commissioner, while fully cognisant of her statutory functions, to identify 6 stations for reopening on a pilot basis to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order.  The pilot will feed into the wider review being undertaken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, at the request of the Policing Authority, of the dispersal and use of resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the delivery of policing services to local communities.</p>  <p>  I understand that work is continuing in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to identify the 6 stations for inclusion in the pilot and that consultations have taken place with relevant stakeholders, including the Policing Authority.  In this context, I am sure that the Deputy would agree that a comprehensive and evidenced-based analysis should be carried out, taking account of all the relevant factors, before a final decision is made in respect of the stations to be reopened by the Commissioner.</p>  <p>  I expect to receive a report from the Commissioner by the end of May in connection with the exercise.</p></reply>

As such, it is critical that there is public confidence in the operation and oversight of these vital enforcement systems. </p>  <p>  I acknowledge the extensive audits that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has carried out since these issues came to their attention and the fact that solutions are now in place and are being closely monitored at the highest levels within the organisation.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner has given me her personal commitment that all necessary steps will be taken to ensure that these errors cannot reoccur.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that in addition to outlining the issues, how they had come to light, and the remedial steps taken so far, at her press conference on 27 March 2017, the Commissioner:</p>  <p> - announced the restructuring of traffic policing with the creation of a new Roads Policing Unit to be led by Assistant Commissioner Mick Finn; </p>  <p> - announced the creation of a dedicated team under newly-appointed Assistant Commissioner Michael O&rsquo;Sullivan to investigate in detail the MATs issue, including with a view to identifying and holding responsible for their actions any Garda members, whether at junior, supervisory or management level, who acted improperly; and</p>  <p> - committed to forwarding the report of this investigation to the Policing Authority and Department of Justice and Equality when completed.  </p>  <p>  Assistant Commissioner Finn outlined new arrangements agreed this week with the Medical Bureau on Roads Safety to the effect that body would supply An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with its data on breath-testing devices on a quarterly basis, in order to ensure an independent benchmark against which Garda data can be measured.  The MBRS will shortly be tendering for new breath testing equipment.  New equipment which is available in the market place has the capacity to record the time, GPS location and number of persons breath-tested, and has the capacity to download the information automatically reducing the chances of errors occurring in the data.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding any internal review the Government believes that an external investigation into these two specific matters needs be carried out.</p>  <p>  The Government believes the level of public concern is now so profound that it may now be time to conduct a thorough, comprehensive and independent root-and-branch review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is clearly a proposal that will require further detailed consideration by the Government.</p>  <p>  The Government also believes that any such proposal should command widespread support in the Oireachtas and accordingly be the subject of consultation with the Opposition, and ultimately approval by the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  I have also met with the Chairperson of the Policing Authority in recent days in relation to these road traffic enforcement issues and I welcome the fact that the focus of the Authority's next public meeting with the Garda Commissioner will be on road traffic enforcement.  This public meeting will be held on 27 April 2017 and will provide a most timely opportunity for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to engage with the Authority and the general public on these key procedural and practice issues that are now before us.  The reason that I prioritised and set up the Authority was to shine a light on and examine issues such as these.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner has been in direct contact with the Policing Authority in relation to the matters referred to in the Deputy's question and the Chairperson of the Policing Authority, Josephine Feehily, has confirmed that the Authority will carefully examine these issues.</p>  <p>  I have emphasised to the Garda Commissioner that these practices that allowed breath test misreporting and FCN errors to happen within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over many years have impacted negatively on public confidence and the new systems that have been established in response must be robust in order that public confidence can begin to be rebuilt. </p>  <p>  I am confident that senior management in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is taking all necessary steps insofar as these critical matters are concerned and I will continue to maintain close contact with the Garda Commissioner and the Chairperson of the Policing Authority in relation to these matters.</p></reply>

The courthouse in Trim was refurbished in 2001 at a capital cost of &euro;7.6 million.  Video technology has recently been introduced in Trim courthouse which will facilitate video conferencing between the courthouse and prisons with a view to reducing the number of prisoners physically being brought to Court.  The courthouse facility in Navan is a leased premises to provide a temporary solution to accommodate court sittings in Navan.  In the longer term the requirement for a modern court complex in Navan is recognised and the Courts Service is currently actively pursuing options to source a suitable site for a courthouse in the town.</p>  <p>  In relation to County Louth, court sittings in the county are provided from three court venues, Dundalk, Drogheda and Ardee.  The courthouse in Dundalk was refurbished in 2003 at a capital investment of &euro;10.3 million.  As the Deputy will be aware, a new courthouse is currently under construction in Drogheda as part of a Public Private Partnership Bundle of seven courthouses in various locations nationwide.  Delivery of this courthouse is expected in April/May 2017 and, once available, it should address any capacity concerns.  The new courthouse is a two courtroom venue which will facilitate both Circuit and District Court business. </p>  <p>  As a matter of policy, on completion of any major refurbishment/construction project, I understand that the Courts Service undertakes a review of the delivery of court services with a view to ensuring the delivery of best possible services to court users while maximising the value of investment in such facilities.</p></reply>

Specifically, I have been assured by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that a permanent and comprehensive IT solution is now in place to cover the majority of issues identified and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is satisfied that the errors that occurred cannot be repeated. </p>  <p>  Insofar as the 14,700 people incorrectly convicted of road traffic offences in court are concerned, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is establishing a dedicated support helpline for members of the public with queries in relation to their case.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also writing to all affected members of the public, explaining what has happened and outlining the solution to rectify the situation.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has indicated that it has been advised by the Director of Public Prosecutions and Courts Service that these 14,700 cases must be brought back before the Courts at Circuit Court level with a view to requesting that the erroneous convictions can be set aside.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has established a dedicated team to this end and is liaising with the Court Services to expedite this process.  As such, members of the public affected by the road traffic enforcement errors referred to are requested to await the aforementioned correspondence from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which will provide further clarification on the matter. </p>  <p>  I want to say that it is matter of great regret to me that anyone should be summonsed to court incorrectly, with all of the consequences that follow for individuals.

It is chaired by Lord Justice Christopher Pitchford.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the establishment of the Pitchford Inquiry and its terms of reference were and are matters solely for the British Government in accordance with UK law.  It is established under the UK Inquiries Act 2005 which does not provide powers for extraterritorial inquiry.</p>  <p>  It is my understanding that representations seeking the extension of the inquiry's terms of reference outside England and Wales were made previously by the authorities in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Germany, and that the UK Home Secretary having considered those representations decided that the terms of reference of the inquiry would not be so amended.  Although in this context the question of my seeking the extension of a UK inquiry does not arise, as I have indicated to the House on several occasions, should anything emerge from the findings of the Pitchford Inquiry that would be relevant to policing in this jurisdiction I will consider it fully and take any action that may be required.</p>  <p>  My colleague, Minister Flanagan, met recently with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and as part of their wider discussions on issues of mutual interest he raised with him concerns that have been expressed previously in this House on matters relating to the Pitchford Inquiry.  The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland agreed to convey those concerns to the Home Secretary, who is the minister in the UK Government with responsibility for the inquiry.</p>  <p>  Allegations regarding an undercover police officer in this jurisdiction were first made public in 2011.  A report from the Garda Commissioner at that time noted that no evidence of criminal activity by that person had been established.  That said, if any evidence of any criminal wrongdoing is available it should be brought to the Garda Authorities.  In the light of developments since these matters first came to light I have requested a fresh report from the Garda Commissioner on any issues arising and the Garda Authorities are in ongoing contact with their counterparts in London in this regard.  I will fully consider this report when it is available.</p></reply>

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. </p><p>This plan is well on course to be achieved.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p><p>I am advised that, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, there has been a total intake of some 1,400 new recruits with another 600 scheduled to enter the College by the end of this year.  I am informed by the Commissioner that some 839 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 24 of whom have been assigned to the Waterford Division and 28 of whom have been assigned to the Wexford Division.  I am also informed that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - a net increase of 700 in the total Garda strength since recruitment recommenced. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Waterford Division and Wexford Divisions in the coming years.</p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.</p><p>For ease of reference I have provided, for the record, a breakdown of the detailed information requested in relation the number of newly attested Garda allocated to the Waterford and the Wexford Divisions, since the first attestation of trainee Garda in April 2015 and the number of Garda assigned to those Divisions on 30 September 2014 and 28 February 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available. <table><tr><th>-</th><th></th><th>Waterford Division</th><th></th><th>Wexford Division</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>Personnel Strength</td><td>Number of newly attested Garda</td><td>Personnel Strength</td><td>Number of newly attested Garda</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>274</td><td>n/a</td><td>251</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>282</td><td>14</td><td>255</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>277</td><td>10</td><td>258</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>275</td><td>0</td><td>267</td><td>3</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Regulation does however contains a number of Articles which provide Member States with a limited margin of flexibility, mainly in respect of the public sector.  Work is ongoing in my Department on the preparation of a General Scheme of a Bill to give further effect to the GDPR and also to transpose the law enforcement Data Protection Directive (Directive (EU) 670/2016) which deals with the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences and the execution of criminal penalties.  The Regulation will come into effect in Ireland on 25 May 2018 and the Directive must be transposed into Irish law by 6 May 2018.  The Department of Justice and Equality has been in regular consultations with other Departments and public bodies and agencies in the course of the preparation of the scheme and awareness has been raised significantly through this process.</p><p>The GDPR adopts a risk-based approach which means that individual data controllers and processors have to put appropriate technical and organisational measures in place in order to ensure and be able to demonstrate that the processing of personal data is in compliance with the Regulation, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing and the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of individuals.  The GDPR provides for the establishment of supervisory authorities at national level with a wide range of functions and powers, including the task of promoting the awareness of controllers and processors of their obligations under the Regulation.  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, which the Deputy is aware has already been in existence in Ireland for almost 30 years, is the supervisory authority for Ireland.</p><p>I am advised by the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) that <font color="#2F2F2F">promoting and building awareness of the GDPR is a top priority for the office in 2017.

The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland agreed to convey those concerns to the Home Secretary.</p>  <p>  The British Government established the inquiry in 2015 in order to investigate and to report on the undercover police operations conducted by English and Welsh police forces in England and Wales since 1968.  It is chaired by Lord Justice Christopher Pitchford.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the establishment of the Pitchford Inquiry and its terms of reference were and are matters solely for the British Government in accordance with UK law.  It is established under the UK Inquiries Act 2005 which does not provide powers for extraterritorial inquiry.</p>  <p>  It is my understanding that representations seeking the extension of the inquiry's terms of reference outside England and Wales were made previously by the authorities in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Germany, and that the UK Home Secretary having considered those representations decided that the terms of reference of the inquiry would not be extended.  Although in this context the question of my seeking the extension of a UK inquiry does not arise, as I have indicated to the House previously, should anything emerge from the findings of the Pitchford Inquiry that would be relevant to policing in this jurisdiction I will consider it fully and take any action that may be required.</p></reply>

Under the Programme, the Garda Commissioner will undertake a number of road safety traffic enforcement initiatives, including expanding the use of technology and increasing checkpoints. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring visible, effective and responsive policing throughout the country in order to strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and prevent crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves. </p>  <p>  Given that there was no recruitment for a period of five years, it will take some time before there are fully trained officers available to adequately replace personnel that have retired across the entire organisation, including the Traffic Corps.  However, the Commissioner has confirmed that the personnel requirement of the Garda Traffic Corps is currently being assessed to identify the most vulnerable areas in regard to serious traffic collisions and the level of compliance with Road Traffic Legislation.  I understand that the Assistant Commissioner with responsibility for Roads Policing is currently assessing the capacity of Divisions and Districts to identify and target areas where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could accelerate the deployment of personnel to traffic in 2017.  The filling of any vacancies identified will be conducted on a structured basis and will be further enhanced with the recently renewed recruitment campaigns to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will also be aware that the Garda Commissioner has in the last few days announced the restructuring of traffic policing with the creation of a new Roads Policing Unit to be led by Assistant Commissioner Michael Finn.</p>  <p>  Ireland has over a number of years developed a multi-agency approach to road safety through the involvement of a number of agencies working in partnership, under the aegis of the Road Safety Strategy.  Under this year's Policing Plan, new measures will be explored with partner agencies in relation to driver compliance and the promotion of a safe and crime-free road network.  The Plan also points to the enhancement of the use of technology to continue to deprive criminals of the use of the road network and to develop policing capabilities.  Among the road traffic initiatives identified in the Plan are the strengthening and re-development of the Traffic Corps to tackle all forms of criminality on our road network and ongoing planning, risk assessment and operational preparation for major emergencies in conjunction with emergency management partners.</p>  <p>  Road traffic legislation is, of course, also enforced as part of the day to day duties of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Both targeted and general methods of enforcement have a valuable role to play in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's enforcement programme, which targets locations with a view to preventing the commission of offences, detecting errant motorists, changing their behaviour and ultimately reducing death and injuries on our roads.</p></reply>

Specifically, I have been assured by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that a permanent and comprehensive IT solution is now in place to cover the majority of FCPS issues identified and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is satisfied that the errors that occurred cannot be repeated.  In the case of breath tests/Mandatory Alcohol Testing, I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na initially put in place new paper based recording and verification processes, and, in November 2016, a new specific data recording IT upgrade was installed on the Garda PULSE system.  The net effect of the new IT upgrade was that personnel now have to record the serial number of the device used for each breath test plus the meter reading before and after the checkpoint was concluded.  Data from the device is now used to verify the total number of breath tests conducted at each checkpoint.</p>  <p>  Insofar as the 14,700 people convicted of road traffic offences in court following the incorrect issuing of a summons are concerned, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has established a dedicated support helpline for members of the public with queries in relation to their case.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also writing to all affected members of the public, explaining what has happened and outlining the solution to rectify the situation.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has indicated that it has been advised by the Director of Public Prosecutions and Courts Service that these 14,700 cases must be brought back before the Courts at Circuit Court level with a view to requesting that the erroneous convictions can be set aside.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has  established a dedicated team to this end and is liaising with the Court Services to expedite this process.  As such, members of the public affected by the road traffic enforcement errors referred to are requested to await the aforementioned correspondence from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which will provide further clarification on the matter. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner has:</p>  <p>  - announced the restructuring of traffic policing with the creation of a new Roads Policing Unit to be led by Assistant Commissioner Mick Finn;</p>  <p>  - announced the creation of a dedicated team under newly-appointed Assistant Commissioner Michael O&rsquo;Sullivan to investigate in detail the MATs issue, including with a view to identifying and holding responsible for their actions any Garda members, whether at junior, supervisory or management level, who acted improperly; and</p>  <p>  - committed to forwarding the report of this investigation to the Policing Authority and Department of Justice and Equality when completed.  </p>  <p>  Assistant Commissioner Finn outlined new arrangements agreed this week with the Medical Bureau on Roads Safety to the effect that that body would supply An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with its data on breath-testing devices on a quarterly basis, in order to ensure an independent benchmark against which Garda data can be measured.  The MBRS will shortly be tendering for new breath testing equipment.  New equipment which is available in the market place has the capacity to record the time, GPS location and number of persons breath-tested, and has the capacity to download the information automatically reducing the chances of errors occurring in the data.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding any internal review the Government believes that an external investigation into these two specific matters needs be carried out. </p>  <p>  The Government believes the level of public concern is now so profound that it may now be time to conduct a thorough, comprehensive and independent root-and-branch review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is clearly a proposal that will require further detailed consideration by the Government.</p>  <p>  The Government also believes that any such proposal should command widespread support in the Oireachtas and accordingly be the subject of consultation with the Opposition, and ultimately approval by the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner has been in direct contact with the Policing Authority in relation to the matters referred to in the Deputy's question and the Chairperson of the Policing Authority, Josephine Feehily, has confirmed that the Authority will:</p>  <p>  - have an independent professional audit undertaken of the steps taken to resolve the issues;and</p>  <p>  - oversee the investigation being undertaken by Assistant Commissioner O&rsquo;Sullivan.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the focus of the Authority's next public meeting with the Garda Commissioner will be on road traffic enforcement.  This public meeting will be held on 27 April 2017 and will provide a most timely opportunity for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to engage with the Authority and the general public on these key procedural and practice issues that are now before us.  The reason that I prioritised and set up the Authority was to shine a light on and examine issues such as these.</p>  <p>  I will continue to maintain close contact with the Garda Commissioner and the Chairperson of the Policing Authority in relation to these matters.</p></reply>

This will involve consideration of a number of important and complex issues.  The Group brings together officials from the Government Departments and bodies with the relevant expertise and responsibility in these areas and Mr John Murphy, retired Secretary General in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is chairing the Group. </p>  <p>  I do, of course, accept that the Garda Associations have a very significant interest in these matters and this is not a question of me excluding the Garda Associations from this process.  The Working Group is to report to me, as Minister, with proposals to amend legislation.  Clearly the Working Group will have to take a view on what are very complex and difficult issues and, in doing that, they must consult with all interested parties, including the Garda Associations.  I have made this very clear to the Associations and to the Chair of the Working Group.</p>  <p>  Initial consultation sessions with the Garda Associations took place on 16 March and I understand that the Working Group will shortly circulate a consultation paper to the Associations setting out options in relation to the key issues under consideration.  Further consultations will follow between then and the completion of this phase of the work in May.  It is vitally important that the Associations take advantage of the opportunity being provided, to engage positively and constructively with the Working Group, in order to ensure that any conclusions reached or proposals made by the Group are informed by the views of the Associations.</p>  <p>  The Associations are not being excluded from this process; I have ensured that they are being provided with every opportunity to engage with the Working Group and to make their views known.  This will continue through to the conclusion of the current phase of the work of the Group which focusses on the legislation.  The second phase of the Group&rsquo;s work concerns internal industrial relations processes in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I want to confirm here today that I will ensure that the Associations are more integrated into that phase of the process and I have asked my officials to work through how this might be arranged with the Chair of the Working Group and with the Associations.  However, for the time being, where the focus of the Group is on the legislation, I am satisfied that the arrangements put in place are appropriate and reflect the differing roles and responsibilities of the Government and the Associations.</p></reply>

The Government commissioned retired Judge Dr. Bryan McMahon to Chair a Working Group to carry out a report into the protection process and the system of direct provision and that report was published in June of 2015. </p><p>The report forms the basis for ongoing improvements across the entirety of the system involving all relevant Government Departments and Agencies.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government (May 2016) states that <i>&quot;Long durations in direct provision are acknowledged to have a negative impact on family life.  We are therefore committed to reforming the Direct Provision system, with particular focus on families and children.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i></i>On 23 February 2017, the latest audit of the implementation of the recommendations contained in that report was published.  This shows that some 121 of the recommendations are now implemented, with a further 38 recommendations partially implemented or in progress.  In total, 92% of the 173 recommendations are implemented, partially implemented or in progress, a significant increase on the figure of 80% we reported on last June. </p><p>The International Protection Act 2015 was commenced on 31 December 2016.  A key feature of this new legislation is the introduction of a new single application procedure which will, in time, significantly accelerate the protection determination process and by extension will reduce the length of time which applicants spend in State provided accommodation.</p><p>The new processing arrangements will determine certainty of status at an earlier stage for those entitled to international protection within the State. </p><p>A number of recommendations from the McMahon report in relation to improvements to accommodation and services are also being rolled out.  The following are some examples:</p><p>- The introduction of full independent living at the Mosney Accommodation centre - each family is now able to acquire fresh food to their liking so they may prepare meals themselves.  The new home cooking arrangements in Mosney went live on 23 January 2017.</p><p>- Cooking facilities are being rolled out to other centres including the State owned centres (Killarney, Tralee, Athlone, Knocklisheen in Limerick and Kinsale Road in Cork) and to Ballyhaunis, Milstreet, St Patrick&rsquo;s in Monaghan and any other centres in which families are resident.</p><p>- Teenagers rooms in centres to provide social areas for this age group</p><p>Recommendations of the McMahon report that involve structural changes or improvements will be implemented as quickly as possible, with due consideration of possible fire safety, building regulation and planning issues.</p><p>The Department has also co-ordinated the preparation of a multi-departmental information booklet for persons who have been granted any type of &lsquo;leave to remain&rsquo; in the State.  The booklet contains practical and useful information for residents across housing, finances, healthcare, education as well as TV licences, public transport and other related matters and has been prepared with the assistance of the National Adult Literacy Agency (NALA) to ensure that it is presented in Plain English.  The booklet has been translated into a number of languages.</p><p>In addition to the publication of the booklet, a number of NGOs have been awarded monies under the EU Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) specifically to provide assistance to move out of State provided accommodation.  At the end of December 2016, there were approximately 450 persons with some form of status continuing to reside in State provided accommodation.  Notwithstanding the current housing crisis, we are working with the NGO community and residents alike to ensure that those with permission to remain in the State are assisted in finding accommodation in communities across the country as soon as possible and that State provided accommodation remains available for those in most need.</p><p>Another key recommendation of the McMahon report was that the remit of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children should be extended to cover those who are living in State provided accommodation.  This has now been implemented and both offices will begin to accept complaints with effect from Monday 3 April 2017.</p><p>As can be seen from the foregoing, significant improvements have either been implemented or are being implemented across all aspects of the system of supports for those in the protection process. </p></reply>

That review was undertaken with the objective of identifying opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation.  I have been advised by the Garda authorities that the closures have allowed front line Garda to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility and in a more focused fashion, particularly with regard to targeted police operations. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits the Government to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  A cornerstone of this commitment is the Government plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  Revisiting the decisions made to close Garda stations is also part of that commitment. </p>  <p>  In this context, I have requested the Garda Commissioner, while fully cognisant of her statutory functions, to identify 6 stations for reopening on a pilot basis to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order.  The pilot will feed into the wider review being undertaken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, at the request of the Policing Authority, of the dispersal and use of resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the delivery of policing services to local communities.</p>  <p>  I understand that work is continuing in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to identify the 6 stations for inclusion in the pilot and that consultations have taken place with relevant stakeholders, including the Policing Authority.  In this context, I am sure that the Deputy would agree that a comprehensive and evidenced-based analysis should be carried out, taking account of all the relevant factors, before a final decision is made in respect of the stations to be reopened by the Commissioner.</p>  <p>  I expect to receive a report from the Commissioner by the end of May in connection with the exercise.</p></reply>

There are also 13 Garda Reserves and 37 civilians attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>I am advised by the Commissioner that, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, some 839 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 21 of whom have been assigned to the Division.  I am also advised that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - a net increase of 700 in the total Garda strength since recruitment recommenced.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Station Building and Refurbishment Programme includes the delivery of a new Garda station in Bailieborough and the provision of a Specialist Victim Interview Suite in Stradone.  I understand that substantial progress has been made in relation to the acquisition of a site for the Bailieborough station and that, in advance of the development of the new station, essential remediation works at the existing Station were completed in 2016 to enhance the public office and general safety throughout the building. </p><p>In relation to the development at Stradone, I understand that the OPW is currently awaiting responses to the tender issued and, subject to the tendering and procurement process, the intention is that this project will commence later in the year. </p><p>In addition, there are some 60 Garda vehicles allocated to the Division. </p><p>The Programme for Government commits the Government to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  A cornerstone of this commitment is the Government plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, the Government has provided funding for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.  In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment it is expected that a new competition for trainee Garda will be announced shortly.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Cavan/Monaghan Division, in the coming years.</p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.  <font color="#000080">  </font></p></reply>

Applications submitted that are fully in order for registration and that do not result in the raising of queries are dealt with in a very timely and efficient manner.  In 2017 to date, in excess of 70% of cases in order for registration which do not require a change to the map or examination of title are completed within nine days or less, while more than 80% of such cases are dealt with within 14 days or less.  Where a case is urgent and is brought to the attention of the PRA it will, in accordance with its customer service policy, deal with the matter expeditiously.</p>  <p>  The PRA had some 99,959 transactions on hand as at end March 2017 which represents about six months' work.  22% of the transactions on hand are subject to query - such cases cannot therefore be completed until a satisfactory response is received.  The PRA has indicated that there is a continuing high rate of rejection - these are transactions that have been received by the PRA but are not in order for registration and must be returned to the lodging party.  In 2017 to date, there has been a rejection rate of 15%.  Factors that may impact on the completion times may include investigation of title requirements, the completeness of the documentation presented, the need to raise additional queries and mapping requirements. </p>  <p>  Certain applications, including First Registration applications, applications made under right-of-way by prescription and applications for registration based on long or adverse possession are legally complex and generally require various queries to be raised by the lodging party.  In addition, notice must be served on all interested parties and appropriate time allowed for objections which can run for some time.  The PRA must be fully satisfied that a case is fully grounded, the nature of the title proved and that all interested parties' concerns have been fully considered before registering a State guaranteed title. By their nature, such applications, of necessity and legislation, may take a long time to process.</p>  <p>  Of the cases currently on hand, some 13% relate to First Registration applications.  This is reflective of a large intake of such cases since the extension of compulsory first registration to the entire country in 2011.  The PRA is addressing this particular area of concern through a number of mechanisms.  Firstly, First Registration applications may be certified by a Solicitor in which case full examination of title is not necessary.  In such cases a First Registration case is completed within three to four months.  Secondly, PRA management has put in place an action plan including targeted resources and business process improvements in case management to deal with the First Registration arrear.  I am advised that further options are being considered including the assigning of additional staff with specific skills and experience of investigation of title.</p>  <p>  In addition to the measures specific to First Registration, outlined above, the PRA has put in place a number of initiatives to enhance its engagement with solicitors, who generally submit applications for registration.  This includes a 'solicitor relationship project', where the PRA has established structures to assist certain solicitors with their applications in order to reduce the level of errors and therefore the length of time the process can take.  The PRA has also developed a series of guides and videos for solicitors, again to help improve the quality of applications lodged - these are expected to go live on the PRA's website in Quarter 2 of 2017.  Business process improvement training is being provided for staff in key areas, with a view to identifying and implementing more efficient processes.  Staff training more generally has been enhanced to upskill the large number of new staff members in the organisation.  These measures, allied to restructuring of the PRA and advances in the use of technology are expected to yield greater efficiency over time and are monitored closely by the Board of the Authority.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.  </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves. </p><p>I was pleased to recently announce the launch of a new recruitment campaign for Garda Reserves in pursuance of the Programme for Government commitment to increase the strength of the Reserve to 2,000 by 2021.  Garda Reserve members act in a supportive role undertaking local patrols and other crime reduction measures.  They have undergone training in many of the skills required to be effective full-time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and it is important that we build on the very real contribution that they are making to the policing of communities right across the country.</p><p>I would encourage anyone interested in pursuing policing as a career to consider first becoming a member of the Reserve where they can see at first-hand what being a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na actually involves.  The competition is being run by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Garda Commissioner and applications can be made online by 13 April, 2017 through<i>www.publicjobs.ie.</i></p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out in the following table, as provided by the Commissioner, the strength of the Garda Reserve in each Division from 2012 to 28 February 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, there has been a substantial reduction in the strength of the Reserve in recent years.  The fall-off arises from a range of factors, not least the lifting in 2014 of the moratorium on recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; which has affected Reserve numbers in two ways - firstly approximately 200 serving Reserves have successfully applied to become trainee Garda&iacute;, and secondly, resources in both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the Public Appointment Service have been focused on delivering an accelerated programme of recruitment of full time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am sure that the Deputy will agree, notwithstanding the very valuable contribution of Reserve members throughout the country, that it was the right decision, with finite resources, to prioritise the running of recruitment campaigns to replenish the full-time ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the last three years.</p><p>Garda Reserve Strength 2012 - 28 February 2017</p><p><table><tr><th>Division</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th></tr><tr><td>DMR South Central </td><td>64</td><td>77</td><td>80</td><td>66</td><td>48</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>DMR North Central</td><td>50</td><td>71</td><td>73</td><td>59</td><td>42</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>DMR North </td><td>63</td><td>59</td><td>61</td><td>57</td><td>49</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>DMR East</td><td>17</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>19</td><td>15</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>DMR South</td><td>47</td><td>51</td><td>45</td><td>35</td><td>26</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>DMR West</td><td>59</td><td>65</td><td>64</td><td>51</td><td>28</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>31</td><td>36</td><td>34</td><td>32</td><td>24</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>29</td><td>32</td><td>37</td><td>37</td><td>22</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>36</td><td>41</td><td>42</td><td>28</td><td>23</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny/Carlow</td><td>33</td><td>40</td><td>38</td><td>34</td><td>26</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td><td>58</td><td>73</td><td>68</td><td>65</td><td>48</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Cork North</td><td>20</td><td>30</td><td>29</td><td>24</td><td>16</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Cork West </td><td>27</td><td>26</td><td>29</td><td>23</td><td>12</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>26</td><td>36</td><td>32</td><td>31</td><td>21</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>47</td><td>52</td><td>51</td><td>53</td><td>36</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>28</td><td>28</td><td>26</td><td>27</td><td>21</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan/Monaghan</td><td>20</td><td>25</td><td>23</td><td>19</td><td>14</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo/Leitrim</td><td>21</td><td>24</td><td>27</td><td>27</td><td>21</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>45</td><td>55</td><td>52</td><td>41</td><td>33</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>18</td><td>15</td><td>13</td><td>8</td><td>7</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>31</td><td>35</td><td>35</td><td>32</td><td>23</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>64</td><td>69</td><td>63</td><td>43</td><td>36</td><td>36</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon/Longford</td><td>18</td><td>20</td><td>15</td><td>11</td><td>11</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>22</td><td>27</td><td>25</td><td>20</td><td>13</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>33</td><td>44</td><td>42</td><td>33</td><td>18</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare </td><td>24</td><td>41</td><td>41</td><td>30</td><td>22</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Laois/Offaly</td><td>31</td><td>31</td><td>28</td><td>24</td><td>19</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>29</td><td>41</td><td>31</td><td>24</td><td>21</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>991</td><td>1164</td><td>1124</td><td>953</td><td>695</td><td>666</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This is a long standing provision of public policy.</p><p>In the case of <i>Sporting Index Limited v John O'Shea</i>[2015] INEC 407, the High Court found that the Irish public policy against enforcement of gambling bets outweighed the rights, under the Brussels Regulation, to have judgments of EU courts enforced in Member States.  In the case very recently reported from the Circuit Civil Court, a person was denied full payment of a claimed win on a gaming machine.  Again, the Court pointed to the long standing public policy on non-enforcement of gambling debts.  These two particular cases may not be typical of normal interaction between gaming operators and their clients and we should not be alarmist.</p><p>While the General Scheme of the Gambling Control Bill in 2013 proposed the ending of the centuries old ban on legal enforcement of gambling debts as a feature of public policy, I am of the view that the matter would bear significant further consideration both by the Government and by the Oireachtas.  This consideration would have to include: the conditions on how gambling debts might be made enforceable by our courts, would it apply only to regulated and licensed forms of gambling and the impact of standard commercial practices, consumer protection and provision of credit.</p><p>We would need to think very carefully as to the full range of possible consequences for all parties concerned.  I have no decided view at this point, as to whether we should make this change to public policy. I welcome the views that Deputies may have to offer.</p><p>As I have very recently conveyed to the House, it remains the intention to proceed with gambling legislation at the earliest opportunity.  The preparation of a Gambling Control Bill continues on that basis.  However, it should be acknowledged that it will require some significant updating to take account of developments since 2013.  The preparation of legislation will be a major and complex undertaking.  Gambling is now a huge multi-billion euro economic activity, with significant cross-border and electronic on-line operations.  I have special responsibility in this area and with Departmental officials am actively engaged in further consideration and research, including consultations with relevant stakeholders.  While the exact nature of new regulatory approaches with regard to all forms of gambling activities remains to be decided, we should be aware that the outcome will have resource implications. </p><p>I should also add that work on the preparation of the General Scheme of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is at an advanced stage in the Department.  This Bill will contain some early amendments to gaming legislation providing for a rage of useful modernisation and clarification measures to the outdated Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956.  In particular, it would address issues concerning the minimum age for gambling activities, authorising realistic stake and prize amounts and a clearer setting out of the circumstances for the permitting and conduct of certain gaming and lottery activities.</p></reply>

The ICLVR's task is to facilitate the location of the remains of a number of persons who were killed and buried secretly by paramilitary organisations during the troubles.</p>  <p>  I know that Deputy Smith, and others in this House, have a long-standing interest in this issue.  The families of the victims have endured a very unique tragedy, not just in having lost a loved one, but having been denied for so long information about the burial places of their loved ones.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy and, indeed, the families of the Disappeared that the ICLVR&rsquo;s investigation team has had and will continue to have the resources it needs to carry out its difficult task.  The Government will continue in co-operation with our British counterparts to support this important work.</p>  <p>  However, as the Deputy will know the ICLVR&rsquo;s work is fundamentally driven by information.  This is the key resource to support its efforts and anyone who has any information on any of the outstanding cases should bring it to the ICLVR without delay.</p>  <p>  The only aim of the ICLVR is to locate the victims&rsquo; remains in order that they may be returned to their families to receive a decent burial.  In this way the families will then have a grave at which to grieve and to remember.  To date, 12 of the ICLVR&rsquo;s cases have been located and the ICLVR is continuing its inquiries in relation to the remaining four cases &ndash; Joe Lynskey, Columba McVeigh, Robert Nairac and Seamus Ruddy &ndash; and I can assure the families of my and the Government's continued full support for this ongoing humanitarian work.</p></reply>

Any such proposal could give rise to very large, unpredictable and potentially very costly impacts across the full range of public and social services.  Furthermore, there may well be significant implications for the operation of the Common Travel Area, particularly in the context of Britain withdrawing from the European Union.  Any proposal in this regard would have to be very carefully considered.  It is important to recognise that in most cases a person becomes undocumented through their own actions by making the choice to remain in Ireland without immigration permission as opposed to the alternative of leaving the State.It is always open to persons in an undocumented situation to present their case on its individual merits to the immigration authorities.  Such cases would be carefully considered before a decision is made and it is reasonable for the State to expect that the affected persons would respect that decision what ever that may be.</p></reply>

In addition, the Garda Commissioner has: </p><p>- announced the restructuring of traffic policing with the creation of a new Roads Policing Unit to be led by Assistant Commissioner Mick Finn; </p><p>- announced the creation of a dedicated team under newly-appointed Assistant Commissioner Michael O&rsquo;Sullivan to investigate in detail the MATs issue, including with a view to identifying and holding responsible for their actions any Garda members, whether at junior, supervisory or management level, who acted improperly; and </p><p>- committed to forwarding the report of this investigation to the Policing Authority and Department of Justice and Equality when completed.  </p><p>As such, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to identify specific internal system failures in An Garda S&iacute;&oacute;ch&aacute;na until such time as Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan's investigation is completed. </p><p>Notwithstanding any internal review the Government believes that an external investigation into these two specific matters needs be carried out. </p><p>The Government believes the level of public concern is now so profound that it may now be time to conduct a thorough, comprehensive and independent root-and-branch review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is clearly a proposal that will require further detailed consideration by the Government.</p><p>The Government also believes that any such proposal should command widespread support in the Oireachtas and accordingly be the subject of consultation with the Opposition, and ultimately approval by the Oireachtas.</p><p>The Garda Commissioner has been in direct contact with the Policing Authority in relation to the matters referred to in the Deputy's question and the Chairperson of the Policing Authority, Josephine Feehily, has confirmed that the Authority will: </p><p>- have an independent professional audit undertaken of the steps taken to resolve the issues; and </p><p>- oversee the investigation being undertaken by Assistant Commissioner O&rsquo;Sullivan.</p><p>I welcome the fact that the focus of the Authority's next public meeting with the Garda Commissioner will be on road traffic enforcement.

However, paragraph 1(b) provides that further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall, subject to appropriate safeguards, not be considered incompatible with the initial purposes.  Likewise, while the "storage limitation" principle requires that personal data should be kept in a form which permits identification of individuals for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data are collected and processed, paragraph 1(e) provides that personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the data will  be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of individuals.  </p>  <p>  Article 89 confirms that data processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes is permitted, subject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of individuals.  It states that such safeguards should ensure that technical and organisational measures are put in place in order to ensure respect for the principle of data minimisation and cites the process of "pseudonymisation" of personal data as a possible safeguard if the purposes concerned can be fulfilled in that manner.  It also permits Member States to provide for derogations from certain data subject rights where personal data are processed for these purposes.  Proposals for legislation which are currently being prepared in my Department to give further effect to the GDPR will contain a number of derogations in line with Article 89. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Regulation recognises the importance of research activity, including the processing of personal data for scientific purposes.  For example, it specifically cites the significance of medical research which can yield new knowledge of great value concerning diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and depression.  In the social science field, it acknowledges that research enables researchers to obtain essential knowledge about the long-term correlation of a number of social conditions such as unemployment and education with other life conditions.  The processing of personal data for scientific research purposes includes technological development, fundamental research, applied research and privately-funded research.</p>  <p>  I want to reassure the Deputy that I, together with my Department, have participated in a constructive and active manner in the negotiations which resulted in agreement on the GDPR.  The GDPR will enter into force in May 2018 and all Government Departments are currently giving consideration to the manner in which its provisions will apply in practice to their respective areas of activity, including scientific research, and assessing the need for any necessary further action.</p></reply>

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. </p><p>This plan is well on course to be achieved.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p><p>I am advised that, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, there has been a total intake of some 1,400 new recruits with another 600 scheduled to enter the College by the end of this year.  I am informed by the Commissioner that some 839 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 13 of whom have been assigned to the Sligo/Leitrim Division.  I am also informed that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - a net increase of 700 in the total Garda strength since recruitment recommenced. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Sligo/Leitrim Division in the coming years. </p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and classroom based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.</p><p>For ease of reference the table below provides, for the record, details of the number of newly attested Garda&iacute; allocated to the Sligo/Leitrim Division, since the first attestation of trainee Garda in April 2015.

I would like to thank Deputy Martin and all of the other Deputies who spoke on that occasion for supporting that statement.  This event was historic and memorable.  I was delighted to note that there was an all-party consensus on the issue and I take the opportunity to commend the Deputy also in that regard.</p>  <p>  There are no legal or expenditure implications arising from this State recognition of Travellers; the Taoiseach's statement was about recognition and respect and not about creating any new rights or rights that do not already exist.  The key argument for recognition of Traveller ethnicity was that recognition of the distinct heritage, culture and identity of Travellers and their special place in Irish society will be hugely and symbolically important to Traveller pride and self-esteem and overcoming the legacy of economic marginalisation, discrimination and low self-esteem with which the Traveller community struggles.  This is not to ignore the real problems that Travellers face but this symbolic gesture will create a new platform for positive engagement by the Traveller community and the Government in together seeking sustainable solutions based on respect and an honest dialogue on these issues and challenges.</p>  <p>  The statement by the Taoiseach announcing State recognition of Traveller ethnicity was the culmination of a long-standing campaign by Travellers to have their identity, culture and unique position valued by their formal recognition as a distinct ethnic group.  As the Taoiseach stressed, this is without prejudice to Travellers being part of, and self-identifying as part of, the Irish nation.  This historic statement is also a new beginning and the start of the work that we need to do as a society, in partnership with Travellers, to address the real and stark issues that face the Traveller community in areas such as health, employment, education and accommodation.  I will present my plans to address these issues in the new National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy which I will, in consultation with other Departments and Traveller and Roma representatives, finalise shortly.  I look forward to continuing to work with Travellers as part of what will be a Strategy with an ambitious set of objectives.</p></reply>

The specific deployment of policing resources is a matter for the Garda authorities, as is the question on ongoing engagement and meetings with transport operators.</p><p>Insofar as the general approach to tackling these issues are concerned, I am advised that Garda management engages extensively with transport operators in the Dublin area and a range of regional and local operations have been put in place as required to address issues that have arisen at specific locations.  Instances of crime and anti-social behaviour are monitored by local Garda management with the assistance of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service, which results in periodic operations aimed at anti-social behaviour on and around public transport routes.  I am further advised that there is effective communication with the respective control centres and that access to good quality CCTV has also been of great assistance in the investigation of complaints.</p><p>I can also inform the Deputy thatthere is a range of strong legislative provisions available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat anti-social behaviour generally, including provisions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts, the Criminal Damage Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts.  The powers available to Garda&iacute; support them in addressing anti-social behaviours, including the prevention of nuisance or annoyance to others and forestalling damage to property or a breach of the peace.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains committed to tackling all types of public disorder and anti-social behaviour by working with communities to reduce this type of behaviour and enhance community safety. </p><p>Underpinning all of these measures is the Government's commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  The Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300, and in this regard I was pleased to be able to launch a new recruitment campaign for Reserve members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na last week.</p></reply>

The Scheme remains open to new applications but it&rsquo;s important to note that decisions have been made on all but two of the 821 applications received to date &ndash; the two refer to applications made only in recent weeks.  The difference between that figure and the 669 payments made is accounted for by refusals and for other reasons including probate cases, applicants still considering provisional offers, and the application of the Assisted Decision Making Act, 2015 in relation to those women who lack the necessary capacity.  In this latter respect, award offers have been made to 19 women who lack the necessary capacity to consider their offer.</p>  <p>  Payment to these 19 women has been delayed until proper safeguards are in place.  To cover these women and other adults whose decision-making capacity is at issue, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015.  The Act provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties.  It is being commenced on a phased basis and it is intended that significant progress will be made in 2017 on the implementation of the new decision-making support options provided for in the Act.  The specific decision making supports available under the Act to adults with capacity difficulties are decision-making assistants, co-decision makers and decision-making representatives who will be supervised by the Director of the Decision Support Service.</p>  <p>  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (which is a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act come into force.  Careful planning and groundwork has to be put in place to ensure that the commencement of the Act is correctly, appropriately and effectively handled.  A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from my Department, the Department of Health and the Mental Health Commission is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service.</p>  <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 1 (Preliminary and General) and Part 9 (Director of the Decision Support Service) of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016.  These provisions were brought into operation in order to enable the process of recruitment of the Director of the Decision Support Service to begin.</p>  <p>  With regard to advocacy, it is important to note that a personal advocate has very limited powers with regard to a person who lacks capacity.  A personal advocate does not have power of attorney, to make decision or otherwise to manage the affairs of the person.  That is why the provisions of Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015 will be so important.  As a general point, women who were in the Magdalen laundries are already covered under section 21 of the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act, 2009 which makes provision for persons to act as care representatives in respect of any person applying for support under that Act.</p></reply>

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his or her Division.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Meath Division, on the 28 February 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 289.  There are also 18 Garda Reserves and 27 civilians attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Commissioner that, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, some 839 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 26 of whom have been assigned to the Meath Division.  I understand that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - a net increase of 700 in the total Garda strength since recruitment recommenced. </p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Meath Division, in the coming years.</p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.</p></reply>

I note that the ICSA report is part one in a series of three reports into agricultural crime in Ireland and I look forward to considering the other reports when published.  </p><p>I also want to assure the Deputy that I am very much aware of the damage done to local communities by organised gangs who target rural areas to engage in burglary and other property crime.  The ICSA report covers a period of 24 months, from the start of May 2014 to the end of May 2016 and this includes a period of 17 months before the launch, in November 2015, of the sustained drive against burglary and property crime which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has pursued under Operation Thor.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, Operation Thor entails a broad range of activities to tackle organised crime gangs and other prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime.  This comprehensive operation is supported by the enhanced Government investment in Garda resources, including the recently announced additional allocation of &euro;88.5 million in 2017.  The additional investments in policing make it possible to maintain and extend a range of intensive policing operations, including the continued targeting of burglaries and related crime via Operation Thor.  There has been concentrated policing activity under Operation Thor and this is reflected in the implementation of over 67,000 targeted checkpoints nationwide, with in the region of 4,000 arrests being made.</p><p>It is encouraging to note that since the launch of the Operation, the burglary figures in particular have shown a significant downward trend.  Indeed, the CSO official recorded crime statistics for Q4 of 2016, which were released this week, show a<b></b>30% decrease in burglary for the twelve months of 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015 - which parallels the implementation of Operation Thor.</p><p>I have also made it a particular priority to strengthen our legislative provisions through the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b></b>2015 which is targeted at repeat burglars who have previous convictions and who are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary.  I am very pleased that this new legislation is now available to support the work which is being carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under Operation Thor.</p><p>The Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities and this is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will be aware that as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders, including the farming organisations.  There are a range of partnership initiatives which have been established between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and important rural-based organisations such as the Irish Farmers Association, Muintir na Tire and other rural community organisations, including the well established Community Alert Programme, the ongoing work of the Metal Theft Forum, the Crimestoppers campaign highlighting the Theft of Livestock, the Theftstop initiative in relation to farm equipment, and the highly successful Garda Text Alert Scheme.  </p><p>Underpinning all of these measures is the Government's commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  The Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.

Like so many other callous and unjustified acts of wanton violence that took place during the troubles, the bombing at Belturbet robbed two young people of their lives and inflicted untold suffering on their families.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the bombing was the subject of a thorough investigation at the time by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with expert assistance provided by the Army.  Investigations at that time involved close liaison with the authorities in Northern Ireland in an effort to bring the perpetrators to justice.  However, although every avenue of inquiry open to the investigation was pursued at that time there was no evidence to bring those responsible for this crime to justice.

That review was undertaken with the objective of identifying opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation.

The new processing arrangements will determine certainty of status at an earlier stage for those entitled to seek international protection within the State.  The Act is intended to achieve the desired balance between treating asylum seekers with humanity and respect and ensuring more efficient immigration procedures and safeguards.</p><p>All applications for international protection from 31 December, 2016 will be processed under the new arrangements in the International Protection Office of INIS (replacing the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner) and any appeals arising in relation to asylum and subsidiary protection applications will be heard by the International Protection Appeals Tribunal (replacing the Refugee Appeals Tribunal).  </p><p>With regard to access to legal advice for those seeking international protection, the Legal Aid Board operates a mixed model of service delivery to persons seeking international protection in the State.  The model involves both the use of in-house staff, including solicitor staff, working in law centres and the referral of cases to private solicitors on a panel.  Since the commencement of the International Protection Act 2015, the Board has committed to providing all international protection clients with early legal advice on all aspects of their application.</p><p>International protection clients receive a full information consultation before completing their questionnaire, wherein the key elements of refugee law are set out, their own obligations as applicants are outlined and the requirements of the questionnaire are explained in full.  Where necessary the Board provides for the services of interpreters for the conduct of consultations and the provision of advice.

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. </p><p>This plan is well on course to be achieved.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p><p>I am advised that, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, there has been a total intake of some 1,400 new recruits with another 600 scheduled to enter the College by the end of this year.  I am informed by the Commissioner that some 839 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 24 of whom have been assigned to the Kilkenny/Carlow Division.  I am also informed that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - a net increase of 700 in the total Garda strength since recruitment recommenced. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Kilkenny/Carlow Division in the coming years. </p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme. </p><p>For ease of reference the following table provides, for the record, details of the number of newly attested Garda allocated to the Kilkenny/Carlow Division, since the first attestation of trainee Garda in April 2015.  It also provides details of the number of Garda assigned to the Division from 30 September 2014 to 28 February 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Personnel Strength</th><th>Number of newly attested Garda</th></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>279</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>284</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>296</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>303</td><td>4</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Where a criminal offence such as assault, criminal damage or a public order offence is committed against a person based on their race, religion, colour, ethnicity or some other ground, the offence is prosecuted through the wider criminal law.  It is also accepted that such an offence is more serious on account of the hate or prejudice motivating the crime and Irish courts do consider evidence of a crime being motivated by hate or prejudice as an aggravating factor at sentencing.</p>  <p>  The Garda Racial Intercultural and Diversity Office (GRIDO) has responsibility for coordinating, monitoring and advising on all aspects of policing Ireland's diverse communities.  GRIDO monitors the reporting and recording of hate and racist crime on a continual basis.  Garda Ethnic Liaison Officers (ELOs) are appointed to work with minority communities at local level throughout the country.  These officers, together with GRIDO, play a fundamental role in liaising with minority groups.  They provide advice and assistance to victims of hate or racist crime as required. </p>  <p>  In addition to the work of the Garda&iacute;, the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration, an Office of my Department, is the focal point for the Government's commitment on anti-racism as a key aspect of integration, diversity management and broader national social policy.</p>  <p>  A new Migrant Integration Strategy was published on 7 February.  The Integration Strategy includes a number of actions to promote intercultural awareness and to combat racism and xenophobia.  It includes an action to review the current legislation on racially motivated crime with a view to strengthening the law on hate crime.</p>  <p>   An open Call for Proposals was held under the EU Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund in September to November 2016.  Actions that combat racism are identified as a priority in Ireland's National Programme under the Fund.  Some of the projects selected are focusing on actions to combat racism.</p>  <p>  A call for applications for national funding to promote integration has also been held.  Activities to combat racism and xenophobia will be funded through this mechanism.</p></reply>

The new single application procedure under the Act, will, in time, significantly accelerate the protection determination process and by extension will reduce the length of time which applicants spend in State provided accommodation.</p>  <p>  The new system will ensure that all aspects of a person's claim (Asylum, Subsidiary protection and Humanitarian Leave to Remain) are considered together rather than sequentially as heretofore. </p>  <p>  A comprehensive information process has been put in place by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and the new International Protection Office (IPO) to ensure that protection applicants and their legal representatives are aware of the provisions of the International Protection Act 2015.  The transitional arrangements of the Act apply to certain applications for refugee status and subsidiary protection which were made before the commencement date (31 December, 2016) and were not finalised for processing by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT). </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Chief International Protection Officer (CIPO) that, as is required by the 2015 Act, in late January/February 2017 the IPO, in addition to placing advertisements in the national media, wrote to approximately 3,000 applicants whose cases were not finalised by the ORAC or the RAT, to inform them of the commencement of the relevant provisions of the 2015 Act and how the transitional arrangements would affect their applications.</p>  <p>  All applicants received the following documents with the mailshot:</p>  <p>  - Information Note - Transitional Arrangements (IPO 12)</p>  <p>  - Information Booklet for applicants for International Protection (IPO 1) and,</p>  <p>  - Application for International Protection Questionnaire (IPO 2).</p>  <p>  The relevant mailshot was sent on an incremental basis initially to both adult applicants in Direct Provision accommodation, and to those with private addresses, in English followed by material in 17 other languages.  The questionnaire is now available in 19 languages, including English, as is the information booklet.  On 30 January 2017, the IPO wrote to all legal representatives on record, providing comprehensive information on the new legislation.  In addition, notices were circulated to Direct Provision centres in relation to the mailshot.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure that applicants had sufficient time to familiarise themselves with this new system, there is no deadline, statutory or otherwise, set in any correspondence sent out by the IPO.  I can inform the Deputy that the information sent to applicants in January/February 2017 made clear in paragraph 7.30 that the Application for International Protection Questionnaire (IPO 2) should be returned 'if possible, no later than 20 working days from the date of the covering letter'.  The next paragraph 7.4 went on to state clearly that opportunities to add to the information supplied exist up to two weeks before the scheduled interview. </p>  <p>  Flexibility is being provided by the International Protection Office, a call centre is available to answer any queries and if extra time is required for its completion, as the wisdom of accessing legal advice is stressed in the questionnaire, no impediment or disadvantage exists to prevent the careful filling out of the new single application form.  I understand, so as to remove any false impressions that may be circulating that the 'if possible' time-frame is some sort of statutory deadline, that the IPO again wrote to the members of the Customer Liaison Panel to confirm the arrangements and that similar clarification has been provided on the IPO website.</p>  <p>  Applicants have also been clearly advised, as referred to above, that should they or their legal advisors need to provide supplementary information to the International Protection Officer after they have submitted the questionnaire, they can also do so, up to two weeks prior to the date of their scheduled interview, if possible.  This time-scale will facilitate the translation of documents if required and ensure that the IPO interviewer has all their papers available and considered in advance of the interview date. </p></reply>

The Bill also aims to make the court process easier for victims of domestic violence.  A victim will have the right to be accompanied to court by a family member, friend or support worker.  A victim will be able to give evidence by live television link.  There will be restrictions on attendance at both civil and criminal court proceedings and protections for the victims anonymity. </p>  <p>  I have received several submissions from various organisations in relation to the Bill, including from the organisation mentioned in the details supplied, which have all been given consideration.  While it may not be possible to include all the recommendations in the final draft of the Bill several are under active consideration for inclusion by way of Ministerial amendment in the final draft of the legislation.</p></reply>

This underspend was mainly due to an insufficiency of suitable projects with the required level of matching funding.</p>  <p>  This Fund, together with the European Refugee Fund and the European Return Fund, was replaced by the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) 2014 to 2020 (but with the eligibility period ending on 31 December 2022).  The AMIF has four specific objectives relating to asylum (including resettlement), integration, return, and solidarity (relocation).  Of the &euro;19.519 million allocated to Ireland, &euro;5.455 million is earmarked in our National Programme for integration.  There is provision for switching allocations between specific objectives depending on where a greater need might arise and, therefore, I am confident that our national allocation will be spent by end 2022.</p>  <p>   Ireland's National Programme for the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund includes provision for supporting integration projects delivered by civil society organisations.  Following an open call for proposals held in late 2016, 20 such projects have been selected and will begin implementation shortly.  These projects will be carried out in various locations nationwide and will focus on providing practical integration assistance such as language and inter-cultural supports to Third Country Nationals resident here.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-30a.178.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017033000057#WRD02300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 70 together.</p>  <p>  The Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 provide for the valuation of all commercial and industrial property for rating purposes.  The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Acts and the making of valuations for rating is his sole responsibility.  I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no role in decisions in this regard.  Under Irish law there is a distinct separation of function between valuation of rateable property and setting and collection of commercial rates.  The amount of rates payable in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority. </p>  <p>  Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors.  This has been the policy of successive governments and is the express purpose of the National Revaluation Programme now being rolled out by the Valuation Office.  The Valuation Acts provide for revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors such as business turnover, differential movements in property values or other external factors and changes in the local business environment.  The Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme, the immediate objective of which is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in over 150 years is conducted across the country, as soon as possible, and on a phased basis.  This is a welcome and positive development which is long overdue and on which considerable progress has been made to date. </p>  <p>  Revaluation is an important instrument in addressing historical anomalies in relation to commercial rates for both urban and rural properties and between particular classes of property within a local authority area.  The general outcome of revaluations conducted to date by the Valuation Office has been that about 60% of ratepayers have had their liability for rates reduced following revaluation and about 40% had an increase, a pattern which is expected to be replicated elsewhere as the programme advances.  The current phase of the national revaluation programme, "REVAL 2017", covers revaluation of all rateable properties in counties Longford, Leitrim, Roscommon, Westmeath, Offaly, Kildare, Sligo, Carlow and Kilkenny where a revaluation is being undertaken for the first time since the nineteenth century.  It also includes the second revaluation of South Dublin County Council area.  Revaluation in these counties will be completed in September 2017 and become effective for rating purposes from 2018 onwards.</p>  <p>  Where the Valuation Office proposes to enter a new valuation or amend an existing valuation on a Valuation List, there is an extensive process available to cater for ratepayers who may be dissatisfied with the proposed valuation.  A dissatisfied person can make representations to the Valuation Office within 40 days of the date of issue of the proposed valuation certificate.  The Valuation Office will consider any such representations and may or may not change the proposed valuation depending on the circumstances of each individual property.  If any ratepayer is still dissatisfied with the final valuation to be placed on their property following consideration of the representations, they have a right to lodge a formal appeal with the Valuation Tribunal, which is an independent statutory body established for the purpose of hearing appeals against decisions of the Commissioner of Valuation.</p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to property used in the equine industry, I am advised by the Valuation Office that there has been some apparent confusion as to the rateability of certain elements of the industry.  The Valuation Act 2001 (Schedule 3, Sections 1(a) and (b)) provides that all buildings and lands used or developed for any purpose, are rateable.  The basic premise under the Act is that all interests (including buildings) and all developed land are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4.  I should point out that there has been no re-classification of properties from rateable status to exempt status (or vice-versa) within the general equine industry since the Valuation Act 2001 came into force on 2 May 2002. </p>  <p>  The only element of the equine industry which satisfies the exemption provisions in Schedule 4 is the breeding of horses.  Buildings used for breeding of horses are classified as being of agricultural use and are "farm buildings" as defined in the Act.  Therefore these buildings are exempted from the payment of rates under paragraph 5 of Schedule 4. On the other hand, buildings used for the training of racehorses, recreational equestrian purposes or livery premises are rateable under the Act because they are considered to be part of a commercial enterprise.  Such buildings would typically include stables for horses, covered riding arenas, tack rooms and ancillary buildings used to support the enterprise.  While acknowledging the important contribution which all elements of the equine industry make to the economy, there are no plans to reclassify these as exempt from rates.  To do so would be at variance with the provisions in the Valuation Acts which maintains the long-standing position that all property occupied and used for commercial enterprises are liable for rates.  Exceptions to this key principle would quickly be followed by demands for similar treatment from the providers of other equally important services and products, which would be difficult in equity to resist.  This could thus substantially reduce local authority revenues, which would have to be made good by imposing corresponding increases on the remaining ratepayers.</p></reply>

The Public Accounts Committee subsequently examined this issue in November 2015. </p>  <p>  The Thornton Hall site comprises 156 acres and was purchased for a proposed prison development to replace Mountjoy Prison campus.  Selection of the site began with advertisements in the national newspapers and over 30 potential sites were evaluated by a selection committee.  Thornton was selected as the least costly of the sites which met the relevant criteria.  Full details of the assessment process have been made public and are detailed in the Comptroller and Auditor General's Annual Report 2005.  Negotiations with the prospective vendors were conducted on behalf of the State by CBRE with some involvement of officials of the Prison Service. </p>  <p>  For reasons which are outlined in detail in the reports cited above, the Thornton project did not proceed.  A total of &euro;50.6 million has been spent on the Thornton site to date and this includes the site preparations, surveys, building of an access road, maintenance, legal and security fees and so on.  The biggest single expenditure was the initial purchase of the land at Thornton for &euro;29,900,000 in 2005 which was offset by the sale of surplus prison lands at Shanganagh Castle for &euro;29.6 million.  For accounting purposes, the value of the 150 acre site at Thornton continues to be recorded at the cost of &euro;29.9 million, plus investment in infrastructure and services, pending a review of its potential value and benefit to the State. </p>  <p>  In January 2015, a Working Group was established by the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality to examine options for the future use of the Thornton Hall site.  This group, comprising of officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Office of Public Works and the Irish Prison Service, was asked to review potential options for the lands and house at Thornton and make recommendations on how best to maximise the value to the State.  That work is ongoing.</p></reply>

Arising from this I met with the late Inspector of Prisons to discuss his findings and recommendations.  At that meeting I emphasised that the rights of all prisoners, including vulnerable prisoners, have to be promoted and an effective complaints system is just one aspect of achieving this goal.  The Inspector made it clear to me that he considered the Irish Prison Service has to retain a central role in the complaints process but with independent oversight and that he was satisfied that a fair and effective complaints procedure could be achieved with the implementation of his recommendations.  I also had a separate meeting with the Director General of the Irish Prison Service to see what action needed to be taken following on from the report. </p><p>One of the key recommendations in the Inspector's report is that prisoners&rsquo; complaints should be subject to review by the Ombudsman, who would also be able to deal with complaints directly in the case of undue delay.  I accepted this recommendation and officials from the Irish Prison Service and from my own Department are in advanced discussions with the Ombudsman's office with the aim of establishing an effective complaints system for prisoners.  When this is in place, the Irish Prison Service will  be in a position to implement the revised procedures.  To effect these changes, some amendment to secondary legislation may be required as well as development of the IT infrastructure.  It is not envisaged that primary legislation will be required.  </p><p>I should mention that I also accepted further recommendations made in the Inspector's report which will be reflected in the revised procedures currently under consideration. These include resolving minor complaints at the lowest level; allowing prisoners to make complaints to relevant professional bodies; prisoners being entitled to an explanation for decisions made affecting them; frivolous and vexatious complaints being addressed; and the application of fair procedures.  Similarly the recommendations on adequate training, adhering to protocols and statutory obligations, holding staff to account, not hindering the complaints procedure and having an effective communication system are accepted. </p></reply>

Female prisoners are accommodated in the D&oacute;chas Centre which is a separate facility for females within the Mountjoy Prison Campus and female offenders in the Munster area are accommodated in Limerick Female Prison.</p>  <p>  A new development for females in Limerick will see a tender for a new facility commence in July 2017 with work to commence in January 2018.  When completed this will provide 50 spaces with 7 independent living areas which will enhance the regimes and supports available to women as a stand alone facility with all the required ancillary services.  This will result in a  therapeutic environment with the view to reducing re-offending offering family links to release and the community. </p>  <p>  At present, there is no open prison facility for females, however in the joint Probation Service/Irish Prison Service Women's Strategy 2014 - 2016, "An Effective Response to Women who Offend", the Irish Prison Service gave a commitment to explore the development of an open centre/open conditions for women assessed as low risk of re-offending.  A joint Prison Service/Probation Service working group considered an open centre for women and decided to recommend step down facilities for women as a more practical and cost effective way to address the deficit rather than developing an open centre for women.  In this regard, I have given approval to the Heads of the Irish Prison Service and Probation Service to proceed to tender for the development of a step down unit for women in Dublin.  It is expected that the facility will be available towards the end of 2017.</p></reply>

These programmes can offer purposeful activity to those in custody while serving their sentences and encouraging them to lead law abiding lives on release.  These education and training programmes are available in all prisons within the Irish Prison Service and all prisoners are eligible to use the services during their prison sentences.  </p><p>On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison.  At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date.  Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral.</p><p>The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2016 - 2018.  There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning through  Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes.</p><p>As well as seeking to draw on best practice in adult and further education in the community, there has been a lot of curriculum development over the years that is specific to prison circumstances, such as courses on addiction, health issues and offending behaviour.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills provides an allocation of 220 whole time teacher equivalents in partnership with the Irish Prison Service through the Education and Training Boards (ETB).  The focus is on providing education which is quality assured, student centred and facilitates lifelong learning through helping those in custody to cope with their sentence, achieve personal development and prepare for life after release.  A broad and flexible curriculum is provided which ranges from basic literacy classes and peer led tutoring to Open University.  There is an increasing focus on QQI (formerly FETAC) accreditation as the modular structure is suitable to the needs of students in prison.</p><p>The guiding principles which underpin the prisons' work and training service are to make available work, work-training and other purposeful activities to those in custody.  Training activities are chosen to give as much variety as possible and also to give opportunities for those in prison to upskill and to acquire practical accredited skills which will help them secure employment on release.  The provision of essential prison services such as catering, industrial cleaning and laundry services also form an important part of work training and skills development in all prisons.  This budget covers equipment and supplies for work training areas across all prisons.</p><p>The Irish Prison Service has also been expanding the number of accredited courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years.  Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies such as City and Guilds and the Guild of Cleaners and Launderers and the centralising of coordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled us to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification.</p><p>The following table outlines the budgets allocated to work training and education for 2012 - 2017.  The budgets cover equipment and supplies across all prisons.  <table><tr><th><b>Year</b></th><th><b>Work Training</b></th><th><b>Education</b></th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;2 million</td><td>&euro;1.27 million</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;2 million</td><td>&euro;1.3 million</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;2.1 million</td><td>&euro;1.1 million</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>&euro;2 million</td><td>&euro;1.1 million</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>&euro;1.8 million</td><td>&euro;1.1 million</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>&euro;1.8 million</td><td>&euro;1.065 million</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The HSE has confirmed that approval has been granted for the appointment of a consultant led team to both Limerick and Cork prisons. The HSE has also advised that arrangements are being finalised for the assignment of a consultant led mental health in-reach team to Castlerea Prison. The NFMHS also provides an assessment and liaison service for all other prisons where a prisoner requires a forensic assessment, or access to an admission bed in the Central Mental Hospital, CMH.  Consultant forensic psychiatrists are leading these services and, in many settings, are supported by non-consultant hospital doctors, community psychiatric nurses, and social workers.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has confirmed that the following personnel are employed by the NFMHS in providing its services to persons in custody:  </p>  <p>  Cloverhill -  1.5 WTE, whole time equivalent, consultant forensic psychiatrist, 2 WTE non-consultant house doctor, 3 WTE community psychiatric nurses, and 1 housing resettlement officer.  </p>  <p>  Wheatfield - 0.2 WTE consultant forensic psychiatrist, 2 WTE community psychiatric nurses, and 0.1 WTE consultant forensic psychiatrist for 17 year olds.  </p>  <p>  Mountjoy - 0.3 WTE consultant forensic psychiatrist, 0.2 WTE non-consultant house doctor, 2 WTE community psychiatric nurses, and 1.3 WTE social workers, for discharge planning.  </p>  <p>  Dochas - 0.2 consultant forensic psychiatrist, 0.2 non-consultant house doctor, 1 community psychiatric nurse, and 0.5 social worker.  </p>  <p>  Arbour Hill - 0.1 WTE consultant forensic psychiatrist, 0.1 WTE community psychiatric nurses.  </p>  <p>  Midlands Prison - 1.0   WTE consultant psychiatrist, and 2 WTE community psychiatric Nurses.  </p>  <p>  Portlaoise Prison - 0.2 WTE consultant forensic psychiatrist.  </p>  <p>  Castlerea - 0.6 WTE senior registrar, and 0.2 WTE community psychiatric nurse.  </p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has access to a limited number of places in the CMH for prisoners who require residential mental health treatment.  There is currently an average of 20 prisoners each week awaiting transfer to the CMH.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service, in collaboration with the NFMHS, has established two dedicated areas where high support is provided to vulnerable prisoners with mental illness; D2 wing in Cloverhill Prison, for remand prisoners, and the high support unit in Mountjoy, for sentenced prisoners.  Both units provide a dedicated area within the prison where mentally ill and vulnerable prisoners, who present with a risk of harm to self or to others, can be separated from the general prison population and are closely monitored in a safer environment.</p>  <p>  A psychiatric in-reach and court liaison service, PICLS, is delivered by the HSE/CMH at Cloverhill Prison.  The diversion system ensures as far as possible that those people presenting before the courts, or indeed at an earlier stage of the criminal justice system, where the infraction is a reflection of an underlying mental illness, are referred and treated appropriately.  This approach has reduced the number of mentally ill people committed to prison.  </p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service Psychology Service also plays a key role in the provision of mental health services for people in custody.  Specifically, the psychology service provides various evidence-based primary, secondary and tertiary care talking therapies for people in custody who experience mental health difficulties.  Interventions include "whole population initiatives" in conjunction with the multi-disciplinary team to raise awareness of mental health, individual therapy and group based interventions.  </p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service Psychology Service is currently comprised of six senior psychologists, 13 staff grade psychologists, one head of psychology, and 6 assistant psychologists.</p>  <p>  All healthcare staff, including prison doctors, prison nurses, and locum healthcare staff, also provide ongoing support to all persons in custody.</p></reply>

Before a final determination a number of factors may be taken into account including:</p><p>-  the nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence being served by the person relates</p><p>-  the sentence concerned and any recommendation made by the Court in relation to the sentence imposed</p><p>-  the period of the sentence served by the person</p><p>-  the potential threat to the safety and security of the public should the person be released</p><p>-  the person's previous criminal record</p><p>-  the risk of the person failing to return to prison at the expiration of the period of temporary release</p><p>-  the conduct of the person while in custody or while previously on temporary release</p><p>-  any report or recommendation made by the Governor, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a Probation &amp;amp; Welfare Officer, or any other person whom the Minister considers may be of assistance in coming to a decision as to whether to grant temporary release</p><p>-  the risk that the person might commit an offence during any period of temporary release</p><p>-  the risk of the person failing to comply with any of the conditions of temporary release</p><p>-  the likelihood that a period of temporary release might accelerate the person's reintegration into society or improve his prospects of obtaining employment.</p><p>Temporary release assists in gradually preparing suitable offenders for release and in administering short sentences, and is an incentive to prisoners.  It is an important vehicle for re-integrating an offender into the community in a planned way.  The generally accepted view is that the risk to the community is reduced by planned re-integration of offenders compared with their return to the community on the completion of their full sentence.  Each application for temporary release for whatever reason, including those referred to in your question, is examined on its own merits and the safety of the public is paramount when decisions are made.</p><p>In addition, all releases are subject to conditions, which in the vast majority of cases include a requirement to report on a daily basis to the offender's Garda Station.  Of course, any offender who breaches his or her conditions may be arrested and returned to prison immediately by the Garda&iacute; or may be refused another period of reviewable temporary release.</p></reply>

In addition, prisoners who have engaged in authorised structured activity may apply to receive enhanced remission of greater than one quarter but not exceeding one third of their sentence.  In order for a prisoner to be granted enhanced remission, I must be satisfied that the prisoner is less likely to re-offend and is better able to re-integrate into the community<i>.</i></p><p>The principles governing the awarding of enhanced remission are contained under Rule 59 of the Prison Rules 2007 to 2014 (S.I. No. 252 of 2007 and S.I. No. 385 of 2014).  For all applications, the following factors are considered - </p><p>-  the manner and extent to which the prisoner has engaged constructively in authorised structured activity</p><p>-  the manner and extent to which the prisoner has taken steps to address his or offending behaviour</p><p>-  the nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence of imprisonment being served by the prisoner relates</p><p>-  the sentence of imprisonment concerned and any recommendations of the court that imposed that sentence in relation thereto</p><p>-  the period of the sentence served by the prisoner</p><p>-  the potential threat to the safety and security of members of the public (including the victim of the offence to which the sentence of imprisonment being served by the prisoner relates) should the prisoner be released from prison</p><p>-  any offence of which the prisoner was convicted before being convicted of the offence to which the sentence of imprisonment being served by him or relates</p><p>-  the conduct of the prisoner while in custody or during a period of temporary release</p><p>-  any report of, or recommendation made by the Governor of the prison, an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, any probation officer or any other person whom I consider would be of assistance in enabling me to make a decision on an application.</p><p>Information prior to 2014 regarding enhanced remission application is not  available.  I am advised that the Irish Prison Service introduced a database in 2014 to track the number of applications and decisions for enhanced remission up to one third remission.  The current number of granted enhanced remission by year and by prison is set out in the following table.  Decisions regarding applications for enhanced remission under the Prison Rules are generally made by Irish Prison Service officials on my behalf.<table><tr><th>Prison</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017 </th></tr><tr><td>Arbour Hill</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Castlerea</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Cloverhill</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>1</td><td>12</td><td>9</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Dochas</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Loughan House</td><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>22</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td>3</td><td>14</td><td>12</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Mountjoy</td><td>3</td><td>55</td><td>12</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Portlaoise</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Shelton Abbey</td><td>4</td><td>16</td><td>30</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Training Unit</td><td>9</td><td>24</td><td>23</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Wheatfield</td><td>1</td><td>40</td><td>13</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>25</td><td>181</td><td>138</td><td>25</td></tr></table>(Figures as of 27 March 2017) </p><p>Note previous PQ answer 29835/15 indicated a figure of 180 for Year 2015 which has now been amended to 181 upon further examination of cases.</p></reply>

Some 92% of the Report's 173 recommendations are now implemented, partially implemented or are in progress, a significant increase on the 80% figure reported when the first audit of progress was published last June.  Details of progress on all of the 173 recommendations are available in the audit report which has been posted on my Department's website and on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.  In conjunction with the implementation of the recommendations of the Working Group, my Department is implementing the commitment contained in the Programme for a Partnership Government to reform the Direct Provision system within two broad themes: commencement of the International Protection Act 2015 and improvements to RIA accommodation.</p><p>The International Protection Act 2015 was commenced on 31 December 2016.  The new single application procedure under the Act, will, in time, significantly accelerate the protection determination process by dealing with all aspects of a persons claim for protection and humanitarian leave to remain at the same time and by extension will reduce the length of time which applicants spend in State provided accommodation.</p><p>Figures prepared for consideration by the <i>Working Group to Report to Government on Improvements to the Protection Process, including Direct Provision and other supports for Asylum Seekers</i>in 2015, showed that there were some 2,695 persons in Direct Provision accommodation for three or more years at that time.  Recent analysis has shown that this figure has now been reduced by 55%, to 1,204 persons.  Similarly, the number of persons in Direct Provision accommodation for five years or more has been reduced by 58%, from 1,946 persons to 811 persons.  Of those persons, less than a third - or 251 persons - were estimated to be awaiting a final decision on their application.  For one reason or another, such as ongoing judicial reviews, the vast majority of these cases were found to be unprocessable and experience has shown that practically all cases over five years in the Direct Provision accommodation system that could be processed have now been processed.  This was a major achievement and has impacted directly on the lives of a large number of persons in the protection and related systems.  The balance of the 811 persons either had a deportation made against them or were granted status.  Recently, a number of NGOs have been awarded monies under the EU's Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) specifically to provide assistance for those with status to move out of State provided accommodation.</p><p>In addition, a number of the Reports recommendations aimed at improving conditions in the Centres are being rolled out.  These include:</p><p>-  The introduction of full independent living at the Mosney Accommodation centre - each family will be provided with their own fresh food to their liking so they may prepare meals themselves.  The new home cooking arrangements in Mosney went live on 23 January 2017.</p><p>-  The installation of residents&rsquo; kitchens in a number of accommodation centres to provide for home cooking by residents and their families;</p><p>-  Cooking facilities will be rolled out to other centres including the State owned centres (Killarney, Tralee, Athlone, Knocklisheen in Limerick and Kinsale Road in Cork) and to Ballyhaunis, Millstreet, St Patrick&rsquo;s in Monaghan and any other centres in which families are resident.</p><p>-  A complete refurbishment of each accommodation unit (triple glazed windows and doors and refurbished interiors) at the Athlone Accommodation Centre;</p><p>-  Improvements to a number of outdoor playgrounds and football pitches to provide for &lsquo;all-weather&rsquo; facilities.</p><p>-  Teenagers rooms in centres to provide social areas for this age group.</p><p>Recommendations of the Report of the Working Group that involve structural changes or improvements will be implemented as quickly as possible, with due consideration of possible fire safety, building regulation and planning issues.</p><p>Other improvements to the system include changes introduced by the Minister for Education and Skills to improve access to third level education and the increase in the weekly payments for children by the Minister for Social Protection.</p><p>In addition, as I recently announced, the remits of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children are being extended to cover those who are living in State provided accommodation.</p><p>With regard to the way that Direct Provision Centres are operated, my Department has recently sought expressions of interest from persons and businesses who are in a position to provide full accommodation and related services to persons seeking international protection.  It is of course open to any contractor or NGO (or group of NGOs) to seek to provide this accommodation and related services.  I would welcome applications from groups or organisations who have expressed concerns about the standards in Direct Provision to submit their proposals to provide, run and manage such centres.  In other EU Member States, reception centres are quite often managed by NGOs in partnership with the State.  We have not, to date, received any expressions of interest by an NGO or an NGO group to manage an accommodation centre in Ireland.  While the financial details of any such contract are not published for reasons of commercial confidentiality, historic details of the values of contracts are published by my Department each year on the web page of the Reception and Integration Agency at <i>www.ria.gov.ie</i>.  Accommodation centres are contracted following established procurement procedures and prices paid to contractors for full board or self catering / cooking, including light, heat, utility costs etc represent good value for money.</p></reply>

The statutory conditions are that the applicant must -</p><p>-  be of full age,</p><p>-  be of good character,</p><p>-  have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a further total residence in the State amounting to four years,</p><p>-  intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation,</p><p>-  have, <font color="#212100">before a judge of the District Court in open court, in a citizenship ceremony or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows -</font></p><p><font color="#212100">(i) made a declaration, in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, and</font></p><p><font color="#212100">(ii) undertaken to faithfully observe the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values.</font></p><p>Under Irish law it is possible for an Irish citizen to hold dual citizenship; the acquisition of Irish citizenship is not contingent on the renunciation of the citizenship of another jurisdiction.

Applicants were also advised that they might be asked at that time to provide additional information to assist in the processing of their application.</p>  <p>  The prioritisation of international protection applications is provided for in the International Protection Act 2015 subject to the need for fairness and efficiency.

All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  A determination on whether an applicant satisfies the statutory criteria attendant to naturalisation can only be made after an application is received and, to date, no application for naturalisation has been received from the individual concerned.</p><p>Section 15 of the Act provides that the Minister may, in her absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation if satisfied that certain statutory conditions are fulfilled.  The conditions are that the applicant must:</p><p>- be of full age, </p><p>-  be of good character, </p><p>- have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a further total residence in the State amounting to four years,</p><p>- intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation,</p><p>- have, before a judge of the District Court in open court, in a citizenship ceremony or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows</p><p>(i) made a declaration, in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, and</p><p>(ii) undertaken to faithfully observe the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values.</p><p>Section 15A provides that, notwithstanding the above, where the application is based on being the spouse or civil partner of an Irish citizen the requirements are, inter alia, that the couple are married or civil partners to each other for a period of at least 3 years and are living together and, immediately before the date of application, have a period of one year's continuous residence in the island of Ireland and, during the preceding four years, have a further period amounting to 2 years (i.e. 3 years in total).  Section 15A(2) provides that the Minister may, in her absolute discretion waive some of the conditions in relation to an application from a spouse or civil partner of an Irish citizen if she is satisfied that the applicant would suffer serious consequences in respect of his or her bodily integrity or liberty if not granted Irish citizenship.  There is no right or entitlement to have any of the conditions waived, it is entirely at the Minister's discretion. </p><p>It is open to any individual to lodge an application for citizenship if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements as prescribed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended.  Detailed information on Irish citizenship and naturalisation is available on the INIS website at <i>www.inis.gov.ie</i>.  The website also contains an online naturalisation residency calculator which individuals may find of assistance in establishing if the residency requirements are met.</p><p>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-30a.319.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017033000062#WRJ01700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115 to 119, inclusive, together.</p><p>I can inform the Deputy that I have met with the Garda Commissioner and the Chairperson of the Policing Authority in the past days and have communicated my very serious concerns in relation to the significant road traffic enforcement errors that have come to light following the completion of extensive internal audits by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has confirmed that it has put solutions in place to deal with the procedural and practice issues that have been detected to ensure that such errors do not recur.  Specifically, I have been assured by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that a permanent and comprehensive IT solution is now in place to cover the majority of FCPS issues identified and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is satisfied that the errors that occurred cannot be repeated.  In the case of breath tests/Mandatory Alcohol Testing, I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na initially put in place new paper based recording and verification processes, and, in November 2016, a new specific data recording IT upgrade was installed on the Garda PULSE system.  The net effect of the new IT upgrade was that personnel now have to record the serial number of the device used for each breath test plus the meter reading before and after the checkpoint was concluded.  Data from the device is now used to verify the total number of breath tests conducted at each checkpoint.</p><p>In addition, the Garda Commissioner has:</p><p>- announced the restructuring of traffic policing with the creation of a new Roads Policing Unit to be led by Assistant Commissioner Mick Finn; </p><p>- announced the creation of a dedicated team under newly-appointed Assistant Commissioner Michael O&rsquo;Sullivan to investigate in detail the MATs issue, including with a view to identifying and holding responsible for their actions any Garda members, whether at junior, supervisory or management level, who acted improperly; and</p><p>- committed to forwarding the report of this investigation to the Policing Authority and Department of Justice and Equality when completed.</p><p>As regards carrying out and recording breath tests under Mandatory Alcohol Testing, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to identify specific internal system failures in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na until such time as Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan's investigation is completed.  Similarly, in addition to the solutions put in place by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na outlined above, additional proposals to improve the recording, verification and management of road traffic enforcement data on the PULSE system arising from  Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan's investigation will be pursued following the completion of the investigation.  While I acknowledge that a number of the Deputy's questions seek to identify Garda members responsible for the oversight of these road traffic enforcement matters in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, these enforcement issues are also of grave concern to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at a corporate level.</p><p>Notwithstanding any internal review the Government believes that an external investigation into these two specific matters needs be carried out.</p><p>The Government believes the level of public concern is now so profound that it may now be time to conduct a thorough, comprehensive and independent root-and-branch review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is clearly a proposal that will require further detailed consideration by the Government.</p><p>  The Government also believes that any such proposal should command widespread support in the Oireachtas and accordingly be the subject of consultation with the Opposition, and ultimately approval by the Oireachtas.</p><p>The Garda Commissioner has been in direct contact with the Policing Authority in relation to the matters referred to in the Deputy's questions and the Chairperson of the Policing Authority, Josephine Feehily, has confirmed that the Authority will:</p><p>- have an independent professional audit undertaken of the steps taken to resolve the issues; and</p><p>- oversee the investigation being undertaken by Assistant Commissioner O&rsquo;Sullivan.</p><p>I welcome the fact that the focus of the Authority's next public meeting with the Garda Commissioner will be on road traffic enforcement.  This public meeting will be held on 27 April 2017 and will provide a most timely opportunity for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to engage with the Authority and the general public on these critical procedural and practice issues that are now before us.  The reason that I prioritised and set up the Authority was to shine a light on and examine issues such as these.</p><p>I will continue to maintain close contact with the Garda Commissioner and the Chairperson of the Policing Authority in relation to these matters.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that, in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his or her Division.</p><p>I am further informed by the Garda Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Kildare Division, on 28 February 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 326.  There are also<b></b>22 Garda Reserves and 30 civilians attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. </p><p>This plan is well on course to be achieved.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p><p>I am advised that, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, there has been a total intake of some 1,400 new recruits with another 600 scheduled to enter the College by the end of this year.  I am informed by the Commissioner that some 839 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 45 of whom have been assigned to the Kildare Division.  I am also informed that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - a net increase of 700 in the total Garda strength since recruitment recommenced. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Kildare Division in the coming years. </p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and classroom based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme. </p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.</p></reply>

I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to pro-actively and resolutely tackle all forms of drug and organised crime in this jurisdiction. </p>  <p>  In 2015 the Garda Commissioner, who is responsible for the allocation of Garda Resources, established a new national Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  The Bureau continues to lead out the policing strategy for tackling drugs by demand reduction and supply reduction strategies.  In this regard the Bureau continues its policy of working with Divisional Drug Units nationwide in tackling supply reduction at local level.  This work is further supported by other national units, including the Criminal Assets Bureau, in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs.  This approach allows for the co-ordinated use of Garda resources in tackling all forms of organised crime, including illicit drug activity nationwide.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau has continued to make significant seizures of controlled drugs as evidenced by a number of significant seizures made in January this year including a huge seizure of herbal cannabis - estimated at that time to have a street value of over &euro;30 million - made as a result of a targeted joint operation involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Revenue's Customs Service.</p>  <p>  Multi-disciplinary approaches are also utilised to ensure that those involved in illicit activity are effectively targeted including through the use of the Proceeds of Crime legislation, money laundering legislation and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p>  <p>  I am informed that this approach adopts good practice in implementing a co-ordinated use of Garda resources and in utilising available criminal law to its fullest extent in tackling all forms of organised crime, including drug trafficking.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.

Counsel for the IRM pointed out that the appropriate forum for raising matters related to alleged Garda failings was the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) who were already investigating certain matters arising from the tragic death in this case.  This arises in part from the fact that my predecessor had referred aspects of this particular case to GSOC.

If no agreement is reached, the matter will proceed to a more formal investigation and adjudication, and the parties will be issued with a legally binding Finding.

However, the Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes obligations on regulated entities in relation to their interactions with consumers.  Where a regulated entity intends to cease operating, merge with another, or to transfer all or part of its regulated activities to another regulated entity, Provision 3.11 of the Consumer Protection Code states that it must: a. notify the Central Bank immediately; b. provide at least two months notice to affected consumers to enable them to make alternative arrangements; c. ensure all outstanding business is properly completed prior to the transfer, merger or cessation of operations or, alternatively in the case of a transfer or merger, inform the consumer of how continuity of service will be provided following the transfer or merger; and d. in the case of a merger or transfer of regulated activities, inform the consumer that their details are being transferred to the other regulated entity, if that is the case.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has a range of powers available to it to investigate non-compliance with its requirements and its approach to regulating financial services providers and markets, whilst ensuring the protection of consumers, is based on a model of assertive risk-based supervision underpinned by a credible threat of enforcement.</p></reply>

Reasons provided to the Cost of Insurance Working Group for the large recent increases in motor insurance premiums included a cross-industry re-balancing process following a period, approximately from 2010 to 2014, when premiums were widely under-priced, growth in the frequency and cost of settling claims, and a significant rise in the levels of reserves set aside for claims expected to be paid in the future.</p>  <p>  I am not aware of any evidence that the exaggerated  number of roadside drink-driving breathalyser tests provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would have had any direct impact on the general cost of motor insurance.</p></reply>

The VAT Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS), which is an optional scheme, also came into operation on 1 January 2015 allowing business to submit returns and pay the relevant VAT due to EU Member States through the web portal of one Member State, instead of having to register for VAT in multiple Member States.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the amount of VAT collected on behalf of and subsequently remitted to each EU Member State is in accordance with EU rules governing the place of supply of TBE services and is paid in a timely fashion. </p>  <p>  The apparent underpayment highlighted by the Deputy is in fact a transitional feature of the changeover to the new VAT rules, whereby the Member State which collects the VAT can retain a proportion of the VAT due to other Member States for a set period.  When the scheme to tax TBE services in the place of the consumer was agreed, it was decided to provide that 30% of the monies collected under MOSS would be retained by the Member State of the supplier in 2015 and 2016; 15% would be retained in 2017 and 2018, before transitioning to a full transfer of funds under MOSS from 2019 on.  In 2016, for example, the amount of VAT remitted to other Member States in relation to TBE services was the total amount of VAT collected on behalf of other Member States minus the retention fee of, at that time, 30%.</p></reply>

Under the new regulation, the applicable VAT rules on the supply of TBE services in intra-EU transactions are those in the Member State where the consumer resides.</p>  <p>  The publication of National Accounts data, including GDP and GNP, is the responsibility of the Central Statistics Office (CSO).  Assessing the impact of the new rules on GDP is complex given the wide range of services covered by the regulation, the need to account for the impact on Irish suppliers as well as Irish consumers and the fact that there are different VAT regimes across the EU.  However, it is likely that the ultimate impact on GDP would be negligible as a number of these factors would net off.  The initial estimates of 2016 GDP and GNP data were published by the CSO in the quarterly national accounts for the fourth quarter of 2016 earlier this month.  These showed GDP growth of 5.2 per cent and GNP growth of 9.0 per cent.  The final figure for 2016 will be published with the National Income and Expenditure data for 2016 due in June.  </p>  <p>  The most recent assessment of the economic outlook was published as part of the Economic and Fiscal Outlook in Budget 2017.  At that time, my department was forecasting real GDP growth of 3.5 per cent this year and real GNP growth of 3.3 per cent.

The report is the latest in a series of status updates since the Examination commenced and sets out the progress being made by lenders in completing the review.  The report also sets out information on the Central Bank's enforcement powers and activity in response to the tracker mortgage issues identified to date.  The Examination Framework, the Principles for Redress and the Appeals Process set out by the Central Bank have also been published, in conjunction with the report.</p>  <p>  In all, approximately 9,900 customer accounts have been identified as impacted by lenders, as part of the Examination, as at end February 2017.  The Central Bank also identified 7,100 accounts where a tracker-related issue was resolved before the commencement of the system-wide Tracker Mortgage Examination.  Lenders have commenced contacting impacted customers identified as at end February 2017 and have rectified the interest rates applied to such impacted customers' accounts, thus stopping further detriment.  As at the date of the Report, interest rates have been rectified on more than 90% of the accounts that require such rectification. </p>  <p>  To end February 2017, approximately &euro;78m has been paid in redress and compensation to approximately 2,600 impacted customers identified as part of the Examination.</p>  <p>  Due to statutory confidentiality requirements, the Central Bank has advised me that it may not publicly disclose much of its supervisory engagement with individual firms.  In particular, the Central Bank can, generally speaking, only disclose such information in summary or aggregate form so that individual firms cannot be identified.  The Central Bank has to be careful that any public disclosures made by it do not breach its statutory confidentiality requirements or prejudice any ongoing or possible future supervisory or enforcement actions.</p></reply>

The majority of products and services that credit unions wish to offer are accommodated within that legislation and require no additional approval from the Registry.  However if approval is required it is a matter for the Registrar of Credit Union at the Central Bank.  The important considerations for credit unions are that they understand the nature of the risks involved in any new product or business line, the financial implications in terms of overall return on assets and product investment, that they have the necessary control and governance framework to oversee their business.  The Registry of Credit Unions does not publish details of bilateral applications. </p>  <p>  Recent developments in business model evolution are social housing investments which requires amendment to Regulations as provided for under Section 43 (2)(c).  The Central Bank will shortly issue a consultation paper on proposed changes to the regulations expanding the list of eligible investments. </p>  <p>  Longer term lending engagement has centered around mortgages and changes to longer term lending limits which would require amendement to Regulations.  The Central Bank informs me that it has yet to receive any concrete proposals around such changes.  The Central Bank has indicated it is prepared to review longer term lending limits and has highlighted asset and liability management, funding profile and funding sources as areas for consideration in developing such proposals.  This review is in line with the Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) recommendation of a full review of s35 lending limits and concentration limits.  Further work is being undertaken in this area by the Implementation Group established to implement the CUAC recommendations.  </p>  <p>  Services or products not accommodated within the existing legislation and regulation can be applied for under the Additional Services Framework under sections 48 to 52 of the Credit Union Act 1997.  In relation to current account services including payment instruments such as debit cards, the Registrar of Credit Unions recently approved six credit unions that applied for and were approved for this new business line.  The Central Bank is currently reviewing a number of additional applications for this service.</p></reply>

This provides credit unions with the right to appeal certain decisions of the Central Bank to IFSAT.  Appealable decisions include:</p><p>- certain decisions in the Credit Union Act, 1997 (1997 Act)</p><p>- refusal of approval under the Central Bank Reform Act 2010</p><p>- findings or orders of an inquiry under the Administrative Sanctions Procedure.</p><p>Decisions in relation to requests for changes to Regulations 2016 are not appealable to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal.</p><p>However, under section 84A of the Credit Union Act, 1997 the Central Bank before making regulations is required to consult with:</p><p>- The Minister and the Credit Union Advisory Committee,</p><p>- Any other body that appears to the Bank to have expertise or knowledge of credit unions generally, and</p><p>- Any other body that the Bank considers appropriate to consult in the circumstances.</p><p>The Consultation Protocol for Credit Unions, published by the Central Bank in 2012, indicates that the Central Bank will consult on new regulations that will, in the view of the Central Bank, potentially have a significant impact on the business of credit unions.  The consultation process for the 2016 Regulations (CP88) took place in 2015 and attracted 117 submissions from representative bodies, individual credit unions, credit union Chapters and from professional bodies, TD s and investment firms.  The Central Bank published a Feedback Statement and all submissions received are available on the Central Bank's website. </p><p>Since the provision of new regulation making powers to the Central Bank, the Registry of Credit Unions is in a position to review and update the regulations as appropriate on a timely basis and following consultation.  The Central Bank is keen to ensure that the regulations remain appropriate for the credit union sector and where credit unions set out a clear path on how they wish to develop, they will consider any amendments to the regulations that may be appropriate. </p><p>The Central Bank is in the process of reviewing investment regulations for credit unions considering a number of factors including expanding the permitted classes of investments.  In line with the published consultation protocol, once the Central Bank have completed their review and analysis and developed proposals, they will undertake a consultation with credit unions and representative bodies and associations.  This will be in the form of a public consultation on draft investment regulations, which will provide a framework for them to seek, receive, analyse and respond to feedback on their proposals prior to finalisation and publication. </p></reply>

The peer review report was published in September 2015.  The basis for the peer review was the 'ICURN Guiding Principles for Effective Prudential Supervision of Cooperative Financial Institutions (2011)', which were developed using the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision as a guide.</p><p>The overall finding in the peer review report was that the Central Bank effectively performs its functions in the regulation and supervision of the credit union sector in Ireland and had effectively undertaken the demanding task of introducing a comprehensive regulatory structure of credit unions.  The report assessed the Central Bank's performance against twenty-three Guiding Principles with each one assessed using five grading categories.  ICURN provided a rating of 'Compliant' for twenty Guiding Principles and 'Largely Compliant' for three Guiding Principles. </p><p>Guiding Principle 1 focused on the effectiveness of the legal framework, including powers for authorisation, supervision, powers to enforce compliance with relevant laws, safety and soundness and legal protection for supervisors.  The ICURN review rated the Central Bank compliant for guiding principle 1.</p><p>The review included some recommendations for refinements under the following three broad areas:</p><p>- Supervisory Approach;</p><p>- Communications and Guidance; and</p><p>- Resources.</p><p>I have been informed by the Central Bank that it has taken actions and initiatives to implement these recommendations.  The full ICURN peer review report is available on the Central Bank's website.  </p><p>Based on ICURN's overall finding in the 2015 peer review report that the Central Bank effectively performs its functions in the regulation and supervision of the credit union sector in Ireland and based on my Department's regular interaction with the Registry, I am satisfied that more regular reviews are not warranted. </p></reply>

This report was agreed by all stakeholders, including credit union representative bodies.  Over 60 of these recommendations were reflected in the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 (2012 Act), which was enacted on 19 December 2012.  The 2012 Act was commenced in tranches over a period of time with the last tranche commenced on 1 January 2016.</p>  <p>  Those sections of the 2012 Act commenced on 1 January 2016, replaced, amended or supplemented sections of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and provided the Central Bank with the power to make regulations.  Amendment of these regulations is a matter for the Central Bank.</p>  <p>  In order to increase transparency and confidence in the regulation making process, consultation arrangements are provided for in 84A(2).  The Consultation Protocol for Credit Unions, published by the Central Bank in 2012, indicates that the Central Bank will consult on new regulations that will, in the view of the Central Bank, potentially have a significant impact on the business of credit unions.  Under section 84A of the Credit Union Act, 1997 the Central Bank before making regulations is required to consult with:</p>  <p>  - The Minister and the Credit Union Advisory Committee,</p>  <p>  - Any other body that appears to the Bank to have expertise or knowledge of credit unions generally, and</p>  <p>  - Any other body that the Bank considers appropriate to consult in the circumstances.</p></reply>

This process has determined the level of concentrated disadvantage across the school system and identifies those schools in need of the greatest level of support.</p>  <p>  The key data sources include the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases as populated by schools and the CSO Small Area of Population (SAP) data from the National Census of Population 2011 as represented by the Pobal HP Deprivation Index (HP Index).  Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates.  This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.  This data is applied uniformly across all schools in the country.</p>  <p>  In its initial application, the new identification model has identified that there are schools in disadvantaged areas, not previously included in DEIS, whose level of disadvantage is significantly higher than many schools already in the programme.  Accordingly, we are moving as a first step to include these schools in the DEIS School Support Programme. </p>  <p>  Schools which have not been included, including the school referred to by the Deputy, are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort, under the new identification process, which is fair, objective and has been uniformly applied.  I am fully aware that there are further schools whose concentrated level of disadvantage may not be at the highest level, but may nevertheless be at a level which warrants additional supports for pupils under DEIS. </p>  <p>  However, as noted in the DEIS Plan, the implementation of a new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model.  Once this work has been completed, consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.</p>  <p>  In delivering on the DEIS Plan 2017 we must be conscious that there are ongoing changes in demographics which may be more marked in some areas than others.  Populations in some areas have changed considerably since schools were originally evaluated for inclusion in DEIS in 2006.  The new model may reveal that some schools currently included in DEIS have a level of disadvantage within their school population much lower than that in some schools not included within DEIS.  If this turns out to be the case, then we must consider whether it is fair that those schools continue receiving these additional resources, using resources that may be more fairly allocated to the schools with greater levels of disadvantage.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the fact that a school has not been included in the DEIS programme on this occasion does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should its level of disadvantage warrant the allocation of additional resources.</p>  <p>  As provided for in the DEIS Action Plan the Department has begun a process of verifying the data used to identify the levels of concentrated disadvantage for each school that has requested verification including the school detailed by the Deputy.  When this process has been concluded all schools who have requested such verification will be notified by the Department of the outcome of this process.</p></reply>

The objective was to assess demand arising within the sector in Ireland including hotels, restaurants, bars, canteens and catering over the period to 2020.  The aim was to ensure that there will be the right supply of skills to help drive domestic hospitality sector business and employment growth.  The report provides a clear and coherent framework for the development of talent in the hospitality sector in the years ahead to help drive both hospitality business and employment growth which is one the key goals of the Government&rsquo;s Tourism Policy Statement &ndash; People, Place and Policy-Growing Tourism to 2025. </p><p>The Study assesses skills demand at all NFQ levels, with a particular focus on career progression opportunities for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings.  The report provides a set of recommendations designed to address the skills requirements of the sector over the period to 2020.  A key recommendation in the report was the need to set up of a National Oversight and Advisory Group comprising all the key hospitality stakeholders.  </p><p>Membership of the Group includes the Restaurant Association of Ireland, the Irish Hotel Federation, Irish Hospitality Institute, Licensed Vintners Association, Vintners Federation of Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Department of Education and Skills, Department of Social Protection, Higher Education Authority, Skillnets, SOLAS, ETBs, IoTs, DIT and Quality and Qualifications Ireland. </p><p>The role of the Group is to monitor progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the EGFSN and to provide a forum for on-going collaboration in addressing the skills needs of the sector and to identify and progress actions to overcome barriers on its implementation.  </p><p>The Group plan to publish a progress report later this year.  To date work has been undertaken on careers promotion via a range of fora, the launch of the Tourism Insight online programme &ndash;aimed at promoting careers in tourism and hospitality with particular reference to transition year and Youthreach participants.  Audits of both higher and further education facilities and courses are underway as well as the establishment of a Restaurant and Hospitality Skillnet which aims to address key skills requirements of restaurants and catering companies to help drive the domestic hospitality sector, employment growth, talent attraction and retention. </p><p>Funded through the National Training Fund by my Department, the network plans to design tailored programmes covering all aspects of the restaurant, food and beverage industry to SMEs nationally, with a particular focus on career progression for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings and increase retention levels within the sector and is well placed to address key recommendations of the EGFSN 2015 Report on the Future Skills.</p><p>I recently launched the 2016-2020 Action Plan to expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland, setting out how state agencies, education and training providers and employers will work together to deliver on the Programme for Government commitments on the expansion of apprenticeship and traineeship in the period to 2020.  The Plan sets out how we will manage the pipeline of new apprenticeships already established through the first call for proposals in 2015 and also commits to a new call for apprenticeship proposals later this year, to provide for the needs of all sectors, including hospitality and tourism.  Over the lifetime of the Action Plan, 50,000 people will be registered on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes representing a doubling of current activity. </p><p>Work is progressing on the development of a new Commis Chef Apprenticeship led by the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland working with Kerry Education and Training Board.  It is planned that this programme will commence later this year.  The Apprenticeship Council also recently approved development funding for a separate proposal to develop a Chef de Partie Apprenticeship.  The Apprenticeship Council will continue to work with the proposers of these new programmes to develop them into sustainable apprenticeships that can be delivered on a nationwide basis.  The funding for planned and forecast expansion in 2017 will see an additional &euro;20 million provided.  </p><p>In 2015 a new Career Traineeship initiative was begun by SOLAS in collaboration with ETBs and enterprise to develop a more effective model of work-based learning, primarily at NFQ levels 4 and 5, incorporating best national and international research and practice. Networks of Employers have been created to facilitate partnerships between ETBs and employers in identifying training needs, designing the training programmes, recruitment of learners and delivery of the training on and off the job.  The Career Traineeship model of work-based learning is currently being piloted with the Hospitality and Engineering sectors, with the involvement of seven ETBs.</p><p>Given the breadth and range of programmes within the Further Education and Training (FET) sector, it is not possible to provide details of funding and places on a county by county basis across specific sectoral provision.  However, one way in which Solas classify FET provision is by the career areas which it serves.  The following table shows the total number of beneficiaries in the career areas of Food and Beverage and Tourism for Limerick Clare Education and Training Boards for 2015 along with that planned for 2016.  As yet, final 2016 figures are not available. </p><p>While it is not possible to give details of expenditure at the level of career areas, the scale of total investment in FET and the numbers served on both a full and part time basis are also included in the table.  </p><p>In relation to the number of tourism and hospitality skills training positions within the higher education sector in 2015 and 2016 and the amount of funding allocated for tourism and hospitality skills training in the same years, it is not possible to give a breakdown by county as students can apply for courses throughout the country, through the CAO application process.

The DEIS Plan for 2017 sets out our vision for future intervention in the critical area of social inclusion in education policy.</p>  <p>  DEIS Plan 2017 provides for a new identification model for assessment of a school's level of disadvantage using centrally held data.  The key data sources include the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases as populated by schools and the CSO Small Area of Population (SAP) data from the National Census of Population 2011 as represented by the Pobal HP Deprivation Index (HP Index).  Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates.  This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.  This data is applied uniformly across all schools in the country. </p>  <p>  Schools are not required to make an application for inclusion in the DEIS programme as all schools in the country across both the Primary and Post Primary sectors have been assessed in terms of the socio-economic background of their pupil cohort using centrally held data.  This process has determined the level of concentrated disadvantage across the school system and identifies those schools in need of the greatest level of support. </p>  <p>  In its initial application, the new identification model has identified that there are schools in disadvantaged areas, not previously included in DEIS, whose level of disadvantage is at the same level as the current DEIS category for schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage.  This includes 15 new Urban Band 1 schools, 30 Urban Band 2 schools raised to Urban Band 1 status, 51 new Rural DEIS schools and 13 new Post Primary DEIS schools. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, we are moving as a first step to include these schools in the DEIS School Support Programme.  Schools included in the list published by my Department on 13th February are those whose level of concentrated disadvantage has been identified as being </p>  <p>  Schools which have not been included, including the school referred to by the Deputy, are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort, under the new identification process, which is fair, objective and has been uniformly applied.  I am fully aware that there are further schools whose concentrated level of disadvantage may not be at the highest level, but may nevertheless be at a level which warrants additional supports for pupils under DEIS. </p>  <p>  However, as noted in the DEIS Plan, the implementation of a new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model.  Once this work has been completed, consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.</p>  <p>  In delivering on the DEIS Plan 2017 we must be conscious that there are ongoing changes in demographics which may be more marked in some areas than others.  Populations in some areas have changed considerably since schools were originally evaluated for inclusion in DEIS in 2006.  The new model may reveal that some schools currently included in DEIS have a level of disadvantage within their school population much lower than that in some schools not included within DEIS.  If this turns out to be the case, then we must consider whether it is fair that those schools continue receiving these additional resources, using resources that may be more fairly allocated to the schools with greater levels of disadvantage.</p>  <p>  The DEIS Plan provides for a verification process and any school wishing to seek verification of the information used to assess the level of disadvantage of its pupil cohort may submit an application for same to social_inclusion@education.gov.ie.</p></reply>

This 2016 update report reveals a 85% drop in the unfinished developments since 2010, from nearly 3,000 to 420, with 248 developments resolved in 2016 alone.</p>  <p>  My Department's objective is to resolve all remaining unfinished housing developments, especially those within high market demand locations. The results of the 2016 survey indicate that the parts of developments that are occupied are in the vast amount of cases now well established and finished to a good standard. </p>  <p>  My Department engages with all local authorities, including Louth County Council, on unfinished housing developments to keep their progress under constant review.  In this context, Louth County Council advised my Department last October of the development in question where there is one occupied unit within an incomplete development.</p>  <p>  In advance of categorising the development, clarification was sought by my Department as to whether the area in question represented an &lsquo;unfinished&rsquo; housing development as opposed to a cluster of individual or one-off homes.</p>  <p>  Louth County Council subsequently contacted my Department on 10 January, proposing that the Department consider adding this estate to the list of unfinished housing developments as the Council had established it was an &lsquo;unfinished&rsquo; development.  However, at that stage, my Department had already completed and finalised the 2016 survey. The 2017 survey will be commenced during the Summer and at that stage, this development will be considered for survey by the Department.</p></reply>

The measures under these four headings will be implemented through the 29 actions contained in the Strategy.</p><p>In terms of supply, the focus in the strategy is on maintaining existing levels of rental stock and encouraging investment in additional supply.  There are shortages in the supply of rental accommodation in key locations, particularly in urban areas.  In some of these areas there is also significant demand for transitory short-term accommodation.  In this context, providing short term rentals at higher prices may be an attractive option for landlords.  However, a determination by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in a particular case has determined that the exclusive use of a residential apartment for short-term holiday lettings is a material change of use requiring planning permission. </p><p>The implications of this case have raised a number of regulatory and other related issues, such as tax liability, residential tenancy regulation, support for tourism, and planning.  The <i>Strategy for the Rental Sector</i>provides for the establishment by my Department of a working group, comprising representatives of relevant stakeholders including local authorities, relevant Departments, public bodies and other interests in the area, with a view to providing more information on the scale and nature of the issue and full clarity regarding the appropriate regulatory approach to be adopted in relation to short-term tourism-related lettings.  The working group is due to report in Quarter 2 2017. </p><p>The Rental Strategy is a set of prioritised and sequenced actions, a number of which involve interdepartmental working groups.  These are being established and are commencing their work in accordance with the timeframes in the Rental Strategy.  Other working groups with shorter timeframes have already started work and the working group in question will commence its work shortly, including considering its working arrangements, allowing it to report within the timeframe outlined in the Strategy.  </p><p>Officials from my Department are in active discussions with organisations involved in short term letting with a view to establishing collaborative agreements within the coming weeks to ensure that those involved in such letting have all required planning permissions.</p></reply>

They must have at least 104 weeks qualifying PRSI contributions paid since they first started work and 39 weeks qualifying PRSI contributions paid or credited in the relevant tax year or, 26 weeks qualifying PRSI paid in the relevant tax year and 26 weeks qualifying PRSI paid in the tax year immediately before the relevant tax year.  The relevant tax year is the second last complete tax year before the year in which your claim is made.  So, for claims made in 2017, the relevant tax year is 2015.</p><p>The Revenue Commissioners collect PRSI on behalf of the Department and send this information to the Department, who then update the employee&rsquo;s PRSI records.  Each registered employer in Ireland is obliged by law to account each year for the Income Tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and where applicable Local Property Tax deducted from his or her employees.  A special return, which is commonly known as a P35 return, is used for this purpose. </p><p>For the 2016 relevant tax year the deadline for the P35 to be sent to the Revenue Commissioners was the 15th February 2017 (23rd February 2017 if using the electronic submission facility).  Therefore, the Department does not receive PRSI information in relation to a person&rsquo;s contributions in the previous relevant tax year until after these dates.  This means that for a person making a claim for a social insurance benefit in January or February 2017, their insurance (PRSI) record for 2016 is not yet available to my Department.</p><p>Additionally, information in relation to mistakes made or changes to the details relating to employee(s) already returned by employers on their P35 return are sent in throughout the year to the Revenue Commissioners, and onwards to the Department.  Therefore it can take many months into the year before all employees PRSI details are fully updated in relation to the most recent complete tax year.</p><p>For these reasons I have no plans to change the current regulations for the assessment of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit to the most recent complete tax year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-30a.482.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017033000066#WRN02500"><p>The Citizens Information Board (CIB), which has statutory responsibility for the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) and the Citizens Information Services (CIS) decided, on 15th February 2017, to restructure the governance arrangements of these services.  The decision was communicated by the Board of CIB to all CIS and MABS Boards and to all staff on the same day.  The CIB assures me that there will be no job losses, no closure of services, no change to service delivery locations and no change to the terms and conditions of serving staff during the lifetime of the restructuring programme.  There will be no disruption to CIS and MABS services for those who use them. </p>  <p>  The decision comes after a lengthy and extensive analysis of options and a detailed consultation period with all stakeholders on the need for a more streamlined governance model.  The restructured governance arrangements are being implemented at local company board level only.  The decision taken simply reduces the number of individual local CIS and MABS company boards from ninety three (93) to sixteen (16).  A new regional board structure will be put in place which will comprise eight (8) CIS boards and eight (8) MABS boards.  The valuable work carried out by the employees and volunteers working in CIS services and the employees of MABS services will continue as heretofore.  </p>  <p>  A more streamlined governance structure will result in a more targeted use of valuable staff resources, re-directed to increased front line service delivery, made possible by reduction in the current significant administrative burden associated with maintaining ninety three (93) individual companies nationwide.  The changes will bring the CIS and MABS organisations more into line with modern public service governance guidelines and requirements where significant State funding is involved.  </p>  <p>  In 2017, CIB is set to receive State funding of &euro;54 million, of which &euro;15 million is allocated to CIS services (including &euro;13.1 million to the 42 local Citizens Information Services, &euro;1.2 million to Citizens Information Phone Services and, the balance, &euro;0.7 million to central and other supports), and &euro;24.6 million is allocated to the network of MABS services (including &euro;15.4 million to the 51 local MABS, &euro;0.3m to National Traveller MABS, &euro;2.0 million to MABS National Development Company, &euro;3.3million to the MABS Dedicated Mortgage Arrears initiative, &euro;3.5 million to the Abhaile service, and the remaining &euro;0.1m to MABS central supports).</p>  <p>  Following on from the decision of the Board, a Restructuring Implementation Group is being set up by CIB to examine all aspects of implementing the new sixteen (16) board model.  This work will include examination of the establishment costs of the new structure and the potential for future savings derived from the reduction in the administrative burden associated with ninety three (93) individual local companies.  Current costs are an aggregate of the costs incurred by each of the ninety three (93) local companies on items such as audit fees, professional fees (including legal services), payroll administration and board of director expenses.  While cost is not the driver of the restructuring project, some efficiencies are likely to result from moving to a reduced sixteen (16) company model.</p>  <p>  The aim of the project is to improve existing governance arrangements and optimise the benefits from operating a more modern, streamlined and customer focused service delivery model.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

It replaced the former smallholders&rsquo; unemployment assistance payment.  In line with the then existing arrangements for unemployment assistance (including smallholders) and pre-retirement allowance, the income of farm assist recipients was exempt from class S PRSI for self-employed workers. </p>  <p>  Recipients of farm assist who had previously paid Class S social insurance had the option of paying voluntary contributions to maintain their social insurance record, provided they satisfied the qualifying conditions.  Since 1st January 2007, the exemption from class S PRSI has been removed and those receiving jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and farm assist are subject to Class S PRSI as self-employed contributors on their self-employed income, provided their annual income is &euro;5,000 or more.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to amend legislation regarding the State pension (contributory), to award a maximum rate payment to pensioners who had such a period during 1999-2006 when they were exempt from PRSI. </p>  <p>  However, a person aged over 66 with limited PRSI contributions over the course of their life may claim a State pension (non-contributory) if they have an income need, and this entitlement is not based on payment of social insurance contributions.  The maximum weekly rate is &euro;227, i.e. over 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.  While it is means-tested, there are very significant disregards which are to the benefit of claimants, and over 70% of such pensioners are paid at the full rate.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The rate of payment depends on the person&rsquo;s level of earnings in the governing PRSI contribution year.  For illness benefit claims made in 2017 the governing contribution year is 2015.  Where the average weekly earnings are &euro;300 or more, the personal rate of payment is &euro;193 weekly (&euro;188 prior to 13 March 2017).  A graduated rate applies where the average weekly earnings are less than &euro;300. </p>  <p>  The person concerned made a claim to illness benefit and this claim was received in my Department on 23 February 2017.

Payment has been made to the date of the latest evidence of work incapacity received.</p>  <p>  It is noted that the spouse/partner of the person concerned is working on a Community Employment scheme.

This reversed the system under previous legislation whereby new bodies would have to be brought into the scope of the legislation by order. </p><p>The Act also provides the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform with the power to make an order bringing a body under the Commissioner's remit if it is financed, wholly or partly, or directly or indirectly by means of monies provided by a Minister of the Government.  I am sure that the Deputy would share the view that there has been substantial progress and a planned and structured approach of continuing to extend the Commissioner's remit is one that he would share.</p><p>With regard to the Citizen's Assembly, I am advised that FOI does not apply in this case as the body does not meet the criteria set out in Section 6 (1) of the Act.  The Assembly is a temporary body which I understand has been operating in an open and transparent way with regard to its operations.  For example on its website<i>www.citizensassembly.ie </i>you may find details on the assembly itself, copies of the submissions made and reports of all meetings, which are also live streamed at the time.  In the circumstances, I currently have no plans to extend the remit of the legislation to the Assembly.</p></reply>

That review identified St Vincent's University Hospital as the most appropriate location for the redevelopment of the National Maternity Hospital (NMH).  The site was at the time, and still is, in private ownership and was not on the market.  The question of the purchase of the site did not therefore arise.</p><p>Last November, following mediation discussions, agreement was reached between the NMH and the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group on a new governance structure for the co-located hospitals on the St. Vincent's campus.  The agreement provides for the establishment of a new company - The National Maternity Hospital at Elm Park DAC (limited by shares).  The new company will have clinical and operational independence in the provision of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services, as well as financial and budgetary independence, but will not have a role in relation to the State redress scheme.</p><p>I am satisfied that the agreement secured protects the identity and branding of the NMH and the right to use of the new maternity hospital facility.  The autonomy of the NMH Board will be underpinned by reserved powers to ensure clinical and operational independence, and the Minister for Health will hold the power to protect those reserved powers.  I am also satisfied that the financial interests of the State will be protected through a requirement for a lien to be placed on the hospital.  I have asked the HSE to provide the Deputy with further details of the mechanisms which will be put in place to protect the State's investment in the new hospital.</p></reply>

Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018. </p>  <p>  In December 2016, I granted approval to the NTPF to dedicate &euro;5m to a daycase waiting list initiative with the aim of ensuring that no patient will be waiting more than 18 months for a daycase procedure by 30 June 2017.  In excess of 2000 daycases will be managed through this process and outsourcing of treatment will commence shortly.  The focus of this initiative will be those lists with large numbers of long waiting patients. </p>  <p>  In addition to this Daycase Initiative, the NTPF has been working closely with my Department and the HSE to agree an approach to the remaining 2017 allocation.  The HSE is currently developing a 2017 Waiting List Action Plans for Inpatient/Daycase procedures and Outpatient appointments to reduce the number of patients waiting more than 15 months by the end of October.  The Inpatient/Day case Plan is being developed in conjunction with the NTPF's approach to the utilisation of its remaining &euro;10m funding for patient treatment in 2017. </p>  <p>  Future investment in hospitals must be considered within the overall acute hospital sector infrastructure programme, the prioritised needs of the hospital groups and within the overall capital envelope available to the health service.  Nevertheless, the HSE will continue to apply the available funding for infrastructure development in the most effective way possible to meet current and future needs, having regard to the level of commitments and the costs to completion already in place.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Health is working with the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to conduct a mid-term review of the capital programme.  While the review will consider capacity requirements over the next decade or so, it will also have a short-term focus and determine how capital investment over the coming years can be best targeted, given the current pressures being experienced within our hospital services.  Funding for the Endoscopy development in Naas will be considered in this context.</p></reply>

The company must submit a separate application to extend a treatment to a new cohort of patients.  Each application is considered separately on its merits and in line with the 2013 Act.</p><p>In reaching its decision, the HSE examines all the evidence which may be relevant in its view for the decision (including the information or dossier submitted by the company) and will take into account such expert opinions and recommendations which may have been sought by the HSE at its sole discretion (for example, from the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE). </p><p>In considering an application, the HSE will also have regard to Part 1 and Part 3 of Schedule 3 of the 2013 Act.  Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria:</p><p>- the health needs of the public;</p><p>- the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;</p><p>- the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement;</p><p>- the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks;</p><p>- the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item;</p><p>- the clinical need for the item or listed item;</p><p>- the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety;</p><p>- the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and</p><p>- the resources available to the HSE.</p><p>I am informed that the HSE received a request and economic dossier from the manufacturer of Ivacaftor, brand name Kalydeco, for the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients aged two years and older and weighing less than 25kg.  In March of last year, the HSE asked the NCPE to carry out a health technology assessment of the applicant&rsquo;s economic dossier on the cost effectiveness of this treatment.</p><p>The NCPE completed its assessment and made a recommendation in October 2016.  The NCPE determined that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness of the drug for its intended cohort of patients and did not recommend that it should be reimbursed for this indication at the submitted price. </p><p>A summary of the health technology assessment has been published on the NCPE website and is available at: <i></i>. </p><p>The manufacturer of Kalydeco is also the manufacturer of Orkambi.  As the Deputy will be aware, discussions with the company regarding Orkambi have been ongoing for a number of months.  The most recent discussions have broadened to include Orkambi, Kalydeco and further treatments for cystic fibrosis patients.  The matter is currently under consideration by the HSE Directorate and by officials in my Department. </p><p>I expect that this process will conclude in a period of weeks.  However, given the scale of the investment, the potential benefits for Irish patients and the impact of this decision on the health service overall, I would call on all Deputies to allow this statutory process to be concluded.</p><p>I am acutely aware that the last number of months have been a stressful and worrying time for CF patients and their families.

In this correspondence he expresses concern about the vaccine and it effectiveness in preventing cervical cancer.  Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide.  Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 100 die from the disease.  All cervical cancers are linked to high risk Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types.  In 2009 the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) recommended HPV vaccination for all 12 year old girls to reduce their risk of cervical cancer and in September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools. </p>  <p>  There are 2 licensed HPV vaccines available in Ireland (Gardasil and Cervarix).  Gardasil is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme and is provided free of charge to girls in first year of second level school.  Gardasil has been authorised for use across the European Union since September 2006 following a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use at the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  It is a fully tested vaccine which protects against the main cancer-causing strains of the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV 16 &amp;amp; 18) and will eventually save around 60 lives in Ireland every year.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.</p>  <p>  While no medicine (including vaccines) is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is responsible for monitoring the safety and quality of all medicines that are licensed in Ireland.  The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in Europe continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.  The vast majority of reports received by the HPRA have been consistent with the expected pattern of short term adverse side effects for the vaccine, as described in the product information.  The most frequently reported side effects are local redness and /or swelling at the point of injection and fever.  These are usually mild and temporary reactions to any kind of vaccination.  Fainting has occurred after vaccination with Gardasil, especially in adolescents. </p>  <p>  The EMA completed a detailed scientific review in November 2015 of the evidence surrounding reports of two conditions: complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).  The Agency&rsquo;s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use concurred that the available evidence does not support that CRPS and POTS are caused by HPV vaccines.  It therefore did not recommend any changes to the terms of licensing or the product information for these medicines.  On 12 January 2016 the European Commission endorsed the conclusions of the European Medicines Agency, that there is no change to the way HPV vaccines are used, or to amend the current product information.  This final outcome by the Commission is now binding in all members states.</p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  An illness that occurs around the time a vaccine is given and is already known to be common in adolescence does not imply the vaccine caused the problem.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  It is important to reassure people that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The diverse nature of these symptoms, which can have both physical and psychological causes, are shared by many conditions which has implications for both diagnostic and treatment services.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services and the HSE are currently working to put in place clinical care pathways appropriate to the differing medical needs of this group.  As there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine causes long term illnesses, the HPV vaccine cannot be held responsible for these illnesses. </p>  <p>  It is important to counter misinformation in relation to the safety of vaccines, and to increase the uptake rates of all vaccines in the State&rsquo;s immunisation programmes.  The scientific evidence is clear and misinformation is causing real harm to those unvaccinated children and adults who develop vaccine preventable diseases, and to people who seek inappropriate treatments for real conditions that are not caused by vaccines.  The benefits of HPV vaccines outweigh the known side effects.  The safety of these vaccines, as with all medicines, will continue to be carefully monitored and will take into account any future new evidence of side effects that becomes available.</p>  <p>  My Department has already sent a reply to the original query.</p></reply>

The PSI has advised pharmacies that this should include an itemised receipt.</p>  <p>  In 2014, the PSI Council issued principles to all pharmacists relating to pricing transparency to guide practice in retail pharmacy.  This includes providing meaningful advice to patients about medicines and their prices, including provision of an itemised receipt.</p>  <p>  The PSI Council also commissioned the development of a Patient Charter - You and Your Pharmacist - which was launched in August 2016.  It is a reflection of the standards set out in the Code of Conduct for pharmacists as they relate to people availing of the professional services, advice and care provided by a community pharmacist.

The overall budget for the TAMS II Schemes over the course of the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 is &euro;395m.  Over 10,000 applications have been received so far.  Of these over 7,000 applicants have been given approval to go ahead with the capital investment.  The payment claim system which has been open since July 2016 has received over 1,100 payment claims and of these, over 660 have been paid.  Approvals are handled on a tranche basis and payment claims are processed on a continuous basis.  The expenditure on TAMS II Schemes in 2016 was &euro;3.970m and the expenditure to date in 2017 is &euro;4.626m.  The budget for 2016 was &euro;28m and the budget for 2017 is &euro;50m.</p></reply>

Addressing the Forum, I took the opportunity to highlight that one of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some sectors, which have caused cash flow difficulties for farmers. </p>  <p>  Therefore I was pleased to facilitate the &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme&rdquo;, which was developed by my Department in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and makes &euro;150 million available to farmers throughout Ireland at interest rates of 2.95%.  Distributed through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, it provides tillage farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.  The loans are for amounts up to &euro;150,000 for up to six years and are flexible with interest only facilities of up to three years.  Although there are no official figures as yet on the total drawdown from the Scheme, very strong interest has been reported. </p>  <p>  Also the Tillage Investment Scheme under TAMS II opened for online applications on the 8 March 2017.  The specific areas of investment include Minimum Disturbance Tillage Equipment, Sprayers, Rain Water Harvesting, Grain Storage and Grain dryers.  This Tillage Scheme is the latest of the Targeted Modernisation Schemes (TAMS II) to be launched under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.  The Scheme is co-funded by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).  All applications must be made on-line, either by the farmer or by an adviser authorised to act on his or her behalf.  The closing date for applications under the first tranche of the new scheme will be Friday 30 June 2017.</p>  <p>  As an additional support to cash flow on farms, including Tillage farms, to date &euro;1.182billion has been paid out under the 2016 Basis Payment Scheme to 123,821 farmers and payments are ongoing.  Payments of just over &euro;201million have also been made to 93,921 applicants under the 2016 Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme.  I can confirm to the Deputy that a wide ranging discussion took place among all the stakeholders who attended the Forum, including on the issue of crop losses as a result of the poor harvest conditions of last autumn.  My officials have since then had some further meetings with stakeholders and I will consider further the outcome of those deliberations.</p></reply>

This is consistent with the overall EU position of not commencing negotiations in advance of the UK's formal notification of its intention to exit the EU under Article 50 TEU.  However, I did take the opportunity to refer to the impact of Brexit at the most recent Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels last month in the course of a discussion on the CAP, and in particular in the context of ensuring that the CAP helps farmers to more effectively deal with the consequences of market volatility.  As previously indicated, I have also raised the matter informally directly with Commissioner Hogan.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is, I am sure, aware of the range of measures that I have introduced to support the agri-food sector in dealing with the impact of the fall in value of sterling against the Euro.  These support measures include additional funding for Bord Bia and Bord Iascaigh Mhara, increased expenditure for the Seafood Development Programme and the Rural Development Programme, agri-taxation measures and the &euro;150 million low-cost loan scheme, introduced earlier this year, and which uses Ireland's most recent EU aid of &euro;11 million to leverage significant funding to help deal with the immediate impact of Brexit.</p>  <p>  In addition, I and my Department officials have been actively continuing our engagement with the Commission and other Member States, to ensure that Ireland's concerns and requirements in relation to Brexit are fully understood.  I have had a series of bilateral meetings with, for example, Germany, Netherlands, Denmark, Estonia and Poland in recent weeks, and intend to undertake further engagement with France, Austria and others over the coming period.</p></reply>

However, it is important to bear in mind that statutory redundancy payments are much larger than minimum notice payments. </p>  <p>  The legislation attempts to strike a necessary balance in circumstances where the economic realities may force an employer into temporarily placing employees on short time or lay-off, and in such circumstances, to allow the retention of trained staff rather than making them redundant.  While no employee would wish to be put in a situation of short time or lay-off, it does allow for the possibility of returning to work for that employer, and thus avoid being made redundant or seeking redundancy of their own volition.</p>  <p>  It is the intention of this legislation to allow for both sets of circumstances, and to be fair to both employer and employee.  It is also important to remember that since 2013 an employer must bear the full cost of a redundancy i.e. it can no longer seek a rebate from the Exchequer.</p></reply>

A JLC is comprised of equal numbers of representatives of employers and workers in a sector.  JLCs meet regularly, under an independent Chairperson to discuss proposals for terms and conditions to apply to specified grades or categories of workers in the sector.  If agreement is reached the JLC publishes details and invites submissions from interested parties.  </p>  <p>  If, after consideration of any submissions received, the Committee adopts the proposals it will submit them to the Labour Court for consideration.  The Labour Court will then make a decision on the adoption of the proposals.  If the Court decides to adopt the proposals, a copy is presented to me and if I consider it appropriate to do so I will make an Order giving effect to the proposals. Such Orders are known as Employment Regulation Orders. </p>  <p>  The Joint Labour Committee for the Security Industry was established in accordance with Statutory Instrument No. 377 of 1998 (as amended by Statutory Instrument No. 30 of 2014).</p>  <p>  I am informed that, in accordance with the Statute, the Labour Court consulted with ICTU, Ibec and the two employer organisations most closely connected with the Security Industry, the National Union of Security Employers (merged with the Security Institute of Ireland in 2011) and the Irish Security Industry Association.  Following consultation, these bodies nominated representatives of both employers and employees for membership of the Committee.  The current members were appointed on the 12th May 2014.</p>  <p>  The Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson are Industrial Relations Officers from the Workplace Relations Commission and are appointed by me. </p>  <p>  The constitution and proceedings  of JLCs is set out in the Fifth Schedule to the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.  The discussions within the Joint Labour Committees are not open to me nor to my Department. </p>  <p>  I am informed that the draft proposals for an employment regulation order that you refer to were advertised as part of the public consultation process.  The closing date for submissions on those proposals was 7th February last.</p></reply>

It is also working on a sectoral level.  Enterprise Ireland is working to assist companies to maintain and increase their UK exports and to extend their international reach by reorienting towards the Eurozone, North America, Canada, Asia and the Middle East.  Enterprise Ireland is particularly working with the companies that are most exposed to the UK in areas like engineering, food, construction and timber.  Enterprise Ireland is working to support companies in enhancing their competitiveness in order that Irish exports and jobs can be protected and can grow.  Enterprise Ireland is assisting its clients to improve their processes, drive efficiencies and cost reductions and undertake research and development and innovation with a view to improving existing products and processes or developing new ones.</p>  <p>  My Department's 2017 budget contains many measures to help Irish businesses to become more competitive and cope with the impact of Brexit.  It includes an extra &euro;52 million in capital funding to support the enterprise sector.  Additional current moneys have also been secured to provide up to 50 extra staff for my Department and its enterprise agencies.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s trade promotion programmes for 2017 are designed to support client exports to the UK and to diversify into new markets.</p></reply>

I wish to assure the Deputy that Tusla deals immediately with emergency cases, including for instance, if a child has been abandoned or is in immediate physical danger or at risk of sexual abuse.  </p><p>At the end of Quarter 3, 2016, Tusla reported that 60% of referrals received were of a child welfare concern with the remaining 40% related to child protection concerns.  The number of referrals reported over the last five years is detailed in the table below categorised by child welfare or child protection concerns.  A child welfare concern is a problem experienced directly by a child, or by a family of a child, that is seen to impact negatively on the child&rsquo;s health, development and welfare, and that warrants assessment and support, but may not require a child protection response (Child Protection and Welfare Handbook, HSE 2011).  A child protection concern is where there are reasonable grounds for believing that a child may have been, is being or is at risk of being physically, sexually or emotionally abused or neglected. <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Child Welfare Referrals</th><th>Child Protection Referrals</th><th>Total Number of Referrals</th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>21,143       (53%)</td><td>19,044      (47%)</td><td>40,187</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>22,192       (53%)</td><td>19,407      (47%)</td><td>41,599</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>24,954       (57%)</td><td>18,676      (43%)</td><td>43,630</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>25,361       (58%)</td><td>18,235      (42%)</td><td>43,596</td></tr><tr><td>2016* </td><td>21,128       (60%)</td><td>14,174      (40%)</td><td>35,302</td></tr></table>* Figures for 2016 to end September as data on referral is reported quarter in arrears</p><p>The following table provides a further breakdown of child abuse referrals by category of abuse for the years 2013 and 2014.<table><tr><th>Physical abuse</th><th>Emotional Abuse</th><th>Sexual Abuse</th><th>Neglect</th><th>Year</th><th>Total referrals of child abuse</th></tr><tr><td>4,330</td><td>5,271</td><td>3,385</td><td>6,421</td><td>2013</td><td>19,407</td></tr><tr><td>4,066</td><td>6,233</td><td>3,114</td><td>5,263</td><td>2014</td><td>18,676</td></tr></table>Referrals can come from a number of sources so there are some duplicates in these totals, and some will be more appropriate for universal services, such as those provided in the education or health sectors.  Also, not all referrals will result in a need for a social work service or in a child being received into care.  </p><p>Comparisons between years before 2012 are not included here as due to definitional changes.  Following the introduction of the standard business process across social work teams, referrals are now counted per child whereas prior to 2012 referrals were counted differently according to &lsquo;case&rsquo; which may have included several children</p><p>Each referral received by the Agency is assessed and dealt with on an individual basis by the relevant social work team.  Preliminary screening is aimed at establishing the appropriateness of the referral to Tusla services and, if necessary, is followed by an initial assessment of the concern to determine the best course of action for the child and their family.  As a result, every year, approximately 50% of referrals can be expected to proceed from preliminary enquiry to the initial assessment stage. </p><p>The following table details the percentage of referrals that, following a preliminary assessment, required an initial assessment in each quarter of 2014, 2015 and 2016 (to end September).<table><tr><th>Quarter and Year</th><th>% of referrals that required an initial assessment</th></tr><tr><td>Q1 2014</td><td>51%</td></tr><tr><td>Q2 2014</td><td>49%</td></tr><tr><td>Q3 2014</td><td>52%</td></tr><tr><td>Q4 2014</td><td>52%</td></tr><tr><td>Q1 2015</td><td>49%</td></tr><tr><td>Q2 2015</td><td>46%</td></tr><tr><td>Q3 2015</td><td>47%</td></tr><tr><td>Q4 2015</td><td>49%</td></tr><tr><td>Q1 2016</td><td>46%</td></tr><tr><td>Q2 2016</td><td>43%</td></tr><tr><td>Q3 2016</td><td>41%</td></tr></table>We have been advised by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, that it does not collate data nationally on the number of allegations of child abuse, including physical, emotional, sexual abuse and neglect that are referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children states that &quot;Where the HSE suspects that a child has been or is being physically or sexually abused or wilfully neglected, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must be formally notified in accordance with the procedure set out in Paragraph 7.4.5 below.  The process of establishing whether grounds exist for suspecting such abuse may involve consulting relevant professional personnel within the HSE and, where appropriate, in outside agencies.  However, the HSE must not await confirmation of such abuse, whether from a child abuse assessment unit or otherwise, before notifying An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.&quot;</p><p>As outlined in Children First Guidance, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla have different functions, powers and methods of working.  The specific focus of Tusla is on the assessment of risk to a child and their welfare and protection.  The role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the investigation of an alleged offence and undertaking a criminal investigation into an allegations of child abuse.  It is the responsibility of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to decide on, and to carry out, prosecutions.</p></reply>

Pobal assisted my Department with the administration of the scheme.  Some 95 applications were received and 30 proposals for new youth cafes around the country were approved for funding.</p>  <p>  I am advised that an application was received in respect of a youth caf&eacute; in Monasterevin from Kildare Youth Services.  However, the application was unsuccessful on that occasion as it did not achieve a sufficiently high score for inclusion in the final list of projects approved for funding.  An application from County Kildare Youth Hub in Kildare Town was successful and has received a capital grant of &euro;50,000 towards the cost of developing a new youth caf&eacute; facility, which has now opened.  </p>  <p>  Youth caf&eacute;s offer young people a safe, alcohol and drug free space, for recreation, non-formal learning and youth activities and they make an important contribution to facilities for young people at local level.  Recent research undertaken by my Department indicates that there are now more than 150 youth caf&eacute;s throughout the country.  In the main, these have been developed, over the years, by local communities with the support of different funding sources.</p>  <p>  My Department does not have available to it in 2017 a capital fund for the development of new youth caf&eacute;s.
