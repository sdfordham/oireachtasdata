In this regard, I am pleased that the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>commits to the continued implementation of the <i>Arts in Education Charter</i>.  </p><p>The work of the two Departments and the Arts Council in implementing the Charter is achieved largely through existing structures, such as education centres and Education and Training Boards.  My Department provides a small amount of funding under the Charter to assist with its implementation, for example, in relation to the funding of artists to assist in the Teacher Artist Partnership Initiative.  In 2015, the Arts in Education Portal was launched and this now serves as an effective key communications and information channel for both education and arts sectors.</p><p>As recently as last April, a very successful inaugural National Arts in Education Day was held in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, with over 200 attendees from both education and artistic fields.</p><p>In terms of direct support for the arts, this is primarily a matter for the Arts Council operating under the provisions of the Arts Act 2003.  The Arts Council&rsquo;s ten-year strategy places specific emphasis on the need to plan and provide for children and young people.  The strategy also commits to working to achieve full implementation of the <i>Arts in Education Charter</i>.</p><p>The Arts Council contributes funding to a number of organisations to assist in the delivery of Arts in Education projects in schools.  These include Poetry Ireland's Writers in Schools Scheme, where writers and storytellers visit primary and post-primary schools, as well as the Bringing to Book Artist-in-Residence Scheme, a Children's Books Ireland project.</p></reply>

This continuing commitment is reflected in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government.</i></p><p>I can assure the House that the creation of a larger Department with a greater remit will not in any way diminish the importance of arts and culture within Government.  In fact, I consider that a larger Department with wider responsibilities can bring greater weight to bear in promoting the importance of arts and culture right across Government.</p><p>Officials of my Department are currently engaging with their counterparts in the relevant Departments to establish the precise details of the functions that will now come under the remit of my Department and to identify the associated personnel and other resources to be transferred.  I anticipate that this process will be brought to a conclusion shortly, following which the issue of delegations to the newly appointed Ministers of State in my Department will be addressed, as appropriate.</p><p>Since my initial appointment as Minister with responsibility for the arts, I have succeeded in securing increased funding for the sector year on year.  Building on this, the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>contains a very important commitment to work to progressively increase funding to the arts, including the Arts Council and the Irish Film Board, as the economy continues to improve.  I can assure the Deputy that I will be engaging with my colleagues in Government and with the Oireachtas to seek to advance this commitment in the context of the forthcoming estimates and budgetary processes.</p><p>Finally, I would like to state that I have met with representatives of the National Campaign for the Arts and I have assured them of my continuing commitment to the arts, to the delivery of relevant undertakings in the Government Programme and to a new National Cultural Policy - <i>Culture 2025</i>- which is built on ongoing dialogue and collaboration with the cultural sector.</p></reply>

This will also feed into my expanded brief covering regional development and rural affairs;</p><p>- Opening the new capital grants scheme for applications to provide upgrades to existing regional arts and cultural centres around the country;</p><p>- Boosting supports to regional museums and facilitating increased loans between our National Cultural Institutions and our network of regional museums;</p><p>- Working with the Irish Film Board/Screen Ireland to ensure that Ireland is maximised as a location for international film production; and</p><p>- Further encouraging strong, mutually beneficial links between the business community and arts organisations.</p><p>These priorities represent an ambitious agenda and I look forward to working with all partners and across all parties of this House to develop and implement these initiatives.</p><p>With regard to funding, I would like to point out that, following years of reductions in Exchequer funding of the arts, I have succeeded in securing increased funding for the sector year on year since my initial appointment as Minister with responsibility for the arts.  For example, the allocation to the Arts Council in 2016 is some &euro;60.1m, an increase of 6% over the past 2 years.  I can assure the Deputy that I will be engaging with my colleagues in Government and with the Oireachtas to seek to advance these priorities in the context of the forthcoming estimates and budgetary processes.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-01a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060100066#WRA01600"><p>As I indicated in my reply to Question No 171 on 26 May 2016, I am very aware that the Bull Island is a hugely important amenity resource for the people of Dublin, as well as being of very high nature value.  Clearly, the concept of sustainable use is important in the management of such areas, particularly if there is a long history of such amenity use by the local population.</p>  <p>  It has been long recognised that bait digging occurs at the Bull Island and that such digging removes some worm species that are also used as food by the birds on the Island.  As I stated in my recent reply, the Bull Island is surveyed annually as part of the Irish Wetland Birds Survey, which collects data on the number of wintering birds at sites around the country.  This survey is coordinated by BirdWatch Ireland under a contract from my Department.  Officials from the Scientific Unit of my Department&rsquo;s National Parks and Wildlife Service have reviewed the data for the Bull Island from 2001 to 2014 and concluded that there is no evidence of any decline of the bird groups, such as waterfowl and waders, that use and feed on the mudflats.  For example, in the winter of 2001/2002, the peak number of waders, one of the main groups of birds species, was 16,513.  In the winter of 2014/15, the peak number was almost identical, at 16,733.  There were some fluctuations in numbers over those years, especially during and after the exceptionally cold winter in 2010, but numbers have recovered since then. </p>  <p>  There is a very similar pattern for ducks and geese, another important group of birds associated with the mudflats.</p>  <p>  I am advised therefore that there is no current evidence of a negative impact from the bait diggers, although there will be temporary disturbances in small areas.  Accordingly, I am not convinced that there is a need to intervene on bait digging.  My Department will continue to review data from the Bull Island and from other relevant sites elsewhere in the country.</p></reply>

Through these subheads, my Department administers and delivers a wide range of programmes and measures, descriptions of which are available on its website at .</p><p>Expenditure under these programme areas is recorded and accounted for on a national basis and it is not possible to give a regional or county-by-county breakdown of that expenditure.  For example, a number of my Department&rsquo;s programmes are delivered through agencies and other intermediary bodies that operate across county boundaries and in respect of which there is no detailed breakdown on a county basis held by my Department.  Groups and organisations that receive grants directly from my Department are not typically constituted on a single-county basis.</p><p>In view of this and because of the wide range of my Department&rsquo;s schemes and programmes, and the large volumes of payments and grants involved, it is not possible to provide the information sought.  However, if the Deputy has specific queries relating to a particular programme or grant, I will endeavour to provide him with relevant information in that regard.</p></reply>

These publications are available on the website of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and on the website of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>  <p>  Most of my Department's arts and culture budget is allocated to the agencies under its remit.  Within these allocations, the Arts Council is the primary State agency for funding the arts in Ireland.  In 2016, I provided &euro;60.1m to the Arts Council, an increase of over 7.5%  since 2014.  This does not include any specific funding for commemorations.</p>  <p>  Details of the Arts Council's expenditure including its individual grants are published on the Arts Council's website at www.artscouncil.ie.</p>  <p>  Where my Department makes direct grants to organisations, the figures are published on the website of my Department at www.ahg.gov.ie.  The figures for 2016 will be published in due course.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the support provided directly by my Department for the arts primarily relates to capital investment in arts infrastructure.  In this regard, I announced a new &euro;9 million investment scheme for arts and cultural centres to run over the next three years focussed on upgrading the existing stock of arts and cultural centres around the country. </p>  <p>  My Department is finalising the guidelines and application forms in relation to the scheme which I intend to open for applications very shortly.</p></reply>

The inclusive nature of the Programme has enabled citizens to re-engage actively with our history and has encouraged them to consider the future of their communities, as they look back, and reflect upon, the events of 100 years ago that led to the birth of our democratic State. </p><p>While a large number of key events took place around the Easter period, the Programme will continue through the remainder of 2016 and there are a number of exciting and innovative programmes and initiatives planned, including many activities at local level.</p><p><i>Reimagine</i>is the final phase of the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme &ndash; the third component of the overall <i>Remember, Reflect, Reimagine</i>theme.  The objective of the <i>Reimagine</i>phase is to create an enduring impact and long-term legacy of 2016, building on the momentum and very positive public responses to the <i>Remember </i>and<i>Reflect</i>phases of the Centenary Programme.  The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>commits to continuing to commemorate the most significant events in the history of this State, ensuring that these commemorations are inclusive, and enhance our understanding of our shared history, particularly among children and young people, so that they have a meaningful and lasting impact.  I am confident that our citizens will continue to engage energetically with these issues as we move into the final phase of the Programme.</p></reply>

The regulations may also set out conditions or restrictions to protect protected habitats and species in areas where such burning is permitted.  There is also proposed provision to allow landowners or their agents to cut, grub or destroy vegetation in any hedge or ditch during August, subject to such regulations as the Minister may make.

My Department operates a <i>Structures at Risk Fund</i>to enable conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership that are protected under the Planning and Development Acts and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  This fund is administered through the local authorities and seeks to encourage the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and to help to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.  Applications for this scheme have now closed for 2016 and recommended projects are currently being finalised.</p><p>I launched a new &euro;2 million scheme - the <i>Built Heritage Investment Scheme</i>- for the repair and conservation of protected structures on 21 October 2015.  This scheme will operate in 2016, via the local authorities, on the same model as the very successful <i>Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme</i>, which ran in 2014.  It is expected to support a significant number of projects across the country and to create employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas.  The scheme for this year is now closed for applications.</p><p>The terms and conditions for both these schemes can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.ahg.gov.ie.</p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  For 2016, the Council is administering a community based heritage grants scheme available for projects that contributed to particular heritage themes. Further details can be found at www.heritagecouncil.ie.</p><p>I also consider applications for determination under Section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Under the terms of the Act, owners and/or occupiers of approved heritage buildings and/or gardens can apply for tax relief in respect of expenditure incurred on repair, maintenance and restoration, on condition that they open to the public.  In order to be approved for this relief, a building/garden must be intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest and reasonable access to the property must be afforded to the public.</p><p>Late last year, I launched an <i>Action Plan for Irish Historic Houses in private</i><i>ownership</i>.  The objectives of the plan will be to assist historic houses in general with their on-going protection, management and promotion into the future.  Nine key actions form the backbone of the plan and its successful delivery will require the coordinated work of private owners, government Departments, local government and agencies.  I am open to considering introducing further instruments to protect our national built heritage, but these must be considered within the overall context of the current economic situation and the need to prioritise the demands on public finances. </p><p>The remainder of my Department&rsquo;s built heritage capital budget for 2016 will be focused on the conservation and presentation of the State's heritage portfolio, which is managed by the Office of Public Works.</p></reply>

Easter Monday saw the largest public history and cultural event ever staged in Ireland, with more than 500 free talks, exhibitions, music, theatre, debates and performances across a number of venues and zones in Dublin city centre.

It links Drumshanbo with Carrick-on-Shannon and comprises a 16.5km paddling trail, a 10km walking trail and a 5km cycle trail.  The 10km Camlin River paddling loop is also in operation.  </p>  <p>  The Shannon-Erne Blueway, which I had the privilege of officially opening on Saturday 28 May 2016, links Leitrim Village with Belturbet, Co Cavan and provides a 70km series of paddling journeys, 25kms of walking trails and 8kms of cycling trails.  There are also plans to upgrade a further 8kms later in 2016.  Based on existing monitoring of visitor usage, Waterways Ireland expects that 100,000 people will use the Shannon-Erne Blueway over the next year.</p>  <p>  Further development on the Shannon during 2016 will include:</p>  <p>  -  A 20km trail from Carrick-on-Shannon to Boyle;</p>  <p>  -  A 50km trail from Carrick-on-Shannon to Lanesborough, and</p>  <p>  -  A 30km looped trail around Lough Allen.</p>  <p>  On the Barrow Navigation, Waterways Ireland plans to submit proposals to upgrade the Barrow towpath to relevant planning authorities in summer 2016.  This will enhance the 112kms of off-road trackway from Lowtown in Co. Kildare to St Mullins in Co Carlow.  Waterways Ireland is working with the relevant local authorities and Leader groups to establish the necessary funding for this development.</p>  <p>  On the Royal Canal and Grand Canals, 45kms and 21kms of towpath trails have been developed respectively.  Plans for upgrading the remaining towpaths on these canals are at varying stages and Waterways Ireland is working with local authorities, Leader groups, the National Transport Authority and the National Trails Office to progress these developments. </p>  <p>  Clearly, the development of Blueways presents valuable opportunities for rural communities to attract more visitors.  Their value lies not only in the recreational opportunities that they offer but also in their potential to stimulate local businesses and regenerate local areas.  Blueways also provide an effective model for partnership between the private, community and voluntary sectors and relevant State bodies.</p></reply>

There is also a facility under these Acts to issue a licence for coursing.</p>  <p>  I am advised that there is no current evidence that hare coursing has a significant negative impact on hare populations.  The most recent population estimate for the Irish hare - undertaken in 2007 - was 535,000 animals.  Coursing Clubs affiliated to the Irish Coursing Club catch in the region of 5,500 hares each coursing season, equivalent to approximately 1% of the national resource.  I am further advised that more than 95% of the hares captured for hare coursing are returned to the wild each year.  In addition, independent scientific studies have estimated that hare mortality during captivity and coursing in Ireland is equivalent to less than 0.1% of the total adult hare population annually.</p>  <p>  My Department has been working with the National Biodiversity Data Centre to collate distribution records for all Irish mammals.  The most recent map of these records, which are available online, show that the Irish hare remains very widespread throughout the country.</p>  <p>  The Irish hare is also listed on Annex V of the EU Habitats Directive and this means that my Department is required to undertake an assessment of its conservation status every six years.  The most recent conservation assessment, undertaken in 2013, identified changes in agricultural practises, in particular intensification of grassland usage, as the main pressure facing the hare.  Nonetheless, the overall assessment considered the species to be in a favourable conservation status and concluded that &ldquo;...the hare is widespread and common in Ireland with a broad habitat niche.  None of the identified threats are considered likely to impact on its conservation status.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The next EU Habitats Directive assessment is due in 2019.  In advance of that, my Department will review the need for a new national hare survey to inform that report and provide up to date information on the population status of this species in Ireland.</p></reply>

People with disabilities are only half as likely to be in employment as others of working age.  The reasons for this are complex, and include level of education and skills, fears around loss of benefits, employer know-how, low expectations, and limited re-entry to work following onset of a disability, as well as a higher incidence of ill-health.</p><p>  The Strategy is a cross-government approach that brings together actions by different Departments and State agencies in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on employment of people with disabilities.  In tandem with that, it seeks to ensure there will be joined-up services and supports at local level to support individuals on their journey into and in employment.</p><p>The Strategy's six strategic priorities are to:</p><p>- Build skills, capacity and independence;</p><p>- Provide bridges and supports into work;</p><p>- Make work pay;</p><p>- Promote job retention and re-entry to work;</p><p>- Provide coordinated and seamless support;</p><p>- Engage employers.</p><p>The Programme for Partnership Government reaffirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to fully implement the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities.  It pledges to ensure the Strategy&rsquo;s actions are compatible with mainstream activation policies and that it addresses concerns surrounding the loss of secondary benefits, so that work always pays more than welfare.</p><p>The focus in implementing the Strategy is on continuing interdepartmental cooperation and a joined-up approach to supports and services for jobseekers and workers with disabilities, rather than on additional resources.  The implementation of the Strategy will be subject to regular monitoring, and there will be a review and renewal every three years.  The Comprehensive Employment Strategy Implementation Group met recently to review progress in implementing the Strategy, and will prepare an annual report before the end of 2016, which will be published.</p></reply>

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources. </p>  <p>  I have been informed that the station in question is part of the Listowel Garda District, which forms part of the wider Kerry Garda Division.  The number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Division on the 31 March 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 297 of which 52 and 7 were assigned to the Listowel District and Ballybunion Garda station, respectively.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the Programme for Government, "A Programme for a Partnership Government" to continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000.   </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, since the Garda College reopened in September 2014, a total of 700 Garda trainees have been recruited with a further 450 planned to be recruited during the remainder of this year.  So far 395 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that 10 newly attested Garda&iacute; have been assigned to the Kerry Garda Division.</p>  <p>  It is expected that a further 300 trainees will attest by the end of this year which, taking account of projected retirements, will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark.  We must, I believe, endeavour to make more rapid progress than this to reach our target of 15,000 and I am engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in relation to increasing the planned annual intake this year and in coming years.</p></reply>

I have no statutory function in relation to the banking decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time and these are taken by the board and management of the relevant institution.  This includes decisions in relation to product interest rates as determined by the banks from time to time.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that in the most recent Department of Finance SME credit demand survey, covering the six month period to September 2015, only 1% of SMEs that did not seek credit said the reason was because it was too expensive to borrow.  The same survey notes that, among those SMEs with outstanding loans, the average claimed cost of credit across all outstanding loans is 4.7%.  Further, close to a quarter of SMEs with outstanding loans report a very low cost of credit between 0-2%.</p>  <p>  In the latest Central Bank of Ireland report on Trends in Business Credit and Deposits: Q4 2015, the total weighted average interest rate on new non-financial SME loan draw-downs during Q4 2015 was 4.52 per cent.  This represents a 58 basis point decline over 2015.  In contrast, the existing stock of Irish SME loans carry a lower weighted average interest rate; recorded at 3.16 per cent at end-Q4.    </p>  <p>  This Government recognises that small businesses play a central role in the sustainable recovery of the Irish economy.  To facilitate this, Government policy since 2011 has been focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources.</p>  <p>  My Department has been involved in a range of initiatives to encourage access to credit for small and medium sized businesses and the SME State Bodies Group chaired by my Department provides a forum for the development and implementation of policy measures to enhance SMEs' access to a stable and appropriate supply of finance.  </p>  <p>  One such policy measure is the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, whose goal is to ensure access to flexible funding for Irish SMEs by facilitating the provision of: </p>  <p>  - Flexible products with longer maturity and capital repayment flexibility, subject to credit approval;</p>  <p>  - Lower cost funding to financial institutions which is passed on to SMEs; </p>  <p>  - Market access for new entrants to the SME lending market, creating real competition.</p>  <p>  The Government's aim for the SBCI is to enhance the range and profile of SME finance providers in Ireland.  The SBCI is achieving this by working with existing and new providers to develop specific funding products and by supporting new entrants to the SME lending market through allocating funding to a number of non-bank SME finance providers.  The SBCI is also pursuing its objective of driving competition within the SME funding market through the provision of funding to a broad range of potential lending partners. </p>  <p>  The SBCI publishes results bi-annually.  To the end of December 2015, the SBCI has lent just under &euro;172 million to circa 4,600 SMEs.  The average loan size was &euro;37,000 and the loans were for a variety of purposes including investment, working capital and refinancing.  The SMEs who received SBCI finance were from a variety of business sectors. 85% of the lending was to SMEs based outside of Dublin (West 13%, Midlands 7%, Mid West 14%, South West 19%, South East 11%, Mid East 10%, border region 11%).  The SBCI will publish half year results at the beginning of the third quarter of 2016 for the first half of the year.</p></reply>

In my role as the Minister for Finance, I have responsibility for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.</p><p>The current legal and regulatory framework for the provision of insurance in the European Economic Area (EEA), and the supervision of that activity, is prescribed by European Union Law in the Life and Non-Life Insurance Directives or Solvency II.  The provision of insurance throughout the EEA on a freedom of services basis and a freedom of establishment basis (i.e. a branch) within this framework is predicated upon the absence of internal market frontiers and the mutual recognition of the authorisation of insurance undertakings by Member States.  Therefore, in general terms, there should be no impediment to an Irish driver seeking motor insurance from an insurance company operating in another EU Member State.  It should be noted, however, that it is up to each insurance company to decide on which jurisdictions or locations in which it will underwrite insurance risk.  Insurance companies would generally operate in jurisdictions where they are familiar with the market.</p><p>Many insurance companies which are authorised in other EU Member States sell insurance into Ireland.  I am informed by the Central Bank of Ireland that any EU authorised undertaking wishing to offer motor insurance in Ireland is allowed to do so subject to complying with the local 'general good' requirements for motor insurance.  These 'general good' requirements include membership of the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) and being a signatory to the Declined Cases Agreement operated by Insurance Ireland.  Both Irish authorised and EU authorised undertakings are required to comply with these requirements.  Other EU Member States will have their own but similar 'general good' requirements for motor insurance.</p><p>The Central Bank informs me that there are currently approximately 15 Irish authorised undertakings and a further 22 EU authorised undertakings offering motor insurance cover in Ireland.  The full list can be accessed at <i>.</i></p></reply>

The ability of the Government to influence insurance pricing is limited as insurance companies are required under European law to price in accordance with risk and neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, have the power to direct insurance companies on the pricing or the provision of insurance products. </p>  <p>  The EU framework for insurance expressly prohibits Member States adopting rules which require the prior approval or systematic notification of certain matters, including general and special policy conditions and scales of premiums.  Furthermore, the EU framework provides non-life insurers with the freedom to set premiums. </p>  <p>  Insurance companies consider a number of risks when determining the premium for a proposed insurance policy, whether that is a general insurance policy such as motor or home insurance, or a life assurance policy.  A premium is based on the actuarial calculation of risk. </p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland has informed me that motor insurers make their own individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.  They use a combination of rating factors in doing this, such as the age of the driver, the type of car, claims record, driving experience, number of drivers, how the car is used, etc.  Insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, prices vary across the market and consumers are free to choose.  </p>  <p>  As stated earlier the ability of the Government to influence insurance pricing is limited but, that does not preclude the Government from introducing measures that may, in the longer term, lead to a better claims environment that would facilitate a reduction in claims costs. </p>  <p>  My Department has embarked on a review of the insurance sector which is being undertaken in consultation with the Central Bank and other Departments and Agencies.  The objective of the Review is to recommend measures to improve the functioning and regulation of the insurance sector.  </p>  <p>  The Review of Policy in the Insurance Sector will continue over the coming months and is expected to be completed by the end of this year.</p>  <p>  Finally, in the event that a person is unable to obtain a quotation for motor insurance or feels that the premium proposed or the terms are so excessive that it amounts to a refusal to give them motor insurance, they should contact Insurance Ireland (telephone 01 6761820) quoting the Declined Cases Agreement.  Under this Agreement, the Declined Cases Committee of Insurance Ireland deals with cases of difficulty in obtaining motor insurance.</p></reply>

It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'.  This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises and the Minimum Competency Code) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which comes into operation on 1 July 2016.</p>  <p>  The Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears provides protections for borrowers who endeavour to meet their commitments in relation to their mortgages and the 2015 Act ensures that these protections apply when a loan has been sold.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may also be aware, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to considering further appropriate actions in this area and on the broader issue of overindebtedness.  I would encourage those borrowers who have not been able to engage with their lender to date to contact the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service dedicated mortgage advice service (MABS Helpline - 0761 07 2000) for confidential, non-judgemental and free advice and practical assistance in negotiating with their lender a suitable long term debt resolution, thus avoiding repossession of their primary residence.</p></reply>

The Department adopts a holistic and integrated approach to supporting the work of schools in promoting positive mental health and to supporting those with a broad range of problems, behavioural, emotional and social.</p><p>  My Department issued a circular to all primary schools in February this year promoting and encouraging Healthy Lifestyles for their pupils.  Schools and the wider education sector have a vital role to play in contributing to the Government's 'Healthy Ireland' agenda that is being led by the Department of Health and is supported by my Department.  It is acknowledged that positive mental and psychological wellbeing are a key aspect of healthy lifestyles.  Schools are contributing to the overall physical, mental health and wellbeing of our young people but this must be done in collaboration with their families and their community.</p><p>  Creating a healthy lifestyle spans the curriculum in schools, whole-school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, pupil support, pastoral care and the provision of professional development for teachers.  It also involves other supports such as educational psychological services and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally.  Schools support these areas also through their implementation of their anti-bullying, substance misuse, attendance policies and through the delivery of the SPHE curriculum.</p><p>  It is also important that work in this area commences when pupils are at an early age.  To this end, Wellbeing Guidelines for Primary Schools were published by my Department in January 2015.  These guidelines were developed, along with guidelines for post-primary schools, following a process of wide consultation, by a working group with representation from the Teacher Education Section/Inspectorate, SPHE Support Service, National Psychological Service (NEPS), Department of Health and the Health Service Executive/National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP).</p><p>  The guidelines provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote positive mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way.  They also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour.</p><p>  The Guidelines are for all members of the school community, boards of management and in-school management teams who play a central leadership role in positive mental health promotion.  They are also useful for parents' associations, student councils, health and other personnel who are seeking an understanding of how to work in and with schools.</p><p>Specific attention is drawn within the Guidelines to the identification of pupils with mental health difficulties, the support process and referral pathways available to schools to provide for their needs and where the difficulties result in absences from school support mechanisms are suggested to ease the pupils re-integration.</p><p>  My Department, in collaboration with the Department of Health and the HSE, provides support to schools to implement this agenda.  At Primary school level the HSE's Health Promotion Officers and my Department's NEPS service respectively support school staff delivery of programmes such as Zippy's Friends and the Friends for Life which promote children's resilience and coping skills which enable them better to manage anxiety.</p></reply>

In this context, the Government is committed to the implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs, with local input, to help spread growth to all areas.</p><p>  The South East region is a good example of what can be achieved in creating sustainable employment growth through strong collaborative effort at local level.  The economic crisis hit the South East's job numbers badly with the loss of 37,900 jobs from Q1 2008 to Q1 2011.  However, since the launch of the Action Plan for Jobs in Q1 2012, the unemployment rate has fallen from 20.1 to 12.5 per cent &ndash; a decrease of 38% in that timeframe, with 204,400 people now at work, an increase of 23,100 over the period.</p><p>  The South East Action Plan for Jobs which was published in September 2015 covers the counties of Carlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary, Waterford and Wexford and will build on the significant progress made to date.  The core objective of the Plan is to support an ambitious programme of enterprise growth and job creation in region over the medium and longer term capitalising on the strengths and opportunities of the region.</p><p>  The role of the education system featured strongly in the consultations for the Action Plan for Jobs, in particular through the introduction of entrepreneurship modules and ensuring young people develop an understanding so they can take an informed step towards self-employment if desired.  An Implementation Committee has been established to oversee implementation of the South East Plan, and a range of educational stakeholders will attend these meetings, including the Carlow and Waterford Institutes of Technology.</p><p>  The new Education and Training Boards in Carlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary, Waterford and Wexford have a fresh mandate, and like the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are now focused on developing stronger links with their local enterprise base.  3rd and 4th Level education in the region is provided by Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT), Institute of Technology Carlow (IT Carlow) and Limerick Institute of Technology (LIT) Tipperary.</p><p>  It is recognised that the Institutes of Technology have developed strategic research activities aligned with the strengths of regional and national priorities.  Overall, stronger engagements between the respective Institutes of Technology and employers and enterprises in the region provides a real opportunity to ensure that the excellence of the graduate and teaching and research capability is understood by all in the region and that the higher and further education systems can respond to the changing skills needs of employers.</p><p>  Regional Skills Forum:</p><p>In addition to this, the establishment of a new Regional Skills Forum in the region by my Department will ensure a focus on attaining ambitious targets improved educational attainment and skills provision in the region.  This will see institutions working together in the region to enhance progression and transfer pathways and develop greater co-ordination of academic provision and engagement with regional employers.</p><p>  Technological Universities:</p><p>Furthermore, the new Programme for Government outlines that this new Government will continue to support the creation of Technological Universities.  It is envisaged that the development of a Technological University for the South East will act as a catalyst and stimulus of economic, social and cultural development for the region.</p><p>  The development of Technological Universities is in line with the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030 which provides a framework for the development of the higher education sector to 2030.  With regard to the institute of technology sector, the Strategy recommended significant reforms to position the sector to meet national strategic objectives.  In particular, the Strategy recommended consolidation within the sector and a pathway of evolution for those consolidated institutes of technology, to allow them to demonstrate significant progress against robust performance criteria and to apply to become technological universities.</p><p>  The development of technological universities has the potential to deliver greater opportunity to students in these regions, to staff working in the institutions, and to the broader local economy and society.</p><p>  I would also like to underline that this is much more than a rebranding exercise &ndash; the institutions concerned are required to achieve high standards across a range of areas before being designated as technological universities.  These include standards relating to the qualifications of staff, the quality of research output, the proportion of students engaged in lifelong learning, and other relevant issues.</p><p>  Regional Focus:</p><p>There will also be a specific focus on the particular contribution the university will make to the needs of the region in which it is located. The development of technological universities has the potential to deliver greater opportunity to students in these regions, to staff working in the institutions, and to the broader local economy and society.</p><p>Consortiums who have applied:</p><p>As part of the implementation of the Strategy, the Higher Education Authority in 2012 published a four-stage process and criteria for applicant groups of institutes of technology wishing to apply to become technological universities.</p><p>  The designation process consists of four stages as follows:</p><p>- an expression of interest, </p><p>- the preparation of a plan to meet the criteria, </p><p>- an evaluation of the plan, and</p><p>- an application for designation. </p><p>There are currently four consortia engaged with the process to become designated as TUs.  These are TU4Dublin (Dublin Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Tallaght, Institute of Technology Blanchardstown), Technological University for the South-East (TUSE &ndash; consisting of Waterford Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Carlow), Munster Technological University (MTU &ndash; consisting of Cork Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Tralee) and the Connacht Ulster Alliance (CUA &ndash; consisting of Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Sligo and Letterkenny Institute of Technology).</p><p>  Status of Consortia:</p><p>At the end of 2014, two consortia successfully passed stage 3 of the four-stage process.  These are the TU4Dublin consortium and the Munster Technological University consortium. </p><p>  In early 2015 the Connacht-Ulster Alliance also expressed an interest in merging and in applying to become a technological university.  This application was approved to proceed to the next stage.  In line with the process for designation as a Technological University, Stage 2 of this process involves the preparation of a plan by the Connacht-Ulster Alliance, to meet the criteria for designation as a Technological University.</p><p>  Technological University for the South-East (TUSE):</p><p>With regard to the Technological University for the South-East, consisting of Institute of Technology, Carlow (ITC) and Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT), following the publication of the Kelly report, a preliminary facilitation process which was underway since September 2015, has recently been completed and a Report of the process was received by my Department on 13 May 2016.  There was strong engagement in the process by both parties.  This facilitation process has been an important building block in terms of building trust between the parties and in developing a strong working relationship between the Presidents and Chairs of both institutions.  As part of this process, the Presidents of the two institutions, have jointly developed an initial work-plan to support the development of a joint TU proposal.</p><p>  In addition to this both Institutions made a recent joint presentation and submission to the Higher Education Authority, seeking funding to underpin the next phase of engagement.  This was part of the latest call issued by the Higher Education Authority regarding the restructuring of the higher education landscape.  The call sought submissions for funding support in respect of the costs arising from mergers as part of the implementation of the National Strategy for Higher Education.</p><p>  Position of Technological Universities Bill:</p><p>In relation to the position of the Technological Universities Bill, this Bill was at Report Stage at the time of dissolution of the previous D&aacute;il in February 2016.  I recognise that there were a significant number of matters raised in respect of the Bill at both Committee and Report Stage.  It is my intention to now consult with all of the relevant stakeholders in relation to both the matters raised during the legislative process and the commitments contained in the Programme for Government.</p><p>  Following the finalisation of this consultation process I will then advance the legislation having determined a position in relation to any matters raised as part of this consultation process.</p></reply>

Legal advice indicates that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has published a Plan for the Implementation of the EPSEN Act.  This report, which was published in 2006, made recommendations which suggested that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act.</p>  <p>  My Department's opinion is that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. </p>  <p>  While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.</p>  <p>  These reports include the NCSE policy advice on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools, published in 2013, and the Report of the Working Group on a Proposed New Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for pupils with Special Educational Needs, published in 2014. </p>  <p>  The alternative model is currently being piloted in 47 schools and the effectiveness of the pilot is being reviewed.  This review will allow us to take into account the learning experiences of schools, principals, pupils and the views of parents over the course of the pilot. </p>  <p>  It is therefore intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice.</p>  <p>  Under the Programme for a Partnership Government, I have also committed to consulting with stakeholders to see how best to progress sections of the EPSEN Act that were introduced on a non-statutory basis.</p></reply>

In the same period the number of children accessing SNA support has grown from approximately 22,000 to some 30,000 by the end of 2015. </p>  <p>  The increase in SNA numbers has been supported by a very significant increase in the Budget for SNAs, rising from &euro;332 million in 2011 to &euro;402 million by the end of 2015.</p>  <p>  This is a higher level of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support than ever before, which ensures that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for allocating a quantum of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support enrolled in the school.  Where children have significant care needs whereby they may need additional support to be able to attend school, the NCSE may make an allocation of SNA support to the school to assist that child.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support, which is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.</p>  <p>  All schools were asked to apply for SNA support for the 2016/17 school year by 29th February 2016. </p>  <p>  The NCSE continues to accept applications in recognition that enrolments may not have been completed or where assessments were not completed.  The NCSE will consider these applications and make further allocations to schools in respect of valid applications which have been received to September. </p>  <p>  The NCSE is currently assessing demand for SNA support for the coming school year and will advise all schools of their allocations for SNA support for 2016/17, before the end of the current school year.</p>  <p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy's question relates to the allocation of SNA support by the NCSE to a particular school, I have referred this question to the NCSE for their consideration and direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Some additional funding would also arise for the group water sector.  Assuming the abolition of the Water Conservation Grant, savings of some &euro;660 million would arise, again over the same period and including savings on administrative costs.</p>  <p>  The effect on the fiscal space or budgetary room for manoeuvre as calculated under the Expenditure Benchmark is more complex to describe.  The expenditure undertaken by Irish Water, which counts as general government expenditure, is already in the base level of expenditure.  However, the abolishment of water charges would count as a discretionary revenue reduction for the year after the abolition occurred.  The redeployment of the Water Conservation Grant as subvention to Irish Water would compensate to some degree.</p></reply>

Building on measures introduced by the last Government, the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>commits to considering further appropriate actions in this area and on the broader issue of over indebtedness.</p><p>The Approved Housing Body (AHB) Mortgage to Rent Scheme was launched nationally in June 2012.  It is a Government Initiative to help homeowners who are at risk of losing their homes due to mortgage arrears.  The scheme is an option for people who have been exited from the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) with their lender due to their mortgage being deemed unsustainable.  It is now properly established as part of the overall suite of social housing options and an important part of the arrears resolution process.</p><p>The package of commitments on mortgage arrears announced by Government in May 2015 included a number of amendments to the Mortgage to Rent Scheme which will enable more properties to qualify, and make it more flexible and accessible to borrowers.  Amendments made with effect from July 2015 include raising the valuation thresholds for properties, flexibility in relation to the size of properties, more efficient assessment of a borrower&rsquo;s eligibility for social housing support and flexibility to allow cases of marginal positive equity to avail of the scheme.  Additional financial support has been made available by increasing the ceiling of support under the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) for MTR cases from 30% to 40%.</p><p>My Department continues to keep the operation of the Mortgage to Rent Scheme under review.</p><p>In addition, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2015 was enacted on 8 July 2015.  It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'.  This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises and the Minimum Competency Code) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which comes into operation on 1 July 2016.</p><p>Further, the Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears provides protections for borrowers who endeavour to meet their commitments in relation to their mortgages and the 2015 Act ensures that these protections apply when a loan has been sold.</p></reply>

To qualify for credits a worker must have paid at least one PRSI contribution while working and have had an attachment to the workforce in the last 2 tax years, as evidenced by having paid or credited   PRSI contributions in that period.  In general where a person has no PRSI paid or credited contributions for two full tax years, they cannot be awarded credits again until they return to work and pay PRSI employment contributions for at least 26 weeks.</p>  <p>  Where these qualifying conditions are met, credits are awarded in respect of specific circumstances, including proven unemployment, notified incapacity to work receipt of specific social welfare payments (i.e. Maternity Benefit) or entitlement to certain statutory leave (i.e. Parental Leave).</p>  <p>  Entitlement to credits for adoptive mothers depends on whether an individual has an underlying entitlement to credits, having satisfied the qualifying conditions, and is in receipt of one of the qualifying payments or fulfils the conditions such as those relating to proven unemployment or notified incapacity to work.</p>  <p>  Adoptive mothers may also qualify for the Homemaker scheme.  This scheme was introduced to make it easier for those who provide full-time care to qualify for State pension (contributory).  Once an individual qualifies for State pension (contributory), the rate of payment is determined by the average number of contributions (paid or credited) since entering social insurance to reaching pension age.  Years spent caring on a full-time basis are disregarded when calculating the average.  The scheme was introduced in 1994 and applies to period spent caring from that date.</p></reply>

The evaluation also determined that the activities pursued under the projects had a greater impact as &lsquo;pre-activation&rsquo; programmes, designed to bring participants with a disability nearer to the labour market, rather than being geared specifically towards achieving defined labour market activation/employment outcomes.  The report of the evaluation is available on the department&rsquo;s website: <i></i></p><p>The interdepartmental working group set up to examine the findings of the report has met on two occasions and a third meeting is currently being planned.  Membership of the working group comprises representatives of departments that have commitments under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for people with disabilities.  This strategy provides for learning from the projects to be used to inform policy development.  Officials from the Departments of Education and Skills, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Health and Social Protection as well as representatives from the National Disability Authority have attended and inputted into the deliberations of the group.</p><p>This working group has been tasked with identifying the next steps in the context of future Disability Activation activities under the new ESF programme, Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL), 2014-2020.  This new ESF programme provides &euro;10 million in funding for future disability activation activities.</p><p>While this group has not yet concluded its work, I am satisfied that it will provide a practical means for advancing the positive aspects of the work identified in the DACT evaluation.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It sets out a ten-year approach to ensuring that people with disabilities who can and want to work are supported and enabled to do so.</p>  <p>  The CES sets out a range of actions across a number of departments.  My Department  has a number of commitments under the CES and these include the following: expanding the Intreo service as a gateway to employment activation on a phased basis to cater for people with a disability; enhancing engagement with people with disabilities (drawing on profiling analysis etc.); devising early intervention strategies to address drift into long-term ill-health; leading and supporting an interdepartmental group on Making Work Pay and raising awareness among employers of the supports available to facilitate the employment of people with a disability or the retention of employees who acquire a disability.</p>  <p>  Overall, I am satisfied that my Department is making progress in meeting its commitment under the first phase of the CES as is evident by progress across a number of areas:</p>  <p>  - My Department is progressively rolling out its full activation support service to people with disabilities who wish to avail of the service on a voluntary basis.  The first phase of this roll-out commenced in 2015 with the service being provided in ten Intreo Centres.  The service is now available in 58 Intreo centres and over 60 Employment Support Officers (Case Officers) have received disability specific training supported by the National Disability Authority and Epilepsy Ireland.</p>  <p>  - In order to better inform its approach to the design of supports and interventions to enable participation in the labour force in accordance with capacity and on a voluntary basis, my Department has undertaken a survey of persons in receipt of disability allowance.  The results of this exercise are currently being reviewed in association with the disability sector before publication.</p>  <p>  - My Department has established an interdepartmental expert group, with an independent chair to examine the complex interaction between the benefits system, including the medical card, and the net income gains in employment.  The interdepartmental group will also identify any significant disincentives for people with disabilities in taking up or returning to work.  The interdepartmental group will report to Government by end 2016.</p>  <p>  - The role of employers is important and my Department seeks to raise their awareness of the range of employment supports available to them from the DSP and in promoting the services available to employers to employ a person with a disability or to support an employee who has acquired a disability.  For instance, information on the wage subsidy scheme (WSS), the reasonable accommodation fund for the employment of people with disabilities, the disability awareness training scheme and other employer supports is provided in the Employer Information Pack, through employer roadshows and jobs fairs and on the DSP website.</p>  <p>  - The EmployAbility service is a national employment service dedicated to improving employment outcomes for people with a disability who are seeking employment.  Budget 2016 provides &euro;9.6m to run the service.  The service currently comprises 23 limited companies each with a specific geographical remit and fully funded by my Department.  A recent evaluation of the EmployAbility service is being considered by my Department prior to meeting with relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

On budgetary issues, the Fresh Start Agreement facilitated a comprehensive resolution which took in a number elements set out in the Stormont House Agreement.  In addition the recently-elected Assembly and newly-formed Executive are operating on the basis of the institutional reforms provided for under the Stormont House Agreement, including a formal opposition.  I understand that preparatory work has been advanced by the Executive on the Commission on Flags, Identity, Culture and Tradition and I look forward to it being established at an early stage.</p>  <p>  The establishment of the institutional framework on the past agreed at Stormont House has yet to be implemented.  Significant progress was made on this in the all-party talks last autumn that produced the Fresh Start Agreement, although ultimately final agreement could not be reached on legacy issues, a situation which I found extremely disappointing.</p>  <p>  Over the last number of months, I tasked my officials with holding consultations with a range of victims&rsquo; groups from across the affected communities, to hear their perspectives on how best to establish legacy institutions and to listen to their views on possible solutions to outstanding issues.  These consultations proved very valuable and will inform our approach to seeking an agreement on addressing the legacy issues.</p>  <p>  Following the Assembly elections in Northern Ireland in May, I have been in a position to engage further on this important issue, including during visits to Belfast and Derry over the last two weeks, where I had discussions about how we might reach a final political agreement on the detail of the establishment of these institutions.</p>  <p>  I will be actively engaging with the political parties in Northern Ireland and with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in the weeks ahead with a view to securing an agreement on dealing with the legacy of the past which is so vital both for individual victims and survivors and for society as a whole.</p></reply>

I can assure the Deputy that I will be engaging with my colleagues in Government and with the Oireachtas to seek to advance this commitment in the context of the forthcoming estimates and budgetary processes.</p><p>The issue referred to in the Deputy's question arises from a Council of Europe research project called <i>Compendium - Cultural Policies and Trends in Europe</i>which includes figures on expenditure on culture across Europe.  I understand that many European counties are not included in the figures, including ten EU member states.  The data for the Compendium project are provided by independent researchers and it is not a standardised system for collection of statistics.</p><p>I further understand that the Compendium itself warns that data provided by the researchers are not comparable across countries because each researcher includes different elements in the definition of culture and these elements are reflected in the figures for public expenditure.  Figures can also include some, or all, of national, regional or local expenditure.</p><p>The issue of a definition of culture and of capturing public expenditure on culture is one which was discussed in the public consultation process that was held for the purpose of developing Ireland's first national cultural policy, <i>Culture 2025.</i>This will be reflected in the draft policy document which I intend to submit to Government for consideration in the coming weeks.</p><p>Expenditure on the arts in Ireland comes from multiple sources, both public and private.  I understand that the CSO does not produce national statistics that capture the totality of this expenditure as a percentage of GDP.  I do consider, however, that further research on this issue is warranted in the context of <i>Culture 2025.</i></p></reply>

This has included intense and on-going engagement with turf cutting interests, the farming community, non-governmental organisations and with the European Commission.  In addition, a long-term compensation scheme has been introduced to compensate turf cutters for their loss arising from the cessation.</p>  <p>  The draft National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan was published in January 2014.

This will entail the phasing out of turf cutting on certain NHAs by 1 January 2017 and the partial or complete de-designation of certain NHAs.  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to publish new legislation to de-designate the NHAs in question within the first 100 days of Government and to reviewing the timetable for the implementation of actions relating to NHAs in consultation with the EU.</p>  <p>  Final resolution of all issues in relation to the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s protected raised bogs will only be brought about by everyone working together, within the law, with my Department and with the Peatlands Council, which was established for the purpose of ensuring the input from all stakeholders.</p></reply>

The Film Board also liaises with IDA Ireland and Tourism Ireland in terms of maximising joint opportunities for promotion of Ireland as a location for film productions.

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures (RPS).  Inclusion on the RPS places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.</p><p>Under Section 53 of the Planning and Development Acts 2000, as amended, I may make recommendations to a planning authority concerning the inclusion in its RPS of structures which I consider would merit inclusion and the attendant planning restrictions which would apply to protect the structures&rsquo; special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest.  This process is administered by my Department&rsquo;s National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH) programme.</p><p>There are a number of ways in which my Department acts in respect of possible heritage sites/buildings deemed to be at risk.  One of these is the receipt of applications for funding for the repair, conservation, preservation or safeguarding of protected structures, sites or monuments.  Financial support is being provided by my Department through a number of structured schemes for the conservation and protection of heritage buildings.  My Department itself operates a Structures at Risk Fund to enable conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, that are protected under the Planning and Development Acts and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  This fund is administered through the local authorities and seeks to encourage the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and to help to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.  Applications for this scheme have now closed for 2016, and recommended projects are currently being finalised.  Since 2011, over 130 structures have been safeguarded for the future as a result of the Structures at Risk Fund.</p><p>In 2015 I launched a new &euro;2 million scheme - the Built Heritage Investment Scheme - for the repair and conservation of protected structures.  This scheme will operate in 2016, via the local authorities, on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme, which ran in 2014.  It is expected to support a significant number of projects across the country and to create employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas.  The scheme for this year is now fully allocated.</p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  For 2016, the Council is administering a community based heritage grants scheme available for projects that contributed to particular heritage themes.  Further details can be found at </p><p>My Department has a number of measures at its disposal to facilitate the restoration of major historical or cultural sites.  I am the owner or guardian under the National Monuments Acts of approximately 1,000 national monuments located at approximately 750 sites and in such cases there is a statutory duty to maintain the national monument.  Such maintenance is undertaken by the Office of Public Works.  Local authorities are responsible under the National Monuments Acts for maintaining the national monuments of which they are owners or guardians.  A wide range of other monuments (in the order of 130,000) are currently subject to protection under other provisions of the National Monuments Acts but my Department and the Office of Public Works do not have a direct role in their maintenance except where, as already noted, a monument is a national monument of which I am owner or guardian.</p><p>My Department is also providing &euro;350,000 of funding to the Office of Public Works (OPW) in 2016 to assist in the conservation and presentation of historic buildings and national monuments in State ownership.  OPW undertakes the care and maintenance of national monuments in my ownership or guardianship (of which there are approximately 750).  My Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service works in close collaboration with the OPW on survey, excavation and research work to optimise the protection, management, interpretation and presentation of national monuments in State care.</p></reply>

The 1945 Act allowed for the admission and detention without their consent, of a person as a  'temporary patient' or a 'person of unsound mind' following an application received and accompanied by a medical certificate, signed by a doctor and on foot of a reception order signed by a consultant psychiatrist. </p>  <p>  I would acknowledge that there were no specific provisions in the 1945 Act for an automatic right of appeal to an independent judicial body against a person's involuntary detention in a psychiatric hospital.  However, the Act did provide patients with the right to write a letter to the Minister for Health, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals or the President of the High Court.  It also required the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, in the course of his inspections, to visit any patient "the propriety of whose detention he had reason to doubt".</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Mental Health Act 2001 significantly modernised procedures relating to involuntary admission by establishing for the first time independent Mental Health Tribunals which review, and affirm or revoke detention orders.  Patients now have the right to be heard and to be legally represented at the Tribunal. </p>  <p>  In addition, following the publication in 2015 of the Expert Group Review of the Mental Health Act 2001, work is underway at official level on the preparation of the General Scheme of a Bill to revise the 2001 Act on the basis of the recommendations of the Expert Group.  An initial draft of the Bill is likely to be completed by year end.</p></reply>

The responsibility of community mental health services is to respond to the needs of people with both problems of addiction and serious mental health disorders.</p>  <p>  Acute presentations by service users with co-morbid mental health and addiction problems will be mostly seen by General Adult Community Mental Health Teams, who offer both addiction counselling expertise and mental health intervention as part of an integrated care plan.  These teams are also be responsible for linking these service users to community-based recovery and support programmes as part of facilitating full community re-integration.</p>  <p>  The standard practice for patients presenting to Emergency Departments with mental health issues who have also misused substances is that the mental health assessment would be postponed until the individual is no longer intoxicated and is medically fit to engage in the assessment process.  In the interim, the patient remains under the care of the Hospital Emergency Department Team.</p>  <p>  The HSE Mental Health Directorate has plans to implement a new &lsquo;Dual Diagnosis&rsquo; clinical programme in 2016 addressing those service users with Mental Health difficulties and Substance Misuse.  The overarching aim of the national programmes is to standardise quality evidence based practice across the Mental Health Services.  The Programmes bring together clinical disciplines and enable them to share innovative solutions to deliver greater benefits to every user of HSE services.

The report examines the case for distributing Naloxone, which is an antidote used to reverse the effects of opioid drugs like heroin, morphine and methadone if someone overdoses.</p>  <p>  In May 2015, the HSE undertook a demonstration project to assess and evaluate the suitability and impact of using a pre-filled Naloxone injection which is designed for non-medical administration in Ireland.  The HSE made naloxone available for prescription and supply to opioid drug users under an initiative aimed at reducing drug-related deaths and near-fatal drug overdoses.  There are four locations participating in the project including Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Waterford.  The Irish Prison service is also participating.  The overall objective of the project was to make naloxone more widely available for opioid drug users.</p>  <p>  The project involved 600 opiate users receiving take-home naloxone on prescription.  It also included those recently released from custody who have been identified as at high risk of opioid overdose.  These drug users and those close to them have been trained on how to administer naloxone and to recognise the signs of an overdose.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that an evaluation of the demonstration project is due to be completed shortly and a national implementation plan is currently being developed.</p></reply>

The inquiry concluded in 2012 but for legal reasons the full report was not published.  Subsequent to that, the HSE commissioned Resilience Ireland to undertake a review/look-back exercise into other foster care placements with the family concerned.  This review was completed in early 2015.  Due to its ongoing inquiries, the Garda&iacute; wrote to the HSE asking them not to publish the Devine report or the Resilience Ireland report while the matter was under investigation.</p><p>However the HSE has emphasised that it has not waited for the publication of the Devine report to act on its recommendations, and that it has put in place a number of changes to take account of the service and management deficiencies identified.  This includes the publication, in December 2014, of its national policy: <i>Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse- National Policy and Procedures. </i></p><p>The matter was raised by the Committee on Public Accounts in 2015 in the context of the procurement process for the two reports and the extended period of time during which it has not been possible to publish them.  In response to these concerns Minister of State Kathleen Lynch appointed Conor Dignam S.C. to undertake a review of these matters, taking account of the ongoing Garda investigation.  </p><p>In view of the seriousness of the issues raised and the need to establish the facts, on 2 February last the previous Government approved, in principle, the establishment of a statutory Commission of Investigation into the care of individuals in the foster home in question.  The approval is subject to the agreement of Terms of Reference for the Commission by the Government and approval of the Oireachtas, with the Terms of Reference to be informed by the review being undertaken by Mr. Dignam. </p><p>As the remainder of the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.  If the Deputy has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, he can contact my Private Office and they will follow the matter up with the HSE. </p></reply>

Recruitment can also take place in areas of critical care and emergency services.</p><p>Improving waiting times for scheduled care for patients is a key priority for the Minister of Health and for Government. In 2015, the HSE was provided with additional funding to ensure that maximum waiting times of 18 months by 30 June 2015 and 15 months by year end would be achieved for inpatient and day case treatment and outpatient appointments.  By maximising capacity across public and voluntary hospitals, as well as outsourcing activity where the capacity was unavailable to meet patient needs, HSE figures for end Dec 2015 showed 95% achievement for In-patient and Day Case waiting lists<i></i>and 93% for outpatient waiting lists,<i></i>against the 15 months maximum wait times.</p><p>At the end of April there were around 400,000 patients on the outpatient waiting list and 74,000 on the inpatient/day case list.  Over 60% of patients on waiting lists wait less than 6 months for their required care and 94% are waiting less than the maximum waiting time of 15 months.  The fact that the majority of people on waiting lists (over 60%) are waiting less than 6 months indicates that there is a consistent high demand for healthcare.</p><p>My Department will continue to work with the HSE to ensure that the service needs and waiting times in this area will be addressed, having regard to the overall level of resources available to the HSE.</p></reply>

The vaccine has not been available in Ireland since the end of April 2015.  Consequently, BCG vaccination clinics in HSE Clinics and Maternity hospitals have been postponed until new stock arrives.</p>  <p>  There is only one licensed supplier of BCG vaccine to Ireland and to other countries within the EU.  Since this problem became apparent, the HSE National Immunisation Office has been in regular contact with the manufacturer of BCG vaccine to ascertain when the vaccine might be available.  The HSE has also asked the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), which licenses and regulates all human medicines in Ireland, to source an alternate supplier of the BCG vaccine.  Efforts have been made to find a company who can provide the vaccine for use in Ireland which satisfies all the HPRA requirements on safety and efficacy.  To date no suitable alternative BCG product has been found.  Therefore the HSE has been unable to procure the BCG vaccine from any other source and still awaits the product from the HPRA licensed supplier of the vaccine. </p>  <p>  The supplier has indicated that supplies of the vaccine are not expected to be delivered into Ireland until early 2017.  When there is confirmation of the date of new supply a decision will be made, guided by the recommendations of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, on who should be prioritised to receive the vaccine.</p></reply>

I have always attached major importance to the live cattle export trade, and my Department, along with Bord Bia, has been extremely proactive in both encouraging and facilitating shipments abroad and the cross-border live trade to Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  Last year saw high levels of exports of cattle to both Britain and Northern Ireland, largely driven by favourable currency rates which made cattle from this country more competitive in those markets.  However, as a result of a closer Euro V Sterling exchange rate, exports to the UK this year are lower by approximately 50%.  Exports to Italy are up by almost 20% and exports to Spain have grown by 11%. </p>  <p>  Beyond this market, animal health restrictions and geopolitical instability have impeded previously large-scale exports to Belgium and North Africa respectively.  The markets currently open to live cattle from Ireland include Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Serbia and Algeria, in addition to the other twenty-seven Member States of the European Union.  The exploitation of market outlets, once opened is a commercial matter for the live export sector, and is affected by the usual variables, including the relative cost of beef on the domestic and international markets, currency exchange rates, transport costs and other factors.  I will continue to ensure that irish meat and livestock producers have the option of exporting to as many global markets as possible.  In this regard my Department has agreed health certificates for the export of live cattle to Egypt, Serbia and Algeria in 2016 and is currently investigating the possibilities of bilateral health certificates for the export of cattle to Kazakhstan, Montenegro, and Turkey as well as breeding cattle to Morocco.  In this regard my Department recently hosted a veterinary inspection by the Turkish authorities and is awaiting a report from that exercise.</p></reply>

In accordance with the regulations, this S.I. establishes a point system, which applies to the Licence Holder of a sea-fishing boat when a serious infringement of the Common Fisheries Policy is detected within the Exclusive Fishery Limits of the State or for an Irish vessel, wherever it may be.</p>  <p>  I have been considering all of the concerns raised by Deputies and by the fishing industry in relation to the implementation of the EU points system for serious infringements of the Common Fisheries Policy.  Indeed, this issue was discussed at a meeting I had with representatives of the fishing industry this morning.</p>  <p>  Upon taking office I requested that the Attorney General consider whether there is a way that the assignment of EU points for licence holders can await the completion of the prosecution process, while at the same time ensuring that Ireland is fully in compliance with its obligations under EU law.</p>  <p>  Further to the Programme for Government commitment pertaining to the assignment of penalty points, I quickly sought advice from the Attorney General as prescribed in the document.  Having now received this advice, I am satisfied to move on the introduction of a system for the sequential application of EU points in conjunction with the prosecution process, thus fulfilling the ambition outlined in the Partnership Programme.</p>  <p>  I should advise the Deputy that this move is subject to addressing some important legal and administrative issues in order to ensure compliance with EU law.  I have listened to the concerns of industry and intend to report back to An Oireachtas as soon as I have finalised a way forward in the context of dealing with legal and administrative matters that are arising.  However I am confident that these matters can be dealt with in a collaborative and constructive manner with all stakeholders.</p></reply>

We have been engaged in intensive discussions with the European Commission for some time now highlighting the importance of ensuring a coherent approach to the twin challenges of food security and climate change.</p>  <p>  As part of our ongoing engagement at EU level, my colleague Minister Naughten and I met recently with Commissioner Miguel Arias Ca&ntilde;ete, European Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy to discuss proposals on the EU&rsquo;s Effort Sharing Decision and on Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF).   </p>  <p>  The meeting provided me with the opportunity to restate the commitment of the Irish agriculture sector to improving efficiency and driving down emissions, and to re-emphasise the importance of reflecting the 2014 European Council Conclusions in the proposed effort sharing decision &ndash; particularly, in terms of their recognition of the low mitigation potential of the sector and their reference to the inclusion of afforestation and LULUCF as part of future climate and energy policy.</p>  <p>  Afforestation, the creation of new forest, is included as a specific mitigation measure in paragraph 2.14 of the Council Conclusions.  This is important for Ireland as afforestation is the main cost-effective land-based climate mitigation tool available to us.  Climate change mitigation by forests, forest fuels and wood products is one of the principal drivers of the policy to expand forest cover out to mid century.  Annual estimates of the current level of uptake of carbon dioxide by forests are provided by my Department to the Environmental Protection Agency.  Projected levels of uptake in forests and storage in solid wood products out to 2020 have been provided to the European Commission under Decision 529/2013 on land use, land-use change and forestry. </p>  <p>  We will continue to work closely with the Commission prior to the launch of proposals for an effort sharing decision, which are expected later this summer.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that Ireland is one of a small number of EU countries to have elected to report on cropland and grazing land management activities under the Kyoto Protocol (KP).  This would allow Ireland to take advantage of any sequestration benefits that may be allowed in the future from these activities.</p></reply>

The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming.</p>  <p>  The High Speed Broadband Map 2020, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the extent of the State Intervention area, which is the subject of procurement.  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The Department continues to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area where commercial operators have committed to providing services, to ensure that those services are delivered.  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention and includes the townland of Granaghan Beg, County Clare.  Members of the public can view whether their premises are in the BLUE or AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.  The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county.</p>  <p>  Over 750,000 premises are the focus of the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire ('PQQ') and Project Information Memorandum.  Five responses were received from prospective bidders to this stage of the competitive procurement process by the deadline of 31 March 2016.  The five responses are being assessed in line with the criteria set down by the Department with a view to shortlist of qualified bidders proceeding to the next stage of procurement.  </p>  <p>  The second stage in the procurement process will be a formal invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) to shortlisted bidders.  I expect that my Department will move to this stage in the next month.  The third stage of the procurement process involves the issue of final tender documentation which follows the dialogue process.  Following the submission of final tenders by bidders, a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy.  The Department will then enter into formal contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s).  It is expected that contract(s) will be awarded by June 2017.</p>  <p>  In preparation for the procurement stage of the process my Department investigated how different technical solutions could be used to deliver high speed broadband.  In line with EU State Aid rules, the process must be "technology neutral" and it is not therefore possible to specify what technology should be used to build the network.  As part of the procurement process bidders will be asked to propose solutions which meet the NBP service requirements.  It is recognised however, that a significant fibre build will be required, regardless of what technology is used to provide services to individual premises.  Once the successful bidder or bidders is chosen the technology to be deployed will be made clear.  </p>  <p>  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht.  Once contract(s) are in place, I expect to publish a detailed rollout plan for the network.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits also to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys will lead on the establishment of county or regional broadband taskforces, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once contract(s) have been awarded.</p></reply>

I have no direct statutory function in relation to liquefied natural gas projects, including specific projects such as the Shannon LNG project, which is a commercial private sector initiative.</p>  <p>  An LNG facility would provide additional security of supply to Ireland, in that it would bring diversity to Ireland's gas supply sources and would bring connectivity to the global LNG market. </p>  <p>  This Government is supportive of the proposal to construct a LNG terminal near Ballylongford and the Programme for Government commits to examining if there are ways to facilitate liquid natural gas on the island of Ireland. </p>  <p>  As part of implementing my Department's Energy Policy Paper, "Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future", our dependency on imported gas, particularly in the context of electricity generation, will be examined.

A Special Speed Limit may also include a periodic speed limit which can be designed to apply and operate at specified periods, for example when children are arriving at, or leaving a school during term time.  The consent of Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) is required when Special Speed Limits are being applied on national roads.</p><p>To assist local authorities in the application of Special Speed Limits, my Department's <i>Guidelines for Setting and Managing Speed Limits in Ireland</i>, published in March 2015, provides detailed guidance on the application of Special Speed Limits outside of schools and is available to all local authorities.  These Guidelines reiterate that the making of Special Speed Limit by-laws is a matter for the Elected Members of local authorities, subject to following Department Guidelines and to the consent of TII in the case of national roads.</p><p>In consideration of a nationwide 30km/h speed limit outside schools during term time, in view of the statutory provisions already available to local authorities, it is my view that the introduction of Special Speed Limits can be best addressed through discussions between all interested parties locally, including council officials and Elected Members, community groups, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and TII rather than being centrally imposed.</p></reply>

However, through the focused collaborative approach and a range of reforms delivered in the region over the recent years, the unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of 20.1 per cent in Q1 2012 to 12.5 per cent in Q1 2016, with 204,400 now at work, which is an increase of 23,100 over the period.</p><p>While the unemployment rate is still too high, the figures demonstrate that the overall trend is one of steady recovery and I am working relentlessly with the various agencies and stakeholders in the South East to ensure that this trend continues and jobs are ultimately created.</p><p>The South East Economic Forum referred to by the Deputy was established to drive the recommendations of the South East Employment Action Plan, developed in late 2011.  The Forum met on five occasions and its membership comprised representatives from this Department and its enterprise agencies, County Councils, the education sector, Teagasc and F&aacute;ilte Ireland, The Forum progressed a significant number of actions from the Plan.  However with the development of the broader South East Regional Action Plan for Jobs, the role of the Forum was subsumed into the implementation process for that Plan and many of the organisations that were represented on the Forum continue to be involved.</p><p>I am particularly pleased that the implementation of many of the key recommendations of the South East Action Plan for Jobs and the South East Economic Development Strategy (SEEDS) reports are having a demonstrable impact on the performance of the South East region.  The remaining recommendations in the Plan and some actions set out in the South East Economic Development Strategy have been incorporated into the South East Action Plan for Jobs where appropriate, and are currently being implemented through that mechanism.</p><p>The core objective of the South East Regional Action Plan for Jobs, launched in September 2015, is to support an ambitious programme of enterprise growth and job creation in the region.  The primary objective of the Plan is to realise the potential to have a further 10-15 per cent at work in the region by 2020 so as to ensure the unemployment rate is within the 1 per cent of the State average. </p><p>Among the short, medium and long term actions in the Action Plan to be delivered over the period 2015-2017 include increasing Start-ups/SMEs by 30%; increasing IDA supported investments in the region; a 20% increase in jobs in exporting companies, in particular in manufacturing, agrifood, businesses services and biopharma/medtech; an 85% increase in agri-food exports over the next 10 years and delivering 300,000 extra tourists and 5,000 associated jobs.  The implementation of South East Action Plan is being led by a collaborative enterprise and public sector Group, chaired by enterprise champion Frank O'Regan, with the active support of regional stakeholders, including Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  My Department is working closely with the Group as it progresses the Plan.  The first progress report of the Plan will be completed and published in Q3 2016.</p><p>In relation to the IDA&rsquo;s role in the South East, the Region has 71 IDA client companies who collectively employ 12,766 people.  The number of jobs created and lost in IDA supported companies from 2013 to 2015 are outlined in the following table.  The figures for 2016 will not be available until completion of IDA&rsquo;s annual employment survey which takes place in November each year.<table><tr><th>No of Companies </th><th>65</th><th>68</th><th>71</th></tr><tr><td>Total Jobs</td><td>12,003</td><td>12,462</td><td>12,766</td></tr><tr><td>Gross Gain</td><td>691</td><td>947</td><td>735</td></tr><tr><td>Gross Losses</td><td>-760</td><td>-488</td><td>-431</td></tr><tr><td>Net Change </td><td>-69</td><td>459</td><td>304</td></tr></table></p><p>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy, <i>WINNING Foreign Direct Investment 2015 - 2019</i>, sets out challenging targets including a minimum of 30% to 40% increase in the number of investment for each region outside of Dublin.  </p><p>Currently, IDA positions the South East in the market place as an investment location with a strong ecosystem of both indigenous and multinational companies operating across a diverse range of sectors.  In particular there are strong clusters in the Life Sciences and Financial Services/Business Services sectors, as well as strong FDI Engineering manufacturing businesses, which have contributed to new significant FDI investments.</p><p>In relation to Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s role, the Agency has 524 clients in the South East region which range in size from early stage start-ups to large companies.  Employment data for EI is collected annually. Therefore, it is not possible to provide employment figures for 2016 as requested by the Deputy however the job figures for the South East region for the period 2013-2015 are outlined in the following table.<table><tr><th>Region</th><th></th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th></tr><tr><td>South-East</td><td>PFT Jobs</td><td>15730</td><td>16485</td><td>17463</td></tr><tr><td>South-East</td><td>Other Jobs</td><td>1852</td><td>2126</td><td>2279</td></tr><tr><td>South-East</td><td>Total Jobs</td><td>17582</td><td>18611</td><td>19742</td></tr><tr><td>South-East</td><td>PFT Gains</td><td>1356</td><td>1863</td><td>1636</td></tr><tr><td>South-East</td><td>PFT Losses</td><td>1400</td><td>1108</td><td>658</td></tr><tr><td>South-East</td><td>PFT Change</td><td>44</td><td>755</td><td>978</td></tr></table></p><p>In 2015, Enterprise Ireland invested &euro;11.639m in Client Companies in the South East region.  From 2011 to 2015, EI approved Innovative High Potential Support to 25 companies in the region, with over &euro;12m of support approved. In addition, 20 start-up companies from the region secured funding of &euro;50,000 each under the Competitive start Fund.  Ongoing investment in the region, together with delivery of its suite of enterprise supports, will continue as part of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s continued effort to drive job creation in the South East.</p></reply>

We have made substantial progress since the Action Plan for Jobs process was first introduced in 2012.  We can point to the considerable strides made in reducing the unemployment rate from 15.1% at the start of the Action Plan for Jobs process to 7.8 percent in May 2016, with 155,000 extra at work since early 2012.</p><p>The Programme for Government sets out a target to create an additional 200,000 jobs from over the period 2016 to 2020, informed by our statement on enterprise policy, Enterprise 2025, which set out Ireland&rsquo;s potential across a number of key metrics.  I am convinced that achieving our ambition for sustainable job growth will require a continued cross government focus on addressing the challenges and realising the ambition set out in Enterprise 2025. </p><p>To deliver on this ambitious target, in the Programme for Government we commit to maintaining the OECD endorsed Action Plan for Jobs (APJ) Process that will set out, on an annual basis, the best ideas for job creation within available resources.  Building on this process, we are focused on ensuring that we can support new job creation in every region in the country over the next five years, through the implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs.  A key objective of the plans is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the aim, as set out in Enterprise 2025, of having the unemployment rate of each region within one per cent of the national average.  Good progress is being made on the targets in the regional Action Plans with 44,500 extra at work in 2015.</p><p>The Regional Action Plan initiative brings the different stakeholders in each of the regions together to identify a range of innovative and practical actions, to be taken across a range of Departments and agencies, with clear timelines for delivery over the period 2015 &ndash; 2017. </p><p>Each Plan is being monitored and driven in each region by a Regional Implementation Committee, with membership drawn from industry, local authorities, Enterprise Agencies, education sector and other key stakeholders and agencies.  Collaboration between the private and the public sector has been a core element in each plan&rsquo;s development, and will be central to each plan&rsquo;s delivery.  The first Progress Reports on the implementation of the Plans, covering the period to end-June 2016, will be completed and published in Q3 2016.</p><p>The focus on job creation is a government wide agenda, and it involves:</p><p>-  achieving a leap forward in the capacity and the performance of enterprises based here and in attracting further investment.  We will put in place an extra &euro;500 million in capital funding to accelerate export led jobs growth across Ireland&rsquo;s regions;</p><p>-  focusing investments in areas where Ireland can differentiate itself internationally &ndash; specifically education &amp;amp; Skills, creating attractive places to live and work and supporting enterprise innovation;</p><p>-  improving the environment for business in terms of access to finance, cost competitiveness, tax environment and economic infrastructures.  The Programme for Government commits to introducing tax incentives to support our entrepreneurs and job creators, including further reducing Capital Gains Tax for new start-ups, and increasing the earned income tax credit for the self-employed; and,</p><p>-  maintaining a focus on protecting our national competitiveness from unsustainable cost growth.<table><tr><th>Region</th><th>Published Regional Action Plan for Jobs targets 2015 to 2020</th></tr><tr><td>North East/North West</td><td>28,000</td></tr><tr><td>Midland</td><td>14,000</td></tr><tr><td>West</td><td>25,000</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>66,000</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-East</td><td>25,000</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-West</td><td>23,000</td></tr><tr><td>South-East</td><td>25,000</td></tr><tr><td>South-West</td><td>40,000</td></tr></table></p></reply>

As set out in 'A Programme for a Partnership Government', our objective is to protect our national competitiveness from unsustainable cost growth and to deliver a job-fit business environment which ranks in the top tier globally.</p>  <p>  Core inflation (consumer prices excluding food and energy) has been low in Ireland and across the Euro area in recent years.  At present, Ireland is experiencing a negative consumer price environment.  Prices on average, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, were 0.1 per cent lower in April 2016 compared with April 2015.  As highlighted by the CSO, the most notable changes in the year were decreases in Transport (-4.9%), Furnishings, Household Equipment &amp;amp; Routine Household Maintenance (-2.6%), Clothing &amp;amp; Footwear (-2.3%) and Food &amp;amp; Non-Alcoholic Beverages (-1.0%).  There were increases in Miscellaneous Goods &amp;amp; Services (+4.5%), Education (+3.8%), Restaurants &amp;amp; Hotels (+2.0%) and Alcoholic Beverages &amp;amp; Tobacco (+1.7%).   </p>  <p>  The Costs of Doing Business Report published by the National Competitiveness Council on April 21st provides an assessment of Ireland's cost competitiveness performance vis-a-vis a range of competitor countries.  The report, which has been noted by Government, concentrates on the costs on enterprise that are largely domestically determined such as labour, property, transport, energy, water, waste, communications, credit /financial, and business service.  It finds that Ireland&rsquo;s cost base has improved across a range of metrics over the last five years.  This has made Irish firms more competitive internationally and made Ireland a more attractive location for firms to base their operations in.  However, despite these improvements, Ireland remains a relatively high cost location for a range of key business inputs and there is upward cost pressure evident in property, business services and the labour market.  The Council warns that Ireland is particularly vulnerable to external shocks beyond our control &ndash; external risks at the moment include in particular Brexit, oil prices and exchange rate movements.</p>  <p>  The report is a timely reminder of the risks of complacency regarding our cost competitiveness performance.  The improved competitiveness of Ireland&rsquo;s exporting sector, as reflected in the IMD Competitiveness rankings released earlier this week where we have moved to 7th position globally, has been one of Ireland&rsquo;s greatest strengths in recent years and has been central to economic growth and job creation. </p>  <p>  In relation to cost competitiveness, as the Council have previously pointed out, we must focus on the controllable portion of our enterprise cost base, and continue to take action to address unnecessarily high costs (i.e. cost levels not justified by productivity) wherever they arise.  Measures that ensure open and competitive markets are also essential.  At the same time, productivity performance will assume an even more prominent role in driving Irish international competitiveness.</p>  <p>  Addressing Ireland&rsquo;s international cost competitiveness is a key economic policy priority for Government and as set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, a range of initiatives are in train across Government Departments to support cost competitiveness.  In addition, the Council and my Department and its agencies are continually engage with relevant public and private stakeholders, as there is a role for both the public and private sectors alike to proactively manage their cost base and drive efficiency, thus creating a virtuous circle between the costs of living, wage expectations and cost competitiveness.  The policy implications of the Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2016 report&rsquo;s analysis, and associated structural reforms required to address Ireland&rsquo;s cost base, will be included in the Council&rsquo;s annual Competitiveness Challenge report which will be brought to Government published later this year.</p></reply>

The work of the authorised officers relates to the application of the Protection of Employment Act 1977 (as amended) to the collective redundancies in question.  That Act imposes a number of obligations on employers who are contemplating collective redundancies, including an obligation to consult with employees (section 9) and an obligation to provide certain information to employees for the purpose of section 9 consultations (section 10).  The work of the authorised officers is ongoing.  In this regard the Deputy may be aware from media reports that one of the parties from whom the authorised officers sought information initiated proceedings in the High Court challenging the powers of the authorised officers.  The High Court is due to consider the matter further on 7 July.</p>  <p>  On a separate note, the Deputy may be aware from media reports that in July 2015 over 60 former Clerys workers, represented by their respective trade unions SIPTU and Mandate, made complaints to the Rights Commissioner Service under the Protection of Employment Act 1977 (as amended) and that in January 2016 they were awarded compensation by a Rights Commissioner in respect of their complaints.  The Rights Commissioner Service was under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, prior to the establishment of the Workplace Relations Commission on 1st October 2015.  The service acted independently in the exercise of its quasi-judicial function.  Hearings heard under the auspices of a Rights Commissioner were heard in private, and in accordance with the relevant legislation their decisions or recommendations were issued to both parties and/or their representative(s), but were not published.</p></reply>

The mechanism for the enforcement of directors&rsquo; fiduciary duties is through a court action.</p>  <p>  Section 599 of the Act provides that, on the application of the liquidator or any creditor or contributory of a company that is being wound up, the court, if satisfied that it just and equitable to do so, having regard to the provisions of the section, may make an order that a related company contribute to the debts of the company being wound up.  I understand that the Minister for Social Protection is currently considering how the provisions of the Companies Act 2014, including section 599, might be used to recover the moneys expended from the Social Insurance Fund.  My Department is not a creditor of the company concerned and would have no locus standi in this regard.</p>  <p>  Section 608 confers a power on the court, again on the application of the liquidator or any creditor or contributory of a company that is being wound up, to order the delivery of property or the proceeds of sale of property to the liquidator.  My Department is not a creditor of the company concerned and would have no locus standi to bring an action in this regard.</p>  <p>  The liquidator has a duty under section 624 to administer the property of a company to which he or she is appointed.  This duty includes the realisation and distribution of the assets of a company in accordance with law.  Section 621 sets out the order of priority of payments of debts in a winding up.  The section provides that each type of debt ranks equally among itself and, where the assets of a company are insufficient to meet such debts in full, the debts abate in equal proportions.  The liquidator in a winding up by the court is an officer of the court.</p>  <p>  Ultimately it will be a matter for the court to determine in any particular case brought before it if the relevant law has been complied with.</p></reply>

This measure, which will be introduced from September 2016, means that children will be eligible to start free pre-school when they reach the age of 3, and continue to avail of free pre-school until they start primary school (once the child is not older than 5&frac12; years at the end of the pre-school year i.e. end June).  Following the introduction of the expanded programme there will be three opportunities each year - in September, January and April - for eligible children to enrol for the free pre-school provision.  This will ensure that children aged 3 or over have the opportunity to enrol as soon as possible after their third birthday.  The maximum number of free pre-school weeks to which a child is entitled will depend on their date of birth, and the age at which they start primary school.</p>  <p>  The expansion of the ECCE programme will see the number of children benefitting from the Programme rise from around 67,000 to around 127,000 in a given programme year.  For the 2016/17 programme year, it is estimated that 89,500 children will be eligible to enrol in the Programme from September 2016, an additional 22,000 from January 2017 and a further 15,500 from April 2017.  Accommodating this expansion requires a significant increase in capacity in the pre-school sector; providers need time to implement any needed infrastructural or services changes, or to hire additional staff.  The September 2016 implementation date was set to allow pre-school providers to put such measures in place.  Should an earlier start date have been chosen, the likelihood is that there would not have been sufficient capacity in the sector to accommodate all children.</p>  <p>  In addition, an upper age limit for participation in free pre-school was set by the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment on the advice of the Department of Education and Skills.  Limiting the diversity in age ranges in primary school is considered to be generally in the best interest of children, in relation to peer interaction in junior infants, as well as other educational considerations.  This does mean that different children will spend different lengths of time in free pre-school, but our focus throughout in considering these issues was how to achieve the best outcomes for children.</p>  <p>  A child born in December 2012 is eligible to enrol in free pre-school, under the ECCE scheme in September 2016 as this is the earliest entry point after the child&rsquo;s third birthday.  They will not be eligible to enrol again in September 2017 as the child would be over the upper age limit of 5&frac12; years at the end of the 2016/2017 pre-school year (i.e. June 2017).</p></reply>
