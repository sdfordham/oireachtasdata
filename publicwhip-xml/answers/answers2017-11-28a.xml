I am pleased to have secured funding for Tusla to establish this service.  In my performance statement for Tusla's 2018 business plan preparations, I have asked that this important service is in place in early 2018.</p>  <p>  Tusla has put in place a project team who are to re-organise services within an integrated national Tusla emergency service.  This builds on the existing infrastructure.  Key steps in the process are to put in place a national manager, have a single national contact number, provide social work advice and support on a 24 hour basis, and have a foster care service available for out of hours placements.  This will also see an on-call social worker service being available to receive children removed by Garda&iacute; under section 12, and accompany them to their identified placement.  A project plan is to be developed by Tusla management.  </p>  <p>  At present, there is a 24 hour Emergency Out Of Hours phone service  in place in all areas.  There is a dedicated phone number for Garda&iacute; and hospitals to access social work consultation out of hours.  There are also social workers available out of hours in Cork, and in the Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare area, on a 24 hour, 7 day a week basis.  Budget 2018 will enable Tusla to provide a greatly improved service, by integrating existing services, and ensuring the on-call availability of social workers throughout the country on a 24/7 basis for emergency cases.  A project team has been established to implement the necessary changes.  </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department and Tusla recently visited a service  that provides the out of hour supports in Northern Ireland. The service they provide differs from ours, as it is a wider service for children and adults, and is a contact point for statutory social work involvement in mental health services.  It is aimed at urgent or emergency situations outside of normal office hours.  This provides important lessons about access to a round the clock social work service.</p>  <p>  In urgent situations, Garda&iacute; must be present to access premises or to remove a child to a place of safety as social workers do not have such legal powers.  For example, the decision to invoke section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991 can only be made by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If a child in immediate danger, as with any other citizen, the correct course of action is to contact Garda&iacute; without delay.  Under the new emergency out of hours service, a social worker will be on-call to attend situations where a child has been removed by Garda&iacute; as an emergency measure under section 12 of the Child Care Act. </p>  <p>  The expanded Tusla Emergency Service will enable greater joint working between Garda&iacute; and Tusla, which will create better outcomes and faster responses for children at immediate risk.  </p></reply>

Galway would be informed by international best practice. As I have advised the Deputy recently, I have now received the Expert Technical Group's final report. I propose to bring the report to Government shortly with a view to its publication. To assist me in this regard I have sought the advices of the Attorney General and my Department is consulting with relevant Departments and agencies in relation to the practical issues which will arise upon publication. </p>  <p>  The Expert Group's preliminary report outlines the range of options which could be considered as next steps on this site. I published this report on my Department's website in July. The Expert Group's final report fully explores each of 5 options, including the feasibility of delivery and what outcomes might reasonably be expected for this specific site.   These options range from the least technical to the most complex responses which are feasible at this site. </p>  <p>  My primary concern is to ensure that whatever action is taken respects the memory and dignity of the deceased children who lived their short lives in this institution. The report will be published to support efforts to build towards a consensus and I can assure the Deputy that consultations will take place with stakeholders before any decisions are made on the future of the site. I am of course willing to discuss this report in the House at a suitable opportunity. However,  I would suggest that such discussion would benefit from first allowing those most centrally involved an opportunity to read the report and have their say.</p></reply>

ECCE providers have catered for over 120,000 children for this programme year and while there can be pressures in some immediate localities; all eligible children have been catered for. We are working closely with the local CCC&rsquo;s and to date there is no reported shortage of places in County Cork.</p>  <p>  Further, from September 2018, the ECCE Programme will revert to one single entry point in a given ECCE Programme Year (i.e. September) with eligible children entitled to two full years of ECCE provision. From September 2018, the number of ECCE enrolments in any given year will be around 114,000. Given that 120,000 places were filled in April 2017, there should be no capacity issues for the 114,000 expected to register for ECCE, for as long as 2 years, from September 2018.</p>  <p>  Towards assisting in alleviating pressures with regard to availability of ECCE places in certain areas, my Department provided &euro;8.4 million for its 2017 Early Years Capital funding programme. This represents a doubling of the &euro;4m provided under the 2016 Early Years Capital.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-28a.30.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112800059#WRB00300"><p>Budget 2017 announced a radical redesign of how we deliver support to make quality childcare accessible and affordable for families in Ireland. The new Affordable Childcare Scheme (ACS) will provide financial support for parents towards the cost of childcare.  This new Scheme will replace the existing targeted childcare programmes with a single, streamlined and more user-friendly scheme and will include &ldquo;wraparound‟ care for pre-school and school-age children. The ambition of this project is immense; its scope matched only in size by its complexity. This scheme aims to reduce poverty, facilitate labour activation, improve outcomes for children and tangibly reduce the cost of childcare for tens of thousands of families. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently putting in place the legal and technical infrastructures to underpin the Affordable Childcare Scheme. I am delighted to report that draft legislation to give our new approach a legal backbone is well advanced and publication of a draft Bill is expected before the end of the year. </p>  <p>  The building of a state of the art IT system to make subsidised childcare more accessible is also being advanced. The IT development is subject to scrutiny by a peer review group (PRG) at the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO).  The project has passed the first stage of the peer review process (reviewing the Business Case) and is close to completing the second stage (Request for Tender Stage).  </p>  <p>  Whilst delivering the scheme as soon as possible remains a priority, I believe that it is prudent to ensure we get the new systems right, so that they operate smoothly for everyone. Accordingly, in progressing our work, we strive to meet the highest standards available and avoid mistakes made on previous government IT projects. In doing so, we have committed ourselves to extensive consultation and peer review processes. </p>  <p>  While intensive work is underway, the project is heavily dependent on timelines beyond its immediate control, such as the advancement of legislation through the Oireachtas.  In particular, the timeframe is dependent upon ICT development.  Once we have completed the Request for Tender element of the project and have the successful developer in place, we will be able to confirm and communicate a timeline for the full introduction of the scheme.  Until then, I am not in a position to make a commitment on the exact launch date of ACS.  </p>  <p>  We are well on our way to introducing the Affordable Childcare Scheme. In the meantime, the families of 64,000 children or 91% of the children eligible for the measures introduced by my Department are already benefiting from financial support for their childcare, on a par with what will be delivered under the new scheme. This number is increasing daily.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-28a.33.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112800059#WRB00500"><p>I can inform the Deputy that,  in my opinion, the lives of children living in Direct Provision improved significantly when it was confirmed that the Ombudsman for Children had remit to receive complaints from them and on their behalf. Even if no complaint is ever made, the ability to make a complaint to the Ombudsman or Ombudsman for Children is a key right of a child or a parent in respect of a service being received by the State. The previous exclusion of people in Direct Provision from making such a complaint was wrong in my view and I am glad that such an exclusion no longer exists.</p>  <p>  The Ombudsman for Children has statutory independence in the exercise of his functions under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002. I am aware that significant work has been done by the Ombudsman for Children's Office, the OCO, as part of this expanded remit. I understand that since April 2017 the OCO has visited every Direct Provision centre and Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre in the country where children and young people under 18 reside. This was primarily to raise awareness and understanding of  the OCO's role to examine and investigate complaints. It is important that both residents and service providers are aware of the role of the Ombudsman for Children.  </p>  <p>  I am also aware that, in the context of its complementary statutory function to promote children's rights and welfare, the OCO is delivering workshops on children's rights for children living in Direct Provision. These workshops have been delivered in 9 Direct Provision centres since September 2017 and I understand that the OCO is planning to deliver further such workshops during 2018. </p>  <p>  My Department was represented on the Working Group on the Protection Process that was chaired by Judge Bryan McMahon that published its report in June 2015. One of that Group's recommendations was that the remit of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children should be extended to complaints relating to services to residents of direct provision accommodation centres and to transfer decisions following breach of rules. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department also assisted the Department of Justice and Equality in consulting with children in Direct Provision centres on what they thought about their lives in these places. The Deputy will be aware of my strong belief in the value of seeking the views of children and young people on matters that affect them. I recently launched the Hub na n&Oacute;g to serve as a resource to assist government departments and other bodies with such consultations. </p>  <p>  At present, officials in my Department are working with the Department of Justice and Equality to develop standards for the governance and management of Direct Provision centres. </p>  <p>  I believe all of these measures have and will improve the lives of children in these centres.

While each young person is in Oberstown the aim is to provide best care, education and therapy programmes that will support their reintegration into the community through the development of individual and comprehensive placement plans. </p>  <p>  The so-called "CEHOP" framework supports the journey through care of each child through planning and co-operation of all agencies addressing Care, Education, Health, Offending Behaviour and Preparing for Release of young people across the campus. The Irish Youth Justice Service and Tusla have together developed a multi-disciplinary clinical service for children in special care and detention. The provision of the Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service, known as ACTS, commenced in 2013 and has continued for young people in Oberstown during 2017.      </p>  <p>  The Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument (MAYSI-2) mental health screening takes place on all children entering detention to gauge the level of risk they may pose to themselves. The multi-disciplinary ACTS team consider this information and make clinical decisions about the need for clinical interventions.</p>  <p>  The ACTS include psychologists, social workers, speech and language therapists and addiction counsellors. The role of the service is to provide specialist assessment or intervention from specialists within the clinical team to young people in need of services. Provision of an in-reach psychiatric service is also provided through the Health Service Executive (HSE). Currently there is a psychiatrist and psychiatric nurse available to Oberstown who works in a collaborative way with other services on the Campus. </p>  <p>  ACTS also engages in short term interventions, when children return to their communities, to support them to re-engage with mainstream services, as appropriate. The service is flexible in that, as children move between placements, it continues to provide clinical services.</p>  <p>  ACTS supports professionals in their ongoing work with young people and also liaises with services to facilitate the continuation of ongoing therapeutic work when the young person&rsquo;s detention ends.</p></reply>

It is my Department's policy that the use of Single Separation shall be a measure of last resort.  Following my Department's publication Oberstown carried out a review of its Single Separation Policy. The revised Single Separation Policy for Oberstown, was approved by the Oberstown Board of Management in April 2017.</p>  <p>  Arising from this review, the separation procedures are being  reviewed and revised in line with the new policy. All staff are receiving refresher training on the policy and will receive training on the procedures once completed. </p>  <p>  The number of separations that take place and the recording of what is deemed to be separation in line with the stated policy is a matter of concern which has emerged in the most recent HIQA inspection report. Under the current HIQA Action Plan for Oberstown, a process to ensure that unit managers monitor single separation records was established by the Deputy Director for Care Services and implementation of this process is the responsibility of the Deputy Director for Residential Services. Record keeping on the use of single separation and other restrictive practices have been further informed by an audit review undertaken by the Deputy Director for Care Services. Direction has been provided to all unit managers on the requirements to ensure that all staff comply with campus procedures and policies. Further monitoring of the records will be undertaken by Oberstown management and specific audits have been scheduled to be carried out by the end of 2017. </p>  <p>  There is now a process in place to ensure that any extensions to the use of separation comply with these policies and procedures. This process includes the availability of senior management on a 24/7 basis to approve the use of separation, following a risk assessment, in specific instances. </p></reply>

Under this Scheme, grant-aid is made available in respect of out-of-school projects for disadvantaged young people. Priority is given to projects in the spheres of special youth work initiatives, young homeless people, young people at risk of substance abuse and young travellers.   Funding to staff-led youth services has generally been targeted at areas of disadvantage and not in proportion to the youth population of a county.</p>  <p>  In addition, funding has been provided to Laois Offaly Education and Training Board under the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme, Youth Capital Funding Scheme and the Local Youth Club Equipment Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that my Department is managing the most significant reform of youth services ever undertaken. This will provide an opportunity to identify need and to focus funding on young people most in need of intervention. </p>  <p>  Under this reform earlier this year, I approved funding of &euro;800,000 for the establishment of new youth projects and for the augmentation of a small number of existing youth services to meet new challenges arising from population increases. An application in respect of Laois was, unfortunately, not successful. However I would encourage further applications in respect of Laois for any funding that becomes available. </p>  <p>  Future development and investment in youth services will be informed by the recently completed exercise which mapped youth service provision across the State. This mapping will assist the Department and the relevant ETB in developing a detailed social demographic profile in terms of both population numbers and deprivation levels.  My Department is committed to working with Laois and Offaly ETB to identify need and explore ways to address this need where it emerges.</p></reply>

This represents approximately 88% of Early Years services which provide non ECCE services. This number continues to rise and applications from providers wishing to provide these subsidies will continue to be accepted for the duration of the programme year. </p>  <p>  A record of all participating providers is maintained by Pobal, which operates the Early Years schemes on behalf of DCYA. The 30 City and County  Childcare Committees are also aware of services that have contracted and have offered information and support to outstanding services to enable them to sign up over the remainder of the programme year if they so choose.</p>  <p>  I am delighted to state that the families of over 64,000 children are benefitting from these increased childcare supports, and the figure continues to rise on a daily basis. 30,000 children are receiving the Universal Payment, which amounts to as much as &euro;1,040 per child under 3, per annum. 34,000 children, from families who need supports the most, are also receiving up to &euro;145 per child, per week. The 64,000 children already represents 91% of the numbers we had estimated and, as I said before, continues to rise on a daily basis. </p>  <p>  To respond to providers that had expressed concerns around the administration of these new measures, I recently announced payments totalling &euro;3.5 million for all childcare providers who register for the enhanced childcare measures. These payments will be made in the coming weeks. This, in addition to &euro;14.5m that has already been  paid to childcare services in 2017, is in recognition of the administration associated with the schemes.

Under the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) Plan 2017 a number of new schools are now included and will be joining the SCP from September 2018. In this regard it is anticipated that the provision of SCP supports in additional schools will require further resources to be made available to the SCP from 2018 onwards.</p>  <p>  The School Completion Programme is a core element of the Educational Welfare Service provided by Tusla and I believe it is a crucial service for  children, parents and schools. The SCP is a targeted fund which seeks to meet the needs of young people most at risk of early school leaving. The SCP aims to drive consistent improvement in the rates of school completion. It does this through the use of evidence based interventions to maintain vulnerable young people in mainstream education and to support young people who have dropped out of formal education to re-engage with learning. </p>  <p>  The School Completion Programme is critical to ensuring that children who are most at risk of early school leaving are supported to stay in education. The further development of the School Completion Programme deserves careful reflection and analysis to ensure that it achieves the outcomes required. I also need ensure that services under the Programme are compliant with financial and governance rules, and that we have the best possible model of service delivery throughout the country. To this end, I am currently examining recommendations from the Educational Welfare Service of Tusla as to how best to strengthen  and improve the Programme. </p></reply>

The Group includes representatives from Campus staff and management, the Board of Management, my Department, a child development expert, representatives of the IMPACT Trade Union and is chaired by the chair of the Board of Management. The Implementation Group is tasked with analysing the recommendations from the Operational Review, as well as the Security Review, Behavioural Management Review and the two Health and Safety Reviews. Work processing all of the recommendations from the reviews has been ongoing since March 2017. In line with the terms of reference, a final report setting out the requirements and issues that need to be addressed to allow their implementation is currently being finalised and I understand it is to be presented to me in December 2017. Many of the recommendations have already been implemented or are works in progress.   </p>  <p>  My paramount objective for Oberstown is the safety and well-being of the children, the staff working in Oberstown and the people living in the local community. I believe that good progress has been made and the implementation of the recommendations of the 4 review reports will bring about further improvements.</p></reply>

Ireland's school completion rates have improved significantly over the years, but those children who remain at risk of early school leaving often now require intensive, highly customised interventions to support them to stay in school. </p>  <p>  This year Tusla has asked School Completion Programme projects to identify the children most at risk and to provide the range of interventions these children require. In some instances this may reduce the number of children attending the School Completion Programme activities, but it should deliver better outcomes for vulnerable children most in need of the Programme. </p>  <p>  To assist schools and projects with this new focus on high-risk children, a working group of SCP Coordinators and Tusla Educational Welfare staff developed a revised Annual School Retention Plan.  Through this Plan, schools and projects can set out the universal and targeted measures they hope to use to meet the needs of their children.</p>  <p>  The School Completion Programme is a core element of the Educational Welfare Service provided by Tusla and I believe it is a crucial service for  children, parents and schools. I am committed to working with Tusla to see this important programme developed to its optimum. </p></reply>

A number of areas which require improvement were identified. An Action Plan to address these areas was agreed between HIQA and Oberstown and published on the HIQA website. I understand that work in this regard is progressing in line with the timetable   agreed in the Action Plan. </p>  <p>  I very much welcome the comprehensive Action Plan to address those areas identified by HIQA that require improvement, and I will keep the implementation of this Plan under review. </p>  <p>  I think it is important to point out that the HIQA report also identified a number of positive improvements at the Campus since the previous report. These include access by children to advocates; that children knew how to make a complaint and children now have a greater voice over the choice of activities on the campus. </p>  <p>  HIQA raised issues in the most recent Report and in previous reports in relation to single separation and the recording of same. It is my Department&rsquo;s policy that the use of any restrictive practice should only be a measure of last resort and as part of a continuum of planned interventions.  The decision to separate a young person must at all times be a proportionate response to the risk posed by the young person. </p>  <p>  After the publication of my Department&rsquo;s national policy on single separation in January 2017, a review of the Separation Policy for Oberstown took place, and the Oberstown Board of Management approved the revised Single Separation Policy in April 2017. Arising from this review, the separation procedures are also being reviewed and revised in line with the new policy. All staff are receiving refresher training on the revised policy and will receive training on the revised operational procedures also. </p>  <p>  An improved system of record keeping on the use of single separation has been further informed by an audit review that looked  at staff compliance with campus procedures and policies. In order to ensure compliance with procedures senior management must sign off on periods of separation and, following risk assessments, any reviews for an extension. This process has been strengthened by making senior management available to front line staff on a 24/7 basis to sanction the initiation or extension of a period of separation.</p>  <p>  Children who are remanded or sentenced at Oberstown have multiple complex needs and vulnerabilities. Providing an ethos of care for children with such complex needs is essential in the safeguarding of children in detention on the Oberstown Campus. </p></reply>

I am happy to report that progress is being made across all 15 actions of the plan I put in place to address the issues raised in the report commissioned by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into the use of section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991, as amended.  The Strategic Liaison Committee, referred to below, is a high level forum between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla which facilitates liaison on inter-agency matters.  The current status of the recommendations is as follows:</p>  <p>  -  Recommendation 6.3.1 - Cultural change is being addressed by means of regular meetings by senior managers in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla.  The Strategic Liaison Committee, attended by senior representatives of Tusla and the Garda&iacute; meets quarterly.</p>  <p>  -  Recommendations 6.3.3 and 6.3.14 - the assessment of needs and provision of supports for families and children are being addressed through Tusla's roll out of a new single national approach to child protection from November 2017 on.  The "Signs of Safety" approach will help ensure appropriate supports and interventions are in place for families. </p>  <p>  -  Recommendation 6.3.5 - Substance misuse issues as a key indicator of risk: I have written to my colleague, the Minister for Health, bringing the concerns highlighted in the report about alcohol and substance misuse, and about children's mental health issues to his attention.  It is noted that the Signs of Safety approach will continue to include parental use of drugs and alcohol as a core part of child assessment</p>  <p>  -  Recommendation 6.3.6 Data protection: The Strategic Liaison Committee is planning to bring any actions or legislative change to the attention of myself and Minister Flanagan at the start of 2018.  </p>  <p>  -  Recommendation 6.3.7 - Protocols to support the commencement of the Children First Act 2015: A protocol between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla is being finalised in advance of the commencement of the remaining provisions of the Children First Act 2015.  </p>  <p>  -  Recommendation 6.3.13 - Assigning social workers to national specialist Garda child protection units: The Garda National Child Protection Unit has now been established.  A senior staff member from Tusla has been working within the unit on an informal basis for some time and this position can now be formalised.  </p>  <p>  -  Recommendation 6.3.14 - Appropriate assessment of the child's needs, including the child's mental health: My Department has written to the Departments of Health and Education in relation to the medical, educational and emotional needs of children subject to an emergency child protection action. My Department has also written to Tusla and the Strategic Liaison Committee to seek confirmation on the issue of impact and trauma, noting that Tusla's Signs of Safety approach to practice provides an appropriate, proportionate, and timely response to children 'at risk/in need'. </p>  <p>  -  Recommendation 6.3.17.1 - Delegation of Tusla's role under section 12:  Tusla indicates that it was never the case that its role was implemented by a private provider. This is and has been exercised by Tusla.  The private provider was contracted to make sure there were placements available to Tusla in these cases.  </p>  <p>  -  Recommendation 6.3.17.2 - Use of foster placements and applicability of section 36(1)(b) of the Act:  Tusla notes that a child received under section 12 is not in care but is in Tusla's custody.  Tusla provides foster placements under section 15 of the Act that provides for accommodation of children for the purposes of part 3 of the Act (Protection of Children in Emergencies), which includes section 12.  </p>  <p>  -  Recommendation 6.3.17.3 - Applicability of Child Care Act and regulations to foster care providers used to provide accommodation in urgent or emergency cases: Tusla have confirmed that the standards and regulatory obligations applicable to foster care generally are also applicable to foster care placements on an emergency basis - be that private provider or otherwise.  </p>  <p>  -  Recommendation 6.3.17.4 - Standards to be applied for foster placements used under Part 3 Protection of Children in Emergencies of the Child Care Act 1991:  Irrespective of the pathway into Tusla&rsquo;s care, a placement with a private provider is subject to relevant standards.  Private providers are inspected by HIQA under national standards.   </p>  <p>  -  Recommendation 6.3.17.5 - Social work service to be provided out of normal office hours:  Tusla&rsquo;s immediate plan to enhance the out of hours service includes the integration of the three existing out of hours services into one national service.  The Minister has secured funding in Budget 2018 and has asked Tusla to progress this project in early 2018.</p>  <p>  I would note that research into the use of emergency care orders, under section 13 of the Child Care Act, is also progressing with Tusla.    </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the power to enter a premises and remove a child to a place of safety if they have formed the view that there is immediate risk to the child and there is insufficient time to seek an emergency care order through the Courts. </p></reply>

In addition, foster carers can make use of the Tusla, the Child and Family Agency feedback and complaints mechanism, "Tell Us".  All foster carers may also submit a complaint to the Office of the Ombudsman if these mechanisms prove unsatisfactory.</p>  <p>  A complaints system for children in care is part of the National Standards for Foster Care.  Children coming into care are informed of how to make a complaint,  verbally or in writing, and of  their right to do so.  This can be done directly with their social worker, or with the team leader or principal social worker.  Alternatively, children in care can also use Tusla's "Tell us" process or make their complaint known to the Ombudsman for Children.  The child's social worker, foster carers or advocacy groups often act on the child's behalf and provide support in making their views known.  For example, Empowering People in Care (EPIC) is an independent organisation which works with and advocates on behalf of children and young people in care. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Irish Foster Care Association (IFCA) independently advocates on behalf of foster carers, providing support and mediation services as needed in the event of differences that may arise.

Social work duty teams keep high priority cases under review by regularly checking to ascertain risk to the child, and where necessary will reprioritise the case.  </p>  <p>  Tusla holds the statutory responsibility for child welfare and protection, and is the appropriate body to receive reports of concerns relating to children at risk.  Each referral received by the Agency is assessed and dealt with on an individual basis by the relevant social work team.  Every report of concern for the safety and well-being of a child is assessed and required action is identified. Preliminary screening is aimed at establishing the appropriateness of the referral to Tusla services and, if necessary, is followed by an initial assessment of the concern to determine the best course of action for the child and its family.</p>  <p>  A number of key provisions of the Children First Act, 2015, have already commenced. On the 11th December the remaining parts of the Children First Act, 2015, will be commenced with the introduction of mandatory reporting by key professionals, mandated assisting, comprehensive risk assessment and the preparation of Child Safeguarding Statements by services for children. Tusla has developed online training for mandatory reporters. Children First guidelines will continue in parallel with the Act.  This sets out the roles and responsibilities for all citizens to report child welfare and protection issues to Tusla, and where criminal matters are involved, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  I believe that we have made significant progress in our structures and practices for child protection.  The Children First Act, 2015, is of particular significance, but I would see it as part of a suite of child protection legislation that  includes the Acts relating to the National Vetting Bureau and the Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons. </p>  <p>  There is no room for complacency about our safeguarding measures and we will constantly review them to ensure that they are effective.</p>  <p>  Tusla works closely with other care providers, including the Health Service Executive, in respect of access to primary care services, child and adolescent mental health services, disability and other services. Tusla and the HSE monitor their interagency relationship to ensure that they are working effectively in the best interests of children and families.</p></reply>

The 2017/2018 numbers are expected (and on track) to be in line with 2016/2017 uptake. Further, from September 2018, the ECCE Programme will revert to one single entry point in a given ECCE Programme Year (i.e. September) with eligible children entitled to two full years of ECCE provision. From September 2018, the number of ECCE enrolments in any given year will be around 114,000. The fact that 120,000 children were provided with ECCE places in April 2017 suggests that there is sufficient capacity to deal with the lower, be it all year round, number of 114,000.</p>  <p>  As with the previous expansion of the ECCE programme, my Department is working closing with all of the City and County Childcare Committees to monitor a range of scheme related issues, including capacity. In the event that capacity issues emerge, we will seek to address these accordingly.</p>  <p>  Recent media statements on this issue cited the total number of children aged 3-5 in the population and concluded that there was a capacity issue for ECCE. This did not account for the many 4 and 5 year olds already in primary school, nor those who opt for only one year of the ECCE Programme. The conclusion that a capacity issue exists is therefore inaccurate.</p>  <p>  One of the measures I took in 2016, and again in 2017, was to support capital development. My Department provided &euro;8.4million for its 2017 Early Years Capital funding programme and &euro;4m for the 2016 Early Years Capital Funding Programme. The 2017 funding was made available to providers under three strands, the largest of which (&euro;4.2m) went towards enabling services to provide additional childcare places. I will be announcing details of the 2018 Capital scheme in the very near future.</p></reply>

I am aware that some people are trying to find out if and when they were in a particular mother and baby home irrespective of an adoption having taken place. My Department has engaged with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, on this issue and the Agency has the resources to help former residents get access to relevant information.</p>  <p>  The Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 provides for the first time a statutory entitlement to identity information for adopted persons. It provides for a structured and regulated access to information and tracing services for those affected by adoption.  It sets out the information that can be provided  and the circumstances in which it can be provided to adopted persons and provides that services will be provided by Tusla. A key provision in the Bill provides that an adopted person aged 18 years or over who was adopted prior to commencement of the Bill will be provided with the information required to apply for his or her birth certificate, subject to certain conditions.  The Bill also provides for access to relevant records containing the information concerned that are held by the Authority. The Bill passed Second Stage in Seanad Eireann in May 2017 and will proceed to Committee Stage in the Seanad as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This review also resulted in closures at plants in other international locations. </p>  <p>  Prior to Roche confirming its decision to close the plant, IDA Ireland engaged with management at the site and with the parent company in Switzerland on how jobs could be retained. This engagement is continuing and the Agency's officials met with senior management of the company in Switzerland in September. At this meeting, the company outlined its commitment to continue working with the IDA to find a buyer for the site. The Agency has itself been actively promoting the site to existing clients and potential investors and will continue to do so in the time ahead. I am hopeful that a new investor will be identified in due course and that further employment opportunities will in turn be created for the people of Clarecastle and the surrounding area.</p></reply>

My Department obtained advice on the issue of civil fines from the Office of the Attorney General to the effect that civil fines are not provided for in Irish law for anti-competitive practices having regard to Article 38.1 of the Constitution which provides that no person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law. In that context, any national legislation to introduce civil fines that would lower the burden of proof from beyond reasonable doubt to the balance of probability would pose constitutional difficulties having regard to the protection afforded in Article 38.1 of the Constitution. </p>  <p>  On 22 March 2017, the EU Commission published a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council to empower the competition authorities of the Member States to be more effective enforcers and to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market. One of the Directive&rsquo;s aims is to ensure that all National Competition Authorities are able to impose effective deterrent fines. The proposal is currently being debated at the Council Working Group on Competition and is also being considered by the European Parliament. </p>  <p>  I am aware that the Law Reform Commission published an Issues Paper entitled "Regulatory Enforcement and Corporate Offences" on 27 January 2016. The Issues Paper invited views on the supervisory and enforcement powers of the State&rsquo;s main financial and economic regulators (including the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission)(CCPC) and the issue of administrative and civil fines was raised. I understand the CCPC made a submission to the Law Reform Commission on 19 September 2017 in response to the Issues Paper requesting the power to levy such fines.  Any recommendations or proposals that may emanate from this exercise in due course will be carefully considered by my Department.</p></reply>

Increasing and sustaining foreign direct investment (FDI) outside of our main urban areas represents an important part of this wider approach.</p><p>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for 2015-2019 includes a commitment to increase FDI in every region outside Dublin by 30%-40%. The Agency made good progress towards achieving this goal in 2016, with 52% of all jobs created by IDA Ireland's clients last year based outside of Dublin. Mid year results for 2017 provide evidence that further strides are being made, with 54% of all job approvals in the first six months of the year being based outside of Dublin.</p><p>It is important to note that grants paid in a particular year are not necessarily linked to either the investments won or the jobs created in that 12-month period. Grants are generally drawn down over the lifetime of a project which is normally over a period of three to five years. Some investments which result in job creation may not be grant aided and some well established firms may no longer be receiving grant payments. </p><p>In relation to the specific counties mentioned by the Deputy, companies based in all three have received significant grant assistance over the last ten years.

The intention is that the recipients of SARP will assist with the establishment of additional functions for their companies in Ireland and, due to a transfer of skills, these functions will be able to operate without the assistance of SARP after a period.  The existing SARP scheme is limited to existing overseas employees of companies and is not available to new hires. </p>  <p>  As SMEs do not tend to have operations outside Ireland, the deputy's proposal concerning a scheme that is similar to SARP but is targeted at SMEs could result in individuals from abroad being cheaper to hire than Irish residents, thereby resulting in potential displacement of employment for Irish residents in favour of non-resident job-seekers.</p>  <p>  However, the deputy may also be aware that in Budget 2018 I announced the introduction of the new Key Employee Engagement Programme (KEEP) with the objective of supporting SMEs in Ireland in competing with larger enterprises to recruit and retain key employees.  KEEP provides for a more advantageous tax treatment of gains arising on the exercise of qualifying share options acquired in SME companies.  These KEEP share options will provide key employees with a financial incentive linked to the success of the company and may improve the attractiveness of an SME employment offer.  In addition, the KEEP incentive is available both to individuals based in Ireland and those coming to Ireland to avail of employment opportunities here.</p>  <p>  The commencement of the programme is subject to EU State Aid approval, which is expected to issue shortly.</p></reply>

The Act (and the Regulations made under that Act) provide the legal basis for the collection and processing of specified personal and credit information for the purposes of the CCR.

CRIF operates in accordance to the ISO 27001 standard and it is audited on a regular basis.  This certification is an indication that the Information Security Management System put in place in CRIF, is in line with the requirements of this international standard. In terms of information security, the Central Bank has performed a review of CRIF operations against the Bank&rsquo;s Third Party Information Security Framework.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the lender is responsible for personal data in their possession, and while it is in their possession, they are a data controller under the Data Protection Acts.  It is a matter for each lender to satisfy themselves that they are compliant with data protection obligations. In that regard it should also be noted that section 19 of the Credit Reporting Act provides that nothing in that Act limits the operation of the Data Protection Acts.</p></reply>

It is only at this stage that an inheritance tax liability will arise for the other two siblings. </p>  <p>  If the right of residence is not exclusive, then the siblings will have an inheritance tax liability at the date of the original inheritance.  As the inheritance does not allow a full enjoyment of the property, the benefit received can be adjusted to allow for a deduction in respect of the right of residence.  Revenue allows a deduction of 10% of the market value of the benefit in respect of each person who has a right of residence.  The reduced market value is then compared to the relevant group threshold and the tax rate applied on any excess of the market value over the threshold. In the case of siblings the group threshold is currently &euro;32,500. </p>  <p>  In my view the provisions relating to right of residence are fair and equitable and I have no plans to change these provisions at this time. </p>  <p>  In relation to an inability to pay any inheritance tax that may be due, I have been advised by Revenue that a beneficiary of &lsquo;real&rsquo; property, such as land or buildings, is entitled to pay any tax due by instalments over a period of up to five years, subject to interest.  Revenue also has the discretion to allow payment over a longer period of time where the tax cannot be paid without excessive hardship.  In cases of hardship, Revenue also has the discretion to allow payment to be postponed for such period and on such terms (including the waiver of interest) as it thinks fit. </p></reply>

Lenders&rsquo; reviews were required to be conducted in accordance with the Central Bank&rsquo;s framework for completion of the Examination (the &ldquo;Framework&rdquo;) issued in December 2015.  The Framework requires lenders to identify all impacted customers and to address customer detriment in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Principles for Redress.  Steps being taken by lenders to address customer detriment identified during the course of the Examination include putting customers on the correct interest rates (rate rectification) in order to stop the immediate harm caused to them and providing redress and compensation.</p><p>The Central Bank has provided a number of update reports on the progress of the examination, the most recent of which was last October.  While the Central Bank is not in a position, due to confidentiality requirements under Central Bank legislation, to comment on the position of individual regulated entities, it has put aggregated information into the public domain in relation to the Tracker Examination.  The latest Central Bank update report indicates that lenders had identified approximately 13,000 impacted accounts as at end September (though it should be noted this figure will increase as the Examination continues to progress) and that &euro;120 million had been provide to impacted customers (in respect of approximately 3,300 accounts) pursuant to the Examination.  This is additional to the 7,100 accounts (and the &euro;43 million redress and compensation paid) identified prior to the industry wide examination.  Individually lenders report and make provision for the costs they incur, or expect to incur, in respect of tracker mortgage failings to their customers.</p><p>The Central Bank&rsquo;s enforcement work continues in parallel to the Examination.  One enforcement investigation has already concluded in relation to Springboard Mortgages </p><p><i>).  </i>Other investigations are at varying stages of completion and the Governor of the Central Bank has stated that he<b></b>expects that all the main banks will be subject to Central Bank enforcement investigations.  The Central Bank is prepared to carry out multiple enforcement investigations and the investigations are detailed and forensic.  As part of ongoing enforcement investigations, interviews with relevant individuals have been and will be conducted, and large volumes of documentation have been and will continue to be gathered and reviewed.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-28a.211.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112800061#WRD04700"><p>I am advised by Revenue that there are a number of provisions in the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 and the Capital Acquisitions Consolidation Act 2003 that provide for tax relief in respect of philanthropy. </p><p>Section 848A and Schedule 26A of the TCA provide for a scheme of tax relief for donations to approved bodies, including eligible charities.  As the Deputy may be aware, changes were made to that scheme in Finance Act 2013.  Individual donors no longer benefit from the tax relief associated with their donations; the relief is repaid direct to the charity.  A blended rate of relief of 31% applies to all tax-payers regardless of their marginal tax rate.  Donations are &ldquo;re-grossed&rdquo; i.e. the sum donated is treated as a net amount after deduction of tax and the gross sum that would give rise to that net amount is calculated.  Relief in the amount of the imputed tax payable on the gross sum is repaid to the charity.  There is an annual donation limit of &euro;1 million per individual for which a refund of income tax can be claimed by approved bodies.</p><p>Section 847A of the TCA provides tax relief for relevant donations to approved sports bodies<b></b>for the funding of approved projects.  An approved sports body means a body established for the sole purpose of promoting athletic or amateur games or sports and whose income is exempt from tax where it is applied solely for those purposes.  An approved project is a project as specified in the section which has been approved by the relevant Minister.  Under this scheme a self&ndash;assessed individual<b></b>is entitled to claim a deduction in respect of a donation made to an approved sports body in calculating his or her total income.  Where a PAYE-only taxpayer makes a relevant donation to an approved sports body, the body is deemed to have received the payment net of income tax and is entitled to claim a refund of the income tax deducted after the donation has been re-grossed at the donor&rsquo;s marginal rate. </p><p>When a company makes a qualifying donation to an approved body, including an eligible charity or an approved sports body, it can claim a deduction for the donation as if it were a trading expense or an expense of management for the accounting period in which it is paid.</p><p>I am further advised by Revenue that there is provision in section 1003 of the TCA 1997 for the payment of tax by the donation of heritage items to Irish national collection.  A credit equal to 80% of the market value of the item donated can be set against taxpayers&rsquo; liabilities for certain taxes.</p><p>The heritage item(s) must be an outstanding example of the type of item involved, pre-eminent in its class, whose export from the State would constitute a diminution of Ireland&rsquo;s accumulated cultural heritage or whose import into the State would constitute a significant enhancement of the accumulated cultural heritage of Ireland and must be suitable for acquisition by the Approved Bodies which include the National Archives, National Gallery, National Library and National Museum.  The determination as to whether an item is a suitable heritage item under the scheme is carried out by a selection committee of experts, and is subject to valuation limits.</p><p>Section 1003A of the TCA provides that tax relief is available in respect of the donation of heritage property to the Irish Heritage Trust or the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, subject to provisions that the property is a suitable heritage property, for example that it is of significant historical or scientific value.  The scheme takes the form of a non-refundable payment on account of tax of an amount equal to 50 per cent of the market value of the heritage property donated and can be credited against particular tax liabilities incurred by the donor.  There is a ceiling of &euro;6 million on the aggregate value of heritage properties that may be approved for donation in any one year.</p><p>Section 611 of the TCA provides that where an asset is disposed of for no consideration to the State to a charity or to other specified bodies such as the National Archives, the National Gallery, the National Library or the National Museum, the disposal is treated as not giving rise to either a gain or a loss for capital gains tax purposes. </p><p>Section 76 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 provides that where a gift or an inheritance is taken for public or charitable purposes the beneficiary is exempt from both gift tax and inheritance tax and the gift or inheritance is not taken into account when computing tax to the extent that Revenue is satisfied that it has been, or will be, applied for purposes which in accordance with the laws of the State are public or charitable. </p></reply>

However, there was no break in employment within the Group or service for the purposes of the individual&rsquo;s pension rights.  Even though the person was employed by a number of companies in the Group the principal employer for the purpose of the pension scheme remained the same. </p><p>The person concerned has since 2016 resumed employment with a company within the Group.  However the principal employer for the purpose of this pension plan is the same as the one he was previously a member of.  Essentially, this means that the individual has become a member of a pension scheme sponsored by his current employer, having previously been a member of another pension scheme also sponsored by the same employer company.</p><p>There is no provision in pension tax legislation to allow what is called a &ldquo;split transfer&rdquo; in these circumstances.  In other words, it is not permitted for an individual to transfer part of his pension fund to an entirely separate pension arrangement, such as a Personal Retirement Bond. </p></reply>

Provision 4.12 of the Code requires regulated entities to draw up its terms of business and provide each consumer with a copy prior to providing the first service to that consumer.  In this document, the regulated entity must set out the basis on which it will conduct business with consumers.  Provision 6.1 of the Code provides that where a regulated entity makes a material change to its terms of business, it must provide each affected consumer with a revised terms of business as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  That said, I can appreciate that a consumer will be aggrieved to find that a new product becomes available after they have taken a less favourable one.  However there must be a cut-off point between the availability of products and it is inevitable that some people will fall on what they consider to be the wrong side of that line.  The Deputy will be aware of the availability of the Financial Services Ombudsman in the case of unresolved complaints against a regulated financial service provider and the fact that the Ombudsman is independent in the performance of his duties. </p></reply>

It allows for losses incurred in the course of business to be accounted for when calculating a business&rsquo; tax liabilities.  This mechanism is a standard feature of Corporation Tax systems in all OECD countries.  </p>  <p>  There would be a material negative impact on the valuation of the States investments from any change in tax treatment of accumulated losses where the banks are concerned.  It is critically important to understand that the State is actually getting value today from these deferred tax assets through our share sales. </p>  <p>  In the case of the AIB, the bank&rsquo;s deferred tax asset of &euro;2.8 billion is in the shareholder&rsquo;s funds or book value of the bank.  Earlier this year we sold 29% of the bank in the recent IPO at a valuation of close to one times the book value yielding proceeds of approximately &euro;3.4 billion.</p>  <p>  In fact our remaining 71% investment is currently valued at more than one times the bank&rsquo;s book value so based on the current tax treatment we should continue to get hundreds of millions in proceeds linked to the deferred tax asset as we sell down our shares.</p>  <p>  Despite the scale of losses accumulated the banks are contributing to the Exchequer through the financial institutions levy.  To recognise the part that the banks played in the financial crisis, in 2013, the Government decided that the banking sector should make an annual contribution of approximately &euro;150 million to the Exchequer for the period from 2014 to 2016.  In Budget 2017, the payment of this levy was extended until 2021.  It was anticipated that the bank levy could be expected to raise &euro;750 million over five years.</p></reply>

Local Authorities may carry out works to address such problems using their own resources or, if necessary, may apply for funding under the Office of Public Works (OPW) Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme. </p>  <p>  I am advised that a revised application was submitted by Wicklow County Council (WCC) in April 2017 for funding under the Minor Works Scheme to undertake a project at North Beach, Arklow. </p>  <p>  In August 2017, the OPW replied to WCC on its application and advised the Council that the application could not be approved because the works proposed related to maintenance works on an existing structure which works are not eligible for funding and because the proposal did not meet the cost benefit criteria of the scheme.  The Council was also advised that, given the scale and complexity of the problem, it may be more appropriate for them to seek funding for a detailed coastal erosion and flood risk management study to better understand the coastal processes involved in the wider region and to inform any further applications for funding for works.</p>  <p>  An application for funding for such study has not been received to date.</p>  <p>  The OPW will continue to work constructively with WCC on this matter and to provide advice and assistance to the Council as required in relation to the advancement of the study.</p></reply>

From 1 November 2013 pre and post-2011 pay scales were merged into a single consolidated scale applicable to each grade. Generally, the third point of 1 November 2013 payscale is equivalent to the first point of the pre 2011 scale. </p><p>Guidelines in relation to the merging of the scales are available on my Departments website <i>www.per.gov.ie/en/haddington-road-agreement/</i>.</p><p>It should be noted that under the new Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 which has recently been ratified by the Public Services Committee of the ICTU, pay increases range from 7.4 per cent to 6.2 per cent over three years, are progressive and will therefore favour new entrants.</p><p>The PSSA also recognises the issues of concern in relation to the salaries of new entrants and commits all parties to an examination of these matters within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement. The first, exploratory meeting, with the full complement of Trade Unions and staff associations, took place on the 12<sup>th</sup>of October. This meeting, based on the contributions of all parties, agreed an outline process of oversight and data gathering. This process will be overseen by the Oversight Body for the PSSA. Further engagement will be undertaken over the coming months with those parties that have signed up to the Agreement.</p></reply>

This is known as Risk Assessment. The aim of Risk Assessment is to reduce the risk of injury and illness associated with work. The Risk Assessment(s) will form part of the employer's Safety Statement.</p><p>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007 set out the First-Aid requirements for workplaces as follows: &quot;Employers have a duty to provide first-aid equipment at all places at work where working conditions require it. Depending on the size or specific hazard (or both) of the place of work, trained occupational first-aiders must also be provided. Apart from some exceptions, first-aid rooms must be provided where appropriate. Information must also be provided to employees as regards the first-aid facilities and arrangements in place.&quot;</p><p>It is important that the school management authority requests parents to ensure that the school is made aware of any medical condition suffered by any student attending. Where the school is aware of potential difficulties that may arise as a consequence of a medical condition suffered by one or more students, it may be possible for the management authorities, working in conjunction with parents, teachers and children to put preventative measures in place to lessen the possibility of any difficulties arising or to ensure that, if a student suffers from an illness requiring, for example, the administration of medication, that appropriate treatment is available.</p><p>Where a child requires adult assistance to assist in the administration of medicine and where the extent of assistance required would overly disrupt normal teaching time, SNA support may be allocated for this purpose.</p><p>It is a matter for the Board of Management to ensure that SNAs are in a position to effectively meet the care needs of stedents for whom SNA support has been allocated in the school when appointing an SNA. </p><p>Where specific training is required, the Board of Management should liaise with the Health Service Executive (HSE) in order to ensure that the HSE provides guidance and training that enables the SNA to meet the care needs of the pupil in an appropriate manner. It is a matter for individual school authorities to make such arrangements locally. </p><p>It is my Department's experience that once the matter has been discussed in detail with the Board of Management and staff of a school, and once all parties are clear as to the procedures to be followed, arrangements can normally be made to assist the administration of first aid or medicine.</p><p>The NCSE are currently undertaking a Comprehensive Review of the SNA Scheme. In response to a progress report from the NCSE on the comprehensive assessment, the NCSE were requested to establish a working group, comprising relevant stakeholders, to assist in proposing a better model for providing care supports so as to provide better outcomes for students with special educational needs who have additional care needs. </p><p>This Working Group, which is chaired by Mr. Eamon Stack, Chairperson of the NCSE Council, has commenced its work and the work will run in tandem with the completion of the overall Comprehensive Review of the SNA Scheme. It is intended that the reports of the Working Group and of the Review will be completed in Spring 2018. </p><p>In tandem with this, a cross Departmental Working Group has been established to develop proposals in relation to the need for nursing supports in schools for children with complex medical needs. This Cross Departmental Working Group has to date held a number of meetings. </p><p>In the meantime, until any changes are agreed, the responsibility for funding Nurses, irrespective of where they are located, is the responsibility of the HSE and they also remain responsible for the clinical and professional governance of the nursing profession in Ireland. </p><p>In relation to insurance, the position is that the nature and terms of an individual school&rsquo;s insurance arrangements are a matter between the individual school and its insurers.</p></reply>

These rules apply to all students from all EU/EEA/Swiss states. Students undertaking a second undergraduate qualification are not entitled to support under the scheme</p><p>Where students do not qualify for free fees funding they must pay the appropriate fee - either EU or Non-EU, as determined by each higher education institution.  These institutions are autonomous bodies and the level of fee payable by students who do not meet the requirements of the free fees scheme is a matter for the relevant institution to determine. </p><p>Due to concerns in relation to the fact that in some cases the higher Non EU fee was being charged to students who hold EU/EEA/Swiss nationality but did not meet the residency clause for free fees, my Department requested that the higher education institutions charge the more moderate EU fees to such students who have completed at least five academic years of study (primary or post-primary level) in Ireland/EU/EEA/Switzerland and commence their first undergraduate course of study in an approved institution here.  This position took effect from the academic year, 2014/15. In this way, such students, while still not eligible for tuition fees funding under the Free Fees Initiative, could avail of the more moderate EU rate of tuition fees. </p><p>Tax relief is available on these fees and students can apply to the Student Assistance Fund for financial support if needed.</p><p>As the terms of the scheme are for general application, exceptions cannot be made in individual cases.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-28a.349.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112800063#WRF04600"><p>It is the policy of my Department that all children with Special Educational Needs, including those with Autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. </p>  <p>  Such placements facilitate access to individualised education programmes which may draw from a range of appropriate educational interventions, delivered by fully qualified professional teachers, with the support of Special Needs Assistants and the appropriate school curriculum. </p>  <p>  This policy has been informed by published research, including the Report of the Task Force on Autism (2001), the Evaluation of Educational Provision for Children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD) (2006) and National Council for Special Education (NCSE) policy advice on Supporting Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (2016). </p>  <p>  The NCSE policy advice on Supporting Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (2016) found that Students are generally well supported in schools with appropriate curriculum; extensive teacher and SNA supports; improving range of educational placements supported by improved accommodation and equipment; improved teacher knowledge and understanding and a generally good standard of provision at primary and post primary levels.</p>  <p>  The NCSE policy advice noted that ASD is a spectrum condition, so some students with ASD require little support in school and are relatively independent in their learning, while others require significant levels of support. </p>  <p>  The NCSE Policy Advice also states that International Research findings suggest that most students with ASD should be considered for inclusion in mainstream education with their peers, where inclusion is well-planned and well-resourced.</p>  <p>  Decisions about placement should be based on individual needs and take into account a number of factors including parental wishes, availability of evidence-based treatments and well-trained staff and individual factors such as targets for intervention and management of behaviours.</p>  <p>  There is therefore not one preferred educational environment for children with ASD, rather there is a model which takes into account the assessed educational needs of individual pupils.</p>  <p>  As such, my Department&rsquo;s policy focuses on ensuring that all students, including those with autism spectrum disorders, can have access to an education appropriate to meeting their needs and abilities.</p>  <p>  Some students, although academically able to access the curriculum in mainstream, may find it too difficult to manage full-time placement there. This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream.</p>  <p>  Enrolment in an ASD special class should only be considered where it has been demonstrated that a student requires the support of a special class because he/she is unable to learn effectively in a mainstream class for most or all of the school day even with appropriate supports. </p>  <p>  Students enrolling in ASD Special Classes must have a report from a relevant professional or team of professionals (for example, psychologist, speech and language therapist, psychiatrist) stating that: </p>  <p>  - S/he has ASD </p>  <p>  - S/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a special class setting and the reasons why this is the case.</p>  <p>  The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.</p>  <p>  Since 2013/14 the NCSE has increased the number of post primary ASD special classes by over 100% from 124 in 2013/14 to 276 for the 2017/18 school year.</p>  <p>  The continued growth in post primary special class numbers is a natural consequence of the earlier growth in primary special class numbers.  However, it should not be assumed that the same levels of growth in post primary class numbers should apply.  This is because, for children with Autism, transferring from a special class in a primary school to a special class in a post primary school may not always be the optimal choice. Many children can progress to mainstream post primary with support of SNA and Resource Teaching hours, while more may transfer from primary to a special school depending on their presentation and needs.</p>  <p>  With regard to Carrigaline, there are 4 Post Primary ASD Special Classes, including 1 newly established class.  The NCSE continues to review Post Primary special class placement requirements in the area and have informed my Department that they are currently satisfied that there are sufficient places to meet existing demand. </p>  <p>  In order to identify need in the area for forthcoming school years, the NCSE refer to professional reports indicating students require the support of a special class. In this regard Parents/Guardians of students with ASD seeking a special class placement should provide the relevant professional report to their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) to inform the planning process. </p>  <p>  The NCSE will continue to engage with schools in the area in opening ASD special classes in future years as required.</p></reply>

My Department uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise.  The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.</p>  <p>  The demographic data for school planning areas nationwide is being reviewed by my Department to take account of updated child benefit data and updated enrolment data.  It is anticipated that these exercises will be concluded shortly. </p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  Once it has been established that a new school, primary or post-primary, is required to meet the demographic need in a school planning area, a separate process is conducted to establish who will run the school.  It is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons, to apply for patronage of a new school under the patronage process.  Parental preferences for each patron, together with the extent of diversity currently available in the area, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.  The process is fair, transparent and open to all patrons, patron bodies and prospective patrons to apply for patronage of any planned new school under this process.</p></reply>

My Department uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise.  The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.  It is anticipated that these exercises will be concluded shortly.</p>  <p>  A range of areas nationwide are experiencing increased demographic pressure and will be kept under review by my Department.  Galway City is one of these areas.  This review takes account of updated enrolment and child benefit data and also the impact of existing and planned capacity increases to existing schools in the area.  Notwithstanding that the Galway City area, including environs, is an area defined as a demographic growth area, it is also an area where certain schools are experiencing a decline in pupil numbers. </p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  With regard to demand for particular models of school provision, it should be noted that the patronage process for new schools is a separate process.  This process is run after it has been decided that a new school is required.  Parental preferences are central to this process and prospective patrons are required to provide evidence of demand for their particular school model and medium of instruction.  These expressions of interest are required to be from parents of primary school children eligible for enrolment in the first five years of the establishment of a proposed new post-primary school.  The process is fair, transparent and open to all patrons, patron bodies and prospective patrons to apply for patronage of any planned new school under this process.</p></reply>

All post-primary schools and some special schools are now included in the 100Mbps programme.</p>  <p>  Significant improvement has been made in recent years with the number of primary schools on broadband speeds of greater than 30mbs having increased from less than 100 in 2012 to over 1000 by the end of 2017.  In Wicklow in 2012, no primary school had access to broadband speeds of 30mbs or greater, now some 30 primary schools in Wicklow have access to broadband speeds of 30mbs or greater.</p>  <p>  Under the current programme the Department continually reviews the availability of services and upgrades schools where the opportunity arises, in line with contractual and budgetary requirements.  A recent drawdown from the Framework of Providers of Broadband Services saw some 1,100 primary schools awarded download speeds of 30Mbps or greater (the baseline download speed required under the National Broadband Plan).  Some 900 of those schools have now been connected with the balance to be in place by the end of 2017.</p>  <p>  The policy of this Department is to offer the best quality connectivity to all schools in line with the technical solutions available in the market and financial constraints.  Broadband capacity can vary due to geographical location and local infrastructure, and thus impact on the service that can be provided. </p>  <p>  The need to improve broadband connectivity to primary schools is recognised in the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020, and as noted access to high speed broadband is one of the indicators identified in the Digital Strategy Action Plan.

Some 2,300 new teachers were recruited in 2016-2017 and 2,900 are being recruited in 2017-2018.  The figure of 2,900 is 21% more than the number announced in budget 2017, so we have in fact been able to recruit more new teachers than we have announced.  All of the 2016-2017 posts have been successfully filled and the process for filling the additional posts in the current year is almost complete.  We are successfully filling the posts that we are making available.</p>  <p>  However, I am aware that some schools have reported difficulties in recruiting substitute teachers at primary level and in certain subjects at post primary level, and I am committed to examining all possible means of addressing these issues.</p>  <p>  Regarding issues around finding substitution at primary level, there are strong career opportunities in teaching and the number of permanent full-time positions are currently increasing at over 1,000 per year in 2016/2017 and 2017/2018.  Due to the additional permanent positions being created, young teachers have greater opportunities to take on permanent positions, and as a result some schools may be experiencing issues in hiring teachers to fill temporary or substitute roles, which arise in schools for a number of reasons, including covering sick leave and career breaks.</p>  <p>  At post primary level I have taken certain initiatives to address some of the supply pressures in particular subject areas.  These include, as part of the implementation of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education, increasing from 2018/19 the number of places available on the existing Irish medium post primary initial teacher education programme in NUIG, to which I have granted two additional posts from September 2017.  This measure will strengthen the Irish-language proficiency of newly qualified teachers across a range of subjects and, it is anticipated, also increase the supply of Irish language teachers.  I have also increased from 85 to 101 the number of students admitted to St Angela&rsquo;s, Sligo to follow the Home Economics ITE programme in the current year, with further expansions in future years being considered.</p>  <p>  I have also undertaken measures to increase the pool of teachers available to schools in particular to fill short term vacancies.  My Department informed all teachers retiring in 2017 that in order to remain eligible for employment in a state funded teaching post for a period of more than five consecutive days or to supervise the State examinations, a teacher must maintain his/her registration with the Teaching Council.  My Department also increased the limits for employment while on career break at primary level to a maximum of 90 days in a school year.  In addition, as a longer term measure, under my Department&rsquo;s Gaeltacht Policy, an RFT is currently being developed for a new Irish-medium B.Ed. (primary teaching) ITE programme.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the report of the Technical Working Group on teacher supply, &lsquo;Striking the Balance&rsquo; which, while focussing on the development of a model of primary teacher supply, outlined the work which will be required to establish a long term model of post-primary teacher supply.  The Deputy will appreciate that there are difficulties in developing a reliable model of teacher supply, particularly at second level, and this was recognised in the work of the Teaching Council as teaching is competing with many other sectors for graduates in areas like Maths, Science, and Irish.  The Teaching Council, which has an advisory role in this matter, recently convened a consultative forum on teacher supply with relevant stakeholders with the aim of producing teacher supply proposals and I look forward to seeing the report from this forum which will further inform our thinking in this matter. </p>  <p>  I am currently reviewing with my Department other potential initiatives on teacher supply.  In that context my Department has engaged with the HEA with a view to obtaining baseline data to support future policy decisions in this area.  My Department also intends engaging with other stakeholders, including school management bodies, in this matter.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. </p>  <p>  The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location.</p>  <p>  The Staffing Schedule includes the provision where schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds.  The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board.  This process includes a provision in which schools that are not gaining an additional teaching post under the developing schools criterion can submit an appeal to the independent Appeals Board.  This appeal criterion is targeted at those schools that make a significant contribution to the provision of school places and so assist the response to demographic growth within their area. </p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy submitted an application for consideration by the Appeals Board at its October meeting under the criteria of alleviating some of the pressure on class sizes at infants level.  The appeal was refused by the Appeals Board on the basis that the grounds of the appeal did not warrant the allocation of an additional post for the 2017/18 school year.  The school has been notified of the outcome of the appeal. </p>  <p>  The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final. </p>  <p>  Budget 2018 provides for an additional 1280 teaching posts in the 2018/19 school year.  This includes a one point improvement in the staffing schedule in primary schools which brings the position to the most favourable ever seen at primary level.</p>  <p>  These changes will come into effect in September 2018 for the 2018/19 school year. </p>  <p>  The detailed staffing arrangements including appeal process for 2018/19 will be set out in the staffing schedule Circular for the 2018/19 school year.

Since then, significant improvements have taken place in the road and rail network and it is considered that the revised distance criteria is more consistent with the type of distances that students may legitimately be expected to commute to college.</p>  <p>  The current qualifying distance of 45km for the higher non-adjacent rate of student grant takes into account a reasonable radius within which students may commute on a daily basis.  There were no proposals to amend the distance criterion in Budget 2018. </p>  <p>  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund.  This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances.  Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended.  This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p></reply>

Schools will be given the option to decide if they wish to implement the specification, the Framework or both.  Schools will be provided with information in the December call in order to allow them make an informed decision.  It is proposed from September 2020 that Leaving Certificate PE will be optional in all schools. </p>  <p>  The Department and its agencies will continue with the development and implementation of a programme of CPD, supporting teachers in Phase 1 schools to ensure that they are in a position to implement the specification and the Framework from September 2018. </p>  <p>  The timetabling of Leaving Certificate Physical Education (LCPE) and Senior Cycle Physical Education (SCPE) will be a matter for the school to decide.  LCPE is designed to be taught in a minimum of 180 hours in total over the two years of fifth and sixth year.  The SCPE Framework is designed to be taught over the two or three years of senior cycle education.  It is recommended that a double period per week (approximately 80 minutes) is made available as the minimum requirement for teaching Senior Cycle Physical Education.</p></reply>

Human rights protections form a vital part of the institutional underpinning for the peace settlement founded on the Good Friday Agreement and serve to build and maintain confidence for communities across Northern Ireland. The protection of human rights in Northern Ireland - including through the incorporation into law of the European Convention on Human Rights - is one of the key principles of the Agreement, as set out in the chapter on Rights, Safeguards and Equality of Opportunity.  It is important to be clear that the European Convention on Human Rights is separate and distinct to the European Union. The UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU has no impact on its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  Even after the UK leaves the EU, there remains a continuing obligation on the British Government to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into Northern Ireland law, as provided for in the Good Friday Agreement.  In this regard, it is welcome that the UK Government&rsquo;s White Paper on legislating for withdrawal from the EU that was published in March clarified that it has no plans to leave the European Convention on Human Rights.</p><p>In February, as part of the All-Island Civic Dialogue on Brexit, the Government convened a Sectoral Dialogue on Human Rights under the Good Friday Agreement to hear the views of civil society, North and South, on the possible implications of Brexit for this pivotal chapter of the Agreement. This was a very valuable exchange and a number of key themes emerged, which have been communicated publicly, which are informing the Government&rsquo;s approach in this area, including as set out in the comprehensive document, <i>Ireland and the negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union</i>, published by the Government on 2 May.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s programme of engagement with EU partners has ensured that Ireland&rsquo;s unique issues and concerns have been fully understood by the EU27 and have been reflected in the EU&rsquo;s negotiating position for the Article 50 negotiations with the UK.  In this regard, the Guiding Principles for the dialogue on Ireland/Northern Ireland, which were published by the European Commission Article 50 Task Force in September, confirm that European Union law and practice has provided a supporting framework in Northern Ireland and across the island for the Good Friday Agreement provisions on Rights, Safeguards and Equality of Opportunity. They state that the Good Friday Agreement requires equivalent standards of protection of rights in Ireland and Northern Ireland and that the United Kingdom should ensure that no diminution of rights is caused by the United Kingdom&rsquo;s departure from the European Union, including in the area of protection against forms of discrimination currently enshrined in Union law. This position has been conveyed by the European Commission Task Force to the UK in the Article 50 negotiations in the High Level Dialogue on Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p><p>As co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government takes very seriously our responsibility to safeguard its institutions and principles, including in the area of human rights. The Government will continue to pursue, with our EU partners, an outcome to the Article 50 process that protects our headline priorities and Ireland&rsquo;s fundamental interests, including to ensure protection of and respect for the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.</p></reply>

It is also a very practical outworking of the peace process which allows for the normalisation of relationships between people across the island, to our mutual benefit. North South cooperation between Ireland and Northern Ireland is one of the central elements of the Good Friday Agreement. The EU Taskforce&rsquo;s Guiding Principles for the Dialogue on Ireland/Northern Ireland indicated that it is &ldquo;necessary for the European Union and the United Kingdom to examine whether, and if so how, the fact that European Union law ceases to apply in the United Kingdom after withdrawal might impact on continued cooperation and whether specific provisions need to be inserted in the Withdrawal Agreement&rdquo;.   Officials have been carrying out detailed work over the last few weeks to map out areas of cooperation that operate on a North South basis on the island of Ireland and which rely on EU law and policies. Over the course of this exercise, an extensive range of North South cooperation was identified, covering areas under the formal North South Ministerial Council work programmes and other areas of cooperation that have developed since the Peace Process.</p>  <p>  There is still more work to be done in this area, but the exercise has underlined the need to avoid risks presented by any regulatory divergence from the rules of the EU Single Market and Customs Union. North South cooperation has made an important contribution through the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement to the improvement of people's lives on this island. We want to ensure that this cooperation can continue in a meaningful way.</p>  <p>  The UK has a responsibility to ensure that it does not hinder or impede the continuation and development of North South cooperation by its withdrawal from the EU.  Avoiding a hard border is only one element of this.</p></reply>

Attacks on civilians in Syria, such as the bombing of this convoy of evacuees, further underline the need for full accountability for these appalling acts. Those responsible for such crimes must be held accountable. In relation to the allegation of kidnapping raised by the Deputy, it is extremely difficult to get reliable and verified information on the situation and reliable evidence is essential for follow up and accountability. I am not aware of any indication that the 54 children who are still missing are being held in Turkey, and I would be happy to pursue the matter further, if the Deputy will furnish more detail.    Conflict and war have a particularly horrific impact on vulnerable groups such as children, and Ireland is committed to working to ensure that their needs are taken into account in humanitarian response in a meaningful way. Ireland will continue to prioritise the protection of civilians, and particularly the most vulnerable of these, including children, in our response to the Syria crisis.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, I call on anyone who may have any knowledge about the whereabouts of the missing children, however insignificant it may seem, to make that information known in order to alleviate the suffering of children separated from their families.</p></reply>

Ireland, along with 7 other Member States presented bids to host the EBA on its relocation from the UK, in the context of Brexit.  After three rounds round of voting, Dublin and Paris were tied with 13 votes each. The selection of Paris was made by the drawing of lots, in line with the procedure set out in advance of the vote.   The Irish Government made a very strong offer for the EBA to be located in Dublin. I wish to acknowledge the work carried out across government departments and agencies on our bid, which was well-received around Europe and viewed as strong and very competitive. It was a very considerable achievement to have won through 3 rounds of voting, successfully out performing very strong bids from a number of other key EU cities and capitals.</p>  <p>  Minister Harris, the Department of Health and relevant agencies also put together a very comprehensive offer which was recognised around Europe as a very compelling case that Dublin could host the European Medicines Agency (EMA).</p>  <p>  The competitive and political nature of the selection process necessitated a whole-of-Government effort to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s case was put forward strongly and convincingly to Member State Governments and to elicit support in the voting process.</p>  <p>  That is why we made a strategic decision some weeks ago to focus our efforts on gaining support for our EBA bid. By focusing on just one offer, we were able to be clear in our goal and it allowed us to engage in a more definitive manner in seeking the support of our partners in the EU.</p>  <p>  I would like to congratulate Paris on being chosen as the new seat of the EBA. It is important that there is a smooth transition and successful relocation for the Authority, its staff and their families.</p>  <p>  The EBA plays a vital role in the European system of Financial Supervision and it is essential that its work, which helps to protect consumers and contributes to the Union&rsquo;s financial stability, continues during the transition. The Central Bank of Ireland is an active member of the EBA and will continue to work with the Authority to achieve high quality prudential regulation and supervision across the banking sector.</p></reply>

I also routinely meet the Foreign Secretary at meetings of Foreign Ministers in an EU context and internationally.</p>  <p>  Although the Foreign Secretary does not have lead responsibility for Brexit, the meeting provided a timely opportunity to exchange views on the ongoing Brexit negotiations.  On Brexit, I underlined the need to ensure sufficient progress is made on all three exit issues in Phase 1 before discussions on a future relationship and any transitional arrangements can commence. I emphasised our desire for progress on Irish specific issues and on the need for the UK to provide strong political assurances and tangible commitments that recognise the unique circumstances of the island of Ireland. Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to protecting the Good Friday Agreement, in all its parts, and the gains of the peace process remains clear. In this regard, I repeated the Government&rsquo;s position that flexible and imaginative solutions are required.</p>  <p>  I also reiterated that Ireland is fully behind Michel Barnier and his team and that any decision on sufficient progress will be made together by the EU 27 Heads of State and Government.</p>  <p>  Ideas on a number of areas of mutual foreign policy interest, including the Middle East and Africa, were also shared. In addition, discussions focused on the strong British-Irish bilateral relationship and how this relationship can be strengthened into the future.</p>  <p>  Ireland and the UK share many areas of mutual interest and concern and we will continue to work together on areas of commonality.</p></reply>

For applications made in person at the Dublin or Cork Passport Offices, card payments may be taken only where both the card and the card-holder are present, with payments taken through secure chip &amp;amp; PIN terminals. Other means of payment such as cash, postal orders or bank drafts are also accepted.</p>  <p>  Passport Express is currently the most popular channel through which the Passport Office receives application.  Payments for such applications are made directly through An Post at the time of submission.  In that case, as any card payments are made by applicants in person at the Post Office, manual inputting of details by the Passport Office does not arise.</p>  <p>  The online passport renewal service, which was launched in March of this year, takes secure payment by card online.</p>  <p>  With the exception of a small number of overseas missions, where current practice is under active review, the Passport Office no longer accepts credit card details written on passport application forms for payment.</p></reply>

In the Presidential ballot, the candidate of the &lsquo;Chile Vamos&rsquo; coalition, former President Sebastian Pi&ntilde;era, won 36.6% of the vote, with the candidate of the Nueva Mayor&iacute;a coalition, Alejandro Guillier, in second position with 22.7%.</p>  <p>  Under Chilean electoral law, a second round election between the two candidates who secured the highest number of votes will now take place on 17 December.  In the congressional elections on 19 November, which were the first to take place under new arrangements which ended the former binomial electoral system, there were significant changes in representation in both the Senate and Congress, both of which have an enlarged number of seats.</p>  <p>  As a result, whoever wins the second round of the Presidential elections may not command a congressional majority.  It is noteworthy that female representation in the new Congress will increase from 16% to 23%.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to have this opportunity to recall that Ireland enjoys excellent and warm bilateral relations with Chile. We look forward to developing that relationship in the months and years ahead, including through the opening of a resident embassy in Santiago, which I announced last month. </p></reply>

Gubernatorial elections took place on 15 October amidst numerous reported incidences of irregularity and the results were not recognised by a large part of the opposition. This has accentuated the political polarisation in the country. The EU has called for full transparency on the results of the elections through a comprehensive and independent audit and Ireland has been wholly supportive of that position.</p>  <p>  The establishment of an all-powerful Constituent Assembly has further eroded the democratic and independent institutions. Ireland and its EU partners have said that we cannot recognise the Constituent Assembly or its acts because of serious concerns about its legitimacy and representativeness.</p>  <p>  On 13 November last, at a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers, which I attended, it was agreed unanimously to adopt restrictive measures, underscoring our concerns at the situation in the country. These measures consist of an embargo on arms and on related material that might be used for internal repression, as well as a legal framework for a travel ban and assets freeze.</p>  <p>  Ireland has supported calls on the Venezuelan Government to urgently restore democratic legitimacy, including through free and fair elections, and on the opposition to continue engaging in a united manner towards a negotiated solution to the current tensions, in the interest of the country. Ireland is also fully supportive of regional and international efforts to find a lasting solution to the crisis.</p></reply>

The introduction and settlement of communities of the occupying power, to alter the demography of the area, is unambiguously illegal under international law. The process of establishing settlements also inevitably involves violations of the rights of the occupied population, through seizure of their land, discriminatory treatment and other restrictions.</p>  <p>  The Government has consistently and repeatedly conveyed these concerns to the Israeli authorities, and highlighted them in our interventions at EU, UN and international level. In addition, I have raised these concerns directly with Israeli leaders during my visit to Israel and Palestine in July. Most recently, I issued a public statement on 20 October condemning the latest settlement plans.</p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland has consistently argued at EU level in favour of a clear differentiation by the EU and the international community between the State of Israel, on the one hand, and the illegal settlements on Palestinian land, on the other. This policy was explicitly supported by the UN Security Council in Resolution 2334 in December 2016. The EU has already taken a number of actions in this regard. These include guidelines on labelling of goods from settlements, advice to businesses on the risks of investing in settlements, and forbidding the spending of EU research funding in settlements.</p>  <p>  I have made it a high priority personally to support efforts to reach a comprehensive peace agreement to the Middle East conflict. I have met with the US Middle East team to encourage their work, and to underline what the EU sees as the key parameters for an agreement. I have also taken an active role on this issue in the Foreign Affairs Council, urging my colleagues to continue our work to help preserve and create the political and physical space in which the two state solution can be achieved. I visited the region earlier this year and met with representatives of both parties, and I hope to do so again in the coming months.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p>  <p>  It is, of course, a matter of concern when people consider that their working environment does not meet acceptable standards.  The Deputies will be aware that the Garda Station Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016-2021 includes provision for a new Garda station to be provided in Sligo, together with stations in Macroom and Clonmel, by means of Public Private Partnership and I understand that the OPW is now actively progressing the acquisition of a suitable site in Sligo for the proposed development.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the current situation at the station, I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that arrangements are in place to ensure that the provision of policing services to the community in Sligo is fully maintained.  As part of those arrangements a Public Office, Radio Control Room, and briefing facilities have been established on a temporary basis at another location in close proximity to the station. </p>  <p>  The arrangements are reviewed on a daily basis to ensure that the policing service provided to the community of Sligo in terms of service to victims, responses to requests for assistance, high visibility patrols and checkpoints, etc., continues as normal.</p>  <p>  I understand that Garda management engaged in lengthy discussions with the representatives of the GRA on Friday 17 November 2017 and set out a comprehensive set of written proposals with the objective of accelerating facility and remedial works at the station and making them a time-bound priority.  The proposals focus on the refurbishment of the station and the improvement of services and amenities for the benefit of all the station party.  In addition, the OPW has recently tendered for the provision of a new male and female two-storey locker facility to be in place by the end of April 2018.  Planning permission for this has been secured and the tender documents are to be returned to the OPW by 6 December, 2017.</p>  <p>  I also understand that Garda management has proposed the establishment of a working group, broadly representative of the station party and under the direction of the local Chief Superintendent, to drive consultation process and to address the issues of concern.  I would encourage this dialogue in the interests of resolving those issues.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the GRA has engaged an external Consulting Engineer who has prepared a report in respect of the station.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has requested the OPW, as the property owners and building agents of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to review that report and to advise on the suggested health and safety and fire safety breaches therein and any remedial actions that can be taken to address any breaches arising.</p>  <p>  The OPW has advised that the station, having being built and refurbished prior to the introduction of the Building Regulations (1992), is deemed to be exempt from the Regulations and the requirement to obtain a Fire Certificate.  However, the provisions of the Fire Services Acts of 1981 and 2003 are relevant to the station. </p>  <p>  The Acting Chief Fire Officer in Sligo has advised that, following a fire safety inspection conducted on 25 November 2017, he is satisfied that Garda management are fulfilling their obligations under Section 18 (2) of the Fire Services Acts as far as is reasonably practicable and that, from a fire safety perspective, it is safe for personnel of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to occupy the premises. </p>  <p>  Further, on Monday 27 November 2017, two inspectors from the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) visited the station and identified some necessary improvement works of a relatively minor nature.  Based on their observations and assurances given in relation to planned improvements that are to be made, the HSA advised that it would have no concerns about members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na using the station as a place of work.</p>  <p>  The OPW considers that, while the building requires some upgrade works in order to bring it completely in line with current regulations, it is safe and fit for occupation.  These upgrade works were included in proposed scheme of works that were submitted to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for consideration and approval (and referred to in the proposals made by Garda management to the GRA at the meeting on 17 November 2017).</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no role in the matter.</p>  <p>  Indeed, this was the basis on which the Garda District and Station Rationalisation Programme was developed and implemented, resulting in the closure of some 139 Garda stations, including Ballymore Eustace Garda station.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the closures have allowed front line Garda to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility and in a more focused fashion particularly with regard to various targeted police operations.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to a pilot scheme to reopen 6 Garda stations, both urban and rural, to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner has recently submitted his final report in relation to this matter.  The report recommends that stations at Ballinspittle, Co. Cork; Bawnboy, Co. Cavan; Leighlinbridge, Co. Carlow; Donard, Co. Wicklow; together with Rush and Stepaside, Co.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that on the 30 September 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of the Laois/Offaly and Kildare Division was 324 and 341 respectively.  There are also 17 Garda Reserves and 25 civilians attached to the Laois/Offaly Division and there are 20 Garda Reserves and 29 civilians attached to the Kildare Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Response Unit, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 66 and 72 of whom have been assigned to the Laois/Offaly and Kildare Division respectively.  In addition, another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest next month which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.  </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  The substantial increase in Garda numbers is tangible progress on achieving this Government&rsquo;s vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p><p>I am pleased to say that Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  The substantial increase in Garda numbers is tangible progress on achieving this Government&rsquo;s vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that on 30 September 2017, the latest date for which figures are currently available, the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was 13,412 members.</p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  In addition, another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest next month which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - increase of 500 since the end of 2016.  </p><p>I am pleased to say that Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.

Such acts represent a blatant disregard for the safety of the brave men and women who work in our emergency services, who risk their lives every day in the service of the people of our State.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the fire services do not come within my remit, however, I am assured that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provide every appropriate assistance to emergency service personnel when they are requested to do so.  Particular liaison is maintained with fire services and local authorities in the run up to Halloween and on Halloween night itself in the context of overall policing plans to respond to issues of public safety and anti-social behaviour which can arise during this period. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, I can advise the Deputy that there is specific legislation in place to deal with attacks on emergency workers in front-line positions, including fire service personnel.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, as amended by the Criminal Justice Act 2006, provides explicit statutory protection for what are termed &ldquo;peace officers&rdquo;, which include members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, prison officers, members of the fire brigade, ambulance personnel and members of the Defence Forces.  The Act also covers those working in medical services in hospitals, including doctors, nurses, psychiatrists and others involved in the provision of treatment and care.  Section 19 of the 1994 Act provides that any person who assaults or threatens to assault any of these front-line workers is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to &euro;5,000 or a term of imprisonment of up to 12 months or both, or on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for a term of up to 7 years or both.  The maximum sentence was increased from 5 years to 7 years under the 2006 Act.</p>  <p>  It is also an offence under the 1994 Act, as amended, to resist, wilfully obstruct or impede a peace officer, or medical staff in a hospital, in the course of carrying out their work.  The penalty on summary conviction for such an offence is a fine of up to &euro;2,500 or imprisonment for a term of up to 6 months or both.</p>  <p>  In addition, in the case of assault causing serious harm, an offender can be prosecuted under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 which deals comprehensively with a wide range of assault provisions, the more serious of which carry heavy penalties.  That Act provides for penalties of up to 5 years in prison for an offence of assault causing harm and for a penalty of life imprisonment for an offence of causing serious harm.

The new Family Reunification Humanitarian Admission Programme (FRHAP) will see up to 530 immediate family members of refugees from established conflict zones come to Ireland as part of our overall commitment to accept 4,000 persons under the IRPP. </p><p>I will operate this humanitarian admission programme under my Ministerial discretionary powers and it will be in addition to the family reunification provisions provided for in the International Protection Act 2015.  To allow the maximum number of families to benefit from the scheme sponsors will be asked to prioritise a small number of family members for admission.  I am conscious that the measure is being introduced at a time when our national housing supply is under strain.  To minimise the impact of the programme, priority may be given to sponsors who can meet the accommodation requirements of eligible family members.</p><p>Additional details on the operation of the programme will be announced on the websites of the Department of Justice and Equality () and the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service () in the coming weeks following consultations with UNHCR.</p></reply>

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Acts and the making of valuations for rating purposes is his sole responsibility. I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no role in decisions in this regard.</p><p>Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors. As the Deputy will be aware this has been the policy of successive governments and is the express purpose of the National Revaluation Programme now being rolled out by the Valuation Office. </p><p>In relation to the information sought, it should be noted that prior to the commencement of the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 a ratepayer could appeal a final valuation firstly to the Commissioner of Valuation and subsequently to the Valuation Tribunal. Since the passing of this Act, appeals are now made solely to the Valuation Tribunal. Appeals from the recently completed Reval 2017 programme (including the second revaluation of South Dublin County Council rating authority area) were made under the new provisions for the first time. It continues to be the case that, when a ratepayer is provided with a proposed valuation earlier in the valuation process, he/she can make representations to the Valuation Office if dissatisfied. </p><p>The information sought by the Deputy is relation to appeals to the Valuation Tribunal is contained in the following table.<table><tr><th>Year Revaluation Completed</th><th>Rating Authority</th><th>Number of appeals to Valuation Tribunal</th><th>Overall Appeal Rate to Valuation Tribunal (%)</th></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>South Dublin County Council</td><td>228</td><td>3.29%</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>Fingal County Council</td><td>100</td><td>1.63%</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>D&uacute;n Laoghaire/Rathdown County Council</td><td>303</td><td>5.83%</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>Dublin City Council</td><td>927</td><td>4.54%</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>Waterford City and County Council</td><td>74</td><td>1.87%</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>Limerick City and County Council</td><td>68</td><td>1.03%</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>Carlow County Council</td><td>119</td><td>5.98%</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>Kildare County Council</td><td>225</td><td>4.45%</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>Kilkenny County Council</td><td>196</td><td>6.85%</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>Leitrim County Council</td><td>33</td><td>3.05%</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>Longford County Council</td><td>47</td><td>3.36%</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>Offaly County Council</td><td>62</td><td>2.49%</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>Roscommon County Council</td><td>93</td><td>4.45%</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>Sligo County Council</td><td>98</td><td>4.42%</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>South Dublin County Council (2nd Reval)</td><td>274</td><td>3.97%</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>Westmeath County Council</td><td>124</td><td>4.16% </td></tr></table></p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that on the 30 September 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of the Tipperary Division, Waterford Division and the Kilkenny/Carlow Division was 372, 285 and 318 respectively. There are also 18 Garda Reserves and 40 civilians attached to the Tipperary Division, 19 Reserves and 30 civilians attached to the Waterford Division and 26 Reserves and 31 civilians attached to the Kilkenny/Carlow Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Response Unit, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 35, 49 and 44 of whom were assigned to the Tipperary Division, Waterford Division and the Kilkenny/Carlow Division respectively.  In addition, another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest next month which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.  </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  The substantial increase in Garda numbers is tangible progress on achieving this Government&rsquo;s vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p><p>I am pleased to say that Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Tipperary Division, Waterford Division and the Kilkenny/Carlow Division, in the coming years.</p><p>The strength of the Tipperary Division, Waterford Division and the Kilkenny/Carlow Division in each of the years 2013-2016 and on 30 September 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, are as set out in the following table.<table><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th>Garda Strength by Division 2013 - 2017</th></tr><tr><td>Division</td><td>2013</td><td>2014</td><td>2015</td><td>2016</td><td>2017*</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>371</td><td>359</td><td>354</td><td>364</td><td>372</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>274</td><td>274</td><td>282</td><td>277</td><td>285 </td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny/Carlow</td><td>289</td><td>279</td><td>284</td><td>296</td><td>318</td></tr></table>*Up to 30 September 2017</p></reply>

In determining whether to make a deportation order, in addition to the factors set out in Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, all relevant constitutional and international human rights arising including those enshrined in the Refugee Convention, the UN Convention Against Torture and the European Charter of Human Rights must be considered.

This has no implications for the findings of the Internal Audit Report.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the funding model for the College changed in May 2017 and the restaurant is now being run on a net cost basis. I am advised by the Garda Commissioner that the monthly funding from the Garda Vote for the restaurant is now calculated from the cost of staff wages and restaurant supplies, and takes account of till receipts. This model is designed to avoid any accumulation of surpluses in the restaurant account.</p>  <p>  In line with the recommendation in the Interim Internal Audit Report and in order to give a transparent picture of the total costs and income of the College, from 2018 all College expenditure hitherto paid from the restaurant account (based on the living allowance direct payments) will now be paid from the Vote under a new College specific subhead and a new budget line for College income from the restaurant, etc. will be included within Appropriations-in-Aid.  This together with the other steps being taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to implement the recommendations of the Report as a matter of priority will ensure that the serious shortcoming identified in the Report cannot arise again.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that there has been very substantial progress in relation to the implementation of the recommendations as noted by the Policing Authority in its second report on this matter. The Authority's report was laid before the Houses on 17 November 2017.    </p></reply>

I have no responsibility in relation to the actions of local authorities. However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have sought the relevant information from the Local Government Management Agency. The names of the ten local authorities which have published a migrant integration policy are as follows:</p><p>Carlow County Council</p><p>Dublin City Council</p><p>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council</p><p>Galway County Council</p><p>Kerry County Council</p><p>Kildare County Council</p><p>Kilkenny County Council</p><p>Limerick City and County Council</p><p>Longford County Council</p><p>South Dublin County Council.</p><p>Development of Local Authorities' integration strategies will be undertaken within the framework of the National Strategy. Action 52 of the Migrant Integration Strategy - A Blueprint for the future, which was published on 7 February 2017, provides for the updating of integration strategies by local authorities over the lifetime of the Strategy i.e. from 2017 to 2020. </p><p>A Monitoring and Co-ordination Committee has been established to support the process of implementing the Migrant Integration Strategy. The Committee, which comprises representatives of relevant Government Departments, State Agencies and the NGO sector, met for the second time in October 2017 and is due to meet again in January 2018. Progress on the implementation of the actions in the Strategy will be reviewed at the end of 2018 and a report prepared for Government.  </p></reply>

Therefore, neither the HSE nor my Department has a role in determining the salaries or other terms and conditions applying to these staff.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the staff of these Section 39 organisations are not public servants and therefore were not subject to the FEMPI legislation which imposed pay reductions. It follows then that the staff of the Section 39 bodies will not be eligible for any pay restoration associated with the unwinding of this legislation and provided for under the more recent Public Service Agreements.  As already outlined, it is a matter for Section 39 organisations to negotiate salaries with their staff as part of their employment relationship and within the overall funding available for the delivery of agreed services. </p>  <p>  Whilst it is understood that pay cuts were imposed on Section 39 employees, it is not clear that these cuts were applied in a universally consistent manner across all the Section 39 agencies. It is also important to recognise that this group of organisations within the health sector is just one element of a larger complex issue which could have significant cost implications for the Exchequer across the public services as a whole.  In this regard, I have had discussions with my colleague Minister Donohoe and will continue to engage with him on this matter.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service. However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner. The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; is forecast at just over &euro;1.7 billion in 2017. </p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively. This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster (Versatis) is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults. It was reimbursed in the community drugs schemes from 2010. The projected budget impact was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure has increased significantly, from &euro;9.4 million in 2012 to over &euro;30 million in 2016, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles. Currently, over 25,000 patients receive this item. </p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of Versatis highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data and its value is uncertain for all other types of pain. The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, between 5-10% of prescribing of this product is for the licensed indication of PHN. </p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for Versatis from 1 September 2017. This process supports the appropriate use of Versatis, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment. The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.</p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who receive antivirals for shingles are automatically approved for Versatis for three months. No action is required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy is notified of his or her approval status.</p><p>All patients who currently use Versatis have been identified and automatically registered on the HSE-PCRS system for three months and will continue to receive the treatment from their pharmacy until 30 November 2017. However, from 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients will no longer get Versatis under the community drugs schemes. The HSE has produced information leaflets for patients and advised GPs on treatment alternatives. </p><p>In exceptional circumstances, the product may be approved for supply through the community schemes for unlicensed indications. GPs apply for reimbursement for unlicensed indications through the online system. The MMP reviews applications before a decision is made and communicated to the GP.</p><p>Full details of the Versatis review are available on the HSE website at .</p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

Valproate-containing medicines are authorised for these indications in all EU Member States, and in Norway and Iceland. </p>  <p>  It has been well established that children exposed to valproate in the womb have an increased risk of congenital malformations and neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism. The product information for valproate-containing medicines clearly states that such medicines should not be used in female children, in female adolescents, in women of childbearing potential and pregnant women unless alternative treatments are ineffective or not tolerated. A warning label for the outer packaging of Epilim products was introduced in Ireland earlier this year; products carrying the new external warning label are now being supplied to retail pharmacies.</p>  <p>  In March of this year, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) initiated a new review of the use of valproate-containing medicines in the treatment of women and girls who are pregnant or of childbearing age.  This review is examining the available evidence and consulting with relevant stakeholder groups; the most recent component of the review was a public hearing held at the London offices of the EMA on 26 September. In its summary of the public hearing, the EMA noted that the PRAC would consider a number of proposals and ideas presented by participants, including registers of women who were receiving valproate and children who had been exposed to valproate during pregnancy. </p>  <p>  When the EMA's current review of valproate is concluded, the HPRA will communicate the outcome and recommendations of the review to Irish patients, healthcare professionals and relevant stakeholders, including the HSE. The HSE National Clinical Programme for Epilepsy will also consider the outcome of the EMA review in finalising its protocol for the effective management of women with epilepsy.</p>  <p>  In terms of supports and services for children with foetal anti-convulsant syndrome, the National Disability Strategy is based on a non-condition-specific approach to the delivery of public services. The current Programme for Partnership Government commits this Government to improving services and increasing supports for all people with disabilities, particularly for early assessment and intervention for children with special needs. This commitment is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities. The overarching principle governing the planning and delivery of health services and supports for adults and children with disabilities is that they should be integrated, as much as possible, with services and supports for the rest of the population.</p>  <p>  I am aware that France has a state-funded compensation scheme for medical accidents, and that this scheme is now considering claims from individuals affected by valproate. I am also aware that a patient representative group in France has filed a class action lawsuit against the manufacturer of a valproate-containing medicine. My Department will monitor developments in France and in other member states, and will give appropriate consideration to the findings and recommendations of the current EMA review of valproate when this review is completed.</p></reply>

These measures include the introduction earlier this year of a warning label for the outer packaging of Epilim (sodium valproate) products; retail pharmacies are now being supplied with products carrying the new external warning label. </p>  <p>  The product information supplied with this medicine also includes detailed warnings and recommendations for healthcare professionals and patients regarding the use of valproate, including the need for treatment to be initiated and supervised by a specialist experienced in the management of epilepsy or bipolar disorder. Within the last two weeks, the HPRA has been in contact with the pharmacy regulator, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI), to re-emphasise the importance of informing women of childbearing age of the potential risks of taking valproate-containing medicines.  The PSI subsequently issued a circular to all registered pharmacists highlighting the need to include a patient leaflet and Alert Card with each supply of these medicines, and to provide additional labelling and counselling to patients as required.</p>  <p>  Since March of this year, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) of the European Medicines Agency has been conducting a new review to examine the use of valproate-containing medicines in the treatment of women and girls who are pregnant or of childbearing age.

This provides the framework to allow for an enhanced programme to replace, upgrade and refurbish these care facilities, as appropriate.  Significant work was undertaken to determine the most optimum scheduling of projects within the phased provision of funding to achieve compliance with National Standards.</p><p>This investment programme will see the provision of two new centres in Donegal, namely in Ballyshannon and also a 130 bed centre, centrally located in Letterkenny.</p><p>Since the announcement in 2016, and following discussions with public representatives, Health Forum members and local community groups, local HSE management in CHO 1 agreed to review overall requirements for the area.

For a person to be admitted as an involuntary patient, there is a three-stage process involving an initial application, a recommendation from a General Practitioner and an assessment by a Consultant Psychiatrist that the person under examination suffers from a mental disorder and meets the conditions for involuntary admission as set out in Section 3 of the Act.  Such admissions are subject to review by a Mental Health Tribunal.</p>  <p>  It is important to point out that any assessment of whether a person should be admitted as an involuntary patient because he/she is deemed to be suffering from a mental disorder, will take into account the question of whether there is a serious likelihood of the person concerned causing immediate and serious harm to himself or herself or to other persons.</p>  <p>  It should also be mentioned that Section 8(2) of the Act specifically prohibits the detention under the Act of individuals who suffer from a personality disorder, are socially deviant, or are addicted to drugs or intoxicants.  However, where individuals with such conditions are also diagnosed with a mental disorder, then they may be subject to detention but only because of the presence of a mental disorder.</p>  <p>  In relation to Dual Diagnosis, the HSE's Mental Health Division recognised the need for a Clinical Programme for Dual Diagnosis to respond to people with substance misuse, both alcohol and/or drugs, together with mental illness.  The HSE's Primary Care Division has already appointed a National Clinical Lead for the Addiction Services to improve its response to drug and alcohol abuse at primary care level and this Clinical Lead will work with the Mental Health Clinical Lead to develop a cohesive programme for those with a dual diagnosis.</p>  <p>  The aims of this Programme are to develop a standardised evidence-based approach to the identification, assessment and treatment of comorbid mental illness and substance misuse.  An integral part of the Dual Diagnosis Programme will be to devise a model of care that will outline how all adolescents and adults suspected of having a moderate to severe mental illness coexisting with significant substance misuse have access to a timely mental health services nationally.  This is to be delivered on a CHO basis.  The aim will be for the service to be provided in an integrated manner across the HSE's Primary Care Division and the Mental Health Service and will ensure that there are close working relationships with the relevant specialities in the Acute Hospital Groups which will deal with any medical comorbidities that may occur, particularly in those with alcohol misuse.</p>  <p>  A National Working Group, made up of key stakeholders with clinical, service user and service provider expertise, has been appointed.  The Group had its first meeting in mid October 2017 and has initiated a work plan to develop a Model of Care based on a Programmatic approach to service improvement and development.</p></reply>

Major trauma involves injuries which have the potential to cause prolonged disability or death. Based on available data, it is estimated that Ireland has approximately 1,600 major trauma patients each year. Trauma care is a subset of overall Emergency Department activity. Emergency Departments provide 24/7 access for emergency and urgent presentations across the spectrum of medical and surgical conditions with 1,157,074 new Emergency Department attendances in 2016. </p>  <p>  In 2015, my predecessor established a Trauma Policy Steering Group, chaired by Professor Eilis McGovern, to make recommendations in relation to the development of a trauma system for Ireland. Patients who have used trauma services and clinicians were at the heart of the development of the plan. The Group has now completed its report and I intend to bring it to Cabinet before the end of the year. </p>  <p>  This is about delivering best outcomes for the small number of patients each year who suffer major trauma, that is, injuries which have the potential to cause prolonged disability or death, and ensuring they get the right care in the right place at the right time.  </p></reply>

Patients may access the healthcare they require in either the public or private healthcare system of another Member State under the CBD. Access to healthcare abroad is based on patients following public patient pathways, i.e. they must demonstrate they have followed the equivalent public patient pathways that a patient would follow if accessing public healthcare in Ireland.  It is important to note that reimbursement is confined to the costs of the care itself and that the rates of reimbursement cannot exceed the cost of provision of the care if it were provided in the Irish public health service.</p>  <p>  The HSE operates the CBD in Ireland. Referral for care under the CBD may be made by a GP, a hospital consultant and certain other clinicians. In line with practice in other EU Member States, the HSE through the National Contact Point (NCP) provides information for patients on the CBD on its website which can be accessed at www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/cbd/ and also by phone at 056 7784551.  The HSE advises where a patient is in any doubt as to the need to seek prior authorization before availing of a consultation or treatment abroad to contact the NCP. </p>  <p>  The HSE also operates the Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS) for persons entitled to treatment in another EU/EEA Member State or Switzerland under EU Regulation (EC) No. 883/2004, as per the procedures set out in EU Regulations (EC) No. 987/2009. The TAS provides for the cost of approved treatments in another EU/EEA member state or Switzerland through the issue of form E112 (IE) where the treatment is:</p>  <p>  -  Among the benefits provided for by Irish legislation; </p>  <p>  -  Not available in Ireland; and </p>  <p>  -  Not available within the time normally necessary for obtaining it in Ireland, taking account of the patient's current state of health and the probable course of the disease.</p>  <p>  GPs refer patients to consultants for acute care and it is the treating consultant who, having exhausted all treatment options including tertiary care within the country, refers the patient abroad under the terms of the TAS. The consultant must specify the specific treatment and in making the referral accepts clinical responsibility in relation to the physician and facility abroad where the patient will attend. </p>  <p>  Applications to the TAS are processed and a determination given in accordance with the statutory framework prior to a patient travelling to avail of treatment. The statutory framework stipulates the patient must be a public patient and is required to have followed public patient pathways. Information on the TAS can be accessed on the HSE website at  www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/treatmentabroad/ and also by phone at  056 7784551.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of EU Regulation 883/2004, all persons ordinarily resident in the EU are entitled to apply for a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC). The EHIC certifies that the holder has the right to receive emergency healthcare during a temporary stay in any EU country as well as Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Iceland. This right is guaranteed to all persons who are covered by the public healthcare system of these countries. The EHIC holder has the right to receive necessary treatment in the host Member State's public healthcare system on the same terms and at the same cost as nationals of the State concerned. It should be noted that under bilateral arrangements, an EHIC is not required from Irish citizens when accessing emergency treatment in Northern Ireland and proof of residence (for example passport or driving licence) is sufficient. </p>  <p>  Information on the EHIC can be accessed on the HSE website at www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/EHIC/ and also by phone at  061 461 105.</p></reply>

The EMA plays a vital role in the protection of the health of 500 million EU citizens through the scientific evaluation and safety monitoring of human and veterinary medicines and I believed that Dublin would be an ideal choice for the new host city. The relocation of the EMA represented an opportunity to attract a prestigious EU Agency which directly employs almost 1,000 staff and would attract many more high-quality jobs in associated sectors. The EMA is also key to maintaining the competitiveness of the European pharmaceutical industry, which is worth approximately &euro;260 billion annually.</p>  <p>  In October 2016 the Government decided to promote Dublin as a suitable new location for the Agency. The Irish offer, which was developed by a cross-sectoral working group led by my Department, with colleagues from the Department of the Taoiseach and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as well as representatives from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), IDA Ireland and other Government Departments, was officially submitted to the European Council and the European Commission on 31 July 2017. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department worked closely with colleagues in the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the strategy and campaign to promote the bid and demonstrate why it was felt Dublin represented a suitable location for the EMA, for Europe and for its citizens. </p>  <p>  On 19 November 2017, Ireland's Permanent Representative to the European Union confirmed that Ireland was withdrawing its bid for the European Medicines Agency in order to focus on the offer for the European Banking Authority recognising the political challenge of pursuing two bids concurrently. The decision on the relocation of the agencies was taken by the General Affairs Council on 20 November. The Council chose Amsterdam as the new location for the EMA and I expect that the Netherlands will be a suitable new location for the Agency that will allow it to the greatest extent possible continue its important role in protecting patient safety. </p></reply>

Patients who have used trauma services and clinicians were at the heart of the development of the plan. The Trauma Steering Group completed its final report in July 2017 and I intend to bring  it to Government before the end of the year. </p>  <p>  This report is about delivering best outcomes for the small number of patients each year who suffer major trauma, that is, injuries which have the potential to cause prolonged disability or death, and ensuring they get the right care in the right place at the right time. International evidence demonstrates that trauma systems are associated with better patient outcomes, improved access to care and reduced length of stay and cost-effectiveness, more lives being saved and fewer people being left with a disability. </p>  <p>  Following on from recent media reports, it is important to say that the report is not about closing Emergency Departments or diminishing services. Traumatic injuries may be low, moderate or severe. Major trauma involves injuries which have the potential to cause prolonged disability or death. Based on available data, it is estimated that Ireland has approximately 1,600 major trauma patients each year. To put this in context, Emergency Departments provide 24/7 access for emergency and urgent presentations across the spectrum of medical and  surgical conditions, with 1,157,074 new ED attendances in 2016.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific queries raised by the Deputy in relation to the number of patients admitted and treated for trauma injuries in hospitals in each of the years 2008 to 2016 and to date in 2017 and the hospitals that treat trauma injuries and the trauma level each is currently at, as this is a service issue, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly. </p></reply>

It provides an update on all 48 recommendations as outlined in the Plan and progress to date.</p><p>One of the principal recommendations in the Plan was the establishment of a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases which is responsible for assisting with mapping and developing care pathways for rare diseases; facilitating timely access to centres of expertise- nationally and internationally; and developing care pathways with European Reference Centres for those ultra-rare disorders where there may not be sufficient expertise in Ireland. </p><p>In line with the National Rare Diseases Plan, the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Department of Health, encouraged designated centres of expertise in Ireland to apply for membership of European Reference Networks during the first round of calls from the European Commission for participation in European Reference Networks.  Three of these centres  are now represented on ERN network.</p><p>Membership of ERNs will bring opportunities for engaging in research relating to Rare Diseases in keeping with the National Rare Diseases Plan.  Further centres are expected to apply for membership or affiliated membership of ERNs when the next call takes place in early 2018.</p><p>The establishment of a National Rare Disease Office (NRDO) featured prominently in the recommendations of the Rare Disease plan.  The office provides current and reliable information about rare diseases to the general public, health care professionals, researchers and policy makers.  The National Rare Diseases Office is responsible for updating Orphanet Ireland.  Orphanet is the international rare disease reference and information portal funded by the EU.  The office also manages the National Rare Diseases Information Line (a Freephone service) and provides online information about rare diseases on <i>.</i></p><p>A number of recommendations about access to appropriate drugs and technologies were contained in the plan.  One chief recommendation in this regard refers to the HSE developing a Working Group to bring forward appropriate decision criteria for the reimbursement of orphan medicines and technologies; and that the approach should include an assessment system similar to that for cancer therapies established under the National Cancer Control Programme.  The HSE Acute Hospitals Division has developed the terms of reference, required membership and reporting relationship for this committee.  A Chairperson has now been identified and it is expected that the Group will convene in the near future  .</p><p>The national plan for rare diseases recommended that the Health Identifiers Bill and the Health &amp;amp; Patient Safety Bill be published.  The former was published in 2013 and enacted in 2014.  The Individual Health Identifier part of the project is now being implemented by the HSE.  A revised and much expanded General Scheme of a Health Information and Patient Safety Bill was approved by the government in November 2015 and published on the Department's website.  </p><p>Two recommendations referred to training in rare diseases for healthcare professionals.  The Department of Health has contacted formally the various healthcare representative and professional bodies about implementing these recommendations.  The National Rare Diseases Office developed eLearning modules for healthcare professionals.  These modules are available on <i>.</i></p><p>The issue of rare diseases and of the creation of an all-island patient register has been raised in the context of ongoing discussions at North-South meetings.  It is also anticipated that the Model of Care for Rare Diseases will set out recommendations for rare disease registries.  This model of care is in development by the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases.</p><p>The National Rare Disease Plan continues to be implemented.  It recommended that an Oversight Implementation Group of relevant stakeholders, including patients' groups, be established to oversee and monitor implementation of the plan&rsquo;s recommendations.  This group was established by the Department of Health in 2015 and it has met on a number of occasions  .</p><p>The Department will consider the matter of a further plan as part of its Work Programme for 2018. </p></reply>

The projections are for the time period 2015 and 2030 and show significant increases in demand across all health services, including acute hospitals.  The ESRI research shows the demand for in-patient bed days (exclusive of maternity activity) is projected to increase by between 32 and 37 per cent by 2030.  It is important to emphasis that this analysis was carried out at a national level and is based on national population projections.  It is also important to recognise that the analysis is based on current patterns of healthcare utilisation and does not take account of changes in our model of care, especially the development of a more comprehensive community-based care system as advocated by the Sl&aacute;intecare report.</p>  <p>  Complementary to the ESRI work, my Department is currently undertaking a national Health Service Capacity Review.  As I have previously stated, this national Review has a wider scope than previous exercises and includes key elements of primary and community care infrastructure in addition to hospital facilities.  It is examining in detail the demand for all key types of hospital activity, including inpatient, daycase, outpatients, critical care, and emergency,  in addition to those non-acute areas which most impact on hospitals, such as primary care and the care of older persons. </p>  <p>  A Steering Group is overseeing the project, with support from external consultants commissioned to provide technical, analytical and engagement expertise.  An independent international peer review group is involved in ongoing review and validation of the methodology and approach.  My Department has also undertaken a public consultation process to ensure that stakeholder views are fed into the Review.</p>  <p>  The findings from this Review will provide a basis for determining both the extent of capacity requirements over the next 15 years and the type of capacity that is needed at a national and regional level.  The emerging findings from the review will inform the development of a new 10 year national capital plan later this year. </p>  <p>  I expect to receive the final report of the Capacity Review by the end of the year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-28a.1020.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112800073#WRQ05000"><p>Ireland's first National Maternity Strategy - <i>Creating A Better Future Together 2016 - 2026 </i>-  recognises pregnancy and birth as a normal physiological process.  It aims to ensure that appropriate care pathways are in place in order that mothers, babies and families get the right care, at the right time, by the right team and in the right place.  Similarly, it recognises that, while all pregnant women need a certain level of support, some will require more specialised care.  Accordingly, it proposes an integrated model that delivers care at the lowest level of complexity and encompasses all the necessary safety nets in line with patient safety principles.  </p><p>The Strategy makes it clear that women should be offered choice regarding their preferred pathway of care, in line with their clinical needs and best practice.  The model consists of three care pathways - supported, assisted and specialised.  The Supported Care Pathway is intended for normal-risk mothers and babies, with midwives leading and delivering care within a multidisciplinary framework.  Care will be delivered by the community midwifery team, with most antenatal and postnatal care being provided in the community and home settings.  The woman can exercise a choice with her healthcare professional with regard to the birth setting, which may be in an Alongside Birth Centre in the hospital, or at home.  The Assisted Care Pathway is intended for mothers and babies considered to be at medium risk, and for normal-risk women who choose an obstetric service, while the Specialised Care Pathway is intended for high-risk mothers and babies. </p><p>With regard to birth settings, the Strategy proposes Alongside Birth Centres for the Supported Care Pathway and Specialised Birth Centres (current labour ward) for the Assisted and Specialised Care Pathways.  Freestanding birth centres are not recommended in the Strategy as it is considered that it will  first be necessary to monitor and evaluate the implementation of Alongside Birth Centres in an Irish context.</p><p>In relation to the terminology used to describe the new model of care, the Strategy, unapologetically, places mothers at the centre.  Therefore, profession-centric terms such as &quot;consultant led&quot; and &quot;midwifery led&quot; have been avoided, as far as possible, as they incorrectly place an emphasis on the profession.  As I have outlined already, in future, maternity care in Ireland will be provided in an integrated manner, by a multidisciplinary team, with women seeing the most appropriate professional, based on their individual need. </p><p>Finally, I should mention that the Strategy will be implemented on a phased basis over the coming years and this work will be led by the HSE National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme.  Last month, I was pleased to launch the Programme&rsquo;s detailed Implementation Plan for the Strategy.  That plan seeks to ensure that each maternity network will have all three care pathways in place and operational in 2018.  The Plan also provides that by early 2019, a minimum of 20% of pregnant women presenting at our maternity hospitals/units, including those units in the north west, will have access to the supported care pathway. </p></reply>

Specialist cardiac services cover hospital-based specialist services for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac disease.  This includes the services provided in catheterisation laboratories, both scheduled and unscheduled.  The intention of the National Review is to set out minimum service requirements, relating to staffing, activity, performance, and other relevant measures, based on evidence where available, and/or conform to international best practice and standards.  In examining the scope of this review, it has been determined that the most appropriate and effective approach, in order to ensure the best possible clinical outcomes, is to consider all adult cardiac service needs and their optimal service configuration as a whole.  This comprehensive National Review of all specialist cardiac services will clearly include data from existing service provision including data related to University Hospital Waterford.  </p></reply>

Patients who have used trauma services and clinicians were at the heart of the development of the plan.  The Group has now completed its report and I intend to bring it to Cabinet before the end of the year.</p>  <p>  This is about delivering best outcomes for the small number of patients each year who suffer major trauma, that is, injuries which have the potential to cause prolonged disability or death, and ensuring they get the right care in the right place at the right time.</p>  <p>  Following on from recent media reports, it is important to say that the report is not about closing Emergency Departments or diminishing services.  Traumatic injuries may be low, moderate or severe.  Major trauma involves injuries which have the potential to cause prolonged disability or death.</p>  <p>  Based on available data, it is estimated that Ireland has approximately 1,600 major trauma patients each year.  Trauma care is a subset of overall Emergency Department activity.  Emergency Departments provide 24/7 access for emergency and urgent presentations across the spectrum of medical and surgical conditions with 1,157,074 new Emergency Department attendances in 2016.</p></reply>

One of the recommendations in that report was that "Consideration should be given on a wider front to amending the statutory complaints process (and the remit of the Ombudsman) to allow for the inclusion of clinical judgement as the subject about which a complaint can be made".  Under current legislation the Ombudsman cannot examine complaints which relate to a person acting on behalf of the HSE and which, in his opinion, relate solely to the exercise of clinical judgement in the diagnosis or care or treatment of a patient.  However, the Ombudsman can examine the administrative actions of healthcare professionals and administrators taken in the course of clinical work which do not involve clinical judgement.</p>  <p>  My department is currently developing a Patient Safety Complaints and Advocacy Policy.  Work to date has included an examination of both national and international experience of the management of patient safety complaints and the legal frameworks involved. In addition a national public consultation took place in May and June of this year.  This public consultation exercise was open to the public, patients, users, staff and relevant organisations. In total, 174 submissions were received.  Meetings have also taken place with 23 key stakeholders, representing a broad spectrum of interested parties, including patient organisations, service providers, the Ombudsman's office, service regulators and professional regulators.  The policy will be finalised shortly. </p></reply>

Securing affordable access to existing and new medicines in a timely manner is a key objective of the Irish Health Service. However, the challenge is delivering on this objective in an affordable and sustainable way in line with the resources allocated by the D&aacute;il and the relevant legislative provisions. Expenditure on medicines represents one of the largest areas of expenditure across the health service and will continue to grow in the years ahead as our health service continues to meet the needs of our citizens</p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE are engaging in a number of initiatives which have led and will continue to lead to better access to medicines for patients, value for the taxpayer and the cost- effective provision of medicines in Ireland.  Key initiatives include reference and generic substitution, under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, the four year Framework Agreement on the Supply and Pricing of Medicines with IPHA, the Medicines Management Programme and National Drugs Management Programme within the HSE, and the development of a National Biosimilar Medicines Policy.  Ireland is also participating in a number of discussions amongst EU Member states to explore possible areas for collaboration including potential joint price negotiations and procurement.  </p>  <p>  However, access to medicines is not solely a funding issue.  A significant barrier to accessing new medicines is the price being sought by some manufacturers for their products.  The solution to increased access is multifaceted and is not simply a matter of allocating more funding for medicines at the expense of other health or public services.  The health service must continue to seek better value and lower costs for both existing and new treatments.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines under the community drugs schemes, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  This Act gives full statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decision on the reimbursement of medicines, taking account of expert opinion as appropriate.  There is also an increased level of engagement and commercial negotiations between the HSE and manufacturers in an effort to reduce the price to affordable levels.  So while this process is resource intensive, it is clear that as a result of such a robust and scientific process, Ireland is paying significantly less for medicines and the ability to invest is enhanced.</p>  <p>  In my recent speech at the IPHA Annual Meeting and Dinner, I highlighted the need for innovative solutions to accessing new medicines. To this end, my Department will continue to consider how improvements can be made to the current system, and will, as part of this work, engage with key stakeholders in 2018 in this regard.</p></reply>

Persons aged 70 or older who are assessed as ineligible under the gross income thresholds may also have their eligibility assessed under the general means-tested medical card scheme if they so wish, for example in the event that they face particularly high expenses, e.g. nursing home or medication costs.  This scheme is open to all persons, irrespective of their age and assessment is based on net income and assessable outgoing expenses.  The general scheme, although having lower income thresholds, provides for income disregards and relevant outgoings to be taken into account in the assessment process.</p>  <p>  Under the medical card legislation, having a particular illness in itself, does not establish eligibility for  a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis.  However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.</p>  <p>   In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.  In addition, from August 2015, all persons aged 70 or older qualify for a GP Visit Card, regardless of income.</p>  <p>  There are no proposals at present to amend the legislation for the granting of eligibility for medical cards for persons aged 70 and over.  However, it should be noted that the gross income limits are reviewed annually and considered in the context of the budget.</p>  <p>  With regard to services for people with Parkinson's disease, the HSE funds a range of community services and supports to enable each individual to achieve their full potential and maximise independence, including living as independently as possible.  Services are provided in a variety of community and residential setting in partnership with service users, their families and carers and  a range of statutory, non-statutory, voluntary and community groups.  Services are provided either directly by the HSE or through a range of voluntary service providers.</p>  <p>  Services are accessed through an application process through the relevant local health office or through referrals from public health nurses or other community based staff.  Resource allocation is determined by the needs of the individual, compliance with prioritisation criteria and the level of resources available.  </p></reply>

Latest data from September 2017 shows that the public-private mix at a system level stands at 82% public for elective in-patient work and at almost 86% for day-case work.  This is consistent with the typical 80/20 split provided for in the consultant contract.</p>  <p>  Arrangements concerning implementation and monitoring of Consultant Contract 2008 including the provisions in relation to private practice are matters for the HSE in the first instance.  Section 20 of the Contract provides a framework for the regulation of private practice, monitoring of the applicable ratio and steps to be taken where it is exceeded.  The responsibility for reporting individual consultant compliance with their contract was formally delegated to the Hospital Groups in 2014.  The main reason for this was to ensure local accountability.  Hospitals know their consultants and the work they deliver.  </p>  <p>  However it seems clear that the arrangements in place are not robust enough to deliver compliance in all circumstances and, as a result, some consultants are able to engage in private practice activity at levels that significantly exceed the permitted levels, or else they may engage in significant levels of off-site private practice, although their contract does not provide for this.  It is incumbent on publicly-funded hospitals to ensure compliance with the terms of the contract, including the provisions in relation to private practice.  For some time my Department has been working closely with the HSE on this.  It wrote to the HSE in July requesting that the HSE satisfy itself that no consultant is engaged, or will be permitted to engage, in private practice beyond the level, if any, provided for in their contract.  </p>  <p>  I am very clear that consultants must deliver their work commitment to the public system.  It is the responsibility of management to make sure these contracts are being enforced and I have asked the HSE to ensure that more robust measures are in place in 2018 to make sure consultants comply with their contractual obligations.  I will require absolute assurances on this point.  </p></reply>

Budget 2018 included an additional allocation of &euro;25 million for the scheme in 2018.  This is in keeping with provisions of the Programme for a Partnership Government.  </p>  <p>  There are a number of options in relation to how any additional funding could be allocated under the ANC scheme.  These options range from allocating the funds as a flat increase across the current payable rates, to various forms of targeting higher payment rates for particular categories of farmers.  The options in this regard are currently being examined.  Any changes to the Scheme on foot of this will require agreement with the EU Commission via a formal amendment of the Rural Development Programme, 2014-2020.</p>  <p>  The 2017 ANC payments commenced on 19 September and to date over &euro;192.6 million has been paid to almost 89,300 farmers.  Payments are continuing on a rolling basis as more farmers satisfy eligibility and stocking rate requirements.</p></reply>

The ICC has confirmed that it has systems in place to underpin the welfare of animals participating in coursing events.

This target was shaped in the context of prospective quota abolition in 2015.  It is likely that Ireland will achieve this Food Harvest 2020 target well ahead of schedule, driven by strong milk production growth in the post quota period. </p>  <p>  Irish dairy farming sits alongside the best in the world in terms of food safety, traceability fundamentals and sustainable farming methods.  Initiatives such as Origin Green and the Sustainable Dairy Assurance Scheme allow Ireland to demonstrably verify the sustainability credentials of the sector.  The focus which such initiatives bring to bear on issues such as animal welfare, and care of the environment, has allowed us to create a competitive advantage in the ongoing development of a strong export-focused agri-food economy, including dairy.  </p>  <p>  Both Food Harvest 2020 and Food Wise 2025 were shaped and informed by a commitment to environmental sustainability.  Food Wise rightly states that "environmental protection and economic competitiveness are equal and complementary: one will not be achieved at the expense of the other".  While obviously challenging, my Department, State agencies and the sector as a whole, are committed to that vision of sustainable growth, and are working to achieve it through implementation of the Food Wise sustainability recommendations and the Rural Development Programme agri-environmental supports.</p></reply>

This is in line with the approach of regulatory authorities throughout the world.  My Department therefore supported the proposal from the European Commission for the re-approval of glyphosate for a period of five years.  The proposal to renew the approval of glyphosate for a five year period received qualified majority support among EU Member States at a meeting to vote on approval of Glyphosate on the 27 November.   </p>  <p>  While the use of glyphosate as a pre-harvest desiccant does not pose a risk to consumers and is proven to be safe, my Department nonetheless disallowed this practice following the extension of the approval of glyphosate by the EU Commission in 2016.  However, there are situations where perennial weeds may be controlled using glyphosate in standing cereal and oilseed crops.  The decision by my Department to allow use in this circumstance is in line with the Commission recommendation forming part of the 2016 approval extension and was informed by the implementation plans of other Member States, </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to ensure that all glyphosate product authorisations in Ireland are in accordance with the recently agreed EU renewal decision.</p></reply>

Ireland is of the view the proposal to prohibit any recreational fishing for sea bass is a step in the wrong direction and would result in loss of valuable data that is gathered under the catch and release arrangements that is needed to support protection and rebuilding of this stock.</p>  <p>  We have already communicated our opposition to this aspect to the Commission proposal on sea bass and will, in consultation with DCCAE, IFI and the Marine Institute, continue to make this case strenuously.</p></reply>

It involves constructing up to 12 customer application suites containing office and laboratory space, so that each company can have an on-campus presence at Moorepark to conduct new-product development etc.</p>  <p>  Developing the National Food Innovation Hub at Moorepark will promote greater collaboration between industry and public research, and deliver a step change in innovation activity in the food industry.  It responds to increasing demand from dairy and food companies to co-locate their own staff at Moorepark to utilise MTL facilities and collaborate with Teagasc research staff, which requires additional laboratory, office and ancillary space.</p>  <p>  The National Food Innovation Hub will be directly linked to both the Teagasc Food Research Centre and MTL to engender close collaboration between the research centres and the companies located on the Moorepark campus. It is envisaged that this unique food cluster will stimulate intensive collaboration between companies and Teagasc researchers to create a platform for innovation, economic growth and job creation.</p>  <p>  In addition, a wide range of modern food processing facilities and equipment is available to food businesses at Moorepark including a pilot plant facility operated by MTL, which contains up-to-date and versatile pilot scale processing equipment.  With regard to developing the wider agri-food sector, Food Wise 2025, the ten year strategy published in July 2015, identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the entire sector and provides an enabling strategy that will allow it to grow and prosper at local, regional and national level.</p>  <p>  It includes more than 350 separate recommendations for actions, spread across cross-cutting themes of sustainability, human capital, market development, innovation and competitiveness.  My Department is committed to a robust implementation process which will drive implementation of the Food Wise recommendations.  The implementation process is driven by a High Level Implementation Committee, which I chair.</p></reply>

The remaining 3 premises fall within the BLUE area and will be covered by commercial operators.  Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at www.broadband.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area.  That procurement process is now at an advanced stage.  The &ldquo;Detailed Solutions&rdquo; submitted by two bidders on 26th September are being evaluated by the NBP specialist team.

It is also a complex area that straddles the responsibilities of many Departments.</p><p>There have been a number of reports on this topic, most notably the Internet Content Governance Advisory Group's report from 2014, and the Law Reform Commission's report on <i>Harmful Communications and Digital Safety</i>published in September 2016.  There have also been a number of initiatives at European level which are of specific relevance to this area, including the European Commission's <i>Code of Conduct on Countering Illegal Hate Speech</i>in 2016 and its more recent Communication in September 2017 titled <i>Tackling Illegal Content Online - Towards an enhanced responsibility of online platforms</i>.</p><p>Given the cross-cutting nature of online safety, I held a meeting on Tuesday 21 November with my colleagues, the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  It was agreed at that meeting that an Open Policy Debate, to be held in early 2018, would be the most appropriate way to progress this matter.</p><p>My Department will lead this initiative in cooperation with the Departments of Justice and Equality and Children and Youth Affairs and other relevant Departments.  My Department will be engaging with the relevant online platforms to ensure their full participation in the initiative, and will also invite parents' groups and other key stakeholders to take part.  A key objective of the Open Policy Debate will be to raise awareness in respect of the actions which are already taking place in this area at an Irish and European level, and identify any gaps which need to be addressed.</p></reply>

The funds will be provided by way of a long term loan advanced from the Exchequer.  The &euro;30m will be used to support the renewal of the post office network (&euro;15m) and the continued fulfilment of a 5 day per week mails delivery service (&euro;15m).  The &euro;30m funding will be subject to stringent conditions and Key Performance Indicators, the delivery of which will be monitored on a monthly basis by the parent Departments and NewERA.  The specifics of these conditions and KPIs are currently being finalised between all parties.</p>  <p>  The funding will be used to underpin the delivery of An Post's Strategic Plan.  The proposed strategy for An Post will involve splitting the company into two distinct business units, An Post Mails and Parcels and An Post Retail.  Improved profitability will be targeted through growth, pricing and cost reduction strategies.  A sustainable, modern and vibrant network for the future, capable of adapting to the changing environment in which it operates, is envisaged.  The Strategic Plan sets out a positive vision for the company, positions it for the digital age and aims to put the company in a position where it can support sustainable jobs in both the mails business and post office network right across the country. </p>  <p>  In relation to the banking issue the Programme for a Partnership Government envisaged that An Post, the Irish League of Credit Unions and other interested stakeholders would be asked to investigate and propose a new model of community banking, such as the Kiwibank model in New Zealand, which could be delivered through the post office network.  The Programme for Government also includes a commitment to investigate the German Sparkassen model for the development of local public banks that operate within well-defined regions.  While last week's Government Decision also formally transferred responsibility for the Post Office Network back to my Department, officials from the Department of Rural and Community Development have been actively working with the Department of Finance to progress this Programme for a Partnership Government commitment and will continue to deal with this matter.  I am advised that a project team was assembled earlier this year involving officials from both of these Departments to consider the matter.  In addition, a public consultation process, seeking views on the community banking model, was launched in early March and ran for four weeks.  A total of 16 replies from a range of stakeholders were received.  Officials from both Departments also met representatives from the International Sparkasse Foundation to learn more about the model.  I understand that the Department of Rural and Community Development and the Department of Finance officials are now finalising their report and this report will be submitted to both Ministers shortly for consideration.</p></reply>

The National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) is responsible for acquiring and managing Ireland's emergency oil stocks.</p>  <p>  The majority of these stocks are held in Ireland, with some stocks held in other EU Member States.  Ireland has entered into bilateral agreements with those Member States within which our stocks are stored, thereby ensuring the repatriation to Ireland of this stock in the event of an oil disruption.</p>  <p>  In the event of an electricity or gas emergency, ESB Networks and Gas Networks Ireland, the respective network operators, have detailed operational plans in place to deal with any disruption to energy supplies.  These emergency plans are regularly reviewed and tested to ensure efficient emergency management in the event of a major disruption to supplies.</p>  <p>  In addition to emergency planning, the transition to renewable energy sources and increasing energy efficiency have key roles in enhancing Ireland's energy security.  The Government has a range of policy measures and schemes in place and under development designed to stimulate further progress in the domestic renewable energy sector.  Existing schemes include the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff (REFIT) schemes for the electricity sector and the Biofuel Obligation Scheme in transport sector, and my Department is also currently developing a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme and a Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) Scheme, designed to encourage further investment in the renewable electricity and heat sectors, respectively.  </p>  <p>  Under Ireland's National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP), a particular focus has been assigned to public service buildings with a target of  a 33% efficiency target.  The most recent SEAI report on energy efficiency achievement by public sector bodies to end 2015 shows almost 21% energy efficiency was achieved &ndash; equating to an avoided energy spend in 2015 of &euro;154m.  More detail, including the energy use breakdowns are available in the Annual Report 2016 on Public Sector Energy Efficiency Performance &ndash; available online.  This year I published the first Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy which provides the framework and impetus to support the public sector to build on progress to date in pursuit of the 33% target.  My Department has been working with other Departments providing leadership and support to them to implement the Strategy.  There are a wide range of measures and initiatives supporting the NEEAP that help improve energy efficiency and reduce energy use, thereby reducing import dependency &ndash; including pilot initiatives introduced this year.  The Schools Pilot Retrofit Project saw 10 schools undertake medium to deep energy retrofit and reducing energy costs by 36% on average.</p></reply>

It is funded by my Department and operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority (SEAI) of Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that individual applications to the Better Energy Homes scheme are an operational matter for SEAI and I can have no role in such matters.  However, a dedicated hot line for queries in relation to the scheme can be reached at 1850 927 000.  In addition, SEAI has a dedicated contact point for Members of the Oireachtas, oireachtas@seai.ie.</p>  <p>  By way of background and context, the rules of the scheme (paragraph 1.4 of the SEAI grant Application Guide) state that a home must be &ldquo;built and occupied before 2006&rdquo;.  The method used to establish this is the installation date of the ESB meter as this confirms when the electricity supply was established.  Initial grant approval can be given online but is still subject to the terms laid out in the Application Guide. SEAI have informed me that the home in question received an ESB meter in 2006 and therefore could not be considered to be "built and occupied before 2006." </p>  <p>  Grants for energy efficiency upgrades are only available to homes built and occupied before 2006.  Houses built and occupied in 2006 or after would have been subject to Building Regulations which require a minimum level of energy efficiency and as such should not require significant upgrades.  Grant funding further works in homes that already possess this level of energy efficiency would not represent a cost-effective use of Exchequer funds.</p></reply>

Under the Road Traffic (Courses of Instruction) (Motorcycles) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 681 of 2011), which provide for IBT, anyone acquiring a learner permit for a motorcycle must first complete IBT before driving a motorcycle in a public place, except on occasions where they are doing so as part of an IBT training course.</p>  <p>  IBT is a requirement under the regulations for anyone acquiring a first learner permit in any of the motorcycle categories after the commencement of the regulations.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific queries raised by the Deputy, there is no requirement to undertake IBT for renewal of a licence.</p>  <p>  When a person who already holds a licence in one of the motorcycle categories becomes a learner in one of the other categories, they are required to take the IBT course for that category.  The rationale for this is that they are now a learner in a different class of machine which requires different handling.</p></reply>

At all times, Tusla&rsquo;s key priority is to ensure that the needs of victims of domestic violence are being met in the best way possible.</p>  <p>  In 2017, I provided Tusla with funding of over &euro;22 million for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services.  This represented an increase of &euro;1.5 million over 2016.  Arising from Budget 2018, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a further increase in funding of  &euro;1.7 million is being provided to Tusla next year for these services.</p>  <p>  Tusla's priority is to achieve the best outcomes for victims of domestic violence from the use of its available resources.  The provision of capital funding for refuges is dealt with by the Housing Authorities and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p>  <p>  Tusla recognises that the provision of emergency refuge accommodation for victims of domestic violence is a core element of the response to domestic violence. Safe Homes provide another service to those affected by domestic violence that may require lower levels of support.  Safe Home accommodation comprises independent housing units with additional safety measures, where victims and families receive intensive support to achieve long term safety and well-being.  </p>  <p>  While there is no domestic violence refuge located in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown area, there are currently four units of emergency Safe Home accommodation provided in the area, which are supported by Tusla.  Victims of domestic violence and their children can also access emergency refuge accommodation in refuges across Dublin or in adjacent areas, such as Bray and Tallaght. At present there are no plans for development of a refuge in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown area. </p>  <p>  Tusla is aware of service pressures in certain areas of the country, and is actively examining needs and appropriate responses through its commissioning process. Tusla will continue to engage with service providers and other stakeholders to review accommodation and to improve provision in areas of need.</p></reply>

This childcare funding may be used towards a place in an afterschool setting.  The subsidies are paid to childcare providers for eligible families.  The rates of subsidy vary according to certain eligibility criteria including social welfare and/or medical card entitlement or participating in a Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection employment programme.  Under the measures which were introduced in September the subsidy rates have been increased significantly, in some instances, as much as 50%. by significantly increasing the subsidy rates for the Community Childcare Subvention and the Training and Employment  Childcare Schemes, in some instance by as much as 50%.While the childcare funding is not specifically for homework clubs, the childcare place may involve homework supports.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that the SCP budget for 124 SCP projects for the school years 2014/15, 2015/16 and 2016/17 was &euro;23.3m per annum.  For the school year 2015-16, the total level of spend for SCP projects on Interventions was &euro;7.4m.  Homework clubs fall within this element of the SCP budget and feature prominently in the returns.  Interventions are split between In-School Interventions, After School Supports and Summer Supports.</p>  <p>  I would like to highlight that significant progress has been made regarding the development of the Affordable Childcare Scheme (ACS).  Once introduced, it will provide childcare supports for children aged from 6 months to 15 years.  The ACS will replace the existing targeted childcare programmes with a single, streamlined and more user-friendly scheme and will include &ldquo;wraparound‟ care for pre-school and school-age children. </p>  <p>  The issue of tax relief should be addressed to the Minister of Finance as tax matters do not fall under the remit of my Department.</p></reply>

The cost to childcare providers is affected by many factors such as rates, rent, labour costs, and insurance amongst other things.</p><p>The cost to parents to access that childcare is decided by childcare providers taking account of these overheads.</p><p>Notwithstanding this, I am committed to ensuring that childcare is affordable, accessible and of a high quality. </p><p>The increase in supports I have provided from this month for the next programme year represents a major step towards accessible affordable quality childcare after decades of neglect and under-investment by successive Governments.</p><p>There are two supports being rolled out under the Community Childcare Scheme.  These include universal non means tested supports of up to &euro;1,040 per year and enhanced supports of up to &euro;7,500 per year to assist families to return to work, and/or training and education.</p><p>I am delighted with the strong response from the sector.  The number of providers signing up to deliver the services increases daily.</p><p>My Department is monitoring the cost of childcare closely and will continue to do so. Initial research from a sampling of services shows that fee increases for full-term services delivering the Community Childcare Scheme (including CCS Plus) rose by &euro;5.26 on average between this programme year (2017/18) and the previous programme year.  By way of comparison the fees across all services delivering full-time childcare rose by &euro;7.26 between 2015/16 and 2016/17 following a number or years of price stagnation.</p><p>  If over the coming weeks or months those percentage increases in fees by service providers were to rise, then I will consider whether actions such as regulation or price capping is required for government schemes.</p><p>  Towards meeting some of the administrative overhead, I announced in recent months payments totalling &euro;3.5m towards 'non contact time' for all childcare providers who register for the enhanced childcare measures under the Community Childcare Scheme.  This, in addition to &euro;14.5m that has been already paid to childcare services so far in 2017 in recognition of administration associated with ECCE and other schemes, provides for &euro;18m in 'non-contact time' payments this year.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work involving approximately 1,400 youth work staff working in youth services and in communities.  I am pleased to confirm that the total youth funding by my Department was &euro;57.4m 2017.  Budget 2018 provided an additional &euro;1.5m in current funding to my Department to support the provision of youth services.  This additional funding will be used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people.  My Department has commenced a process with national organisations and local services to identify service development needs for 2018 and to finalise the 2018 allocations.  Every effort will be made to complete this process as soon as possible. </p><p>In 2017, an amount of &euro;138,788 was allocated for the targeted youth projects and services in County Meath, as follows:<table><tr><th>Projects - Meath</th><th>2017 Grant</th></tr><tr><td>Youth Work Ireland </td><td>&euro;92,842</td></tr><tr><td>Involve - Meath Youth Traveller Project (Navan)</td><td>&euro;45,946</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>&euro;138,788</td></tr></table></p><p>Funding to these staff-led youth services has generally been targeted at areas of disadvantage and not in proportion to the youth population of each county.  My Department this year completed an exercise with Pobal and each Education and Training Board which mapped youth service provision across the State.  This mapping exercise will assist my Department and each Education and Training Board in developing a detailed social demographic profile in terms of both population numbers and deprivation levels and will inform future development and investment in youth services.  My Department is committed to working with Louth and Meath Education and Training Board to identify need and explore ways to address this need where it emerges.</p><p>The Local Youth Club Grant Scheme supports youth work activities at a local level.  These grants are made available to all youth clubs and groups through the local Education and Training Boards.  The scheme, which is open to new entrants, is advertised locally and applications for funding are invited by the Education and Training Boards from local groups in their respective areas.  Each year, some 1,700 local youth clubs are eligible to apply under the scheme.  In 2017, I have provided an additional 10% in funding to the scheme, bringing the total allocation to &euro;1.1715.  Funds are allocated to each of the sixteen Education and Training Boards, in proportion to the most recent census population in 10 to 24 age range available at the time of allocation.</p><p>In addition, I was pleased to approve the establishment the Local Youth Club Equipment Scheme in 2017 which will provide &euro;6.35m. nationally.  The primary focus of this scheme was to assist volunteer led clubs and groups that work with young people in communities throughout the country.  The scheme provides for the purchase of equipment for sport, arts, adventure and other much needed items. Allocations to each of the sixteen Education and Training Boards were distributed in proportion to the number of clubs eligible to apply under the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme.</p><p>Youth Officers of the Education and Training Boards have an important support role to my Department in the administration and coordination of youth services at local level.  Youth Officers engage with local services, on behalf of my Department.  They provide support and advice in matters to do with the application and reporting processes for funding and the implementation of quality standards in services for young people.  In this context, I was pleased to provide funding to Louth and Meath Education and Training Board recruit a second youth officer during 2017.  The allocation to the Education and Training Board for this purpose amounted to &euro;129,640 in 2017.</p></reply>

Accordingly, AIM Level 7 support is a shared resource for the pre-school setting</p>  <p>  A pre-school provider, in partnership with a parent, can apply for AIM Level 7 support - additional capitation.

The 2017/2018 numbers are expected (and on track) to be in line with 2016/2017 uptake.  Further, from September 2018, the ECCE Programme will revert to one single entry point in a given ECCE Programme Year (i.e. September) with eligible children entitled to two full years of ECCE provision.  From September 2018, the number of ECCE enrolments in any given year will be around 114,000.  The fact that 120,000 children were provided with ECCE places in April 2017 suggests that there is sufficient capacity to deal with the lower, be it all year round, number of 114,000.</p>  <p>  As with the previous expansion of the ECCE programme, my Department is working closing with all of the City and County Childcare Committees to monitor a range of scheme related issues, including capacity.  In the event that capacity issues emerge, we will seek to address these accordingly.</p>  <p>  Recent media statements on this issue cited the total number of children aged 3-5 in the population and concluded that there was a capacity issue for ECCE.  This did not account for the many 4 and 5 year olds already in primary school, nor those who opt for only one year of the ECCE Programme.  The conclusion that a capacity issue exists is therefore inaccurate.</p>  <p>  One of the measures I took in 2016, and again in 2017, was to support capital development.  My Department provided &euro;8.4million for its 2017 Early Years Capital funding programme and &euro;4m for the 2016 Early Years Capital Funding Programme.  The 2017 funding was made available to providers under three strands, the largest of which (&euro;4.2m) went towards enabling services to provide additional childcare places.  I will be announcing details of the 2018 Capital scheme in the very near future.</p></reply>

I will respond to the Committee by year end.</p>  <p>  We are in the enviable situation here in Ireland that 92% of children living in care are in foster care placements.  This compares very favourably to foster care services overseas.  The most recent figures for England show that 74% of children in care were in a foster placement and the figure for Northern Ireland is 80%, for children who were in care for at least 12 months.  The vast majority of foster placements are stable, loving, long-term arrangements, where children are nurtured and supported.</p>  <p>  By the end of last year, HIQA had inspected all foster care services.  The findings showed that, in general, children in foster care were safe, happy, in good health and attending school.  For 2017, HIQA focussed on specific standards in more detail.  These relate to the checks and balances that Foster Care Committees, and senior managers, should have in place to support a safe and effective service.  The child&rsquo;s experience of the service was not assessed during 2017.  </p>  <p>  This year's inspections show delays in completing formal assessments of relative carers, and the lack of regular reviews of all foster carers.  The need for Garda vetting for children over 16 and young adults in the household was also highlighted.  There were weaknesses in how some Foster Care Committees are informed about complaints and allegations against foster carers.  I am pleased to note that HIQA accepted Tusla&rsquo;s action plans in relation to the inspection reports, and I am monitoring improvements being made.  </p>  <p>  The clear themes coming through are of the need for better oversight, recruitment of staff, the replenishment and broadening of foster care panels, improved supports and supervision of foster carers.  </p>  <p>  I am asking Tusla to provide me with a national strategy for the recruitment of foster carers as part of its 2018 business plan, and to build on and improve the assessment and support for foster carers.  I have secured additional funding of over &euro;40 million for Tusla to ensure that the business plan can be achieved.</p></reply>

The new Affordable Childcare Scheme (ACS) will provide financial support for parents towards the cost of childcare.  This new Scheme will replace the existing targeted childcare programmes with a single, streamlined and more user-friendly scheme and will include &ldquo;wraparound‟ care for pre-school and school-age children.  The ambition of this project is immense; its scope matched only in size by its complexity.  This scheme aims to reduce poverty, facilitate labour activation, improve outcomes for children and tangibly reduce the cost of childcare for tens of thousands of families. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently putting in place the legal and technical infrastructures to underpin the Affordable Childcare Scheme.  I am delighted to report that draft legislation to give our new approach a legal backbone is well advanced and publication of a draft Bill is expected before the end of the year. </p>  <p>  The building of a state of the art IT system to make subsidised childcare more accessible is also being advanced.  The IT development is subject to scrutiny by a peer review group (PRG) at the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO).  The project has passed the first stage of the peer review process (reviewing the Business Case) and is close to completing the second stage (Request for Tender Stage).  </p>  <p>  Whilst delivering the scheme as soon as possible remains a priority, I believe that it is prudent to ensure we get the new systems right, so that they operate smoothly for everyone.  Accordingly, in progressing our work, we strive to meet the highest standards available and avoid mistakes made on previous government IT projects. In doing so, we have committed ourselves to extensive consultation and peer review processes. </p>  <p>  While intensive work is underway, the project is heavily dependent on timelines beyond its immediate control, such as the advancement of legislation through the Oireachtas.  In particular, the timeframe is dependent upon ICT development.  Once we have completed the Request for Tender element of the project and have the successful developer in place, we will be able to confirm and communicate a timeline for the full introduction of the scheme.  Until then, I am not in a position to make a commitment on the exact launch date of ACS.  </p>  <p>  We are well on our way to introducing the Affordable Childcare Scheme.  In the meantime, the families of 64,000 children or 91% of the children eligible for the measures introduced by my Department are already benefiting from financial support for their childcare, on a par with what will be delivered under the new scheme.  This number is increasing daily.</p></reply>

In addition, foster carers can make use of the Tusla, the Child and Family Agency feedback and complaints mechanism, "Tell Us".  All foster carers may also submit a complaint to the Office of the Ombudsman if these mechanisms prove unsatisfactory.</p>  <p>  A complaints system for children in care is part of the National Standards for Foster Care.  Children coming into care are informed of how to make a complaint,  verbally or in writing, and of  their right to do so.  This can be done directly with their social worker, or with the team leader or principal social worker.  Alternatively, children in care can also use Tusla's "Tell us" process or make their complaint known to the Ombudsman for Children.  The child's social worker, foster carers or advocacy groups often act on the child's behalf and provide support in making their views known.  For example, Empowering People in Care (EPIC) is an independent organisation which works with and advocates on behalf of children and young people in care. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Irish Foster Care Association (IFCA) independently advocates on behalf of foster carers, providing support and mediation services as needed in the event of differences that may arise.  This includes a support helpline, funded by Tusla, which is available to all foster carers.</p></reply>

From September 2018 all children will be entitled to a full two years of the ECCE scheme or free preschool, as it has become known.  This further enhancement delivers fully on a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that is good for children, families and Early Years providers.  I also announced investment to continue the childcare affordability measures introduced last September that are already benefitting 45,000 children, with 24,000 of these registered so far for the universal under-3 scheme, and 21,000 registered for the targeted schemes.  The additional funding will ensure that the door remains open for further children and families to register and benefit from these subsidies throughout 2018.  I have also recently commissioned an Independent Review of the Cost of delivering Quality Childcare which will assist me in seeking more investment  for childcare over the coming years. </p><p>The introduction in September 2017 of the universal payment for under 3s (and for children who are aged 3 but do not yet qualify for entry into the ECCE Programme) addresses the issue where children under 3 years of age were the only age group of pre-school children for which no other universal State support for care and education was previously available, given that children aged 3 and older can participate in the ECCE Programme or school.  The universal payment is a contribution towards the cost of childcare for under 3 years of age, given that many parents require full-time childcare for this age group.  The Affordable Childcare Scheme, which will replace the existing childcare schemes, will provide for a continuation of this universal payment for childcare.  In addition, it will for the first time provide higher payments for targeted subsidies for children under 3 years of age than for older age groups ( and the highest subsidies for children under 1 year old), to reflect the higher cost of provision for this age group, given the regulatory requirements on adult-child ratios.  Let me also add that the issues facing childcare providers in the provision of services to under 3 years of age is one also being considered by a subgroup of the Early Years Forum.</p><p>As part of Budget 2018, I have also secured a 5.7% increase in funding for Tusla in 2018 which amounts &euro;40.6m.  The extra funding will be used to progress a number of key priorities including the introduction of mandatory reporting under <i>Children First</i>, addressing gaps in out of hours services and further investing in Family Resource Centres that deliver services to families in disadvantaged areas across the country.  The additional investment will allow Tusla to recruit over 300 staff to respond to areas of identified risk and to meet increased demand for services.  This includes resources for responding to expected increases in referrals following the introduction of mandatory reporting; management of unallocated cases and developing aftercare services.

Tusla have provided a breakdown of the referrals they have received in the years 2014, 2015 and 2016, which is included in tabular format.  In addition I include data as published on Tusla's website for quarter 1 2017.  It should be noted that multiple referrals may be received that relate to the same child.  The Deputy will notice from the table below that the vast majority of referrals are for emotional abuse and neglect, possibly indicating abuse within the family setting.</p><p>Each referral received by Tusla is assessed and dealt with on an individual basis by the relevant social work team.  Approximately 60% of referrals to Tusla are of a child welfare concern with the remaining 40% related to child protection concerns.  Tusla's policy is to refer child welfare referrals to relevant family and community support services. At any stage, if a determination is made that there is abuse, whether physical, emotional, sexual or neglect, from which there is an ongoing risk of harm, the child protection pathway is followed. In a minority of cases this may lead to the child being placed on the Child Protection Notification System (CPNS) or the child being received into care.</p><p>Upon receipt of an appropriate referral, the Duty Social Worker carries out preliminary enquiries, including checking to see if the case is already open or known to child protection services, clarifies the nature of the concern, contacts key professionals, e.g. public health nurses or teachers, and records the details of the child and family.  It is possible that duplicate referrals have been received, or that the child involved is already receiving a service from Tusla, or that the child needs another service such as, for instance, the HSE's Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service.  If the threshold for a child protection assessment or response is not met but a child has an unmet need then this may be addressed as a child welfare concern by local family and community support services, organised through the Local Area Pathways team.</p><p>A referral becomes an open case (one per child) when it meets the criteria to need an initial assessment. Based on the information available, the referral will be given a priority level of high, medium and low.  Open cases also include children receiving a social work service or who have been received into care.</p><p>The additional &euro;40m funding which has been secured for Tusla in the 2018 Budget will support the continued implementation of child protection services.  Tusla aims to provide a proportionate and timely response to children at risk or in need.  Where appropriate, responsibility and control will be shared with families and communities by developing joint solutions and through inter-agency collaboration.</p><p><b>Child Protection referrals made to Tusla by category 2014 - 2016</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>Q1 2017</th></tr><tr><td>All Referrals</td><td>43,630</td><td>43,596</td><td>47,399</td><td>13,344</td></tr><tr><td>Child Protection Referrals</td><td>18,676</td><td>18,235</td><td>19,087</td><td>5,458</td></tr><tr><td>By Category:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Physical Abuse</td><td>4,066</td><td>3,991</td><td>4,450</td><td>1,394</td></tr><tr><td>Emotional Abuse</td><td>6,233</td><td>6,535</td><td>6,870</td><td>1,896</td></tr><tr><td>Sexual Abuse</td><td>3,114</td><td>2,940</td><td>3,042</td><td>921</td></tr><tr><td>Neglect</td><td>5,263</td><td>4,769</td><td>4,724</td><td>1,247</td></tr></table></p></reply>

These provide for the welfare of the child, the care practices, care records, accommodation and safety precautions. Children, depending on their identified needs, may be placed by their social worker in foster care either with relatives or general foster carers, in residential care or other placement types. The majority of children are placed in long term stable placements and currently over 92% of children are placed in foster care. A key part of the social worker role is to ensure the quality and safety of the child's placement, and to meet with the child on a one to one basis on all visits. There are safeguards surrounding each child care placement, whether foster or residential care and placements are supervised by a professionally qualified social worker.</p>  <p>  All foster care services and statutory residential centres are subject to inspection by the Health Information Quality Authority (HIQA) and private and voluntary residential centres are inspected by Tusla against National Standards. These inspection reports of children's residential centres, fostering services and child protection services are also reviewed and analysed by my officials. The overview of these reports provides me with a level of assurance on the overall capacity of Tusla to identify and provide services to families and children.</p>  <p>  Within its national office, Tusla, has a dedicated Quality Assurance Team. This team produces monthly, quarterly and annual reports in respect of Tusla's functions, including detailed reporting on child safety and protection services. Tusla also provides me with information on children in care, their placement type, care status and allocation of social workers. Within my Department there is a Unit which scrutinises these reports and briefs me and senior officials on issues of note. The reports also provide statistical evidence of improvements to child welfare and protection services and highlights challenges and areas where further improvement is required, such as the recruitment of additional social workers.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department meet Tusla management on a regular basis to review the level of service provision, including areas in need of improvement. I myself meet on a regular basis with the CEO and Chair of Tusla. Contact is maintained with non-governmental bodies on issues within the sector, including, for example, the Children's Rights Alliance, EPIC and the Irish Foster are Association.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should also be aware that children in care have access to independent advocacy supports, such as the organisation Empowering People in Care (EPIC). Children in care also have access to the complaints mechanism in Tulsa, and may make complaints, or be assisted to make complaints, about their care to the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.</p></reply>

Once the child is in a place of relative safety, Tusla social workers can carry out a fuller assessment and put in place steps to support the child to reunify with their family, to put in place a child protection plan, or to receive the child into care.  Where a child has a child protection plan they are listed as active on the Child Protection Notification System.  This information helps social workers determine if a child who comes to their attention is already considered at risk.  If sufficient progress is not being made in the plan, a child may be received into care, on a voluntary basis or by applying to the courts for a care order.</p>  <p>  Tusla, holds the statutory responsibility for child welfare and protection, and is the appropriate body to receive reports of concerns relating to children at risk. Each referral received by the Agency is assessed and dealt with on an individual basis by the relevant social work team. Every report of concern for the safety and well-being of a child is assessed and required action is identified. </p>  <p>  I have been very pleased to have secured an additional &euro;40m for Tusla in Budget 2018 - which will allow for the continued recruitment and expansion of Tusla social work, social care, family support and business support staff.  In addition to recruitment, I glad to say that this budget has also provided for enhancing early intervention pathways, as it includes funding for the establishment of an additional 11 Family Resource Centres.</p></reply>

Under the Child Care Act, 1991 and the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, Tusla has a duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care or protection. The Agency is obliged to provide care for these children for as long as their welfare requires it. Tusla operates under the principle of equity of care. </p>  <p>  Children First National Guidance (2011) gives advice for notifying Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, of situations where abuse is suspected.  A range of professionals including teachers, nurses, early years educators, Garda&iacute; and other health professionals, who see children regularly, are in a good position to identify children at risk. Where someone has reasonable grounds for suspecting a child is being, or has been, abused, they are expected to immediately contact Tusla. </p>  <p>  The Children First Act, 2015 places a statutory obligation on key professionals (mandated persons) to report concerns of harm above a defined threshold to Tusla without delay. These provisions will be commenced on December 11th, this year. </p>  <p>  If a child is taken into care, their needs are given priority. A social worker is assigned to a child placed in State care and has a duty to prepare and regularly review the care plan for the child. Intrinsic to this process is ensuring that the wishes of the child are listened to, and if appropriate, Tusla may assist them in establishing residency.</p>  <p>  Unaccompanied asylum seeking children are placed in care and have their needs assessed, and are allocated a social worker.  </p>  <p>  Children who, with their parents, live in Direct Provision, are provided with welfare supports as required. Tusla have seconded an experienced social worker to the Department of Justice and Equality to liaise directly between Direct Provision and Tusla services.</p></reply>

CIB has taken this operational decision following years of analysis of options and a detailed consultation period with all stakeholders on the need for a more streamlined governance model.  The changes are being made at local company board level only.  The valuable work carried out by employees and volunteers working in CIS services and employees of MABS services will continue as heretofore. </p>  <p>  The Citizens Information Board is committed to the principle of local involvement in service delivery and has already held discussions on proposed new Local Advisory Committees.  CIB is committed to giving this matter further attention, through the Implementation Group&rsquo;s work, to devise a strategy to embed an effective and supportive network to ensure that the long standing, helpful, local linkages are not lost under the new governance arrangements.  </p>  <p>  With regard to membership of the new regional boards, CIB has committed to apply modern best practice and fairness in its selection and recruiting methods, in line with best practice guidelines developed by the Public Appointments Service.  Existing Board members of local CIS and MABS companies will also have an opportunity to express their interest in joining the new regional boards.</p>  <p>  I am informed that Kerry MABS is included in the initial phase of the restructuring process in the South Munster region.  I am also informed that as the restructuring process progresses, all CIS and MABS services will be requested to commence gathering the information required to facilitate what is known as the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employees) (TUPE) process for employees and the transfer of business assets/liabilities.  </p>  <p>  It is the intention of CIB to provide information and support through the transitional period, and in this regard, information sessions are being organised for Chairpersons of local services, providing an opportunity for Chairpersons to seek clarifications on the process of transfer to the new regional companies and wind up of the existing companies.  </p>  <p>  While cost savings was never a key aim of the restructuring of governance arrangements by the CIB, the transition will not be without cost to the Exchequer.  It is nonetheless necessary in order to achieve the appropriate standards of accountability expected from 100% publicly funded services.  The aim of the change remains to improve existing governance arrangements and to optimise the benefits from operating a more modern and streamlined citizen-focused delivery model.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The signing ceremony was held at the EU Social Summit for Fair Jobs and Growth in Gothenburg which I attended with the Taoiseach on 17 November.</p>  <p>  The European Pillar of Rights is a political commitment at EU level to ensuring social rights keep pace with the fiscal and monetary progress made under Economic and Monetary Union.  The Government is fully supportive of the principles set out in the Interinstitutional Proclamation.</p>  <p>  The Proclamation is a political, rather than a legal document.  The European Commission shares this view, referring to the Proclamation as a &lsquo;compass&rsquo; for future actions rather than a legally binding instrument.</p>  <p>  The Interinstitutional Proclamation is an important political commitment which provides guidance to Member States and the EU institutions.  Its aim is to ensure that we have a social system which is robust in the face of 21st century challenges such as globalisation and the changing nature of work.  We look forward to advancing this ambitious agenda.</p></reply>

The programme helps break the cycle of unemployment and improve a person&rsquo;s chances of returning to the labour market. </p>  <p>  CE sponsors advertise their vacancies free-of-charge on my Department's JobsIreland website - www.jobsireland.ie.  Posting vacancies is a relatively simple process and a dedicated video tutorial is available on the site to assist sponsors.  Anyone requiring further assistance can contact my Department&rsquo;s National Contact Centre by phone at Lo Call 1890 800 024 or (01) 248 1398, or by email at jobsireland@welfare.ie. </p>  <p>  Sponsors can also promote their scheme vacancies within their local communities.  At a local level, various methods of promoting CE have been arranged between my Department and local CE schemes, including targeting potentially eligible jobseekers to attend a CE job-fare, where details of CE vacancies and employment opportunities are provided. </p>  <p>  There have been no recent changes to the recruitment and applications procedures for CE schemes.  Jobseekers receive information about all available employment support options, including CE, through the Intreo Service.  Jobseekers receive one-to-one support from a case officer and all available and suitable options are discussed.  However, jobseekers can also view CE vacancies online on www.jobsireland.ie.  Eligible candidates are then referred to sponsors by case officers in their local Intreo Centres.</p>  <p>  CE also supports participants in training and development.  Training is based on the personal and occupational needs of each individual and includes providing support to address any literacy difficulties.  A tailored Individual Learning Plan (ILP) is agreed between the CE supervisor and the participant.  The ILP tracks, records and reports on all planned training interventions and achievements in line with the participant&rsquo;s career plan and employment goals. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners (Revenue) allocated the husband&rsquo;s Revenue and Social Insurance (RSI) number to the wife and appended a &ldquo;W&rdquo; to the end so that they could be separately identified but linked for joint assessment.  Following the introduction of PRSI in 1979 Revenue collected social insurance on behalf of this Department and made the necessary transfers using this &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; number where required. </p>  <p>  Following legislative provision being made in the Finance Act 1993 for either spouse to be the assessable spouse, the practice of allocating &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; numbers ceased and from then on, all persons were allocated individual, unique numbers.  However, it was decided not to ask all individuals with &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; numbers to change them until there was an actual need to do so.</p>  <p>  The Personal Public Service Number (PPS Number) was introduced in the Social Welfare Act 1998, replacing the RSI Number, and my Department was given legislative responsibility for allocating and managing these new numbers.  In practice the RSI numbers in existence were retained and became PPS Numbers, including &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; numbers.  </p>  <p>  As a result of the changes over 20 years ago, the vast majority of individuals now have their own non &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; PPS Numbers. </p>  <p>  While there is no legal requirement for a widow to obtain a new PPS Number on the death of her husband, the Revenue position is that while it continues to support &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; numbers for the limited range of non-assessable spouse options, its systems now require a non &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; number where they are dealing with an individual in his or her own right.  Revenue has also stated that accommodating &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; numbers for tax purposes would require significant ICT development across a range of Revenue systems.  Accordingly, Revenue asks people with &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; numbers to change them once they need to engage with them on taxation matters.</p>  <p>  In addition, as a husband&rsquo;s PPS Number may be extracted from his wife&rsquo;s &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; number, there are also Data Protection concerns over the continuing use of such numbers.</p>  <p>  The process of replacing a &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; number is relatively straightforward.  The process can only be undertaken by staff of the Client Identity Section (CIS) in my Department who can be contacted by phone or by email.  Accordingly, there is no need for the client to turn up at any office or to queue for service.  As part of the process, CIS verifies the identity of the individual, secures their consent, purges the existing number and replaces it with either a new number or one that the individual may have had prior to marriage.  In addition, all pre-existing records relating to that individual are transferred over to the new number.  Once completed, a letter advising of the new number is issued to the individual at their home address.  While every effort is made to complete this work within 24 hours, it can occasionally take up to 5 working days because of volumes.  However, urgent cases are always expedited.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

My Department has responsibility for the associated social welfare payment of maternity benefit which is provided for in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended).  In 2017 it is estimated that my Department will spend approximately &euro;266 million on maternity benefit, in respect of an average of 22,000 recipients per week. </p>  <p>  On 3 October 2017 I, together with my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality, Charlie Flanagan T.D., announced increased maternity leave and maternity benefit for mothers whose babies are born prematurely.</p>  <p>  Under the new arrangements, in addition to the current 26 weeks of paid maternity leave a mother will be entitled to an additional period of maternity leave and benefit where her baby is born prematurely, where she meets the ordinary qualifying criteria for the schemes.  The additional period will commence at the end of the standard 26 week period of paid maternity leave.  The extended period to be added will be the number of weeks from the baby's actual date of birth up to two weeks before the expected date of confinement which would have been the 37th week of the pregnancy, at which point the current entitlement to 26 weeks leave and benefit would normally begin.</p>  <p>  The Government decided that the additional maternity leave and benefit would be available for mothers of premature babies born on or after 1 October 2017.  There are no plans to extend the new arrangements to mothers of premature babies born before that date.</p></reply>

Strict timeframes apply to the issuing of acknowledgements and responses and these are constantly monitored to ensure adherence.  </p><p>The contract requires the JobPath provider to respond to all complaints in the first instance.  To this end each provider has a comprehensive Complaints Procedure which contains successive levels of escalation, which can be availed of should the client feel the matter has not been adequately addressed.  This ensures that complaints are dealt with as comprehensively as possible and at the appropriate level of authority.  In the event that a customer has availed of this procedure but remains dissatisfied with the response to their complaint, they may request my Department to carry out a full review of the file and a response and / or recommendations will be issued.  Customers may also refer a complaint to the Office of the Ombudsman for review once they have exhausted the complaints process but remain dissatisfied.  </p><p>In the JobPath context, a complaint is defined as &ldquo;an expression of dissatisfaction, measurable by reference to service standards, and requiring a response.&rdquo;  Issues covered by the complaint process may include delays, mistakes and poor customer service and also complaints made under Sections 25, 26, 27 and 28 of the Disability Act, 2005.  </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

Carers are entitled to an extra half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance if they care for more than one person and a respite care grant for each care recipient.  </p>  <p>  The maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance payable to a carer who provides full-time care and attention to one person is &euro;209 weekly.  If a carer is caring for a second person and is assessed with no means, they could qualify for a 150 per cent carer&rsquo;s allowance which is payable at the weekly rate of &euro;313.50.  </p>  <p>  The financial supports available to carers in Ireland are among the highest rates of income support in Europe.  Furthermore, the means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance is one of the least onerous in the range of social protection payments provided by my Department.  Moreover, carers can continue to receive carer&rsquo;s allowance at half the weekly rate if they are in receipt of another weekly social welfare payment.  They are also entitled to free travel and if residing with the care recipient may also receive the household benefits package.  </p>  <p>  Considerable improvements have been introduced for carers in recent years.  In Budget 2016, the carer&rsquo;s support grant, which is payable without a means test, was increased to &euro;1,700.  In addition to this, the period when carer&rsquo;s allowance can be paid following the death of a care recipient was extended from 6 to 12 weeks.  Budget 2017 also introduced a measure that extends payment of carer&rsquo;s allowance for 12 weeks where the care recipient enters permanent residential care.  Most recently, Budget 2018 provides for a &euro;5 increase in the weekly carer&rsquo;s allowance rate.  This follows on from a &euro;5 per week increase in Budget 2017 and a &euro;3 per week increase in Budget 2016.  From the beginning of the week commencing 26 March 2018, the maximum payment rate for carer&rsquo;s allowance will be &euro;214 per week.  </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am very aware of the key role carers play in society and I will continue to keep the range of supports available to carers under review.  However, any improvements or additions to these supports can only be considered in a budgetary context  and in the light of available financial resources.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  </p>  <p>  One of the conditions of the State pension contributory is that a person needs a minimum of 520 weekly contributions (i.e. 10 years) paid since entering insurable employment, i.e. between their 16th and 66th birthdays.  If a person does not have this minimum number of contributions paid, they will not generally have an entitlement to this particular pension, either at a full or reduced rate.  </p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement.  Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances.  </p>  <p>  Voluntary Contributions are designed to facilitate employees / self-employed persons who are no longer subject to compulsory PRSI, to pay contributions directly to the Department on a voluntary basis, in order to protect their future State Pension Contributory (SPC), Widow(er)&rsquo;s Contributory Pension and Guardian&rsquo;s Contributory Payment entitlements.  </p>  <p>  There are a number of qualifying conditions attached to the Voluntary Contribution Scheme. In order to become a Voluntary Contributor a person must (i) have a minimum of 260 to 520 Contributions paid &ndash; dependant on the period he or she wishes to pay for, and (ii) apply within 60 months of the end of the year in which he or she last paid or was credited a contribution.  </p>  <p>  My Department will take into account all relevant contributions, paid or credited, as well as the time frame involved, when making a decision on an individual&rsquo;s level of entitlement to the State Pension (contributory).  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

As such, the changes did not preclude any pensioner who would have qualified for a full State Pension (contributory) pre-2012 from qualifying for a full rate after September 2012.  </p>  <p>  The current rate bands were introduced from September 2012, replacing previous rates introduced in 2000.  The rate bands prior to 2000 were less generous, and the improved rate bands introduced in 2000 were a feature of the economic and political environment at that time.  The economic crash changed the focus and while other payments were reduced as a result, the core rates of the pension, which many pensioners were solely dependent on, were maintained. Instead, the rates for people who both had additional means and lesser PRSI contribution records were reduced.  </p>  <p>  The 2012 rate bands more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place between 2000 and 2012.  The current rate bands still provide pensions to people which are better than proportionate with their level of contribution.  A person with only 20 years of contributions over nearly 50 years will still get an 85% pension, which compares favourably with contributory pensions in other EEU countries.  </p>  <p>  It is estimated that to revert to the previous bands from January 2018 would result in an annual cost of well over &euro;70 million in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10 to &euro;12 million extra each following year.  Awarding a maximum rate contributory pension to everyone who had spent time outside the PAYE system, regardless of their means, would be even more expensive and it is estimated this would cost well over &euro;1 billion per annum.  </p>  <p>  My Department is examining in depth various options that would provide some relief to those who would have a higher contributory pension, had the rate-bands not been amended in 2012.  If there are equitable changes that target such relief to those who were affected by the yearly average system, particularly those who had homemaking periods prior to the introduction of the Homemakers scheme, I will ask Government to consider if and how these might be financed.  </p>  <p>  It is intended to introduce a total contributions approach for new pensioners from 2020.  This will make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  It will also have significant homemakers provisions that will assist those pensioners who spent significant periods caring for their children, or adults with a caring need.  </p>  <p>  The main aim of Government policy on pensions is to make sure that pensions are affordable, sustainable and keep their value in the coming years.  The reforms that are planned will result in a more inclusive and fairer pension system for all citizens.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

The contract was awarded to Biometric Card Services (BCS), an Irish registered company based in Co. Wicklow.  It was a condition of award of the contract that all data and related services provision and operation be provided on-site in Ireland and subject to the jurisdiction of the Irish Courts.  As a consequence, the cards are produced in Ireland.  A number of changes have been made to the contract since its award, primarily to deal with the implementation of new and additional security measures, to facilitate the implementation of new Free Travel software specification, and to allow extension of the contract period to the end of 2017.</p><p>To date, some 2.98 million cards have been issued.  As the initiative is demand-led, it isn&rsquo;t possible to predict precisely when three million PSCs will be issued.  My Department is considering a number of options for continued production of the PSC when the current contract expires at the end of this year.</p><p>The following table sets out, as requested, the costs to date, both overall and in 2017, of the Public Services Card project.  <table><tr><th>Costs</th><th>to date</th><th>2017 only</th></tr><tr><td>Production, personalisation and distribution of PSCs</td><td>&euro;20,882,292.41</td><td>&euro;3,722,187.09</td></tr><tr><td>Helpdesk *</td><td>&euro;2,615,546.71</td><td>&euro;86,990.24</td></tr><tr><td>Staff (estimated)**</td><td>&euro;28,789,151.58</td><td>&euro;5,573,603.81</td></tr><tr><td>Other***</td><td>&euro;2,297,150.65</td><td>&euro;95,415.12</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>&euro;54,584,141.35</td><td>&euro;9,478,196.26</td></tr></table></p><p><b><i>Notes:</i></b></p><p>*Helpdesk costs include all calls including those related to activation, lost or stolen cards or general queries.  They are charged on the basis of call-time and are not differentiated as between the nature of the call received.  </p><p>**Currently the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has sanctioned a total of up to 218 posts for the Project.  These posts include both temporary and permanent roles, and the numbers and locations of deployed staff are kept under constant review to ensure the best use of resources.  As of end-October 2017 there were 51.96 full-time-equivalent permanent staff (FTE) and 164 Temporary Clerical Officers working on the PSC Project.  These figures include four full-time IT staff assigned to the PSC project.  </p><p>***Other costs include provision of external expertise in relation to related technical issues as well as development and deployment of associated software on internal IT systems.  </p><p>My Department does not have a figure for the cost of postage of invites to clients for SAFE registration as, for budget purposes, postage costs are not differentiated across different business processes.  </p><p>Currently, the PSC has a maximum validity period of up to 7 years.  At the time the Project was being launched, the durability of similar cards, e.g., bank cards, in use at the time was three to five years.  However, card technology was changing and a new, more durable form of card could be utilised.  Following discussion and advice from the Project&rsquo;s technical advisors, my Department settled on 7 years as a preliminary validity period for the bulk of initial cards.

This standard is known as the Standard Authentication Framework environment &ndash; or SAFE.  A person who successfully completes a SAFE 2 registration process (i.e. verifies their identity to a substantial level of assurance) may be issued with a Public Services Card (PSC).  </p><p>In the case of my Department&rsquo;s own services, the legislation governing identity verification for existing claimants is set out in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended, <i>viz.</i></p><p>- Section 247C(1) of the Act provides that the Minister may require any person receiving a benefit to satisfy the Minister as to his or her identity;</p><p>- Section 247C(2) of the Act specifies the consequences of failure to satisfy the Minister in relation to identity as required, specifically that a person shall be disqualified from receiving a benefit; and</p><p>- Section 247C(3) of the Act specifies the manner in which the Minister may be so satisfied; in effect, this Section describes the process for registering a person&rsquo;s identity - this is the SAFE 2 Process.  </p><p>This legislation requires a person to satisfy the Minister as to their identity and allows disqualification from receipt of a benefit in the event that it is not done.  It is not possible for a person to satisfy the Minister as to his or her identity without being SAFE2 registered.  </p><p>My Department does not collect data on the number of individuals who currently, or who, at any point in time, have had a payment stopped by reason of failing to complete the SAFE 2 registration process.  This data is fluid in nature.  </p><p>For example, a considerable number of customers who have a payment or entitlement suspended or stopped subsequently decide to complete the SAFE2 process and have their payment or entitlement reinstated.  It should be noted that of the remainder, a considerable portion do not make any contact with the Department.  The decision to stop a payment is never made lightly.  However, where a customer does not satisfy the Minister in relation to identity, in accordance with the legislative requirements, a payment can be disqualified.  In advance of any such disqualification, the Department makes every effort to engage with the customer to explain the legislative basis for the SAFE2 registration process and the consequences of potential disqualification.  Where a payment has been disqualified and the customer subsequently successfully completes the SAFE2 registration process, their payment will be reinstated by my Department (assuming they continue to meet all qualifying criteria for that payment) from the date of compliance.  </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

The service commenced operations in mid-2015, and reached full State-wide delivery of the service in July 2016.  </p>  <p>  Jobseekers who are selected for JobPath, are invited to attend an initial information session at which the jobseekers&rsquo; rights and responsibilities are explained.  Participants on JobPath receive intensive individual support to help them address barriers to employment.  Each participant is assigned a personal advisor who assesses their skills, experience, challenges and work goals and agrees a &ldquo;personal progression plan&rdquo; that includes a schedule of activities, actions and job focused targets.  Participants are provided with a range of development supports and may also be referred for further education and training opportunities.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the rules and processes for the application of a reduced rate of payment are the same across all of the Department&rsquo;s activation services, whether they are delivered directly by the Department&rsquo;s own Intreo service or through its contracted services such as the Local Employment Service or JobPath service.  Only a departmental official can make a decision to apply a reduced rate of payment.  The process with regard to such decisions includes written/verbal warnings from a departmental official and an opportunity for the jobseeker to re-engage with the service prior to the application of a reduced payment rate.  </p>  <p>  Up to the end of October 2017 approximately 9,000, or 6.9% of the total 129,000 clients who engaged with the JobPath service between July 2015 and October 2017 have had, at some point, a penalty rate applied to their payment: some of these clients may have had the penalty rate applied after finishing their engagement period with the JobPath service, so the actual numbers who have had a penalty rate applied while with the JobPath service will be lower.  </p>  <p>  Data specifically related to the application of reduced payments for clients refusing to sign a personal progression plan is not available.  It is important to note that the factors to be considered in applying a penalty rate precludes me from making a definitive statement that the sole context involved would have been non engagement with JobPath.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

The Department and An Post agreed a protocol in 2014 governing the forms of identification which claimants, or their agents, must produce in order to collect payments.  There has been no change in this agreed protocol or in the forms of identification required of claimants to collect their social welfare payments.  </p><p>Social welfare claimants must present one of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payment cards when collecting payments.  These cards are; the Public Services Card, the Social Services Card and the Temporary Payment Card.  </p><p>The Public Services Card, or PSC, is an identity token, issued by the Department, following a face to face registration process which involves the capture of an individual&rsquo;s photograph and signature plus the verification of identity data already held by the Department.  No other identification is required of clients when a PSC is presented.  </p><p>The Social Services Card, or SSC, is a payment token, used to collect DSP payments.  The token is issued to claimants who have not yet been registered for and received a PSC.  If presenting for payment with an SSC, a person must also provide additional identification.  Ideally this should photographic.  Acceptable forms of photographic ID are: </p><p>- Current Passport (For Irish and UK passport holders, a passport which has expired within the previous 12 months is acceptable) </p><p>- Current (in date) National ID card for EU citizens other than Ireland or UK </p><p>- Current (in date) Irish or UK Drivers Licence or Irish Driver Learner Permit </p><p>- Current (in date) Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) Card </p><p>- Emergency Photo ID produced by the Department.  </p><p>If a claimant holds an SSC but does not have appropriate photographic ID then the following documents are acceptable: </p><p>- Medical Card and Proof of Address </p><p>- Bank Card and Proof of Address </p><p>- Recent work ID and Proof of Address</p><p>- Recent communication from Public Service body or Local Authority and Proof of Address.  </p><p>If a customer holds an SSC but is unable to present either acceptable Photo ID or alternative ID, An Post may make payment based on the personal validation of the Post Office staff on the basis that the customer is known to them by sight and name.  </p><p>Finally the Temporary Payment Card is a paper document issued by the Department for short-term use by a claimant pending receipt of a PSC or SSC. A temporary payment card is valid for a specific period.  An Post may not accept the Temporary Payment Card without the additional forms of identification listed above for the SSC.  </p><p>In addition to the identity requirements for claimants collecting in person, post offices are obliged to apply the following controls in respect of payments collected by authorised agents.  These agents are of two types; temporary and permanent.  </p><p>Payment should only be made to a temporary agent on presentation of the following: </p><p>-  A Temporary Agent form (TA1) signed by the claimant authorising the agent to collect their payments.  </p><p>-  The claimant&rsquo;s PSC, SSC or Temporary Card </p><p>-  The Agent&rsquo;s own photo ID. Acceptable forms of photo ID are the same as set out for SSC card.  </p><p>An Post have recently begun the roll out of an updated counter transaction system.  This change would appear to have caused some confusion among staff in post offices as my Department has received an increase in public queries regarding the use of the PSC for identification.  In each case the Department has asked An Post to contact the relevant post office to clarify that there has been no change in the agreed protocol governing the forms of identification which claimants, or their agents, must produce in order to collect payments.  To date these communications have been successful in ensuring that these instances have been resolved.  </p></reply>

The Guidelines are also intended to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country in the identification of suitable locations for wind energy development and the treatment of planning applications for such developments.  The policy context, including renewable energy policy, for the Guidelines is set out in section 1.2 of Chapter 1.</p><p>The 2006 Guidelines were not subject to a strategic environmental assessment (SEA).  As the Deputy will be aware, a focused review of the 2006 Guidelines is currently underway.</p><p>My predecessor as Minister, in conjunction with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, announced an emerging &quot;preferred draft approach&quot; to the review of the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines in June 2017.  A copy of the announcement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: www.housing.gov.ie/planning/guidelines/wind-energy/coveney-and-naughten-announce-key-development-review-wind-energy-development-guidelines.</p><p>It is important to mention that, as part of the overall review, and having regard to the recent ECJ Judgement in a case relating to the Belgian/Wallonian wind energy guidelines, it is proposed to undertake a SEA of the proposed revisions to the 2006 Guidelines before they come into effect.  This is in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, the SEA Directive.  SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.  It is envisaged that the public consultation as part of the SEA process will be undertaken in early 2018.</p><p>It is estimated that the SEA process will take approximately 9 months and tendering to engage the necessary expertise to carry out that process is well advanced.  In light of the SEA requirements, it is expected that the Guidelines will not be finalised and come into effect until 2018.  In the meantime, the current Guidelines remain in force.</p><p>When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000. </p><p>With regard to the proposed setback distance requirements in the &quot;preferred draft approach&quot;, which are based on international examples, these are primarily proposed for visual amenity purposes so that the setting of an appropriate setback in any planning determination takes account of turbine size, while also taking account of other factors such as site design and layout, the scale of the project and its effects on the topography and landscape of the area.  Furthermore, the &quot;preferred draft approach&quot; requirements in relation to setback distance will also be subject to the need to separately comply with the proposed noise limits in the &quot;preferred draft approach&quot;.</p><p>My Department issues periodic advice and guidance by way of circular letters to planning authorities on a range of planning related issues.  General Departmental circulars do not have a statutory basis as compared to the Planning Acts, Regulations made under the Acts or any Ministerial Guidelines, Directives or Directions issued under the Acts.  </p><p>However, Departmental circulars, which are generally advisory in nature, are used as a means for providing information to planning authorities in relation to various legislative provisions and requirements, to outline and clarify Government or Department policy, and to provide practical advice on the implementation of the planning code and general planning matters, with a view to ensuring consistency in approach and implementation by all local authorities.  </p><p>In addition, under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as Minister, I am empowered to issue guidelines to planning authorities as may be required.  Planning authorities, and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under section 28 and must apply any specific planning policy requirements therein in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.</p><p>My Department issued circular letter PL 20/2013 on 20 December 2013, the purpose of which was to advise that, in light of developing relevant national policy reviews, local authorities should defer amending their existing Development Plan policies in relation to wind energy and renewable energy generally as part of either the normal cyclical six-yearly review or plan variation processes.</p><p>On 3 August 2017, my Department issued circular letter PL 05/2017 which reiterated the advice in previous circular letter PL 20/2013 and provided an update on the review of the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines.  However, its primary purpose was to issue new Ministerial section 28 Interim Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Statutory Plans, Renewable Energy and Climate Change, entitled Interim Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Statutory Plans, Renewable Energy and Climate Change &ndash; July 2017, with a focus on the administrative procedures which should be carried out, and the national policies relating to renewable energy and wind energy that regard should be taken of, in the adoption or variation of statutory development plans.</p></reply>

My Department provides 100% capital funding for Traveller-specific accommodation and also provides funding for accommodation related supports to operate in tandem with the capital programme.</p>  <p>  Local authorities submit funding proposals for individual Traveller-specific projects and developments on an annual basis, which are assessed on a case-by-case basis in my Department in advance of allocations being made.  In addition, further funding may be considered by my Department throughout the year, also on a case by case basis, in the light of progress across the programme generally.  </p>  <p>  While my Department does not get involved in the case of individual households, which are a matter for the relevant housing authority, in this case Cork County Council, it is of course a matter of concern when funds available to any local authorities for traveller accommodation are not drawn down.  In that regard, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to establishing a special working group to audit the current delivery and implementation of local authorities&rsquo; Traveller Accommodation Programmes and consult with stakeholders on key areas of concern.  This commitment was underpinned in Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, which provided for the commissioning by the Housing Agency, on behalf of my Department, of an expert, independent review of capital and current funding for Traveller-specific accommodation for the period 2000 to date, having regard to the targets contained in the local authority TAPs and actual units delivered, the current status of the accommodation funded and the funding provided for accommodation maintenance and other supports. </p>  <p>  This report was finalised and submitted to the National Traveller Accommodation Committee (NTACC) for consideration at its meeting on 28 August 2017.  The NTACC is a statutorily-appointed Committee, comprising key stakeholders, including Traveller representative groups, to advise the Minister with responsibility in relation to Traveller accommodation matters.  On foot of its considerations of the report, the NTACC collectively agreed to advise me to establish an Expert Group to examine and make recommendations on issues regarding Traveller accommodation policy, strategy and implementation.  This is in keeping with the Programme for Partnership Government and I have agreed to proceed with the establishment of this Expert Group.  </p>  <p>  I have also agreed that a review of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 should be part of the work of the Expert Group.  The composition, terms of reference and methodology of this Expert Group are currently being formulated with a view to it being in place as soon as possible.  </p></reply>

This is in recognition of the exceptional nature of activities carried out by local authorities in responding to severe weather emergencies and the fact that the costs of these unprogrammed activities cannot be met from within existing resources. </p>  <p>  My Department has written to all local authorities inviting them to submit claims for the recoupment of exceptional costs associated with the response to and clean-up following Ex-hurricane Ophelia, and is liaising with Laois County Council with regard to the recoupment of its exceptional response and clean-up costs associated with the flooding event in Mountmellick on 22 November. </p>  <p>  Funding of repair of public infrastructure is undertaken by the relevant Department in line with its sectoral responsibility.  Capital costs associated with infrastructural damage, for example damage to the roads network and coastal protection infrastructure (where relevant), are not included therefore under the above arrangements. </p>  <p>  I am aware also that a number of emergency humanitarian support schemes have been put in place to assist households and small businesses affected by the recent flooding event in Laois. </p>  <p>  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection confirmed on 23 November that its Humanitarian Assistance Scheme is available to assist people in Laois whose homes are damaged by flooding and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and in some instances structural repair.  The scheme is means tested and assistance is not provided for losses which are covered by insurance or for commercial and business losses. </p>  <p>  Financial support under the Humanitarian Assistance Scheme is targeted initially at the immediate needs of those who may have been directly impacted by the flooding (such as clothing and food) with further support available (financial support for household items and structural repair) as the clean-up operations begin.  More information on the Scheme is available at: www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Humanitarian-Assistance-Scheme.aspx.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department of Defence has activated an Emergency Humanitarian Scheme for small businesses, community, voluntary and sporting bodies, to be operated by the Irish Red Cross.  The scheme provides temporary emergency humanitarian support to small businesses that have been unable to secure flood insurance and have been impacted by flooding.  It is intended as a contribution towards the costs of returning business premises to their pre-flood condition including the replacement of flooring, fixtures, fittings and damaged stock.  </p>  <p>  The scheme is targeted at small businesses (up to 20 employees) and has two stages: the first stage commenced immediately and will provide a contribution of up to &euro;5,000, depending on the scale of damage incurred.  In the event that businesses have incurred significant damages above &euro;5,000, the second stage will provide a means to seek further support.  However, this will require a more detailed assessment.</p>  <p>  Further information, including application forms and eligibility criteria, are available on the Irish Red Cross website, at: </p>  <p>  www.redcross.ie/news-and-events/laois-humanitarian-support-scheme/.</p></reply>

In addition, in the case of a number of Boards, not all of the appointments to the body concerned are made by the Minister, and in some situations appointments are made by the Minister with the consent of another Minister.  Furthermore, appointments to An Bord Plean&aacute;la are of a full-time executive nature and are governed by statutory processes.</p>  <p>   A &ldquo;unitary board structure&rdquo; is in place for Ervia and its subsidiaries, Irish Water and Gas Networks Ireland.  An overarching non-executive board has overall responsibility and accountability for the performance of the Ervia Group.  The Boards of the two principal Ervia subsidiaries, Irish Water and Gas Networks Ireland, are executive-only boards.</p>  <p>  The Public Appointments Service portal www.stateboards.ie offers a single dedicated point of contact to all Government Departments, as a support to the existing State Board appointment procedures.  This service provides a mechanism for Departments to advertise board vacancies and it gives prospective candidates an opportunity to register their general interest in a position on a State Board and to be alerted to upcoming vacancies.  This process for appointments to State Boards includes an assessment of the skills and competencies required to be a member of the relevant Board.</p>  <p>  A process is underway to fill a vacancy in An Bord Plean&aacute;la and a further Board member position which can be added to the Board's complement under its governing legislation.  There is also potential for a further member to be appointed to the Board of the Housing Agency.</p></reply>

As Minister, I am empowered to grant approved status to housing bodies for this purpose. AHBs are independent, not-for-profit organisations, which can also include housing co-operatives, which are housing organisations controlled by their members/tenants who actively participate in setting their policies and making decisions. </p>  <p>  Information in relation to specific administration costs of these organisations is not held in my Department.  The day-to-day administration and financial management of AHBs is a matter for their individual Boards.  I have no role in relation to such matters, nor does my Department collate data relating to the administration costs in AHBs. </p>  <p>  To date, there are 547 bodies with approved status.

Until such time as the legislation is enacted and the statutory system of regulation is put in place, the interim regulatory arrangements in operation since 2014 will remain in operation.</p></reply>

Once these works are complete, the approved housing body (AHB) will proceed to close the sale with the vendor.</p>  <p>  CALF is available as a low interest loan provided by local authorities (and recouped by my Department) to AHBs.  This funding allows AHBs access to early working capital (up to 30% of the relevant costs) for the purchase, construction or refurbishment of units which will then be made available for social housing purposes under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP).  Low interest rate borrowings are available to AHBs from the Housing Finance Agency and other private finance streams to support the financing of the balance.  The AHB effectively uses the CALF approval for the capital injection of up to 30% and the ongoing commitment of lease income under the Payment and Availability Agreement to leverage the balance finance required.  Once an AHB has secured the property and signed the Payment and Availability Agreement with the local authority, they use the lease income to service the borrowings.</p>  <p>  Properties made available under the CALF scheme are used to accommodate households from the local authority waiting list.  Leased properties are allocated to tenants, in accordance with the relevant local authority's allocation scheme.</p></reply>

Any person regarded as homeless may be placed into temporary emergency accommodation without the requirement to undergo a social housing assessment and be approved for social housing support; these arrangements give housing authorities the flexibility that is essential to respond quickly and effectively to the various needs of cases that may present to them. </p>  <p>  In order to qualify for social housing support, a household&rsquo;s long-term housing need and eligibility must be determined by a housing authority through a social housing assessment under section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and associated Regulations.  As social housing support is intended to address a household&rsquo;s long-term housing need it is expected that any household applying for such support should have a long-term right to reside in the State.  Departmental Housing Circular 41/2012 sets out the appropriate criteria that housing authorities can use to accept someone as having a long-term right to reside, and therefore be eligible to apply to be assessed for social housing support.</p>  <p>  Given that statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless accommodation rests with individual housing authorities, my Department has no role in relation to operational issues such as placements of particular individuals or families into emergency accommodation.  It is a matter for individual authorities to obtain legal advice as required in the execution of their statutory functions.</p></reply>

A commitment to deliver 50,000 new social housing homes through a range of delivery mechanisms is being supported by a multi-annual Exchequer commitment totalling &euro;6.5 billion over the period of the plan. These targets will be achieved using a combination of building, purchasing and leasing high quality properties to meet the needs of households on local authority waiting lists around the country.</p><p>The Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) will support the delivery of 10,000 of these homes by providing financial support for the leasing of houses and apartments by local authorities and approved housing bodies from a range of different sources. A total of 3,500 properties are targeted to be achieved using the Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) which harnesses the potential of existing vacant stock and brings it back into use for social housing. The remaining 6,500 properties to be leased are intended to be secured under long-term lease arrangements from a variety of sources. </p><p>In relation to NAMA/SPV leases, NAMA has established a special purpose vehicle (National Asset Residential Property Services Limited &lsquo;NARPS&rsquo;), to take ownership of properties where there is an established demand and then lease them long-term to an approved housing body or local authority. In these projects, NAMA funds the remediation of the common areas and the completion of the unfinished units, which are often the last remaining incomplete and vacant units in the estates. When the units are complete, NARPS purchase the finished properties and lease them immediately to the approved housing body or local authority. While NAMA is consistently mindful of identifying properties which may be suitable for social housing, the pool of such properties is reducing in line with the reduction in the NAMA loan portfolio and it is unlikely at this point that significant numbers of additional properties will be identified. Information in relation to NAMA delivery for social housing is available on the website for the Housing Agency at the following link:</p><p><i>www.housingagency.ie/Housing/media/Media/Social%20Leasing%20Library/NAMA%20Status%20Reports/Breakdown-by-County-October-2017.pdf</i>.  <b></b></p><p>The number of dwellings  supported by the SHCEP in each of the years 2014 to Q3 2017, in the categories sought, are set out in the table below:<b></b></p><p><b>Table 1: Delivery 2014 - 2017</b><table><tr><th>Type of lease</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017 (up to end Q3)</th></tr><tr><td>AHB/LA Lease </td><td>626 </td><td>652 </td><td>574 </td><td>413 </td></tr><tr><td>NAMA/SPV Leases</td><td>120 </td><td>433 </td><td>218 </td><td>258 </td></tr><tr><td>Repair &amp;amp; Leasing</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>746</td><td>1085</td><td>792</td><td>671</td></tr></table>SHCEP funding is used to fund a range of delivery mechanisms, including those outlined in Table 1.

Like other areas within the Public Service, the pay of the Permanent Defence Force was reduced during the financial crisis.  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts of 2009-2015 (FEMPI) and the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2018 (Lansdowne Road Agreement) define current pay policy.  PDFORRA signed up to the Lansdowne Road Agreement in March 2017.  The finalisation of negotiations under the agreement allowed for the commencement of the process for the implementation of pay increases and arrears, which have now been applied to the Permanent Defence Force.  An increase of 2.5% from 1 January 2016, for annualised salaries up to &euro;24,000 and 1% for annualised salaries between &euro;24,001 and &euro;31,000 was included in the weekly payroll of 5 July 2017.  An increase of &euro;1,000 from 1 April 2017 on annualised salaries up to &euro;65,000 per annum was paid on 19 July 2017.</p><p>The pay of general service recruits and privates who joined the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January 2013 has been increased further following an agreement, facilitated by the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), between the Department of Defence, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and PDFORRA.  These improved payscales, have been backdated to 1 July 2016.  The payments were made to relevant personnel on 30 August 2017.</p><p>Going forward, there is the potential for further increases arising from the recent negotiations on the extension to the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 contains proposals for:</p><p>- a 7.25% increase over the period of the agreement for those earning less than &euro;30,000 per annum </p><p>- a 6.75% increase over the period of the agreement for those earning between &euro;30,001 and &euro;32,000 per annum, and</p><p>- a 5.75% increase over the period of the agreement for those earning over &euro;32,000 per annum.  </p><p>The Government recognises the contribution made by all public servants, including members of the Permanent Defence Force, during the economic crisis, to restoring our public finances and getting the country back on track.  In making these improvements, the Government is ensuring that the increases are weighted in favour of those on lower pay.</p><p>Under the provisions of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Bill 2017, which is currently before the Oireachtas, it is anticipated that, between 2018 and 2020, the pay of all public servants (including members of the Defence Forces) earning under &euro;70,000 will be restored to pre FEMPI levels.</p><p>The proposals have been presented to the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations who participated in the negotiation process.  They are subject to ballot by members of the Associations.</p><p>Future remuneration of Defence Forces personnel will continue to be dealt with within this collective process.</p><p>The Public Service Pay and Pensions Bill 2017 which provides for restoration of pay also provides for the restoration of the 5% reduction in allowances under FEMPI.  The restoration of Defence Force Allowances which were reduced under the Haddington Road Agreement are currently the subject of separate negotiations under the Conciliation &amp;amp; Arbitration Scheme.</p><p>In relation to contracts for enlisted personnel, I have directed civil and military management to initiate a broad view and to bring forward recommendations for my consideration.</p></reply>

Members who serve overseas on UN missions or UN mandated missions, subject to certain criteria, are currently eligible for the award of An Bonn Chosant&oacute;ir&iacute; S&iacute;och&aacute;na na N&aacute;isi&uacute;n Aontaithe (United Nations Peacekeepers Medal).  This medal is only awarded once to any individual, irrespective of the number of overseas missions that they complete during their career.   </p>  <p>  In addition to this medal, a member who serves overseas may also be eligible for the award of a mission-specific medal by the mission organisers.   </p>  <p>  The military authorities inform me that all Defence Forces personnel who were deployed on the overseas missions referred to by the Deputy received the appropriate mission-specific awards provided that they met the criteria laid down by the United Nations for each of the missions referred to and reflected in Defence Forces Regulations.  The qualifying service period was 90 days in the mission area. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the military authorities that any personnel who met the eligibility criteria and were not awarded the mission medal should contact the Defence Forces Ceremonial Branch. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that last June I and the former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny TD, decided to award a medal to the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and, in the case of those members who are deceased, to their next of kin, to give full and due recognition in honour of the courageous actions of the men during the siege at Jadotville in September 1961.  This was an exceptional measure that recognises their bravery and courage during the unique circumstances of that siege.  This was an initiative I had been working on for some time and I was privileged to be able to take the decision to award a medal to the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company.   </p></reply>

Equipment priorities for the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment planning process.  In this context the principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements both at home and overseas. </p><p>  The White Paper on Defence provides that the Air Corps will see the Cessna fleet replaced with three larger aircraft suitably equipped for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance tasks.  The tender competition for the procurement of the three new aircraft is under way and the cost will be determined by the outcome of the tender competition which is expected to conclude shortly. </p><p>  The two Air Corps CASA 235 Maritime Patrol Aircraft are due for replacement in 2019.  The White Paper also provides for the replacement of the CASA 235s with consideration to be given to their replacement with larger more capable aircraft which would enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks. </p><p>  Also, a decision was made in 2016 to replace a PC-9M aircraft and this aircraft was delivered from Pilatus Aircraft in Switzerland this July at a cost of &euro;5 m exclusive of VAT.  The new aircraft brings the fleet up to 8 and will assist in a required increase in pilot training in the Air Corps. </p></reply>

In terms of formal bilateral meetings, I have previously met with The Rt Hon Sir Michael Fallon, MP the then Secretary of State at the UK Ministry of Defence.  Our discussion covered a wide range of topics mainly in the security and defence domain but also focused on Brexit and the implications for Ireland and the EU.

In accordance with the Framework for Major Emergency Management, primary responsibility for responding to emergencies caused by severe weather events, such as storms and flooding, rests with the three designated principal response agencies, namely, the relevant Local Authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the Health Service Executive.  The Defence Forces provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate agencies in the event of a natural disaster or emergency situation in its Aid to the Civil Authority role. </p>  <p>  Major Emergency Plans have been developed by local and regional authorities and these Plans identify the procedures for requesting assistance from the Defence Forces.   </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces retains a wide range of specialist skills which can be deployed in such circumstances.  The full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment are available for deployment in response to any emergencies that may arise.    </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the assistance provided by the Defence Forces is provided in a co-ordinated way and that the tried and tested arrangements work well in response to emergencies.  </p></reply>

Like other areas of the Public Service, the pay of the Permanent Defence Force was reduced during the financial crisis.  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts of 2009-2015 (FEMPI) and the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2018 (the Lansdowne Road Agreement) define current pay policy for Public Servants and members of the Permanent Defence Force.</p><p>It should be noted that the remarks relating to levels of pay contained within the focus group report compiled by the University of Limerick, predate a number of measures which have been taken this year to increase the pay of Permanent Defence Force personnel.  The focus of these measures have been on the lower paid. </p><p>PDFORRA signed up to the Lansdowne Road Agreement (LRA) agreement in March 2017.  The finalisation of negotiations under the agreement allowed for the commencement of the process for the implementation of pay increases and arrears, which have now been applied to the Permanent Defence Force.  An increase of 2.5% from 1 January 2016 for annualised salaries up to &euro;24,000 and 1% for annualised salaries between &euro;24,001 and &euro;31,000 was included in the weekly payroll of 5 July 2017.  An increase of &euro;1,000 from 1 April 2017 on annualised salaries up to &euro;65,000 per annum was paid on 19 July 2017.</p><p>The pay of general service recruits and privates who joined the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January 2013 has been increased further following an agreement, facilitated by the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), between the Department of Defence, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and PDFORRA.  These improved payscales have been backdated to 1 July 2016.  The payments were made to relevant personnel on 30 August 2017.</p><p>Going forward, there is the potential for further increases for public servants, including members of the Permanent Defence Force, arising from the recent negotiations on the extension to the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 contains proposals for:</p><p>- a 7.25% increase over the period of the agreement for those earning less than &euro;30,000 per annum</p><p>- a 6.75% increase over the period of the agreement for those earning between &euro;30,001 and &euro;32,000 per annum, and</p><p>- a 5.75% increase over the period of the agreement for those earning over &euro;32,000 per annum.  </p><p>The Government recognises the contribution made by all public servants, including members of the Permanent Defence Force, during the economic crisis, to restoring our public finances and getting the country back on track.  In making these improvements the Government is ensuring that the increases are weighted in favour of those on lower pay.</p><p>Under the provisions of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Bill 2017, which is currently before the Oireachtas, it is anticipated that, between 2018 and 2020, the pay of public servants, including members of the Defence Forces, earning under &euro;70,000 will be restored to pre-FEMPI levels.</p><p>The proposals have been presented to the Permanent Defence Force representative associations who participated in the negotiation process.  They are subject to ballot by members of the associations.</p><p>Future remuneration of Defence Forces personnel will continue to be dealt with within this collective process.</p></reply>
