A total of 6,437 payments and 650 turf deliveries have been made in respect of the applications received. In addition, 1,330 once-off incentive payments of &euro;500 have been made to applicants who have signed and returned legal agreements under the scheme to my Department. This equates to some 2,300 individual applicants having received payments under the scheme thus far.<br/><br/>The qualifying criteria for the scheme are that:<br/><br/>-  The claimant must have a legal interest in one of the raised bog special areas of conservation &ndash; ownership or turbary right;<br/><br/>-  The claimant must have been the owner or entitled to exercise turbary rights on the land in question on 25 May 2010;<br/><br/>-  The turbary on the site must not be exhausted;<br/><br/>-  The claimant must have been cutting turf on the land in question during the relevant five year period; and<br/><br/>-  No turf cutting or associated activity is ongoing on the property.<br/><br/>I am advised that, at this stage, 138 applicants from raised bog special areas of conservation have been informed by my Department that they do not fulfil the qualifying criteria of the scheme. <br/><br/>While it may be anticipated that there will be further instances where applicants will be informed that they do not fulfil the qualifying criteria, current priority is being given to providing payments to those who clearly appear to fulfil the criteria on the basis of the information they have provided. In addition, establishing ownership rights is particularly complex and my Department is working with owners of land and turbary right holders to assist them in this regard.<br/><br/>A number of applicants are not being provided with compensation under the scheme as the areas on which they have been cutting turf are not within one of the designated sites.</p></reply>

The Arts Council is the main channel of State current expenditure on the arts and will receive almost &euro;59 million in 2015. Although the Council is funded through my Department, it is statutorily independent in its funding decisions, as provided by the Arts Act 2003.  <br/><br/>I believe that the Arts Council serves the arts and this country well, and I have no plans to change the institutional arrangements, which encompass the arm's length approach to the distribution by the Council of Exchequer funding to the arts. Significant expertise on the arts resides in the Arts Council and I believe, therefore, that it is best placed to identify and fund excellence in the arts.<br/><br/>I am also committed to ensuring the delivery of the country's first ever national cultural policy - <i>Culture 2025</i>- which will set out the high-level aims and policies of the Government in the period up until 2025.  I will shortly be initiating a wide-scale consultation process to ensure that all stakeholders and members of the public can make their views known on the various aspects of arts and cultural policy.</p></reply>

As a consequence of the Preservation Order, any works affecting Nos. 14-17 require the formal consent of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht under the National Monuments Acts.  After extensive deliberations, a final Ministerial consent was given to the owners in April 2014 for the creation of a 1916 commemorative centre in the monument buildings, involving the full repair and restoration of the structures, both internally and externally.</p>  <p>  Proposals that subsequently went before Dublin City Council late last year would have allowed the exchange of two modern 1990s buildings at Nos. 24 and 25 Moore Street, currently used as a cleansing depot, in return for full ownership of Nos. 14-17 being transferred to the City Council.  The transfer would have been accompanied by NAMA funding to cover the full cost of the restoration project and the proposed commemorative centre.</p>  <p>  I was disappointed that Dublin City Councillors rejected these plans, which I believe provided a real opportunity to have the restoration work completed and the commemorative centre open in time for the centenary of the Rising in 2016.  Following the decision to reject the proposal, it is now a matter for the City Council and the monument owners to consider what the implications are for the national monument buildings, for the NAMA funding for the restoration project and for the centenary commemorations in 2016.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, my Department continues to monitor the condition of the protected buildings, including undertaking regular site inspections. Works have been carried out by the monument owners from time to time, with my Department&rsquo;s formal consent, with the objective of preventing any deterioration in the condition of the structures.</p></reply>

Hare coursing is administered by the Irish Coursing Club, which is a body set up under the Greyhound Industry Act 1958.  Licences were issued by my Department in August 2014   under the Wildlife Acts to the Irish Coursing Club, on behalf of their affiliated clubs, to facilitate the tagging and capturing of hares for the purpose of hare coursing for the 2014/15 coursing season.   </p>  <p>  Where resources allow, officials of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department attend coursing meetings, on a spot-check basis, to monitor compliance with conditions on the licences.   My Department will review the operation of the 2014/15 coursing season following the end of the season.  This review will take account of the inspections undertaken by National Parks and Wildlife Service officials at coursing meetings during the season. Any issues that may arise from these inspections will be pursued with both the Irish Coursing Club and the individual coursing clubs in question.      </p>  <p>  In addition, veterinary staff from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine carry out some monitoring inspections during the coursing season to verify compliance with the rules governing animal welfare.  The Irish Coursing Club also ensures that a veterinary surgeon and a control steward are present at all coursing meetings.  As a further control, a Monitoring Committee on Coursing, comprised of officials from my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Irish Coursing Club, continue to monitor developments in coursing. </p>  <p>  In that regard, the situation is kept under constant review to ensure that coursing is run in a well-controlled and responsible manner, in compliance with the relevant licensing conditions.</p></reply>

In this regard, I am committed, together with my Government colleagues, to ensuring that the commemorations to mark the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising will be inclusive, appropriate and respectful.<br/><br/>The <b><i>Ireland 2016</i></b>initiative, which I am leading, aims to develop, coordinate and deliver a programme to honour and remember those who fought and died in the Rising.  It will also reflect on the legacy of that period and look towards our future, based around 5 themes, as set out in the Government's framework plan:<br/><br/>-  Remembering the past<br/><br/>-  Reconciling and respecting all traditions<br/><br/>-  Presenting Ireland to the world<br/><br/>-  Imagining our future<br/><br/>-  Celebrating our achievements. <br/><br/>The <b><i>Ireland 2016</i></b>initiative will, as did <i>The Gathering,</i>seek to build positive engagement with the citizens of Ireland across the Government, State agency and community sectors.<br/><br/>I have secured an allocation of &euro;4 million in current funding to support the development of an integrated national plan focused on the commemoration of the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising.  This allocation will be used to engage with and support a wide range of activities and events by interested groups, including local community groups and the arts, as well as Irish language and educational projects. The allocation of &euro;4 million is in addition to the capital provision of &euro;22 million, which will be allocated in 2015 to a number of flagship commemoration projects.<br/><br/>I anticipate that the overall investment in the <b><i>Ireland 2016</i></b>programme will have a positive impact in terms of employment, trade and tourism, as well as wider economic benefits, both locally and nationally.  <br/><br/>I will continue to work with the Oireachtas All-Party Consultation Group on Commemorations, the Expert Advisory Group and a wide range of stakeholders over the coming 18 months to ensure that the events of Easter 1916 are marked in a fitting manner.</p></reply>

Of these, 783 applicants have expressed an interest in relocation to non-designated bogs.Relocation is a complex process in terms of<br/><br/>- investigating suitable sites for turf quality and quantity;<br/><br/>- the infrastructure/drainage works required;<br/><br/>- establishing the number that can be accommodated on the site;<br/><br/>- the cost and feasibility of land purchase or lease; and <br/><br/>- possible planning and Environmental Impact Assessment requirements.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding this complexity, progress in relocating turf cutters to non-designated bogs is being achieved in a number of cases and arrangements have been made to date as regards:<br/><br/>- Clara Bog special area of conservation in Co Offaly, where 25 qualifying turf cutters have been accommodated on Killeranny Bog; and<br/><br/>- Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog special areas of conservation in Co Galway, where 23 qualifying turf cutters have been accommodated on the Islands Bog and Killasolan Bog.<br/><br/>Works have been undertaken on Lemanaghan Bog in County Offaly with a view to facilitating turf cutters from Moyclare Bog. Works have also been completed at Cloonabricka Bog in County Galway to facilitate additional cutters relocating from Carrownagappul and Curraghlehanagh Bogs.<br/><br/>Potential relocation sites had been identified for each of the remaining raised bog special areas of conservation where relocation may be required. When relocation sites have been assessed as suitable, my Department has been seeking expressions of interest from turf cutters with a view to them moving to these sites. In 2014, the Department wrote to over 250 turf cutters, from 14 special areas of conservation, seeking expressions of interest in relocating to specific non-designated bogs. </p></reply>

The law provides for significant penalties for those that are found to breach those protective measures - for example, fines of up to &euro;100,000 or imprisonment of up to two years can be imposed following convictions on indictment for cases involving the shooting of a Hen Harrier. <br/><br/>In that regard, I consider incidents such the killing of rare and protected species, as we have seen in recent weeks, to be completely unacceptable. They are damaging to our wildlife, to our reputation, to tourism-related business, and to the image generally of Ireland&rsquo;s healthy countryside. <br/><br/>I can assure the Deputy that the provisions of the Wildlife Acts are kept under continuous review and I remain open to introducing improvements to the law, where appropriate.</p></reply>

In addition to their great intrinsic value, these are central to promoting the image of Ireland and its perception as a rich cultural destination. My Department has taken a number of initiatives in that regard.   In 2014, my Department appointed a Cultural Tourism Officer, who has been tasked with establishing and chairing a Cultural Tourism Working Group comprising representatives from across the Department. This working group assisted in the formulation of a Cultural Tourism Working Action Plan, which focuses on identifying areas of potential collaboration, in my Department and its agencies, as well as with external partners such as the Office of Public Works and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. </p>  <p>  This initiative will enable the development of a more cohesive approach to the promotion of Ireland's culture and heritage at home and abroad by the relevant heritage and tourism bodies, for instance by encouraging the development of initiatives that help communities convey a distinctive, local cultural narrative and promote greater engagement with local cultural heritage. It will also facilitate the protection and delivery of the cultural and heritage experiences that citizens and tourists alike anticipate in Ireland. For example, consideration is being given to extending the reach of the Wild Atlantic Way tourism trail to incorporate visits to suitable national monuments that are in close proximity to the trail as currently configured.</p>  <p>  A key objective of this initiative is to promote and realise the value of our cultural assets, both directly in terms of my Department&rsquo;s contribution to the development of cultural tourism, and indirectly in terms of promoting the development of cultural tourism initiatives across the wider public, commercial and community sectors in order to bring socio-economic benefits to local communities and assist in balanced regional development.</p>  <p>  Another example in this area is the annual Heritage Week held each August, which is coordinated by the Heritage Council and funded by my Department. The main aims of Heritage Week are to promote awareness of our built, natural and cultural heritage, thereby encouraging its conservation and preservation. Heritage Week is designed to appeal to as broad an audience as possible and has proved very successful in doing so.</p>  <p>  Through these and other initiatives, my Department will continue to encourage a greater awareness of our rich culture and heritage, both for their intrinsic value and for the associated economic benefits. </p></reply>

The 1926 Census is the next full set of Census records, after the 1911 returns, which is available to the State. However, current legislative provisions, as contained in the Statistics Act 1993, require that census data must be withheld for 100 years. Accordingly, it is not possible at this time to release the 1926 Census returns before the statutory period has elapsed in 2026. If the records were to be released before the expiry of 100 years, a<font color="#004080"> </font>major<font color="#004080"> </font>change in legislation and policy would be required to allow for the early release.  This is not currently being proposed. <br/><br/>A 1926 Census Working Group has been formed, comprising officials from my own Department, the National Archives and the Central Statistics Office. The Group has examined this complex project and has assessed the significant resources - in terms of additional financial, staff and infrastructural resources - that will need to be in place to move the project forward to completion. I can say that, following discussions within the Working Group, I am of the opinion that the extensive preparatory work required to prepare the 1926 Census database for processing, and eventual digitisation to facilitate the release of the data into the public domain, should continue. It must be recognised, however, that, in light of the level of additional resources that will be necessary, and of the current engagement by the National Archives on a number of other important projects, including some that form a key part of the programme for the Decade of Commemorations, it will be necessary to work over time towards building the necessary capacity to undertake and oversee the 1926 Census project.<br/><br/>The cost to digitise the 1926 Census could be as high as &euro;10m, as the Census has never been micro-filmed and the individual return sheets would need to be scanned and cross-indexed. <br/><br/>The Government agreed, as part of its capital stimulus package, to provide funding this year for phase one of a development plan at the Archives headquarters in Bishop Street.  The OPW will shortly go to tender for the project and it is anticipated that works could begin by mid-2015.  This will greatly increase the storage capacity of the National Archives. In addition, sanction has been given to run a competition for additional archivists for the National Archives, adding further to the capacity of the organisation.</p></reply>

The full technical report is available on the website of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department at .

This network plays a major role in making the arts more accessible to everyone. I am also aware that the Association of Local Authority Arts Officers provides a forum for discussion and a support for the development of its members&rsquo; work within local authorities.<br/><br/>In November 2014, I met with local authority arts officers as a group to discuss their views and their ideas for the future.  I have also met many of the arts officers individually and I am constantly looking for ways which would improve communication and linkages between the arts officers and other stakeholder bodies.<br/><br/>Finally, I would like to state my commitment to ensuring the delivery of the country's first ever national cultural policy - <i>Culture 2025</i>- which will set out the high-level aims and policies of the Government in the period up until 2025, including the role that local authorities can play in promoting the arts.</p></reply>

This Directive aims to ensure the protection of habitats and species which have been selected for conservation within Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special Protection Areas (SPAs).  The Habitats Directive has been transposed into national law under the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011.</p>  <p>  Landowners may object to the proposed designation of a site as an SAC. Following the completion of a Departmental review of an objection to the proposed designation, landowners may opt to take their cases to the Designated Areas Appeals Advisory Board, an independently chaired Board which makes recommendations to me, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, on such cases. The appeals process includes an oral hearing. The Board heard 17 appeals over the 2013-2014 period. In each case the recommendation of the Board was accepted.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that the nomination of a site for designation as an SAC may have an impact on the manner in which certain lands may be farmed. The designation of lands does not mean that the lands are subject to blanket restrictions. However, they must be managed appropriately. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the relevant legislation, certain activities in protected sites may only be undertaken with my consent, as Minister. Compensation may be payable where a person has been refused consent by me for a prescribed activity within a designated site that he or she had been undertaking in the five year period prior to the refusal. However, compensation schemes have generally been put in place, where required, without the need to undergo a formal process under the relevant legislation.</p>  <p>  While my Department has the lead role in relation to the implementation of the Habitats Directive, significant funding is provided through the rural development programme, operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. This programme provides for a range of supports for farmers, including payments in respect of sites nominated for designation or designated in accordance with the Directive. I understand that, i  n future, EU financial supports for agri-environmental actions by farmers in SACs and SPAs will be made through the green, low carbon agri-environment scheme (GLAS), to be operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>  <p>  Since this Government has come into office, huge efforts have been made to engage with stakeholders with regard to the implementation of the EU Habitats Directive. My Department engages with stakeholders, including those from the farming sector, non-governmental organisations and other public authorities, on an ongoing basis in this regard. This has particularly been the case in efforts to solve the issue of the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s raised bog SACs within the framework of the Habitats Directive. This has included intense engagement with turf cutting interests, farmers, non-governmental organisations and with the European Commission, as well as the putting in place of a long-term compensation scheme.</p></reply>

The report, which can be accessed on the welfare.ie website, was undertaken by my Department working with the Central Bank and the then Pensions Board.  It gathered information on the level of pension charges levied during the pension-saving cycle from initial set-up, to on-going maintenance and to the point of retirement.  The focus of the report is on pension types utilised by the majority of pension savers in the Irish marketplace.  This amounts to almost 750,000 people who have pensions across a wide range of pension vehicles, both employer-sponsored and individual arrangements.</p>  <p>  The report shows that there are a wide range of different charges and their application can vary greatly, both in scale and complexity across the various pension arrangements.  Charging structures are influenced by many scheme specific factors including scheme structure, type, age and size.</p>  <p>  The report noted that unlike other pension structures, the cost structure in relation to Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) is regulated and considered whether similar regulation should apply for other pension vehicles.  Having examined the issue in depth, the report concluded that the focus of recommendations should be on measures that would introduce clarity and consistency across the various products, and increase consumer/trustee understanding to provide a better result for the consumer.  I have previously highlighted that the matter of pension charges will be kept under review with a view to considering more stringent options if necessary.  In this regard I can confirm that I have asked that the matter of pension charges be a priority item for consideration by the Pensions Council.  I recently established the Pensions Council to help strengthen the pensions environment by advising the Minister for Social Protection on policy matters of relevance to pensions and giving consumers greater input into pension policy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-02-10a.96.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015021000055#WRC01400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 169, 174, 177 and 207 together.<br/><br/>The rent supplement scheme provides support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. There are approximately 70,700 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;298 million for in 2015. Rent supplement recipient numbers by county and information on expenditure since 2008 is provided in the attached tabular statements. Rent Supplement expenditure by local authority is not available.<br/><br/>I am acutely aware of the difficulties people are experiencing in maintaining affordable rented accommodation in areas of high demand in the current market including areas of Cork and Clare. The Department has put measures in place to ensure that the housing needs of rent supplement customers throughout the country who are at risk of homelessness are addressed by providing for increased flexibility within the administration of the rent supplement scheme. Notices were circulated to all Community Welfare Service staff reminding them of their discretionary power to award, on a case by case basis, a supplement for rental purposes in such circumstances in July and December 2014. A National Framework has also been developed to ensure that appropriate supports continue to be provided throughout the country in a consistent manner.<br/><br/>The Department continues to monitor the measures in place to ensure that the appropriate supports are in place for rent supplement recipients including the Interim Tenancy Sustainment Protocol operating in Dublin, which was extended to Cork city in recent weeks. The Department&rsquo;s response will continue to be kept under review during 2015.<br/><br/>Where a person in receipt of rent supplement is at risk of losing their tenancy they should make contact with the Tenancy Protection Service provided by Threshold in Dublin or in Cork city or their local Community Welfare Service as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Concerns have been raised by advocacy groups regarding the reduced rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for younger persons and homelessness. The reduced rates encourage young jobseekers to improve their skills and remain active in the labour market in order to avoid the risk of becoming long-term unemployed and will help them to progress into sustainable employment.  Where a person is in receipt of a reduced rate of jobseeker's allowance and he or she participates in a course of education or training a higher rate of &euro;160 applies.<br/><br/>In addition to the measures in place under rent supplement, enhanced processes to provide earlier and more intensive engagement, additional places on a number of programmes and youth-oriented variants of existing schemes are being rolled out. This will help to ensure that all of those young unemployed people who need most support, those who are assessed as having a low to medium probability of securing employment in the absence of any support, will receive a Youth Guarantee offer within four months of an initial one-to-one interview.<br/><br/>The Department is also actively engaging with Tusla and non-government organisations in providing the necessary support to vulnerable young people leaving care who are experiencing homelessness or in insecure situations. These cases are managed on a case by case basis and the payment of deposits and rent in advance is considered. This form of assistance is very important to those on low incomes who are at risk of, or who are homeless, or who rely on the private rented market to meet their housing needs. In 2014, the Department made a total of some 3,000 payments of rent deposits/rent in advance at a cost of &euro;1.48 million throughout the country, of which some 850 payments at a cost of over &euro;360,000 were made to persons aged under 25 years.<br/><br/><b>Table 1: Rent Supplement End of Year Recipient Numbers &amp;amp; Expenditure: 2008 to Date</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Recipients</th><th>Cost &euro;000</th></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>74,038</td><td>440,548</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>93,030</td><td>510,751</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>97,260</td><td>516,538</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>96,803</td><td>502,747</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>87,684</td><td>422,536</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>79,788</td><td>372,909</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>71,533</td><td>338,135 <sup>1</sup></td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>70,761 <sup>2</sup></td><td>298,415 <sup>3</sup></td></tr></table><sup>1</sup>2014 Revised Estimate<br/><br/><sup>2</sup>At end of January, 2015<br/><br/><sup>3</sup>Rev 2015 Exp<br/><br/><b>Table 2: Rent Supplement End of Year Recipient Numbers per County</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>End Jan. 2015</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>24,119</td><td>31,261</td><td>33,818</td><td>34,423</td><td>32,584</td><td>29,541</td><td>26,453</td><td>26,202</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>8,538</td><td>10,603</td><td>10,988</td><td>10,732</td><td>9,878</td><td>9,020</td><td>8,273</td><td>8,134</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>3,275</td><td>4,161</td><td>4,409</td><td>4,447</td><td>4,338</td><td>4,135</td><td>3,698</td><td>3,717</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>3,733</td><td>4,989</td><td>4,829</td><td>4,615</td><td>4,134</td><td>3,983</td><td>3,591</td><td>3,576</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>2,870</td><td>3,763</td><td>4,055</td><td>4,102</td><td>3,700</td><td>3,179</td><td>2,700</td><td>2,628</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>2,942</td><td>3,669</td><td>3,896</td><td>3,833</td><td>3,323</td><td>2,984</td><td>2,461</td><td>2,374</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>1,887</td><td>2,426</td><td>2,563</td><td>2,734</td><td>2,549</td><td>2,422</td><td>2,211</td><td>2,189</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>2,066</td><td>2,699</td><td>2,613</td><td>2,719</td><td>2,495</td><td>2,381</td><td>2,130</td><td>2,145</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>2,082</td><td>2,572</td><td>2,680</td><td>2,609</td><td>2,199</td><td>2,094</td><td>1,961</td><td>1,943</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>3,282</td><td>3,470</td><td>3,194</td><td>2,977</td><td>2,411</td><td>2,047</td><td>1,812</td><td>1,786</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>1,453</td><td>2,213</td><td>2,552</td><td>2,723</td><td>2,143</td><td>1,941</td><td>1,726</td><td>1,683</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>2,252</td><td>2,398</td><td>2,339</td><td>2,278</td><td>2,037</td><td>1,888</td><td>1,736</td><td>1,702</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>2,585</td><td>3,077</td><td>3,012</td><td>2,928</td><td>2,435</td><td>1,900</td><td>1,619</td><td>1,600</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>1,275</td><td>1521</td><td>1,623</td><td>1,671</td><td>1,592</td><td>1,588</td><td>1,533</td><td>1,523</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>2,126</td><td>2,267</td><td>2,332</td><td>2,098</td><td>1,773</td><td>1,556</td><td>1,443</td><td>1,432</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>1,441</td><td>1780</td><td>1,937</td><td>1,961</td><td>1,722</td><td>1,547</td><td>1,336</td><td>1,319</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>1,092</td><td>1,472</td><td>1,577</td><td>1,619</td><td>1,365</td><td>1,210</td><td>1,011</td><td>962</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>1,161</td><td>1,498</td><td>1,484</td><td>1,440</td><td>1,239</td><td>1,108</td><td>1,086</td><td>1,094</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>833</td><td>1,053</td><td>1,273</td><td>1,349</td><td>1,240</td><td>1,124</td><td>1,041</td><td>1,020</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>706</td><td>979</td><td>1,151</td><td>1,178</td><td>1,097</td><td>1,085</td><td>1,008</td><td>1,011</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>1,042</td><td>1,286</td><td>1,276</td><td>1,275</td><td>997</td><td>802</td><td>687</td><td>678</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>706</td><td>789</td><td>715</td><td>623</td><td>511</td><td>507</td><td>476</td><td>478</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>733</td><td>822</td><td>787</td><td>698</td><td>591</td><td>542</td><td>451</td><td>460</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>874</td><td>1,115</td><td>1,029</td><td>843</td><td>519</td><td>455</td><td>414</td><td>418</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>509</td><td>640</td><td>598</td><td>488</td><td>438</td><td>395</td><td>352</td><td>354</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>456</td><td>507</td><td>530</td><td>440</td><td>374</td><td>354</td><td>324</td><td>333</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>74,038</td><td>93,030</td><td>97,260</td><td>96,803</td><td>87,684</td><td>79,788</td><td>71,533</td><td>70,761</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Social impact assessment is an evidence-based methodology which estimates the likely effects of welfare and tax policies on households across income levels and social groups.</p>  <p>  The assessment was prepared by the Department, which is responsible for the welfare component of the Budget. It is based on the tax/welfare micro simulation model SWITCH developed by the Economic and Social Research Institute. Responsibility for the analysis rests solely with the Department.</p>  <p>  One aspect of the assessment examines the distributive impact of the composite budgetary package for 2015 compared with the 2014 measures.  Overall, there is a marked difference in the overall distributive impact: an average gain of 0.7 per cent in 2015 compared to an average loss of 0.8 per cent in 2014.</p>  <p>  The contrast in distributive impact between 2015 and 2014 is greatest at the top and bottom of the income distribution, on the basis that these two quintiles experienced the greatest losses in 2014, which were then transformed into gains in 2015. Thus, a loss of 1.1 per cent for the bottom quintile in 2014 is replaced by a gain of 0.3 per cent in 2015 (a difference of 1.4 percentage points). Similarly, the top quintile goes from a loss of 1.1 per cent in 2014 to a gain of 1 percent in 2015 (a difference of 2.1 percentage points). For middle income groups, the scale of the transformation is not as dramatic, given the smaller losses experienced in 2014. The report acknowledges that over the two years combined, many households will still show an overall loss in income.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that certain items are not included in the assessment, for instance, additional expenditure on labour market initiatives (such as the back to work family dividend and the expansion of JobsPlus).  In addition, the assessment also does not include non-welfare expenditure measures for 2015, such as healthcare, education, social housing, and the new housing assistance payments, which will remove the barrier to full-time work for long-term recipients of rent supplement. Work is ongoing to quantify these impacts as part of the ESRI SWITCH research programme.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.</p>  <p>  To qualify for a state pension (contributory) a person must:</p>  <p>-  have at least 520 paid contributions, and</p>  <p>-  satisfy a yearly average condition (a yearly average of 48 contributions paid or credited is required for a full rate State pension (contributory), and reduced rates of payment may be payable for pensioners with lower averages).</p>  <p>  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes. </p>  <p>  Where an applicant has also been insurably employed in another EU Member State, or in a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, their insured periods in those countries may be combined with their Irish insurance to assess their entitlement to a pro-rata State pension (contributory).  In addition to the general provisions under EU legislation (which apply to all EU Member States, EEA state Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, and to Switzerland), Ireland has bilateral agreements with the UK which also cover the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, USA, Australia, Canada, Quebec (which has a separate system from the rest of Canada), New Zealand, Japan, and the Republic of Korea.</p>  <p>  EU legislation and bilateral agreements provide that comparative pension assessments (for standard-rate State pension contributory under Irish legislation alone, and for pro-rata State pension contributory under EU or bilateral agreement provisions) be undertaken, and whichever is the most financially beneficial pension entitlement for that pensioner is awarded to them.</p></reply>

At any one time, the scheme provides up to 8,500 work experience placements for jobseekers, in organisations in the private, public, community and voluntary sectors.</p>  <p>  To date, over 37,000 internship placements having commenced, there are currently 6,194 interns on the programme and a further 1,386 positions are advertised on the JobBridge website.</p>  <p>  In September 2014, the Department&rsquo;s attention was drawn to an unusually large number of cleaner/caretaker posts being advertised by schools, which raised concerns regarding the potential displacement of paid employees in the Education Sector.  In light of such concerns, I asked for  a report to be prepared on the use of JobBridge by the Education Sector with a view to establishing a set of guidelines to prevent inappropriate use  of the scheme, and in particular to prevent displacement by interns of positions which should be filled by paid staff.  This report has been finalised by the review group, and is currently under consideration.</p>  <p>  There is no application procedure for jobseekers for the First Steps programme.  Jobseekers will be selected, brought into the activation process and referred to the programme by their case worker based upon circumstances, activation needs and meeting the eligibility criteria.</p>  <p>  Participation of jobseekers on the First Steps programme, once referred, will be non-discretionary and subject to conditionality and penalty rate legislation should they fail without good cause to attend in accordance with the activation process.</p>  <p>  Further to Parliamentary Question No. 184 of 3 February 2015, statistics matching commencement dates with advertisement dates is not routinely prepared by the Department and so is not available at present, however, on this occasion, I have asked officials to collate the data requested and send it on to the Deputy. The Department will forward a reply directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.  In the meantime, I am providing a table setting out details of the host organisations, internship role, start date and current status.</p></reply>

Such property includes all monies held in financial institutions or otherwise, the market value of shares and houses and premises owned by a claimant which may or may not be put to commercial use. However, it does not include property such as the family home or, for example, a premises used by the claimant in carrying out a business.<br/><br/>For assessment purposes, the current market value of the property is established as well as the amount of any outstanding mortgages on that property. The balance (market value less outstanding mortgage) is assessed by reference to the following formula in the case of most schemes (including jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and one parent family payment), as follows:<br/><br/><b>Capital &ndash; Assessment Formula</b><table><tr><th>AMOUNT OF CAPITAL</th><th>WEEKLY MEANS ASSESSED</th></tr><tr><td>Up to &euro;20,000</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;20,000 - &euro;30,000</td><td>&euro;1 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;30,000 - &euro;40,000</td><td>&euro;2 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr><tr><td>Over &euro;40,000</td><td>&euro;4 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr></table><br/><br/>For the purposes of the State pension non-contributory and carer&rsquo;s allowance the amounts above are doubled in the case of a couple. The amount disregarded in the case of disability allowance is &euro;50,000 while &euro;5,000 is disregarded in the case of supplementary welfare allowance.  <br/><br/>The assessment formula is not designed to reflect interest or annuity rates available to investors and no account is taken of interest or dividend payments received in the means assessment. Similarly, the formula does not reflect rental or other income derived from the ownership of property. <br/><br/>The assessment formula reflects the fact that there is an expectation that persons with reasonable amounts of capital and property are in a position to use that capital or to realise the value of property to support themselves without having to rely solely on a means tested welfare payment.  <br/><br/>Any changes to the current arrangements would have to be considered in a Budgetary context.</p></reply>

In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p>  <p>  Self-employed people in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance have access to the full range of activation measures available through the State.  Given the scale of unemployment levels, the key objective of activation policy and labour market initiatives is to offer assistance to those most in need of support in securing work and achieving financial self-sufficiency.  This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.  Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people.  However, many services are available to the formerly self-employed who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment.</p>  <p>  Some employment services, such as assistance with job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices, regardless of their social welfare status.  Unemployed persons, including the previously self-employed, not in receipt of payments may also be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities but are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course.  Springboard courses are open to people who were previously self-employed, regardless of their social welfare status.</p>  <p>  In September 2013, I published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral.</p>  <p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. </p>  <p>  On the basis of the findings of the report of the Advisory Group I am satisfied that the self-employed have access to income support in the event of business failure and I do not propose to make any changes to the PRSI system at this time.  I will keep the situation under review.</p>  <p>  In general the current system of social insurance operates on a mandatory basis and therefore contributors pay PRSI contributions at the rate appropriate to their PRSI class.  Allowing people a facility to opt in or opt out at their own discretion could lead to the selection of bad risks.  The whole principle of social insurance is social solidarity where everybody pays in and, if needed, cover is available. </p></reply>

The function of the Pensions Council is to advise the Minister for Social Protection on matters of relevance to pensions, with a particular focus on policies to support the sustainability and adequacy of pension provision.  It will ensure that the system has a far stronger consumer focus.  Mr Jim Murray, former Director of the European Consumers Organisation (BEUC), who has a notable record as a consumer rights advocate, will chair the Pensions Council.</p>  <p>  The work of the Pensions Council will be advanced through research on pensions policy development, either in terms of significant reports on the overall direction of pension policy, or more discrete pieces of work examining particular subject areas.  Whilst the Pensions Council&rsquo;s inaugural meeting has yet to take place, I have asked that the matter of pensions charges be a priority item for consideration.  I have also asked that the pension gender gap and the gender-proofing of the pensions reform programme be considered.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, in Budget 2015, we partially restored the Christmas Bonus and increased the living alone allowance.

The setting of retirement age is a matter for agreement within the employer/employee relationship and the contract of employment.   </p>  <p>  In relation to the age at which a State pension may be payable, the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provides that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years to make the pension system sustainable in the context of ever increasing life expectancy.  This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition), thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years. State pension age will increase further to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028. </p>  <p>  All short term social welfare schemes are payable to age 66. The main social welfare payment available to those who leave employment before pension age is jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. Persons aged between 65 and 66 years who qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years). </p>  <p>  I was happy to be able to introduce new arrangements in Budget 2014 for older jobseekers, i.e., those aged 62 and over who have left work before reaching the State pension age of 66 and who wish to claim a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment. With effect from 1 January 2014, fully unemployed jobseekers aged 62 or over will be placed on yearly signing and will be given the option of transferring to EFT payments. Furthermore, they will not be subject to mandatory activation measures or activation-related sanctions but may avail of employment support. </p>  <p>  Social welfare supports will continue to be available to those who need it most and where a person fails to meet the qualifying conditions of an insurance based scheme, a means tested assistance payment may be available provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions.</p></reply>

The schemes reviewed included the training employment support grant (TESG) and the technical assistance and training scheme (TATS).  Further work undertaken took account of developments in the supports available to jobseekers and changes in the services offered by Solas and the newly created Education and Training Boards. </p>  <p>  Two new schemes of supports for jobseekers have been introduced in recent months, replacing the above mentioned schemes.  A new enterprise support grant has been put in place to offer specific supports to jobseekers starting their own business and who have been approved for income support under the back to work enterprise allowance scheme.  A training support grant (TSG) has also been developed to support the Department&rsquo;s activation objectives.  </p>  <p>  Like the former TESG, the new TSG is designed to fund quick access to short-term training where this cannot be provided by a state provider within a reasonable time or where a intervention is identified that can support individual jobseekers to access work opportunities. Like the old scheme, the TSG is not designed specifically to provide general training for jobseekers.  Access to the new scheme is via the Department&rsquo;s case officers who are tasked with identifying the most support intervention for jobseekers, particularly where a job opportunity has been identified. </p>  <p>  The maximum fund available to jobseekers under the scheme is &euro;500 p.a.  TSG is designed to be a more activation focused grant than TESG.  The training sought by the jobseeker must form part of the agreed personal progression or action plan to enter/re-enter the labour market.  </p>  <p>  The operational guidelines for the scheme were drawn up to ensure a consistent approach nationally and set out clearly defied criteria for eligibility.  As with all new schemes, the Department will closely monitor implementation and the guidelines will be reviewed over time, if this is found to be necessary.</p></reply>

A jobseeker who is available for and genuinely seeking work can apply for the contribution-based jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, depending on their previous employment history.  While the Department does not provide any specific supports for those wishing to join or return to the taxi industry, a jobseeker may avail of any of the following supports to aid their return to employment/self-employment:<blockquote>- A person who is self-employed can apply for Jobseeker's Allowance if their income falls below a certain level. The applicant can continue in self-employment with their earnings from the business assessed to determine the level of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance that can be paid.<br /><br />- The Short-Term Enterprise Allowance (STEA) gives support to people who have lost their job and want to start their own business.  A person must be in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit payment to qualify and payment will cease when the entitlement to jobseekers benefit expires.<br /><br />- The Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA) scheme is available to support persons who are long-term unemployed and wish to develop or take up self-employment opportunities.  The scheme allows a qualified person to retain a reducing proportion of their social protection payment, plus secondary benefits over a two year period.  However, it is important to note that given the nature of the taxi industry and concerns about displacement of existing operators and viability, the likelihood of a jobseeker being approved for BTWEA to establish a taxi business in relatively low.<br /><br />- A jobseeker may quality to be supported under JobsPlus, an incentive that provides cash subsidies to employers to recruit jobseekers who are longer-term unemployed.</blockquote>Information on accessing schemes and supports for jobseekers is available from DSP Intreo centres with further information available on the Department&rsquo;s website .</p></reply>

Funding of &euro;46m has been provided for the programme in 2015 which will maintain the current level of activity.</p>  <p>  Service providers must operate community or social enterprises that are able to deliver tangible services and are capable of generating non-public revenues from their operations by way of charging fees, sales and/or fundraising.  The programme is not intended to represent full funding for any operation.  Rather, funding is provided on the basis of a contribution to the cost of full-time staffing positions to support the delivery of the service and can include management and non-management elements.</p>  <p>  Given the restrictions on resources, the Department has been unable to make an open call for new proposals to the programme for a number of years.  However, from time to time and as resources allow, the Department does process new applications received from organisations that have expressed an interest in and are considered eligible under the programme.  Any not-for-profit company wishing to express an interest to be considered for the programme can send an expression of interest and its proposals to the Department by email to cspinfo@welfare.ie.</p></reply>

The key objective of these regulations is to increase the resilience of the banking and household sectors to the property market and to reduce the risk of bank credit and house price spirals from developing in the future.  However, it should be noted that there are some exemptions to the rules in certain circumstances.  For example, the principal home loan to value (LTV) ratio restriction will not apply to a borrower in negative equity who wishes to obtain a mortgage for a new home. Additionally, in the case of principal dwelling loans, lenders can exceed the LTV threshold in respect of up to 15% of loans advanced for such purposes and can exceed the loan to income ration in respect of up to 20% of such loans.  These macro prudential measures are supplementary to individual banks' credit policies and are not designed as a substitute for lenders  responsibilities to assess affordability and lend prudently on a case-by-case basis.</p></reply>

The PAYE allowance, as it was then, was introduced in 1980 to improve the tax progression of PAYE taxpayers and to take account of the fact that the self-employed generally then had the advantage of paying tax on a preceding year basis. The argument was also made at the time that the general scheme of allowances for expenses discriminated against employees and in favour of other taxpayers. </p>  <p>  There have been some changes since 1980. For example, the self-employed now pay tax on a current year basis. In addition, the PAYE allowance has become a tax credit. However, there are other aspects to how the self-assessed are taxed which can be beneficial to them. For instance, there are significant timing benefits, depending on the accounting period used by the taxpayer, which are available to the self-assessed but which are not available to PAYE workers. In addition, the expenses regime for self-assessed taxpayers remains somewhat more liberal than that afforded to employees and therefore the self-employed can actually pay less tax when compared to a PAYE worker on the same income.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the changes to the Income Tax system introduced in Budget 2015 will benefit all those who pay income tax and or USC equally, regardless of whether they are PAYE or self-assessed taxpayers.</p>  <p>  As regards PRSI, I assume the Deputy is referring to the 10.75% rate of employers PRSI, which is payable once an employee's income exceeds &euro;356 per week. I would point out that a lower rate of employer PRSI of 8.5% applies where weekly income is &euro;356 or lower. These rates of employer social insurance contributions are very low when compared internationally.</p>  <p>  As regards the encouragement of employment by the self-employed and start-up businesses, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the JobsPlus scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection. This scheme provides cash grants to employers where they employ an individual who is classified as being long-term unemployed. The Government has made additional funds available for this scheme for 2015.</p></reply>

The fall in inflation combined with the fact that inflationary expectations have begun to drift downwards poses a risk to price stability. </p>  <p>  As a result, and with policy rates effectively at zero per cent, the ECB announced an expanded asset purchase programme on January 22nd to include bonds issued by euro area central governments, agencies and European institutions. Under this expanded programme, the combined monthly purchases of public and private sector debt securities will amount to &euro;60 billion. </p>  <p>  These monthly purchases are intended to be carried out from March 2015 until end-September 2016 and will, in any case, be conducted until inflation moves onto a path consistent with price stability. Price stability in the euro area, in turn, has been defined as annual inflation of close to but below 2 per cent (inflation being measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices). </p>  <p>  Decisions on and the implementation of monetary policy in the euro area are entirely a matter for the Governing Council of the ECB, which is independent in these matters. I note, however, that there is  some mutualisation: the Governing Council decided that 20 per cent of the additional asset purchases under the programme will be subject to risk sharing. Moreover, the scale of the asset purchase programme is rightly seen as being the more important issue, as well as the  fact that it is potentially open-ended.</p></reply>

(The factors range from 37, in respect of pension benefits accrued after 1 January 2014 and drawn down at age 50 or under, to 22 in respect of benefits drawn down at age 70 or over.) <br /><br />- Finally, the reimbursement options, introduced in Finance Act 2012, for public servants affected by chargeable excess tax are being amended and extended.  </blockquote>As occurred on the occasion of the introduction of the SFT regime in 2005, and again when the value of the SFT limit was reduced to &euro;2.3m in 2010, the legislation contained in Finance (No 2) Act 2013 provides for an individual who has pension rights on 1 January 2014 in excess of the new lower SFT limit of &euro;2m, to claim a Personal Fund Threshold (PFT) from Revenue in order to protect or  grandfather  the value of those rights on that date. This is subject to a maximum PFT of &euro;2.3m, and individuals with PFTs from 2005 or 2010 retain those PFTs.  <br/><br/>The primary purpose of the changes made to the SFT regime is to further restrict the capacity of higher earners to fund or accrue large pensions through tax-subsidised sources in line with the commitment made in the Government programme for National Recovery 2011-2016. In addition, the introduction of higher age-related factors to value DB pension entitlements significantly improves the equity of the SFT regime as between DB and defined contribution (DC) pension arrangements and between those who retire at younger ages and those who retire later in life. <br/><br/>The SFT regime addresses the problem of pension overfunding and excessive pension accrual by dealing with it at the point of pension drawdown in retirement rather than by applying restrictions to pension savings or accrual upfront. The regime achieves this by imposing a significant tax charge on the value of retirement benefits above set limits (the SFT or PFT, as appropriate) when they are drawn down. In this way it acts to discourage the building up of large pension funds in the first place or unwinds the tax advantage of such overfunding by clawing back, through the tax charge, the tax relief granted. <br/><br/>In Finance Act 2014, I introduced further amendments to the SFT regime to deal with issues arising in cases involving Pension Adjustment Orders (PAOs) the purpose of which is to provide for a more equitable sharing of the chargeable excess tax between the parties to PAOs in affected cases where the SFT or PFT, as appropriate, is exceeded.</p></reply>

The ISIF funds are broken down further into a repayable loan from the ISIF of &euro;240m and an equity investment in the name of the Minister for Finance to the value of &euro;10m. After the initial period of operations, the SBCI in conjunction with its funders, will review its funding requirements for its further development.  </p>  <p>  The SBCI drew down &euro;200m of its funding from the European Investment Bank during December 2014 so that funds could be borrowed by its lending partners to be distributed to SMEs. </p>  <p>  The SBCI is preparing for a nationwide launch of its products shortly.  The Government's aim for the SBCI is to change the range and profile of SME finance providers in Ireland.  The SBCI are achieving this by working with existing and new providers to develop enhanced products and by supporting new entrants to the SME lending market.</p></reply>

The tax is charged on the amount gifted to, or inherited by, the beneficiary of the gift or inheritance. <br/><br/>For the purposes of CAT, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary), determines the maximum life-time tax-free threshold known as the &quot;Group threshold&quot; below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.<br/><br/>There are, in all, three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer:<br/><br/>The Group A tax-free threshold of &euro;225,000<b></b>applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer. Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.<br/><br/>The Group B tax-free threshold of &euro;30,150 applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, nephew, niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.<br/><br/>The Group C tax-free threshold &euro;15,075 applies in all other cases.<br/><br/>Where a person receives gifts or inheritances in excess of their relevant tax free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax free threshold.  It should also be noted that the thresholds apply on an individual basis so that, for example, where there are two children the current Group A threshold of &euro;225,000 applies individually to each child in respect of gifts and inheritances from their parents.<br/><br/>The Group thresholds have been reduced over recent years, as asset prices have fallen, in order to maintain the yield from capital taxes as part of the effort to restore the public finances.  Taxes on capital are less harmful from an economic perspective than taxes on employment.<br/><br/>The property market continues to improve with positive developments which had been restricted to the Dublin area now manifesting in other areas of the country though not to the same extent in terms of price rises.  I recognize, of course, that there are supply issues in certain areas of the Dublin property market. <br/><br/>The Group tax-free thresholds are kept under review, in the same way as other relevant tax provisions, and in this regard I will bear the Deputy's comments and concerns in mind for the future.<br/><br/>In the details supplied with his first question, the Deputy refers to a constituent who is concerned about the CAT implications arising from being bequeathed the family home, in which I understand from the details that the constituent still resides.  I would point out to the Deputy that Section 86 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 provides for a specific exemption from CAT in respect of a gift or inheritance of a dwelling house. <br/><br/>This exemption was introduced to cater for persons who had been living in the disponer's house for a substantial period prior to the gift or inheritance and who might otherwise be faced with having to sell the house (their home) to pay the CAT liability.  This would apply in particular to children who continued to reside with their parents into their old agevery often to care for them.  The following are the main conditions to be satisfied in order to benefit from the dwelling house CAT exemption:<br/><br/>- The recipient must have occupied the dwelling house continuously as his or her only or main residence for a period of three years prior to the date of the gift or inheritance<br/><br/>- The recipient must not , at the date of the gift or inheritance, be beneficially entitled to any other dwelling house or have an interest in any other dwelling house<br/><br/>- The recipient must continue to occupy the dwelling house for a period of six years commencing on the date of the gift or inheritance, except where the recipient was aged 55 years at that date or dies in this period. <br/><br/>The Deputy's constituent may wish to contact her local Revenue Office if she needs to clarify any issue in relation to this exemption.</p></reply>

While the figures quoted by the Deputy are accurate, it is important to understand that PAYE workers and the self-employed are taxed in different ways to reflect their differing circumstances. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, employees in the PAYE system benefit from a PAYE income tax credit worth &euro;1,650 per annum, to which the self-assessed are not entitled. The PAYE allowance, as it was then, was introduced in 1980 to improve the tax progression of PAYE taxpayers and to take account of the fact that the self-employed generally then had the advantage of paying tax on a preceding year basis. The argument was also made at the time that the general scheme of allowances for expenses discriminated against employees and in favour of other taxpayers. </p>  <p>  There have been some changes since 1980. For example, the self-employed now pay tax on a current year basis. In addition, the PAYE allowance has become a tax credit. However, there are other aspects to how the self-assessed are taxed which can be beneficial to them. For instance, there are significant timing benefits, depending on the accounting period used by the taxpayer, which are available to the self-assessed but which are not available to PAYE workers. In addition, the expenses regime for self-assessed taxpayers remains somewhat more liberal than that afforded to employees and therefore the self-employed can actually pay less tax when compared to a PAYE worker on the same income.</p>  <p>  It is true that employees are exempt from the charge to PRSI if their income does not exceed &euro;18,304. However, once PAYE income exceeds this threshold they are liable to pay PRSI on the full amount at 4%, thus equalising the treatment of personal PRSI contributions, on all of the income, for PAYE and self-assessed workers on incomes above that level. </p>  <p>  In the case of employees, their employers are required to pay a PRSI charge in respect of each employee. Thus the contribution made to the Social Insurance Fund in respect of employees is usually higher than that made by a self-assessed individual. For instance, at an income level of &euro;100,000, an employer would typically be required to pay PRSI of &euro;10,750 in respect of the employee, in addition to the &euro;4,000 payable by the employee. Total PRSI of &euro;4,000 is payable in respect of a self-employed individual with the same income. Entitlement to social welfare benefits is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social Protection. However, it is worth pointing out that for individuals with incomes in excess of &euro;18,304 the total PRSI payable in respect of an employee is 14.75% of salary, while the total payable by a self-employed individual is 4%.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the changes to the Income Tax system introduced in Budget 2015 will benefit all those who pay income tax and or USC equally, regardless of whether they are PAYE or self-assessed taxpayers.</p></reply>

These provide for the following measures;-</p>  <p>Principal dwelling house (PDH) mortgages are subject to a Loan to Value (LTV) limit of 80% of the value of the property;</p>  <p>- For first time buyers,  the LTV limit in respect of a PDH mortgage is 90% up to a value of &euro;220,000 and 80% on any excess value over that amount;</p>  <p>- Buy to Let (BTL) mortgages are subject to an LTV limit of 70%;</p>  <p>- PDH mortgage loans are also subject to a loan to income (LTI) limit of 3.5 times gross income.</p>  <p>  The central Bank has informed me that lenders, however will have a certain limited discretion to exceed these limits if they so choose.  These macro prudential measures are complementary to existing micro-prudential supervision and to lenders' own risk management practices.  They are not intended to capture credit risk associated with a particular loan or borrower, nor to replace or substitute for a lender's existing internal credit assessment policies and procedures, but rather to reinforce and strengthen the existing suite of credit risk mitigation tools employed by prudent lenders.  Credit institutions will have internal policies in relation to specific risks or products and individual banks are free to adopt stricter measures as part of their underwriting decisions and their individual risk management practices.</p></reply>

This includes those who act as an agent for undertakings providing hire purchase agreements.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission further regulates the advertising of credit facilities by authorised credit intermediaries.  To obtain an authorisation, the intermediary must hold a letter of recognition for each undertaking for which he is an intermediary, a current tax clearance certificate, and be a fit an proper person to carry on the business of a credit intermediary.  All credit intermediaries must display an authorised copy of their authorisation prominently in their premises and they appear in the CCPC's online register.</p>  <p>  There are no legislative requirements that oblige hire purchase providers to seek an authorisation from the Central Bank for the provision of hire purchase agreements to consumers and or to small businesses.  Notwithstanding this, hire purchase providers are required to comply with the relevant provisions of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 when providing hire purchase agreements to consumers acting outside their business.  Research is currently being carried out on behalf of the Central Bank in order to obtain information on the hire-purchase market, such as information about the number and identities of firms providing hire purchase agreements, the purpose and features of the agreements, the level of commitment by the consumer, the level of arrears and default, and the level and type of complaints.</p>  <p>  In the case of small and medium enterprises, where hire purchase is provided by a bank under its banking license, the bank is required to comply with the Central Bank s Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises.</p>  <p>  The remit of the Financial Services Ombudsman includes complaints in relation to the providers of hire purchase agreements under Regulation 2 of the Central Bank Act 1942 (Financial Services Ombudsman) Regulations 2005 (SI 191 of 2005).  The Financial Services Ombudsman is a statutory officer who deals independently with complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with financial service providers that have not been resolved by the providers after they have been through the internal complaints resolution systems of the providers.</p></reply>

Works in the City area were completed by 2009 with approximately &euro;7.5m expended in the City area out of a total of &euro;19.3m.  In general, the works were carried out directly by the Office of Public Works (OPW) with some aspects being undertaken by external contractors who were employed by the relevant Local Authority who acted as the Contracting Authorities in their area.<br/><br/>The works undertaken were as a result of the recommendations of the River Tolka Study completed in 2003.  The recommendations were made in order to provide the standard 1 in 100 year level of protection for properties against extreme flood events which applies to the OPW flood relief schemes, i.e. a flood with a 1% probability of occurring in any given year.<br/><br/>The works carried out in the City area included:<br/><br/>- Replacement of Woodville Road footbridge,<br/><br/>- Replacement of Distillery Road Bridge,<br/><br/>- Construction of walls<br/><br/>- Construction of embankments<br/><br/>- Widening of River channel<br/><br/>- General River cleaning<br/><br/>- Lowering of Weirs<br/><br/>- Construction of Fish passes<br/><br/>- Capping of walls<br/><br/>- Construction of pumping station<br/><br/>The OPW is satisfied that the works carried out fulfil the intention of providing the standard flood protection to all properties in the City area highlighted in the Study.<br/><br/>In March 2014, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between Insurance Ireland, the representative body for the insurance industry in Ireland, and the Office of Public Works.  This Memorandum sets out principles of how the two organisations will work together to ensure that appropriate and relevant information on completed OPW flood defence schemes is provided to insurers to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, the availability to the public of insurance against the risk of flooding.  The Memorandum came into effect on 1 June, 2014 with an initial tranche of data provided by the OPW to Insurance Ireland in respect of 12 completed flood defence schemes (including the Tolka scheme in Dublin city) and showing the design, extent and nature of the protection offered by these works.  Since then, data on a further four completed flood relief schemes has been communicated to Insurance Ireland in the agreed format and data on further completed schemes will be provided in due course.  The arrangements set out in the Memorandum represent an ongoing process which, over time, should lead to an improvement in the availability of flood insurance cover.  The text of the Memorandum of Understanding and further information on the process is available on the OPW website at .<br/><br/>Since the signing of the Memorandum, contact has continued between OPW and Insurance Ireland.  The implementation of the Memorandum has been discussed at a number of meetings at both official and Ministerial level involving Insurance Ireland, the Office of Public Works and the Department of Finance.<br/><br/>Early indications are that flood risk insurance is widely available in areas where flood relief schemes have been completed by the OPW.  A definitive breakdown on the provision of flood risk insurance will not be available until after June of this year, when a full renewal cycle has been completed following the coming into effect of the Memorandum.<br/><br/>The OPW and the Department of Finance will continue contact, including meetings, with Insurance Ireland to review the operation of the Memorandum of Understanding.</p></reply>

This compares with the previous estimate of &euro;116bn for 2009 which was arrived at by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;amp;AG).  Therefore, over the three years from 2009 to 2012 the liability has fallen by &euro;18bn or by 16%.  The main reasons for the reduction were the pay and pension cuts since 2009 and the freeze in pay and pension rates until after the Haddington Road Agreement.<br/><br/>This figure of &euro;98bn represents the present value of all expected future superannuation payments to current staff and their spouses in respect of service to December 2012, plus the liability for all future payments to current and preserved pensioners and to their spouses.  The pension payments to discharge this liability will therefore be spread over the next 70 years or so.<br/><br/>Historically Public Service pension increases were on the basis of pay parity i.e. in line with the pay of the grade from which the public servant retired.  The figure of &euro;98bn above was based on pay parity applying in future.  An alternative accrued liability figure was also estimated; this was based on pension increases in line with CPI (after 2016) and the associated accrued liability figure was &euro;82bn.<br/><br/>The accrued liability figures set out above provide a broad indicator of the size of fund that would be needed to provide for Public Service pension benefits in the event that a fund were to be established for public service occupational pensions.  In contrast, future pension payments will be paid for on an ongoing basis from the State's income, which also includes the employee pension contributions made by serving public servants.  In assessing the affordability and sustainability of public service pension costs met on a &quot;pay as you go&quot; basis, a key measure in addition to the overall liability is the expected level of actual total annual spending on pensions in future years relative to an indicator of income like GDP.  Latest projections are for the total expenditure on public service pensions, if the link to pay is maintained, to increase from 2.3% of GDP in 2015 to 2.9% in 2030 and then to fall steadily to 1.5% of GDP by 2060.  This reduction in annual costs in the longer term is largely due to the introduction by the current Government of the new Single Public Service Pension Scheme, which changed the benefits for public servants appointed from 1 January 2013.</p></reply>

This was necessary to ensure that rapidly emerging business needs were met.</p>  <p>  Last year, as there was a wider need for Clerical Officers right across the Civil Service, the Public Appointments Service (PAS) conducted an open recruitment competition to establish a panel of candidates for permanent Clerical Officer posts.  Anyone, including staff assigned to PeoplePoint, was entitled to apply for Clerical Officer posts.  This process was fully transparent. 18 Temporary Clerical Officers working in PeoplePoint were successful in this competition and have been appointed on the usual probationary basis.  Only one candidate working in PeoplePoint declined the offer of a permanent post.</p>  <p>  PeoplePoint is currently in the process of transitioning this temporary structure to a permanent Clerical Officer structure.  This process will take six months in order to ensure business continuity and to assist with the integration of new clerical staff.  Consequently some longer serving Temporary Clerical Officers will remain in their positions until 28 August 2015.  For those staff on fixed-term contracts who are leaving, structured support is being offered to assist them with future employment, including guidance on CV and interview preparation.  The skills and experience gained while working in PeoplePoint can be added to their curriculum vitaes.</p>  <p>  Some staff who are leaving have already been offered other roles.</p></reply>

Of this sum of &euro;69.5 million, up to &euro;19.6 million was allocated for repair of existing coastal protection and flood defences based on submissions and cost estimates made by the local authorities concerned to the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government(DoECLG).  This funding for repair of damaged coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure is being made available to the local authorities via the Office of Public Works (OPW) based on programmes of works submitted by the local authorities.  The Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Transport, Tourism and Sport and Agriculture, Food and the Marine are responsible for the approval of programmes of work and the disbursement of funding for repair of other damaged public infrastructure such as roads, piers, harbours and other community facilities and amenities, and would be in a position to provide information to the Deputy in that regard.<br/><br/>Based on the programmes of works of repairs to coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure that were submitted by local authorities, total funding of &euro;19.070 million was approved by the OPW for 176 projects that were deemed to be within the scope of the works covered by the Government Decision.  The prioritisation and progression of projects is entirely a matter for the local authorities concerned.<br/><br/>To the end of 2014, OPW paid local authorities a total &euro;7.675m of the total allocation based on draw down claims submitted by the local authorities for funding in respect of projects that have been completed, are under construction, or where contracts for the works have been placed.  A substantial part of the approved funding was not drawn down in 2014 due to a variety of factors.  The local authorities are continuing to progress with works and further draw down requests are expected to be submitted and processed in 2015.  Provision has been included  in the OPW's 2015 Vote to allow local authorities to draw down the unexpended balance of funding this year.  The remaining total funding available for draw down by local authorities in 2015 is &euro;11.395m for projects approved for funding by the OPW in 2014 but for which no funding or partial funding has been drawn down to date by local authorities.  As all programmes of works were approved for funding in 2014 there is no requirement for a further approval process in 2015.<br/><br/><b>Details of projects approved by OPW in 2014</b><table><tr><th><div>Local Authority</div></th><th><div>Project Location</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>Clare County Council</div></td><td>New Quay</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>R477 Ballyvaughan</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Doolin</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Clahane, Liscannor</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Liscannor</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Lahinch</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>White Strand, Miltown Malbay</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Spanish Point</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Seafield Pier</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Carrowmore</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Rhynnagonnaught, Doonbeg</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Whitestrand/ Doonmore, Doonbeg</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Baltard<br /><br />(south of Doonbeg)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Kilkee</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Ross Bay</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Kilbaha</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Cloughansavan /<br /><br />Kilclogher</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Fodra</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Rinevella Beach</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Rinevella</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Kilcredaun Irish College</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Carrigaholt</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Cappagh, Kilrush</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Carrowdotia, N67 Moneypoint</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Knock</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Labasheeda</td></tr><tr><td><div>Cork County Council</div></td><td>Durrus-Ahakista Road- Phase 1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Point Road, Crosshaven</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Belvelly, Cobh</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Summercove Kinsale</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Gerahies Sea Wall- Phase 1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Ballydonegan Beach</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Red Strand, Ardfield, Clonakilty</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Garryvoe, Midleton</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>South Harbour, Cape Clear Island</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Pier Road, Rosscarbery</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Hare Island</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Cow Strand Wall Sherkin Island</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Saleen- East Ferry, Midleton</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Garrahies Sea Wall- Phase 2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Durrus- Ahakista Road- Phase 2</td></tr><tr><td><div>Donegal County Council</div></td><td>Inver</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Ards, Creeslough</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Shore Road, Mountcharles</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Shore Road, Killybegs</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Buncrana Shore Walk</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Creey Pier</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Bundoran West end Carpark</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Bundoran Main Beach</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Aranmore</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Tory Island</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Moville Shore Path</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Mill Bay, Inch Island</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Keadue Bridge</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Melmore</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Maghery/<br /><br />Termon Road</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>White Strand</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Rossbeg Pier Road</td></tr><tr><td><div>Fingal County Council</div></td><td>Portmarnock Beach</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Strand Road, Sutton</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Portrane Beach</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Sea Wall Barnageera, Skerries</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>South Strand Street, Skerries</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Burrow Beach, Portrane</td></tr><tr><td><div>Galway City Council</div></td><td>Silverstrand/<br /><br />Blackrock to Birdoo/<br /><br />Blackrock to Southpark</td></tr><tr><td><div>Galway County Council</div></td><td>Causeway at Lettermore, Gorumna, B&eacute;al an Daingean &amp;amp;

It became law via the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2010 and was subsequently amended via the FEMPI (Amendment) Act 2011 and the FEMPI Act 2013. Detailed application of the public service pension reduction in accordance with the legislation is a matter for the individual public service pension paying authority.</p>  <p>  The PSPR is a progressive reduction whereby those on higher pensions are impacted by a proportionately greater reduction than those on lower pensions who are impacted by a lower reduction or are exempt. Pensioners on &euro;12,000 per year or less are fully exempt from PSPR, with a higher exemption threshold of &euro;32,500 applying to pensioners who retired over the last three years. There are currently 3 different PSPR rate tables; the particular table which applies to any affected pension depends on when the pension was awarded and the size of the pension. </p>  <p>  Based on the details supplied, it is assumed that the pension referred to in the Deputy's question was awarded on or before 29 February 2012. For all such pensions the threshold before PSPR applies is &euro;12,000. From 1 July 2013 following the FEMPI 2013 Act, pensions in this category with a pre-PSPR value above &euro;34,132 were subject to an increase in the PSPR imposition through the application of a table of higher PSPR rates, reflecting the Government's decision to secure an additional reduction in the public service pension bill, while avoiding further impacts in the case of pensioners on relatively lower pensions.</p>  <p>  Additionally, section 5(4) of the FEMPI 2013 Act specifies that in circumstances where the application of the table of higher PSPR rates to pensions in payment on or before 29 February 2012 would reduce the pension in payment below the &euro;32,500 threshold, a smaller reduction will be applied ensuring the pension is not reduced below &euro;32,500.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

Work is continuing on the preparations for the full implementation of the Act, as the commencement of the Act is dependent on a number of factors set out in the legislation. These factors include the appointment of a Panel of Adjudicators by Minister Nash and the selection of the adjudicators for this Panel will be achieved through an open competitive process to be arranged by the Public Appointments Service, at the earliest opportunity. Minister Nash is also overseeing the preparation of a Code of Practice for the conduct of adjudications, which will be binding on all adjudicators operating under the Act, the drafting of which is at an advanced stage and will be finalised after consultations have concluded with the construction industry stakeholders. A specific date for implementation of the Act will be announced in advance once the necessary arrangements have been finalised, in order to provide sufficient notice to those affected by the Act's provisions.</p></reply>

Member States' entitlement to provide for audit exemption for small companies derives from EU legislation prescribing the maximum thresholds capable of being employed by Member States to determine small company size.  These thresholds relate to net turnover and balance sheet total and number of employees.Under the Fourth Company Law Directive (78/660/EC) Member States can provide for small companies to avail of an exemption from the requirement to have their individual accounts audited.  This exemption applies to the accounts prepared for the members.<br/><br/>Currently, to be eligible for audit exemption, Ireland requires, among other things, that a private limited company meet all three of the size criteria (balance sheet total, turnover and average number of employees).  The company must not be either a parent or a subsidiary.  In Ireland, companies engaged in certain activities, essentially those in the nature of financial services, cannot avail of the exemption.<br/><br/>The audit exemption thresholds applicable in Ireland were raised to the maxima permitted by the European Union, under Directive 2006/46/EC, as implemented by S.I. 308 of August 2012.  These current thresholds, which are also set out in the Companies Act 2014, are balance sheet total of &euro;4.4m, net turnover of &euro;8.8m and average number of employees during the financial year of 50.<br/><br/>In addition, the Companies Act 2014 extends the scope of the application of the audit exemption to a company limited by guarantee, a company that is either a parent or a subsidiary or a dormant company.  Also, to be eligible for audit exemption, the Act includes a provision that an eligible company need only meet two of the three size criteria. <br/><br/>The Accounting Directive (2013/34/EU) replaces the Fourth Company Law Directive (78/660/EC).  Work on the transposition of the Accounting Directive is currently being progressed by my Department and is required under the Directive to be transposed by 20 July 2015.  This Directive increases the current permissible maximum thresholds which Member States may establish for net turnover and balance sheet total to &euro;12m. and &euro;6m. respectively - the maximum permissible threshold for number of employees remains unchanged. Consideration is being given, in the context of the Department&rsquo;s transposition of the Accounting Directive, as to whether to maintain these thresholds at their current levels or to provide for increases and, if the latter, what levels it might be appropriate to establish.<br/><br/>If the decision is to provide for increased thresholds, this will be done by way of an appropriate amendment to the Companies Act 2014.</p></reply>

There are currently 117 such centres across the country. The last scheme rolled out was in 2012 and 2013 when Enterprise Ireland provided funding of &euro;2 million to support the recruitment of a total of 46 Business Development Managers. I plan to introduce a new approach which will draw lessons from the 2012 programme. This new programme will be part of a much more comprehensive strategy to develop enterprise at regional and local level. My aim is to enhance the impact of the CEC network on continuing  job creation through this strategy.</p>  <p>  On the wider issue of the Centres, the success levels, occupancy levels and sustainability of jobs at the Centres varies and therefore I asked Enterprise Ireland to review the operations of the Community Enterprise Centres in the context of regional enterprise development and how the Community Enterprise Centres and the Local Enterprise Offices might work more closely in support of business start-ups before giving further consideration to the matter.</p>  <p>  Under the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs, my Department developed a framework for the preparation of Regional Enterprise Strategies. This framework provides a model for co-ordinated action across public bodies and other stakeholders to maximise the potential of each region to support enterprise development and jobs growth, based on the strengths and assets of the region.</p>  <p>  The application of the template was tested in the Midlands region towards the end of 2014 and will lead to the publication and implementation of a Regional Enterprise Strategy for the Midlands in the coming weeks. Similar strategies for the other regions will be commenced over the course of the year, on a phased basis, and will include specific actions on the part of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, the LEOs, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and other public bodies active in each region to promote enterprise growth and job creation. The Regional Enterprise Strategies will provide new funding for enterprise support in the regions and seek to leverage and orient existing funds to target initiatives that enable regions to achieve their full employment potential. A significant regional fund of up to &euro;25 million in competitive funding will be announced to support regional initiatives. In this context, my Department and Enterprise Ireland will also work to explore how the Community Enterprise Centre network can best be enhanced to support regional job creation.</p></reply>

The locations of these sites are set out in the tabular statement.  The site in Mullagharlin has advanced planning for a bio pharma campus.<br/><br/>The availability of an adequate supply of marketable, serviced land and office and industrial / technology buildings in advance of demand is a key element in IDA Ireland&rsquo;s ability to compete for mobile FDI.<br/><br/>The availability of property solutions eliminates the lead times normally associated with acquiring property, enables clients to plan their property needs with a greater degree of certainty and allows for the commencement of projects at an earlier date by eliminating much of the difficulties associated with land acquisition, planning and construction.<br/><br/>At the end of 2014, there were 23 IDA Ireland client companies in County Louth, employing 3,029 people in full and part time employment.  IDA Ireland has strong relationships with all these companies and works closely with them to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and continuing re-investment in their sites.<br/><br/>County Louth has strong clusters in international business services, with companies in the region such as eBay, Coca-Cola, National Pen and International Fund Services; and in manufacturing with companies such as Cargotec and Becton Dickinson. These international brands are an attraction for additional companies to potentially locate to the North East region. In 2014 alone Becton Dickson announced a &euro;16m investment and expansion of its headquarters in Drogheda while PayPal announced the expansion of its facility in Dundalk with creation of a further 400 jobs.<br/><br/>As the Deputy is aware, the Action Plan for Jobs 2015 was launched recently.

The Government is determined that this progress continues so that full employment can be achieved by 2018.<br/><br/>While it is very encouraging that 94% of new jobs being created are full-time, in accordance with the Statement of Government priorities, Minister Bruton has commissioned a study into the prevalence of zero hour and low hour contracts and the impact of such contracts on employees. The key objectives of the study are:<br/><br/>- To fill the gap that currently exists in terms of the hard data and information that is available concerning the prevalence of zero hour and low hour contracts in the Irish economy and the manner of their use.<br/><br/>- To assess the impact of zero hour and low hour contract on employees.<br/><br/>- To enable the Minister to make any evidence-based policy recommendations to Government considered necessary on foot of the study.<br/><br/>All sectors of the economy, both public and private, will come within the scope of the study, and a <font color="#2F2F2F">wide range of stakeholders will be canvassed to contribute to it.

My office and Department through Enterprise Ireland is in continuing contact with the company and my Department is briefed as appropriate.  Enterprise Ireland will continue to offer any assistance possible to the company so that it can explore opportunities to develop and grow the business, as envisaged by the company. </p></reply>

They pull together all the players &ndash; other Government Departments and Agencies &ndash; to support everyone with a good business idea and strengthen the enterprise sector in the local area. The LEOs are the first port of call in terms of advice, direction, training and, in certain circumstances, grant support for anyone who wishes to start or expand a business.</p>  <p>  The main role for the Business Advisors and Assistant Business Advisors working within all LEOs is to help meet the business development needs of all clients that come to the LEO for business advice. In performing this task, the Advisors rely upon their wealth of experience as well as the range of formal training courses that they have attended. In this regard, staff in the LEOs need to be able to respond to changing markets and, to this end, the Centre of Excellence in Enterprise Ireland is working with the LEOs to develop and implement a training plan that meets the ongoing training needs of all LEO staff.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, LEOs maintain a list of experienced mentors to whom clients can be assigned, as necessary. For example, Business Advisors can refer clients to a mentor currently working within their sector who has specialist skills not available to the staff in the LEO. These mentors can provide the clients with practical advice and guidance as well as market and business insights and, if relevant, introductions.</p>  <p>  I am therefore satisfied that the Business Advisors in the LEOs can provide clients with, or direct them to, the supports necessary to establish and grow their business.</p></reply>

This is transposed into Irish law through Statutory Instrument S.I. No., 427 of 2013 as amended.</p>  <p>  Biocidal products, including rodenticides used for the control of rodents, are evaluated and authorised for placing on the market under Regulation 528/2012 as amended and S.I. No. 427 of 2013 as amended. This regulatory system   is designed to ensure a very high level of protection for man, animals and the environment. The evaluation examines the risks to the environment, humans and animals and only approves products that can be used safely without any unacceptable risks to man or the environment . It also applies risk mitigation measures to the products to further reduce these risks.</p>  <p>  In the case of rodenticides, my Department is the Irish Competent Authority for biocides and has placed restrictions on pack sizes available for purchase by amateur users. The product labels also instruct users to collect dead rodent bodies and unused bait and safely dispose of these.</p>  <p>  A group called the &lsquo;Campaign for Responsible Rodenticide Use &ndash; CRRU Ireland&rsquo;, which involves companies engaged in the rodenticide industry and relevant state agencies, including my Department and the National Parks and Wildlife Service , has been established to promote best practice and responsible rodent control thereby enhancing the process of protecting wildlife from rodenticide exposure. Among the activities that CRRU Ireland is engaged in is the organisation and delivery of   &ldquo;Wildlife Aware&rdquo; training courses, and associated accreditation scheme, for professional pest control technicians and other competent users of rodenticides. A series of courses were held in 2014 and a further series of courses have been arranged for 2015.</p></reply>

Thus, frontline services are being fully maintained and public access for all of the Department&rsquo;s stakeholders will continue to be available in the Tralee office.</p>  <p>  The transfer of administrative functions out of the Tralee office arises from an extensive review of the local office structure which was carried out by the Department over the last number of years.  This review concluded that, arising from investment in technology and the substantial reduction in disease levels in recent years, significant efficiencies would accrue from the centralisation of administrative functions, thereby giving rise to scope for redeployment of administrative staff from existing local offices.  </p>  <p>  In line with Government policy, my Department has actively sought redeployment opportunities for administrative staff in local offices and in the vast majority of cases, arrangements have been made to maintain staff in their existing geographic location.  However, in the case of Tralee, while my Department, together with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, pursued all avenues to identify redeployment opportunities there, unfortunately it was not possible to identify any at that location.  Given that no options were available in Tralee, my Department acceded to a request from the Financial Shared Services Centre in Killarney and redeployed the staff there in accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014.</p></reply>

In order to establish the most appropriate response for forest owners and the forest industry a taskforce, chaired by Mr Tom Hayes TD, Minister of State, and comprising relevant forestry stakeholders was put in place to assess the damage nationally and to identify the various issues arising. The taskforce issued a guidance note for forest owners, laying down the steps to consider in safely harvesting and selling the fallen trees and giving advice on a range of other associated issues. Teagasc, in association with Coillte and my Department held two very successful events on managing storm damage in farm forests. These events were attended by over 400 forest owners.

Under the Terms &amp;amp; Conditions of the Direct Aid Schemes, which includes the Single Payment scheme, farmers are obliged to declare only eligible land when making their applications and to exclude ineligible features such as roads, buildings, farmyards, dense scrub, etc.  These claims are then recorded on the Department&rsquo;s Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS).  Given the importance of the LPIS database in underpinning direct aid payments worth in excess of &euro;1.5 billion annually, the Department is obliged under EU Regulations to ensure its accuracy.<br/><br/>Following consultation with the EU Commission, as part of the normal Accounting process, the Department was requested to undertake a complete review of the LPIS database.  This has resulted in the necessity to adjust parcels of a significant number of applicants, where it was established that some ineligible features had been included.  In certain circumstances these adjustments have given rise to penalties.<br/><br/>A comprehensive review and appeals process has been implemented to ensure that the cases of individual farmers are fully scrutinised.  In the first instance, a farmer, who finds himself or herself in this position, can seek a review of the original decision by Department officials.  If they are not happy with the outcome of the review, they can submit an appeal to the<i>independently-chaired LPIS Appeals Committee</i>.</p></reply>

The scheme gives priority access to those farmers who have valuable environmental assets , and the retention of rare breeds falls into this category.  The conservation and preservation of breeds which are under threat is vitally important in the context of halting the loss of biodiversity, which is why those farmers who have continued to maintain these breeds will be given priority access into the Scheme under Tier 1.  Any farmers who had registered livestock in 2012 and/or 2013 will be eligible to join the first tranche of the Scheme and this will target those who have traditionally been engaged in this valuable work.

At the subsequent meeting of the RoundTable held last week, there was a general consensus that progress was being made in delivering on the outcomes agreed in November, although further work was required in a number of areas.  This was accompanied by a strong commitment from all participants to continue this work.  As the Deputy notes, Processors agreed at the November Round Table to a targeted, cost neutral price incentive for all steers and heifers from Quality Assured farms with effect from 1st January, based on consideration of an appropriate mechanism to be agreed by then.  Following on from this, Meat Industry Ireland, the representative body for the meat processors announced with effect from 1 January a &euro;3 per head bonus payment for steers and heifers from Quality Assured farms that do not qualify for the current 12c/kg in-spec bonus.</p>  <p>  A number of farm organisations believe that a higher bonus payment is warranted, but welcome d the fact that the current 12c/ kg in spec bonus had not been replaced in order to deliver the new bonus payment.  This position was noted at the RoundTable meeting last week.  This is a commercial matter of course.  I have encouraged the processors and farm organisations to discuss any further adjustments to the Quality Assurance arrangements that may be necessary, as appropriate.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to be aware that in addition to focussing on the ongoing implementation of the outcomes agreed at the Roundtable meeting in November, the most recent meeting last week considered the improved beef market position and strategic issues concerning bull beef production in Ireland.  The Roundtable tasked a stakeholder group, led by Teagasc, with preparing written guidelines for beef farmers which would act as a blueprint for those currently producing bull beef or those considering developing bull beef production systems, taking into account production efficiency and market dynamics.  I also updated stakeholders on progress as regards the development of Producer Organisations in Ireland, a key proposal to emerge from the Roundtable process. </p>  <p>  I am confident that with positive engagement from all the stakeholders, the forum can continue to make a significant contribution to the strategic development of the beef sector.</p></reply>

The proposed BDGP would deliver an accelerated improvement in the environmental sustainability of the beef herd via the application of genomics technology.  This will help farmers to manage their enterprises sustainbly, cognisant of Ireland&rsquo;s climate change commitments, and will improve the quality of the national suckler herd.  It will also cement our place amongst the more progressive beef producing nations in the world. </p>  <p>  Subject to the approval of the Rural Development Programme by the EU Commission, farmers will be paid for work carried out in a range of areas related to data recording and animal breeding policies.  The actions being considered for the Programme include recording a range of data related to performance criteria and animal events, taking tissue (DNA) samples from selected animals and sending for laboratory testing, completing an on-farm Carbon Navigator, and selecting high quality replacement bulls and heifers over the 6 years of the BDGP contract.</p>  <p>  All Rural Development Plans submitted to the European Commission are subject to approval, following a detailed period of analysis and discussion.  The Commission has provided observations on the BDGP and my Department has been engaged in intensive discussions to address issues raised and to provide the necessary clarifications.  The scheme will be rolled out without delay following approval, with application forms issuing to all eligible farmers. Given that this is a 6 year scheme, with very specific actions spread over the full duration, I can assure the Deputy that these farmers will be given sufficient time to allow them to fully analyse the requirements of the scheme and to submit their applications as appropriate.</p></reply>

During these unannounced inspections, 51,017 carcases were checked by regionally based DAFM Classification officers for conformation and fat, weights, dressing (Trim) and labelling.

Live exports serve a dual purpose as a means of satisfying market demand for live animals and providing alternative market outlets for cattle farmers in Ireland.  Total live exports for 2014 were 237,000 head, of which over 72,000 went to the UK - a 10% increase over 2013.  Specifically, over 54,000 head were exported to Northern Ireland, which is comparable with the 2013 figure.  I should make it clear that Ireland has been a proponent of mandatory origin labelling for beef, which requires the place of birth, rearing and slaughter to be shown on beef labels. The longstanding policy of UK retailers, who buy large quantities of Irish beef, is to market British and Irish beef separately.  This means that beef must be sourced from animals originating in one country or the other, so that they can be labelled as born, reared and slaughtered in the same country.  In addition, logistical difficulties can arise when a small number of Irish-born animals are slaughtered in a UK meat plant.  Under mandatory EU labelling rules, these carcases have to be deboned in a separate batch, and packaged and labelled accordingly, thereby incurring additional costs for the processor.  These issues are a matter of commercial preference, both of slaughter plants in Britain, and of British retailers.</p>  <p>  While Bord Bia has repeatedly raised this issue with British retailers over the years, they are unlikely to reverse their marketing policy in the short term and face other demands from UK stakeholders to stock more British beef.  Nevertheless Bord Bia, in its ongoing interactions with British customers, will continue to pursue all opportunities to maximise the full potential of the beef and livestock trade with our largest trading partner.  In addition, Bord Bia actively supports the development of the live export trade through the provision of market information, developing market access and promotional activity.</p>  <p>  I have also had several meetings with my Northern counterpart, Minister Michelle O&rsquo;Neill, on this subject.  We agreed to make a joint approach to the three British retailers who stock Irish Beef, accepting that these were commercial matters, but also seeking some flexibility given that this mixed label beef is produced to the exacting standards required by British consumers. </p>  <p>  Minister O&rsquo;Neill also approved a voluntary beef label in Northern Ireland for cattle born in the Republic of Ireland, raised in the Republic of Ireland and/or Northern Ireland, and slaughtered in Northern Ireland.  This label would facilitate the sale of beef from animals born in the South and slaughtered in the North under a voluntary &lsquo;Irish&rsquo; label, if retailers are willing to stock the product carrying this label.  Of course, such a label would be additional to the mandatory origin label.  The question of using such a label is now a commercial matter between processors and retailers in Northern Ireland and elsewhere in the UK.</p>  <p>  Following on from this, I convened a meeting with Minister O&rsquo;Neill and the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium which took place in October.  At this meeting the NIRC made it clear that their beef buyers had a preference for single origin beef, of which they had ample supply, but they would keep the situation under review.  I also met separately with Tesco where we had a useful and frank discussion on this and other procurement issues.  I will continue to pursue opportunities for exports of beef and live cattle at every opportunity.</p></reply>

This is particularly true of a lucrative market like the US where the beef market is estimated at 11 million metric tonnes.  It is split 60: 40 between foodservice and grocery retail (by volume).  The US imports 1 2 million tonnes of beef every year and Ireland is the first EU Member State to secure access to this market.  As the Deputy is aware, I am currently leading a major trade promotion to the US which will mark the arrival of Irish beef there for the first time in 15 years.  I will be launching Irish beef at events in New York, Washington DC and Boston, and I will be meeting high-end trade buyers and promoting Irish beef to US food publications so as to <i>build awareness of the qualities of Irish Beef.  </i>Ireland is the first EU country to be allowed back into the United States and we must use this advantage to place Irish Beef at the forefront of the premium steak cut market.<br/><br/>Bord Bia&rsquo;s strategy for the US market is to position Irish beef as a premium grass based natural product so pure and so natural that you can taste the difference.  The brand positioning developed by Bord Bia is grounded in comprehensive consumer and trade research conducted in the US over the last three years.  The beef market in the US is significantly different from the consumer packaged goods market and retail sales are nearly exclusively own brand.  As a result, Bord Bia will use the visual identity of the Quality Assurance mark to communicate the defining attributes of Irish beef as a natural product sustainably farmed to internationally accredited standards. In addition Bord Bia is developing an application to the sustainbly Process Verified Program which will facilitate their endorsement of the product claims on pack.  Bord Bia&rsquo;s marketing programme this year will encompass media advertising, PR and digital campaigns to targeted trade and consumer audiences to support the commercial activities of Irish beef exporters.</p></reply>

In order to establish the most appropriate response for forest owners and the forest industry a taskforce, chaired by Mr Tom Hayes TD, Minister of State, and comprising relevant forestry stakeholders was put in place to assess the damage nationally and to identify the various issues arising. The taskforce issued a guidance note for forest owners, laying down the steps to consider in safely harvesting and selling the fallen trees and giving advice on a range of other associated issues. Teagasc, in association with Coillte and my Department held two very successful events on managing storm damage in farm forests. These events were attended by over 400 forest owners. Teagasc forestry advisers continue to be available to discuss the issue with forest owners affected. Forest owners are also urged to get professional advice from qualified foresters to guide them through this process.</p></reply>

I am aware that the levels of biotoxins in shellfish in a number of bays in the Southwest currently exceed the regulatory limits. Harvesting from affected areas is temporarily suspended until such time as the biotoxin levels return to normal naturally occurring background levels. Such harvesting suspensions are not unusual and all aquaculture enterprises will be aware that this is a known business risk in the sector.  I have received a request from aquaculture industry representatives for a package of compensation for rope mussel farming enterprises affected by these harvesting suspensions. My Department is presently finalising a new Seafood Development Programme under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) which will determine how we use the finite resources that will be available to us in the coming years in the overall best interests of Ireland and its seafood sector as a whole. I will be publishing a detailed consultation document and Strategic Environmental Assessment for public consultation in the next month or so, with a view to submitting the new Programme to the Commission by May this year for its consideration and adoption. </p>  <p>  The EMFF Regulation sets out a legal framework under State Aid rules and the European Structural and Investment Funds concerning investment measures that Member States may implement in the period up to 2020. This potentially includes compensation aid to aquaculture enterprises for suspended harvests, but there are of course many other worthwhile investment possibilities allowed under the EMFF and national choices must be made between competing demands.  So, as part of the preparation of the new Programme, my Department has been following a structured process of considering the investment needs of the seafood industry as a whole. Stakeholders have been consulted on this on a number of occasions to date.  This has helped shape my initial thoughts on investment priorities and when I publish the consultation draft of the Programme shortly, my proposals will become clear. I will welcome all views at that point on the extent to which our resources should be directed towards compensation for suspended harvests. </p></reply>

Section 39 of these Regulations specifies that members of the AR and NSR must undertake a total of 48 hours training in order to remain effective. There are a number of types of training which can be used to fulfil this requirement, such as training parades, overnight camps, field days , annual training or courses of instruction. There are a wide variety of combinations that are feasible in order to meet the 48 hours target.     Section 39 (2) (a) of the Regulation states that, for the purpose of qualifying for retention on the effective strength but not for any other purpose, attendance for the full period of an overnight camp or field day shall be deemed to be attendance at training for a period of four hours.

One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel. The EAG&rsquo;s report was accepted by Government in 1995.  In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis, following consultation with Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA). In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces. This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct. Longer periods of service were envisaged for Non Commissioned Officers. </p>  <p>  In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January, 1994. A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1994 while continuing to address the Government&rsquo;s objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis. Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.</p>  <p>  The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows:</p>  <p>  -	Enlisted Personnel, up to and including the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service.</p>  <p>  -	Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years.</p>  <p>-	Enlisted Personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of fifty-six.   </p>  <p>  The first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by Permanent Defence Force members in those ranks this year. A claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter. In accordance with normal procedures the Association&rsquo;s claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force, under which discussions are confidential to the parties involved. While there was significant progress made in recent discussions between PDFORRA and Civil and Military Management on this issue, it was not possible to reach full agreement. As a result, an adjudication hearing took place on 30 January 2015, following the exchange of submissions between the parties and the result of same is expected in the near future.In the meantime work is continuing on exit support measures to support those due to be discharged. A number of military courses and other skills courses are already accredited with various third level institutions and professional bodies.

My Department consulted on the matter with the Law Reform Commission and it took the view that unreasonable interference caused in such circumstances was a matter in any particular case for tort law or more generally for planning or environmental law. </p>  <p>  In England and Wales, for example, legislation makes provision for local authorities to determine complaints by the owners or occupiers of domestic property who are adversely affected by hedges over 2 metres high.  Broadly similar legislation, i.e. the High Hedges Act (Northern Ireland) 2011, came into operation in Northern Ireland on 31 March 2012. </p>  <p>  The manner in which problems associated with high hedges and trees are resolved in both England and Wales and Northern Ireland demonstrates a clear preference for the resolution of such disputes at local level, preferably by mediation, with recourse to the courts only as a last resort.  This reduces the risk of prolonged and costly litigation, and the further risk that court proceedings could leave a legacy of bitterness between neighbours and ill-feeling in the local community.  The introduction of such legislation in this jurisdiction would be a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and his Department.</p>  <p>  Depending on the circumstances of the case, a person may, under existing law, be in a position to seek damages or an injunction requiring the cutting of boundary hedges or trees under the tort of nuisance.  In order for the nuisance to be actionable, the person would have to show that an easement existed and that there had been a substantial interference with that right.</p>  <p>  Mediation offers a viable, effective and efficient alternative to court proceedings in many cases, including disputes over boundaries and overhanging foliage.  It can both reduce the legal costs involved and speed up the resolution of disputes.  It is my intention to bring forward a mediation Bill to promote mediation as an alternative to court proceedings.  The legislation, which is currently being drafted, will introduce an obligation on solicitors and barristers to advise any person wishing to commence court proceedings to consider mediation as a means of resolving a dispute before embarking on such proceedings.  It will also provide that a court may, following the commencement of proceedings, on its own initiative invite parties to consider mediation and suspend the proceedings to facilitate the mediation process.</p></reply>

Details of the remuneration package, ie basic pay and other allowances including unsocial hours allowances, were made available to all applicants prior to their recruitment and I am providing with this answer a table of current basic pay for members at Garda rank together with the basic pay from 2009.  These pay scales do not include any allowances.  It is expected that newly attested Garda&iacute; will be assigned to frontline duties and will work the Garda Roster system.  This will immediately attract unsocial hours payments which, in addition with other relevant allowances amounts to over 25% of their earnings.  Even at the entry level of &euro;23,171 and the lower end of unsocial hours scale, this would add almost &euro;5,800 to their salary. <br/><br/>The Deputies will be aware that under the 2013 Haddington Road Agreement, the current remuneration and conditions of service of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na together with an evaluation of annualised hours/shift pay arrangements are being examined as part of a wider review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br/><br/>However, the Deputies will also be aware that, following a review of all allowances in the public service in 2011 and 2012, rent allowance for all new public servants including Garda&iacute;, Prison Officers and Fire Officers was abolished in early 2012.

Appendix 3, the Collective Agreement for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, provides that, among other things, the use of short-term career breaks, Incentivised career breaks, unpaid leave and family friendly schemes will also be made available.  This agreement was entered into between the Garda Staff Associations and the management side.  An incentivised Career Break for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was announced on 7 March 2014. <br/><br/>The terms of the Scheme stated that a Garda member could commence the career break from 7 March 2014 but no later than 28 February 2015.  The commencement date could be postponed only in the event that a member was on maternity leave on 28 February 2015 or if a decision was deferred in accordance with a discipline action.  The latest date for returning from the incentivised Career Break is the 28<sup></sup>February 2018, unless the date was deferred for one of the reasons stated above.  It is expected that all Garda personnel will return to duty on the expiry of their three year career break with 81 expected to return before the end of 2017 and the remaining 110 returning in 2018.<br/><br/>A breakdown of the number of Garda members who commenced their incentivised Career Break in 2014 and 2015, by Division is below. <table><tr><th>Division</th><th>Number Commenced Career Break in 2014</th><th>Number commencing Career Break in 2015</th></tr><tr><td>CAVAN / MONAGHAN</td><td></td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>CHANGE MANAGEMENT</td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td>2</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>CORK CITY</td><td>3</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>CORK NORTH</td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>CORK WEST</td><td>2</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CRIME AND SECURITY</td><td>1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>D.M.R.

No child under the age of 12 years can be charged with an offence.  An exception is made for 10 and 11 year-olds charged with murder, manslaughter, rape, rape under Section 4 of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990 or aggravated sexual assault.  In addition, the Director of Public Prosecutions must give consent for proceedings to continue against any child under the age of 14 years that has been charged with an offence.<br/><br/>Section 53 of the Children Act 2001 sets out a series of clear steps which a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should undertake when dealing with any child under the age of criminal responsibility who commits an offence<blockquote>1.The Garda should take the child to its parent or guardian.<br /><br />2.Where the Garda has reasonable grounds for believing that the child is not receiving adequate care or protection, the Garda shall inform the HSE of the child's name, address and age and the circumstances in which the child came to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br /><br />3.Where it is not practicable for the child to be taken to his or her parent or guardian, the member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na concerned may give the child, or arrange for the child to be given, into the custody of the health board for the area in which the child normally resolves.<br /><br />4.Where the Garda has reasonable grounds for believing (a) that there is an immediate and serious risk to the health and welfare of the child, and (b) that it would not be sufficient to await an emergency care order, the Garda may remove the child to safety.</blockquote>Section 53(4) of the Children Act states that it is the duty of the HSE to apply for a care order or supervision order (in accordance with the Child Care Act 1991) where it appears to the HSE that the child is unlikely to receive the care and protection it requires under the circumstances described above.<br/><br/>The Deputy will be aware that the functions of the Health Service Executive under the Children Act 2001, as amended, transferred to Tusla, the Child and Family Agency under the Child and Family Agency Act 2013.  In the circumstances you may wish to contact Tusla, which comes under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, about their role in relation to such children.</p></reply>

Contained therein is a stated business target that  visa applications to join Irish citizens should be dealt with within six months of receipt of application. A target of twelve months applies to  other applications for family reunification. These processing times are in line with international norms for such applications.  However, it must be made clear that these are business targets for the immigration service. Accordingly, they in no way constitute legal obligations.<br/><br/>These business targets reflect the detailed assessment that is required to be carried out in relation to applications for family reunification and are qualified by availability of resources.  These targets are largely being met. Delays in achieving them are primarily related to processing more complex cases where the provision of additional documentation is requested by my officials, or where detailed assessments of family rights under the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights are required, rather than to the availability of staff resources.<br/><br/>The stated targets are being largely met despite a 58% increase in the number of visa applications from persons wishing to join an Irish citizen spouse/partner from 2010 to 2014. <br/><br/>The management of resources is kept under constant review in my Department. As I stated in my previous reply,  I must balance the needs of this specific area of my Department with the requirements of other areas.  <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b><br/><br/>In this regard, it must be borne in mind that 'join family' applications are not as time-bound as other forms of visa applications e.g. for the purpose of tourism, to study, to do business, to take up employment etc. and, therefore, the staff resources available for processing must be organised to deal, in a timely way, with these more time-bound applications while also progressing the more complex family reunification applications.  </p></reply>

The concerns raised in the material provided do not, on the face of it, appear to raise any issues of Garda misconduct but refer to matters which occurred during the course of a trial.<br/><br/>While I appreciate the difficulties and distress that people engaged in court proceedings can experience,the position is that the courts are subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.  The conduct of any court case is a matter entirely for the presiding judge.  As the Deputy is aware, I cannot comment or intervene in any way in relation to how particular proceedings are conducted or on the outcome of those proceedings. <br/><br/>A copy of the correspondence was also forwarded directly to my Department by e-mail on 26 January 2015 and a reply will issue in due course.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

Work is also underway with respect to planning for the necessary investment in Garda technology to support the recording and management of crime information, and to bring outdated paper based practices into the 21st century.</p></reply>

The Scheme is available on my Department's website and is with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel awaiting formal drafting.  It is not possible as yet to indicate when the Bill is likely to be published. </p>  <p>  This Bill will, upon enactment, replace all extant laws on gambling (with the exception of that governing the National Lottery). The new legislation will have consumer protection generally as one of its core principles, and it is envisaged that it will include several measures aimed at assisting and protecting vulnerable persons, the young and those for whom gambling has become a problem. </p>  <p>  The Scheme, at Part 7, provides for a Fund to aid research, education and awareness activities and to support treatment programmes. The Fund will be based on contributions from the industry but the proposals will ensure independent supervision of its disbursement.  </p>  <p>  I am not aware of any specific national data or evidence, other than anecdotal evidence, that would support the Deputy's assertion about an increase in the  numbers of persons presenting with gambling addiction problems. However, some limited scale research is this area is suggestive.  I am not, therefore, in a position to comment on the matter. The scarcity of information on the scale and impacts of gambling underlines the need for measures such as the Fund I referred to above.</p></reply>

Section 15A provides that the Minister may waive certain conditions for naturalisation if satisfied that the applicant would suffer serious consequences in respect of his or her bodily integrity or liberty if not granted Irish citizenship.<br/><br/>An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) on 19 November, 2014.  On examination of the application submitted it was determined that the person in question did not have total residence in the island of Ireland of three years in the five years immediately prior to the date of application and therefore did not satisfy the statutory residency requirements as set out in the Act and referred to above.  The person concerned was informed of this by letter on 20 January, 2015.<br/><br/>It is open to the individual referred to by the Deputy to lodge a further application for citizenship if and when he is in a position to meet the prescribed statutory requirements. The on-line Naturalisation Residency Calculator available on the INIS website at <i>www.inis.gov.ie</i>can be used as a guide to whether an individual satisfies the naturalisation residency conditions and, if not, give an indication of how long they should wait before making an application.<br/><br/>The Deputy may wish to note that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been established specifically for this purpose.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-02-10a.652.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015021000066#WRO00500"><p>I will shortly be meeting with representatives of AdVIC, Advocates for Victims of Homicide, to hear from them first hand about their proposals for policy change. In relation to the items listed in the Deputy's question I reply under the following headings.<br/><br/><b>1. A state appointed victim liaison officer for families of homicide victims</b><br/><br/>I am not satisfied that the operation of a separate scheme parallel to the existing Garda Family Liaison Officers would prove in the best interests of providing an effective service in this area.<br/><br/><b>2. Garda Family Liaison Officer (FLO) scheme to be extended to all districts and FLOs to be given continuous training</b><br/><br/>I understand that the Garda Family Liaison Officer scheme is available in all districts and that Family Liaison Officers receive initial  training.<br/><br/><b>3. Victim impact statement for all homicide victims</b><br/><br/>When an offender has been convicted of murder or manslaughter representatives of the family of the deceased victim may make a victim impact statement prior to sentence being passed. There is no requirement on a family to make such a statement and where a statement is not made no inference may be drawn by the court that the offence had little or no impact. If a judge thinks it is appropriate, the judge may allow a victim impact statement in other cases, for example a fatal road traffic incident.<br/><br/><b>4. Definition of manslaughter and murder to be changed to murder by degree</b><br/><br/><b>5. Minimum of 25 years imprisonment for first degree murder</b><br/><br/><b>6. Defined sentencing scales for other degree murder convictions</b><br/><br/><b>9. Revision of concurrent sentences</b><br/><br/>The mandatory sentence for murder is life imprisonment, as provided by section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1990. A sentence of life imprisonment means that the prisoner is subject to that sentence for the rest of his or her life. Such a prisoner has no right to be released early at any stage. If granted temporary release, the prisoner remains subject to the life sentence and can be recalled to prison at any stage. Currently a person sentenced to life is, on average, likely to spend 17-18 years in prison before receiving any extended period of temporary release.<br/><br/>The imposition of multiple life sentences, whether concurrently or consecutively, in a case where more than one murder is committed in the same incident, does not increase the severity of the sanction and has no such effect in practice or in law.<br/><br/>The offence of manslaughter does not attract a mandatory sentence but is punishable by a maximum of life imprisonment.<br/><br/>As the Deputy will appreciate, the courts are independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  The approach of the Oireachtas has generally been to specify in statute a maximum penalty for an offence, so that a court, having considered all the circumstances of a case, may impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient.<br/><br/>The prescription of mandatory prison terms in legislation is an exception to this general approach.  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Law Reform Commission 2013 Report on Mandatory Sentences, which recommends the repeal of existing presumptive mandatory minimum sentence provisions for various drugs and firearms offences. I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the Report on the Strategic Review of Penal Policy, published in September, which recommended that no further mandatory sentences or presumptive minimum sentences should be introduced.<br/><br/>I have no plans at present to amend the law to provide for a specific minimum term of imprisonment for murder or to replace the offence of manslaughter with offences of different degrees of murder.<br/><br/><b>7. Bail laws to be tightened and implemented by the judiciary</b><br/><br/>A decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions. There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail because, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.  The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.<br/><br/>Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that the accused person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses or evidence.  Section 2 of the Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, permits the courts to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence where refusal of bail is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  A &ldquo;serious offence&rdquo; is an offence listed in the Schedule to the Bail Act that is punishable by at least five years imprisonment.<br/><br/>As regards reform of the bail laws, I can inform the Deputy that the preparation of the General Scheme of a Bail Bill to modernise the law on bail is at a very advanced stage and I intend to bring proposals to Government on the matter in the coming weeks.<br/><br/>While the primary aim of the proposed Bail Bill is to consolidate and update bail law, I wish to take the opportunity to seek, as far as is possible, within the constraints of the Constitution and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, to focus the legislation on the protection of the individual and of the public.  The intention is that the new provisions will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided.  The new Bill will seek to improve the operation of the bail system and make the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against the commission of offences by persons on bail.<br/><br/><b>8. Parole and release</b><br/><br/>In September last year I published the report of the Penal Policy Review Group which was tasked with carrying out a strategic review of penal policy.  As an initial step, the Government agreed, in principle, last November to proceed immediately with the bringing forward of legislative proposals to establish the Parole Board on an independent statutory basis.  I believe this will help to strengthen the Board and improve its functions.  My Department is currently considering the matter in more detail ahead of presenting proposals for legislation.<br/><br/><b>10. Revision of article 10 of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme</b><br/><br/>Section 10 of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme is being examined as part of an overall review of the Scheme itself which is currently underway in my Department.</p></reply>

Full vetting checks are conducted by the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) for each new vetting application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account.</p>  <p>  The current procedures for Garda vetting ensure the integrity of the system.  This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original Garda Vetting Disclosure would not include information regarding any recent criminal convictions, and the second employer could not safely rely on it.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, under the Data Protection Acts, any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date and employers would be exposed to civil liability if they knowingly recruited staff based on out-of-date criminal records information where the person in fact had a more recent criminal conviction.  Effectively, the non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process protects against the risk of fraud or forgery and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting service and such procedures are in line with best practice internationally.</p>  <p>  There are, however, certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant.  For example, persons involved in voluntary work may be doing work with more than one voluntary organisation at the same time, and may agree with the vetting applicant to share a single vetting disclosure.  Similar arrangements arise in the health sector in regard to persons working as locums, agency nurses or other temporary employees in a number of different organisations, or in the education sector where substitute teachers are on panels for substitute teaching in more than one school.</p>  <p>  Finally, the current average processing time for vetting applications is four weeks.  Any vetting process will take a certain minimum amount of time to complete and, taking into account  the need to protect children and vulnerable adults while providing an effective and efficient service, I do not think that this time period is unreasonable.</p></reply>

The purpose of the review is to identify in consultation with all stakeholders a range of options which could be considered to enable the Courts Service to more efficiently and effectively maintain frontline court services in the county. The review will collate and analyse data on court business being conducted in Clonmel and Nenagh Courthouses. It will consider the appropriate operational structure which should underpin the provision of frontline services and the necessary support for court sittings in both locations.</p>  <p>  I welcome the consultative approach which is being adopted by the Courts Service in seeking submissions on the review from any interested parties or local interests.  The Courts Service had originally sought submissions by the end of November 2014 but they agreed to extend the timeframe for submissions to mid January 2015 to allow for the fullest possible consultation. I am informed that all submissions have now been received and there are some further consultations with key stakeholders and court users in the county to be completed. I have been assured by the Courts Service that all views received will be taken into account in the decision making process. The Courts Service anticipate that its report of the review of court services in County Tipperary will be completed by the end of March. It should, however, be noted that the final decision is a matter for the Courts Service Board.  Under the statute I have no role or function in the matter.</p></reply>

If the mother agrees, the parents can jointly make a statutory declaration appointing the father as a guardian; alternatively, the father may apply to court to be appointed a guardian under Section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964. The vast majority of such court applications are successful.<br/><br/>The Children and Family Relationships Bill which will be published very shortly, if enacted will ensure that more fathers are automatically the guardians of their children. Where the father lives with the child's mother for more than 12 consecutive months, of which at least 3 months are with the mother and the child after the child's birth, the Bill will provide that he will automatically be the guardian of the child. This will substantially improve the position of non-marital fathers generally, including in situations such as the Deputy has outlined.<br/><br/>Where a father is the guardian of his children or has a court order granting him custody, including shared custody, of the children, or there are proceedings pending, the Central Authority on Child Abduction may be able to provide assistance where the children are removed from the jurisdiction in breach of those rights of custody.<br/><br/>The procedures for dealing with situations of international parental child abduction involving countries which are party to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction are set out in the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act 1991.  EC Regulation 2201/2003 supplements and supports the terms of the Hague Convention in instances of international child abduction between EU Member States excluding Denmark.  The Deputy should note that  the Hague Convention and EC Regulation 2201/2003 are applicable in the jurisdictions of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Further detail in relation to these instruments is available at www.justice.ie. under the &quot;Youth Justice, Children and Family&quot; heading.<br/><br/>A network of Central Authorities has been established in contracting states to facilitate applications for the return of children under the Hague Convention and the Irish Central Authority for International Child Abduction is located in my Department.

A child can only be received into the care of the Child and Family Agency where there are welfare or protection concerns.  Homelessness as part of a family group is not, in of itself, a basis for seeking to receive a child into care.  Responsibility for young adults (aged over 18 years) presenting as homeless lies primarily with the local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  In light of this, I have been advised by the Agency that it does not collect the data requested by the Deputy and cannot provide it in the format as requested.</p>  <p>  I would note, however, that where a child under 18 years of age presents as homeless and it is not possible to reunite them with their family, then the child may be taken into care.  In some circumstances, a child aged 16 or 17 years of age may be accommodated and supported by the Agency under section 5, accommodation of homeless children, of the Child Care Act 1991.  The Child and Family Agency does capture some information on children aged 16 and 17 years presenting as homeless and who are referred to the Agency under section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991.  The Agency advises that there were 26 children who were accommodated under section 5 of the Act in the year to the end of the third quarter of 2014.  The regional breakdown reported was 1 in Dublin Mid-Leinster, 5 in Dublin North East, 13 in the South and 7 in the West.  Figures for previous years can be found in the Review of Adequacy reports published under section 8 of the Act.</p>  <p>  Young adults, generally in the age range of 18 to 23 years old, who were formerly in the care of the State and presently in receipt of aftercare services will, as part of this support, have their accommodation needs identified.  As of September 2014, the Agency reported that there were 1,698 young adults aged 18 to 23 in receipt of an aftercare service and education participation in this group was on a par with the national participation rate of 56%.  In respect of homelessness, I have been advised by the Agency that it does not collect statistics on young adults (over 18 years) who present themselves as such to local authorities.  </p>  <p>  Last year, a protocol was established between the County and City Management Association and the Child and Family Agency in relation to the assessment of housing needs for young people leaving care. The aim of the protocol is to make the assessment and allocation of social housing, where deemed to be the most appropriate response to the young person&rsquo;s need, more efficient and seamless. It is hoped this will facilitate an improved service for those leaving care in obtaining social housing suitable to their needs.</p></reply>

The programme, which is a free and universal provision, represents an annual investment of approximately &euro;175 million. </p>  <p>  To ensure that the ECCE programme is more accessible to children with special needs, a number of additional provisions have been added.  These include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification under the programme where a child is developmentally delayed and would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the preschool year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.  </p>  <p>  Many children with special needs avail of the free preschool year in mainstream childcare services without any additional supports.  I am aware that the Health Service Executive does, where possible, assist children with special needs who may require additional support to enable them to avail of preschool services in mainstream settings.  </p>  <p>  My Department has been working with the Department of Health in the context of building better supports to facilitate the children with special needs.

In his report, Mr Justice Quirke recommended, inter alia, that legislation be introduced to give effect to his recommendation on the provision of health services to Magdalen women. To this end, the Minister for Justice has published the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Bill 2014.  This Bill is to make provision for the making available without charges of certain health services to certain women who were admitted to and worked in certain institutions, to provide that those women shall not be required to pay charges for acute in-patient services, and to amend the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. </p>  <p>  The Bill completed Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il last week and is scheduled for Report Stage on 10 February 2015. It is anticipated that it will continue its passage through both Houses over the coming weeks.

In these circumstances, Roflumilast, was not added to the HSE Reimbursement List. </p>  <p>  I understand that the pharmaceutical company Takeda have a multinational clinical trial on-going in an attempt to develop sufficient evidence to allow the HSE and other international reimbursement agencies to re-consider reimbursement.

I commend them for their efforts to raise awareness on the importance of blood donation.</p>  <p>  The Irish Blood Transfusion Service (IBTS) is responsible for providing a safe and reliable blood service to the Irish health system. Blood, and the products derived from it, are an integral facet of healthcare delivery.  A major objective of the organisation is to ensure that it always has the necessary programmes and procedures in place to protect both the donors of blood and recipients of blood and blood products. </p>  <p>  The IBTS is continually seeking ways to recruit donors and to raise awareness of the importance of blood donation.  It has a  schools information pack with leaflets, videos and CD content which it distributes to secondary schools to promote  blood donation.  The IBTS is currently reviewing this material with several  parties, including input from Transition Year students.  It is envisaged that this material will form part of a proposal to the Department of Education and Skills to include blood donation as part of  the secondary school SPHE curriculum.  The IBTS also promotes awareness of blood donation through their presence at youth activities, such as the GAA and other sports clubs. </p>  <p>  The IBTS has no plans to reduce the age of consent for blood donations to 17 years of age. They have advised that they are not in a position to reduce the age of consent due to a higher rate of adverse reactions, such as fainting, in younger donors. </p></reply>

Every person who uses our disability services is entitled to expect and receive supports of the highest standard and to live in an atmosphere of safety and care.  <br/><br/>The safeguarding and protection of vulnerable people in the care of the health service is of paramount importance and the Director General of the HSE has written to all staff instructing them to take personal responsibility for ensuring that individuals supported by the HSE in any setting are treated with dignity and respect.<br/><br/>In December 2014, the HSE initiated both an expert investigation chaired by Mr Christy Lynch, and an independently chaired review of services at this facility led by Dr Kevin McCoy. <br/><br/>Garda&iacute; investigation into allegations of abuse at the centre is ongoing and the Garda&iacute; had requested that a stay is placed on HSE investigations until such time as Garda investigation is completed. I welcome the fact that the Garda&iacute; have now cleared the way so that Mr. Lynch&rsquo;s investigation can commence.  I have asked the HSE to keep me informed of progress.<br/><br/>Mr Lynch&rsquo;s investigation team is working independently of the HSE and will form an important input into any disciplinary process which the HSE will undertake. <br/><br/>A full assurance review has also been commissioned of all of the Units in the Aras Attracta facility under the independent chairmanship of Dr. Kevin McCoy, assisted by 3 independent experts within the field. The group will review the programme of work already implemented on foot of the reports from HIQA and HSE Audits to establish their effectiveness, identify the gaps that arose and make recommendations for further improvements for each unit at Aras Attracta. In addition the output from the Review Team will help to inform a system &ndash;wide programme of improvement and assurance for all residential centres, including a mechanism for input from service users and their families, staff at all levels throughout the sector and academia. <br/><br/>The HSE has undertaken a number of additional initiatives to ensure that quality and safe care in residential services for people with disabilities is appropriately implemented and monitored. <br/><br/>A six-step plan will address this in a systematic way. These steps are:<br/><br/>- The establishment of a National Implementation Taskforce, including a series of National Summits to improve client safety, dignity, respect and  culture; <br/><br/>- Implementation of the <i>National Policy &amp;amp; Procedures on Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse</i>;<br/><br/>- Development of an Advocacy programme; <br/><br/>- Implementation of an evaluation and quality improvement programme in disability residential centres; <br/><br/>- Development of an implementation plan for any recommendations arising from the McCoy review of residential services in &Aacute;ras Attracta when complete, and <br/><br/>- Development of long term sustainable &amp;amp; evidence-based safeguarding practices and training programmes specific to residential settings.<br/><br/>I can assure the Deputy that my Department will monitor progress on the initiatives and processes commissioned by the HSE in relation to &Aacute;ras Attracta, to ensure that the learning from this incident is promulgated throughout our health system.<br/><br/>As the second part of the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.  If the Deputy has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, she can contact my Private Office and they will follow the matter up with the HSE.</p></reply>

Every person who uses our disability services is entitled to expect and receive supports of the highest standard and to live in an atmosphere of safety and care.  <br/><br/>The safeguarding and protection of vulnerable people in the care of the health service is of paramount importance and the Director General of the HSE has written to all staff instructing them to take personal responsibility for ensuring that individuals supported by the HSE in any setting are treated with dignity and respect.<br/><br/>In December 2014, the HSE initiated both an expert investigation chaired by Mr Christy Lynch, and an independently chaired review of services at this facility led by Dr Kevin McCoy. <br/><br/>Garda&iacute; investigation into allegations of abuse at the centre is ongoing and the Garda&iacute; had requested that a stay be placed on HSE investigations until such time as Garda investigation is completed. I welcome the fact that the Garda&iacute; have now cleared the way so that Mr. Lynch&rsquo;s investigation can commence.  I have asked the HSE to keep me informed of progress.<br/><br/>Mr Lynch&rsquo;s investigation team is working independently of the HSE and will form an important input into any disciplinary process which the HSE will undertake. <br/><br/>A full assurance review has also been commissioned of all of the Units in the Aras Attracta facility under the independent chairmanship of Dr. Kevin McCoy, assisted by 3 independent experts within the field. The group will review the programme of work already implemented on foot of the reports from HIQA and HSE Audits to establish their effectiveness, identify the gaps that arose and make recommendations for further improvements for each unit at Aras Attracta. In addition the output from the Review Team will help to inform a system &ndash;wide programme of improvement and assurance for all residential centres, including a mechanism for input from service users and their families, staff at all levels throughout the sector and academia. <br/><br/>The HSE has undertaken a number of additional initiatives to ensure that quality and safe care in residential services for people with disabilities is appropriately implemented and monitored. <br/><br/>A six-step plan will address this in a systematic way. These steps are:<br/><br/>- The establishment of a National Implementation Taskforce, including a series of National Summits to improve client safety, dignity, respect and  culture; <br/><br/>- Implementation of the <i>National Policy &amp;amp; Procedures on Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse</i>; <br/><br/>- Development of an Advocacy programme; <br/><br/>- Implementation of an evaluation and quality improvement programme in disability residential centres; <br/><br/>- Development of an implementation plan for any recommendations arising from the McCoy review of residential services in &Aacute;ras Attracta when complete, and <br/><br/>- Development of long term sustainable &amp;amp; evidence-based safeguarding practices and training programmes specific to residential settings.<br/><br/>I can assure the Deputy that my Department will monitor progress on the initiatives and processes commissioned by the HSE in relation to &Aacute;ras Attracta, to ensure that the learning from this incident is promulgated throughout our health system.</p></reply>

The key objective is to develop services in the community which will give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and other allied health professionals.</p>  <p>  The development of the Teams is a work in progress with enhancements occurring in terms of team membership and organisational delivery over time.  At the end of December 2014, core Team staff amounted to approximately 3,000, providing services for almost 4 million of the population.</p>  <p>  264.5 Primary Care Team posts (Public Health Nurses; Registered General Nurses; Occupational Therapists; Physiotherapists; and Speech &amp;amp; Language Therapists) were approved in 2013.  247 posts are now filled or start dates agreed. The recruitment process is continuing regarding the remaining posts.</p>  <p>  On 8 October, the HSE launched the Community Healthcare Organisations Report. The Report sets out plans for a comprehensive reorganisation of health services outside the acute hospital system. The primary focus is to provide the maximum proportion of care to people in the communities where they live and to achieve joined-up, integrated services.</p>  <p>  The present 17 Integrated Service Areas will be replaced by nine Community Healthcare Organisations, which will be part of the HSE.  Existing resources will be reorganised into 90 Primary Care Networks, each serving about 50,000 of the population.  Each network will be headed by an identified, accountable person responsible for care delivery by professionals such as nurses, therapists and social workers so as to meet a wide range of people&rsquo;s needs in a joined-up way. There will be strong GP involvement and a focus on decision-making at local level. The new structures will also have a strong focus on building good linkages with the acute hospital system so that people&rsquo;s care pathways are appropriately planned and their needs met in the right setting.</p>  <p>  The implementation of the recommendations of the CHO Report, including the establishment of the CHOs and their management structures, has been listed as a key priority of the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2015. The HSE has appointed seven of the nine Chief Officers. The process is ongoing in relation to the remaining two posts.</p>  <p>  There are currently 8 Community Intervention Teams (CITs) in place in Dublin North, Dublin South, Cork, Limerick, Tipperary, Clare, Carlow/Kilkenny and Galway. CITs work in partnership with Primary Care Teams, General Practice, Community Response Beds, community nursing, home support services, acute hospitals and other professional, voluntary and external providers to deliver enhanced services and patient centred care in the most appropriate setting. The CIT provides a rapid and integrated response to an appropriate patient with an acute episode of illness who requires CIT services for a defined/short period of time in the community/home, thus helping to increase hospital avoidance and earlier discharge from acute hospitals.</p>  <p>  There are currently over 2,400 GPs providing services to 1,768,700 medical card holders and 159,576 GP visit card holders under the General Medical Services scheme.  90% of the population have access to GP out-of-hours services in 14 centres nationally, in all HSE regions, in at least part of every county.</p>  <p>  The development of Primary Care Centres (PCC) to accommodate the HSE&rsquo;s Primary Care Teams and GPs in the one location is a key enabler for the delivery of primary care services. There are three methods used by the HSE for the development of PCCs: Direct Build; Public Private Partnership (PPP) Programme; and Operational Lease. To-date, there are 85 PCCs in operation (42 of which have opened since March 2011). There are currently 37 locations where primary care infrastructure is under construction or at an advanced planning stage.</p>  <p>  In general, services provided in PCCs include: Public Health Nursing; Physiotherapy; Occupational Therapy; Speech and Language Therapy; Primary Care Social Work; Primary Care Counselling; Dietetics; and Podiatry. Some centres also provide additional services such as Minor Surgery, Mental Health services, Pharmacy and Dental services.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to widening access to primary care.  This includes introducing, on a phased basis, a universal GP service without fees.  This process has commenced in respect of all children under 6 years. The objective is to have universal GP care without fees for children under 6 years in place in Quarter 2, 2015, subject to the conclusion of the present discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation and the completion of a fee-setting process.</p>  <p>  The Government is also prioritising GP care without fees at the point of access for persons over 70 years to coincide with the introduction of GP care without fees for children under 6.  This will be facilitated under the existing GMS contract.  </p>  <p>  The HSE/Department and the IMO, under the Framework Agreement signed in June 2014, have also commenced talks on a new GP contract, with more substantive engagement scheduled for the coming weeks. A priority of these discussions will be the inclusion of chronic disease management for patients.</p>  <p>  The HSE has identified an initial five Integrated Care Programmes for implementation in 2015, including the Integrated Care Programme for the prevention and management of Chronic Disease.</p>  <p>  The National Integrated Care Diabetes Programme is being implemented on a phased basis.  In 2013, the Government approved funding for the appointment of 17 Integrated Care Diabetes Nurse Specialists to support the phased roll out of the programme.  To-date, 16.65 Whole Time Equivalent nurse specialists have been recruited.</p>  <p>  Work is also underway in the HSE on an implementation plan for the National Clinical Programme for Asthma&rsquo;s Model of Care.</p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s 2015 National Service Plan (NSP) commits the HSE to roll out a pilot, to provide GP direct access to ultrasound, at approximately eight primary care sites, across the South and West, from early 2015.  The pilot will aim to clear any existing hospital waiting lists for GP referrals to ultrasound.</p>  <p>  The NSP also makes a commitment to pilot the provision of additional minor surgery services in agreed primary care settings and sites.  This will contribute to a reduction in the waiting lists for minor surgery procedures in hospitals. The intention is to make this pilot service available in all of the HSE's Community Healthcare Organisations, ensuring local access for patients.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the implementation of the above key measures will play a significant part in the re-focussing of health services in line with the Government's health reform programme.</p></reply>

I concluded that it would not be possible to introduce a full UHI system by 2019, as envisaged in the White Paper.  However, I want to emphasise my commitment to implementing reforms. In particular, I want to push ahead with key reforms in areas such as extending free GP care on a phased basis, improving the management of chronic diseases, implementing key financial reforms, including activity-based funding, and establishing hospital groups. As well as representing critical building blocks for the future health system, they are also important reforms in their own right that will drive efficiencies and bring benefits in advance of moving to a system of universal healthcare. <br/><br/>With regard to the introduction of universal GP care, &euro;37 million has been provided for the first and second phases of this initiative this year, which is intended to provide GP care without fees to all children aged under 6 and to all persons aged 70 years and over by Quarter 2 2015, subject to the conclusion of discussions between the Department of Health, the HSE and the IMO.<br/><br/>Finally with regard to the wider issue of the statutory resources required to deliver UHI, my Department is undertaking a major costing exercise, in conjunction with the ESRI, the Health Insurance Authority and others. This exercise will estimate the cost of UHI for individuals/households and the Exchequer.  I expect to have the initial results from this exercise in April, following which I will revert to Government with a roadmap on the next steps to UHI. </p></reply>

The Act provides that persons, unable without undue hardship having regard to their overall financial situation to arrange GP services for themselves and family, qualify for a medical card. The Deputy will also be aware of the publication of the Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility and the Medical Card Process Review in November 2014.  A key recommendation of the Expert Panel was that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.</p>  <p>  The HSE has discretion, exercised in accordance with the legislation, to grant a medical card where a person's income exceeds the income guidelines. The HSE is obliged to operate within the legal parameters as set out in the Health Act, while also responding to the variety of circumstances and complexities faced by individuals who apply for a medical card.  </p>  <p>  In the light of the conclusions of the two reports a range of actions have been identified to improve the operation of the medical card system, particularly for people with significant medical needs. The HSE has appointed a senior manager, at Assistant National Director level, with specific responsibility for Primary Care Schemes and Eligibility, to lead the reform. A Clinical Advisory Group has been appointed and it will provide an interim report within three months on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions. It includes representatives of Our Children's Health and Patients for Patient Safety Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The HSE is also putting arrangements in place for a more integrated and sensitive processing of medical card applications involving significant medical conditions to ensure greater interaction between the central office regarding the assessment of a person&rsquo;s eligibility and the local health office regarding the person&rsquo;s medical condition and the services that they may require. Consequently, the number of medical cards issued, where the HSE has exercised discretion, has increased from approximately 50,300 at the start of 2014 to approximately 76,700 at the start of 2015.</p></reply>

There are a number of options open to individuals to make a complaint about the health services at present.  Part 9 of the Health Act 2004 states that a person has the right to complain about any action of the Health Service Executive (HSE) or a service provider that they believe was not fair or had an adverse affect on them. The HSE has appointed designated Complaints Officers to ensure the effective management of complaints throughout their relevant areas of responsibility.  The HSE actively encourages and promotes consumer feedback and links with customers on a regular basis to ensure that the complaint handling processes are effective, are being communicated and are achieving outcomes that are satisfactory to the consumers. The HSE continues to seek improvements in its complaint handling ability and capacity in order to respond to the needs of patients. </p>  <p>  If an individual is unhappy with the way in which his/her complaint was dealt with the National Advocacy Unit of the HSE will appoint an independent officer to review the complaint.  If an individual is still unhappy with the outcome of this process he/she can request an independent review of the complaint from the Office of the Ombudsman or Ombudsman for Children.   </p>  <p> Healthcomplaints.ie is an on-line information service which was developed by the Office of the Ombudsman in cooperation with   a number of organisations including my Department and the HSE. This service provides information on how to make a complaint or give feedback about health and social care services in Ireland. This website has been developed for people who use health and social care services in Ireland, as well as for their families, care-givers and advocates.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, if an individual is unhappy with the level of care provided by a regulated health service professional such as a doctor, nurse or other healthcare professional, he/she may make a complaint to that employee's professional regulatory body.</p>  <p>  I believe that it is paramount that both patients and their families raise queries or complaints and that they feel that those complaints will be listened to and acted upon.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is not possible for me to answer the specific queries raised by the Deputy based on the details supplied. However, l will say that it is a basic tenet of medical practice that all medical procedures carried out require the full and informed consent of the patient.</p></reply>

Persons in this category are entitled to full eligibility and receive a medical card as evidence of their entitlement. The applicant is only required to demonstrate to the HSE that they qualify under the EU Regulations and there is no requirement to submit income details and details of savings. The applicant must produce the appropriate E or S-form, completed by their Member State confirming the healthcare entitlement for which that state is liable.  The position regarding the UK is that, under a reciprocal agreement, the EU S form is not required, however, proof of receipt of a qualifying payment from the UK authorities should be provided with the application to the HSE.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has responsibility to establish if an applicant is subject to Irish social security legislation. A person is considered subject to Irish social security legislation if s/he is in receipt of a contributory Irish social welfare payment or engaged in work in Ireland and subject to PRSI.  If a person is considered subject to Irish social security legislation, the person will not qualify for a Medical Card under EU legislation, but may qualify for a means-tested Medical Card under national legislation. An applicant under the EU Regulations may apply in respect of themselves alone if they consider they meet the above requirements even where their partner/spouse is subject to Irish social security legislation. The dependants of the person who qualifies for a medical card under the EU Regulations who reside with him/her are also entitled to a medical card on production of the appropriate E or S-form provided that they are not themselves subject to the Irish social security system, or in the case of children, that the spouse or person looking after the children is not also subject to Irish social security legislation. Again no form is required in the case of UK applicants provided the required evidence of entitlement is provided.</p>  <p>  A spouse who does not qualify under the EU Regulations may separately apply for a means-tested medical card under national legislation but will however be required to supply the information requested by the HSE in respect of the couple's means in order to permit the HSE assess if the spouse will qualify for a means-tested medical card under national legislation. </p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible. The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended. It has established a dedicated contact service for members of the Oireachtas specifically for queries relating to medical cards and GP visit cards, which the Deputy may wish to use for an earlier response. Contact information has issued to Oireachtas members.

However, the issue of pricing and reimbursement of medicines has been the subject of recent discussion at an EU level.</p>  <p>  The Council of the European Union issued conclusions in December 2014 on the issue of innovation for the benefit of patients which included the issue of co-operation on the pricing of medicines between Member States. The Council conclusions invited the European Commission and Member States to examine opportunities for potential co-operation on a voluntary basis in the field of pricing and reimbursement.</p>  <p>  I have indicated previously in discussions at an EU level on this issue that I am supportive of proposals that would deliver greater transparency in prices. However, I am mindful that this may be difficult to achieve as Member States negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies to agree commercially confidential discounts on the price of medicines and to establish patient access schemes.</p>  <p>  A number of mechanisms exist at a European level to assist with the issue of pricing and reimbursement of medicines. In 2008 the network of Competent Authorities on Pricing and Reimbursement was created of which Ireland is a member. This is an informal platform which discusses the issues and challenges in the field of pricing and reimbursement of medicines. Ireland also has access to the EU Euripid Database which was launched in 2010. This is a web based database which provides up to date information on the prices of medicines which can be accessed by participating Member States. </p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that a Joint Procurement Agreement for medical countermeasures is in place at an EU level which enables countries, including Ireland, to procure pandemic vaccines and other medical countermeasures on a group rather than individual basis.</p></reply>

Between 2006 and 2014 these agreements have generated savings in the region of &euro;790 million.</p>  <p>  The State has engaged at an industry level on the basis not only of the savings delivered but also that the agreements have provided the State with certainty regarding security of supply of pharmaceutical products for Irish patients including ensuring that patients have access to new and innovative medicines. </p>  <p>  The 2012 agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association provides for a mid-term review. My Department and the HSE have been engaging with IPHA in this context. Whilst the Government's preference would be for additional savings to be delivered in co-operation with the pharmaceutical industry, agreement has not been reached in discussions to date. </p>  <p>  Section 21 of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 affords the HSE powers to review and alter prices. This is an option which the Executive is examining at present, having regard to all relevant factors, including the funding pressures that it faces in relation to new and innovative drugs. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the HSE does enter into direct negotiations with pharmaceutical companies who are seeking reimbursement of new products on the GMS and community drugs schemes.</p></reply>

Currently 61% of all adults in Ireland are either overweight (37%) or obese (24%). The picture in relation to childhood overweight and obesity is similar where one in four children is either overweight or obese.</p>  <p>  A significant contributor to this trend is the consumption of high calorific foods and drink outside the home. In 2012, the then Minister for Health initiated calorie posting on menus on a voluntary basis. Although the majority of restaurants stated that they would like to display calories, in May 2013 only 8% of all fast food outlets, coffee shops and food chains did so.</p>  <p>  In 2012, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) conducted a consultation exercise to find out public views on the matter.    96% of the general public who made a submission wanted calorie menu labelling in all, or some, food outlets. 86% wanted calorie labelling in all food service businesses. An industry majority were in favour of calorie posting.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that putting calorie counts on menus is about providing consumers with information at the point of choice.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the legislation may impose a cost on the industry and, for that reason, the FSAI was requested to develop a web-based, user friendly and free to users Calorie Calculator to enable them to accurately calculate calories on all menus at no cost. This calculator is called &ldquo;MenuCal&rdquo; and has been in operation since April 2014. The Department of Health will consult with industry and other stakeholders on the calorie posting legislation.</p></reply>

Currently, there are<b></b>54 operational Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service ( CAMHS )  beds in the HSE, i.e. beds available to take a child / adolescent as an in-patient if the need arises. These beds are located as follows - 22 in Dublin, 20 in Galway and 12 in Cork.  This is an improvement on the position in November last, when 48 beds were operational. <br/><br/>A new purpose built 22 bed CAMHS in-patient unit located on the grounds of Cherry Orchard Hospital is due to be completed in mid-2015.  The existing 14 beds in the current temporary facility,  will transfer across, thereby giving a net increase of 8 beds in the facility, thus increasing the number of operational beds nationally to 62. In addition, the HSE intend to open an additional 8 beds, currently closed, in the Eist Linn Unit in Cork, when  staffing recruitment issues are resolved, thereby targetting an overall operational capacity of 70 beds in 2015. The question of providing additional bed provision, in line with <i>A Vision for Change </i>and overall revenue availability over the longer term, will be kept under review by the Department of Health and the HSE.</p></reply>

Disability services are provided in a variety of community and residential settings in partnership with service users, their families and carers and a range of statutory, non-statutory, voluntary and community groups. Voluntary agencies provide the majority of services in partnership with or on behalf of the Health Service Executive.</p>  <p>  In planning for the delivery of intellectual disability services, the Health Service Executive (HSE) and disability service providers maintain the National Intellectual Disability Database (NIDD).</p>  <p>  The NIDD provides a comprehensive database for decision-making in relation to the planning, funding and management of services for people with an intellectual disability. The 2013 report of the NIDD forecasts the future residential, day care and respite requirements of people with an intellectual disability in the period 2014 to 2018 based on 2013 data. However, it is important to emphasise that the NIDD acts as a planning and forecasting tool and does not match individuals to the actual service they will require at the specific time it will be required. This will often depend on individual and family circumstances which will change over time.  </p>  <p>  The report forecasts that 4488 additional residential, day and residential support/respite places will be needed to meet service requirements in the period 2014 &ndash; 2018. Of these 4488 individuals, it is forecast that 190 will require a day service, 2043 will require a residential support or respite service and 2215 will require a full-time residential service.</p>  <p>  In 2013, the 2043 individuals forecast as requiring a full-time residential service between 2014 and 2018 were in receipt of specialist disability services to meet their needs at that time. 99.8% of this group of 2043 were in receipt of a day service or a residential support service and 90.0% of the 2043 lived at home.</p></reply>

This specifically excludes day case beds, beds used for longer term care, for example geriatrics, and it also excludes psychiatric beds. The data Ireland supplies to Eurostat is based on the publicly funded acute hospitals only.</p>  <p>  In the most recent data available from 2011, Ireland had 217 curative care beds per 100,000 population. This compared with an average of 365 curative care beds per 100,000 population for the 25 EU Member States that provided data in 2011. It should be noted that data for Ireland and UK (237 per 100,000) excludes beds in private hospitals which affects the comparability somewhat. </p></reply>

We recommended that Israel end urgently night arrests of Palestinian children, the admissibility in evidence in military courts of written confessions in Hebrew signed by Palestinian children, the use of solitary confinement and the denial of access to family members or to legal representation.

The signing ceremony was hosted at the Embassy of Ireland in Washington DC by Irish Ambassador Anne Anderson and took place in the presence of US Secretary of Labour, Thomas Perez and Richard Trumka, President of the AFL-CIO.</p>  <p>  The federation promises to deliver considerable benefits, especially in terms of expanding training and future employment opportunities for the members of both unions. Explaining the context of the agreement, Eamon Devoy, General Secretary of the TEEU, has pointed to the imperative that engineering workers are suitably trained and retrained to meet the demands of change based technologies that are crucial to the needs of successful business.</p>  <p>  He has also highlighted the TEEU&rsquo;s focus on training, quality and standards and noted that the association with the UA will be important to developing the training aspect of their activities.  Under the agreement, the TEEU will bring US trainers to Ireland to teach workers new skills under a &ldquo;train the trainers&rdquo; programme.  William Hite of the UA has also stressed the need for skills development in order to compete for high skilled jobs in a global economy and committed the UA to sharing their knowledge.</p>  <p>  I welcome the signing of this agreement and commend the role of our Embassy in Washington in facilitating it.  In an increasingly globalised world and in an open economy such as Ireland&rsquo;s it is essential that we constantly look to enhance and improve our skills so that training opportunities arising, as the economy starts to grow again, can be availed of.  While the future development of this agreement is for the two unions concerned, I hope and expect that it will contribute to such improved training opportunities and wish the two organisations every success with its implementation and development.</p></reply>

The School Transport Scheme is not charged depreciation in respect of any vehicles fully funded by the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  Vehicles are transferred from road passenger services to school transport services on a planned cascade basis when they are available in order to improve the age profile and quality of the school bus fleet.  The depreciation charge takes account of the net book value of the vehicles cascaded to school transport and the date the vehicle was cascaded.  The depreciation charge also takes account of any school vehicles scrapped and the date of scrapping.</p>  <p>  The depreciation charge is independently reviewed by Price Waterhouse Coopers each year as part of the annual audit process.</p></reply>

In keeping with this principle, additional resources provided in the education system are allocated on the basis of identified individual educational need rather than that of ethnic or cultural background.</p>  <p>  Following decisions of the last Government, as part of the December 2010 budgetary process, Traveller pupils who are eligible for learning support teaching now receive this tuition through the existing learning support provision in schools.  This is in keeping with the policy of inclusion and the 2006 report.</p>  <p>  The General Allocation Model, which provides additional learning support and English as an additional language allocations for primary schools, was updated for all primary schools from the 2012/13 school year and now includes the Traveller pupils who had previously been supported by Resource Teacher for Traveller (RTT) posts.</p>  <p>  Limited alleviation measures were put in place to assist schools who had high concentrations of Traveller pupils previously supported by Resource Teacher for Traveller posts/hours, in the context of the limited resources available.</p>  <p>  A total of 141 posts have been allocated to schools for this purpose.  81 posts were also provided to readjust Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) allocations to include Traveller pupils previously supported by Resource Teacher for Traveller posts.</p>  <p>  38 alleviation posts were provided for schools that had high numbers or concentrations of Traveller pupils who were previously supported by RTT posts and a further 22 alleviation posts were allocated to schools who had the highest percentage of traveller pupils previously supported by RTT posts, in comparison to other schools, taking into account their overall pupil populations, and who had not qualified for the first round of alleviation posts.</p>  <p>  This Government has been resolutely committed to protecting, and where possible, increasing, the level of investment being made to support children with special educational needs at a time when there has been a requirement to make expenditure reductions across a range of areas.  It is an area of spending which has been prioritised above most other areas by this Government, despite the enormous pressures on all areas of public spending.</p>  <p>  Some &euro;1.37 billion will be spent in support of children with Special Educational Needs this year, which represents approximately 15% of my Department's budget.</p>  <p>  365 new Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts and 480 resource teaching posts have been provided to support children with special educational needs in schools in 2015, bringing the total number of SNAs available for allocation in 2015 to 11,330 posts and the total number of resource teaching posts to 6,705.  Over 11,000 resource and learning support teaching posts are now available.  This is the highest level of SNA and resource teaching allocations that we have ever had, and will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, a number of sections have been commenced, including those establishing the National Council for Special Education and those promoting an inclusive approach to education of children.</p>  <p>  The NCSE report on 'Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools' which was published in 2013 and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie, recommends that the EPSEN Act be fully implemented as soon as possible.

The rationale underlying the requirement was the presence of a monument which is listed on the statutory Record of Monuments and Places in the vicinity of the project location, as well as its proximity to the zone of archaeological potential surrounding the historic town where the school is being built, which is also a recorded monument.  I understand that ground works at the site revealed evidence of significant archaeological remains and, as a result, an archaeological excavation was commenced, which was also a planning condition.</p>  <p>  The cost of the archaeological monitoring to date is &euro;103,239 inclusive of VAT.

The enrolment policy must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>  <p>  This Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in the area. Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>  <p>  Existing equality legislation, which outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values. The Equality legislation provides that any school that has this objective may, where it has more applicants than places available, admit a student of a particular religious denomination in preference to other students. The legislation also provides that a school whose objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values can refuse to admit a student who is not of that religion only where the school proves that this refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school.</p>  <p>  It is my firm view that all schools should be inclusive. It is with this spirit of inclusiveness that the proposed Admission to Schools Bill is designed. Drafting of the Bill is currently at an advanced stage and the Bill is on the Government legislative programme for publication early in the Spring/Summer session. </p>  <p>  The draft Bill does not propose changes to the existing equality legislation. The draft Bill, while including provision for single sex schools and denominational schools to reflect in their admission policy the exemptions applicable to such schools under equality legislation, will provide for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion. The draft Bill will also provide for schools to publish an enrolment policy which will include details of the school's arrangements for students who do not want to attend religious instruction.</p>  <p>  The Bill and its associated regulations should see improved access to schools for all pupils and ensure there is consistency, fairness and transparency in the admissions policies of schools and in the service they provide to parents.</p></reply>

In keeping with this principle, additional resources provided in the education system are allocated on the basis of identified individual educational need rather than that of ethnic or cultural background.<br/><br/>Following decisions of the last Government, as part of the December 2010 budgetary process, Traveller pupils who are eligible for learning support teaching now receive this tuition through the existing learning support provision in schools. This is in keeping with the policy of inclusion and the 2006 report.<br/><br/>The General Allocation Model, which provides additional learning support and English as an additional language allocations for primary schools, was updated for all primary schools from the 2012/13 school year and now includes the Traveller pupils who had previously been supported by Resource Teacher for Traveller (RTT) posts.<br/><br/>Limited alleviation measures were put in place to assist schools who had high concentrations of Traveller pupils previously supported by Resource Teacher for Traveller posts/hours, in the context of the limited resources available.<br/><br/>A total of 141 posts have been allocated to schools for this purpose. 81 posts were also provided to readjust Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) allocations to include Traveller pupils previously supported by Resource Teacher for Traveller posts.<br/><br/>Thirty-eight alleviation posts were provided for schools that had high numbers or concentrations of Traveller pupils who were previously supported by RTT posts and a further 22 alleviation posts were allocated to schools who had the highest percentage of traveller pupils previously supported by RTT posts, in comparison to other schools, taking into account their overall pupil populations, and who had not qualified for the first round of alleviation posts.<br/><br/>This Government has been resolutely committed to protecting, and where possible, increasing, the level of investment being made to support children with special educational needs at a time when there has been a requirement to make expenditure reductions across a range of areas. It is an area of spending which has been prioritised above most other areas by this Government, despite the enormous pressures on all areas of public spending.<br/><br/>Some &euro;1.37 billion will be spent in support of children with Special Educational Needs this year, which represents approximately 15% of my Department's budget.<br/><br/>Three hundred and sixty-five new Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts and 480 resource teaching posts have been provided to support children with special educational needs in schools in 2015, bringing the total number of SNAs available for allocation in 2015 to 11,330 posts and the total number of resource teaching posts to 6,705. Over 11,000 resource and learning support teaching posts are now available. This is the highest level of SNA and resource teaching allocations that we have ever had, and will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.<br/><br/>With regard to the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, a number of sections have been commenced, including those establishing the National Council for Special Education and those promoting an inclusive approach to education of children.<br/><br/>The NCSE report on 'Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools' which was published in 2013 and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie, recommends that the EPSEN Act be fully implemented as soon as possible. The report also states that the NCSE recognises that the current economic climate makes it unlikely that the Government will be able to implement this recommendation in the short to medium term.<br/><br/>It is intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice.<br/><br/>This includes the National Council for Special Education's (NCSE) Report on a Proposed New Model for Allocating Teachers for Students with Special Educational Needs, published on 18th June 2014. <br/><br/>The report recommends that a new allocation model should be developed, based on a schools educational profile, while providing a baseline allocation to every mainstream school to support inclusion. <br/><br/>I hope to make an announcement in relation to this matter shortly, in order to give clarity to schools regarding the allocation process for the coming school year.</p></reply>

These themes are further developed in SPHE at post primary level.</p>  <p>  My Department also supports the Blue Star programme for primary school students. This programme, which is funded through the Department of the Taoiseach, seeks to foster pupils' better understanding and knowledge of the European Union and how it affects the lives of Irish citizens. </p>  <p>  Education about active citizenship is an integral component of the new Framework for Junior Cycle. For example, one of the 24 'Statements of Learning', that encompass the key knowledge and skills that students will be expected to develop during their junior cycle, requires that all students will "value what it means to be an active citizen with rights and responsibilities in local and wider context".  In addition, the 8 key skills which underpin the new Framework for Junior Cycle, include "working with others" whereby students should realise and experience how they can "contribute to making the world a better place". </p>  <p>  A new short course in Civics, Social and Political Education (CSPE), which has been developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), is available, since last September,  to schools to implement, should they wish to do so, as part of their junior cycle programme. The short course aims to inform, inspire, empower and enable young people to participate as active citizens in contemporary society at local, national and global levels based on an understanding of human rights and social responsibilities. Or, for this academic year, schools may choose to offer the existing CSPE syllabus.</p>  <p>  In my proposal for Junior Cycle last November, I have included "wellbeing" as a core element of the reformed Junior Cycle. This will include CSPE, SPHE and PE.</p>  <p>  Post primary schools who offer Transition year (TY) have the flexibility to design their own TY programme, consisting of 'Transition Units', in accordance with an overall framework set out by the DES. Among the 'Transition Units' that have been developed to date are peace studies, politics, European studies, and gender studies.  </p>  <p>  One of the programmes that is implemented as part of TY is the Young Social Innovators Programme. This programme helps to develop social awareness and activism amongst young people in the 15-18 year age group. Participating students working in teams, attempt to address a social issue that they have identified as important at either local, national or international level. The projects are showcased in an annual event each year, with an award scheme. </p>  <p>  The Leaving Certificate Applied (LCA) includes a 'Social Education' Module which provides opportunities for the students to examine and explore issues and topics related to contemporary social, economic, political and cultural issues. </p>  <p>  My Department is also currently planning to introduce 'Politics and Society' as a new optional Leaving Certificate subject. It is intended that this new subject will be trialled in a number of schools in the 2016/2017 school year. </p></reply>

This includes a number of measures to promote physical activity in post primary schools.</p>  <p>  Post primary schools are required to deliver a minimum of 2 hours per week of Physical Education. In 2012, my Department carried out a 'Lifeskills' Survey in primary and post primary schools. The data indicated that, in addition to this formal PE provision, 96% of post primary schools encourage physical activity outside of school, and 86% promote physical activity during school break times.</p>  <p>  My Department's Professional Development Support Service for Teachers (PDST) is currently developing a professional development programme for primary and post primary teachers in P.E.. The initial focus of this professional support will be on developing fundamental movement skills and building the knowledge, skills and capacity of teachers to meet the physical literacy needs of learners through the P.E. Curriculum.</p>  <p>  My Department also supports the Active Schools Flag. This initiative, which was launched in 2009, recognises schools that provide a quality programme for all students and promote physical activity across the whole school community. The popularity of this programme among all schools is increasing annually.</p>  <p>  Physical activity by pupils is not the sole remit of schools. PE in schools is designed to complement activity and other lifestyle habits outside of school. In fact, this "whole of life" approach is being adopted in the National Physical Activity Plan, which is currently being finalised by a cross-sectoral working group co-chaired by the Department of Health and the Department of Tourism and Sport. The Department of Education and Skills is a member of this group.</p>  <p>  In addition, I will shortly be issuing guidance to all schools about measures to promote healthy lifestyles generally. This guidance encompasses measures to promote P.E. and physical activity, as well as healthy eating and healthy vending. The guidance has been drafted in consultation with the Department of Health and the HSE.</p>  <p>  I have no plans at this time to extend the study referred to by the Deputy.   However, as part of a quality physical education programme, P.E. teachers routinely provide information, advice and guidance to students on how to improve a range of components of fitness as part of a healthy lifestyle. This would frequently include advice on the benefits of improved flexibility and the measurement of this component using basic field tests such as the sit-and-reach test.</p>  <p>  The authors of the study may wish to make contact with the management bodies of post primary schools, or principals' associations, should they wish to disseminate the benefits of their work more widely.  </p></reply>

Individualised data coverage has already been in place for a number of years at pre-primary, post-primary and third level education. The primary purpose of POD will be to monitor the education progress of primary pupils (in DES aided schools), throughout the primary system and onwards to post primary level and to help them develop their full educational potential. Once up and running other secondary purposes of POD will include becoming the basis for the allocation of teachers and capitation grants.The Department has consulted with the Data Protection Commissioner in relation to the collection of individual pupil information for the Primary Online Database. They have stated that PPSN can now be collected by schools with the purpose being it is a requirement of the Primary Online Database.  A PPS number is an individual's unique identification number for all dealings with the Public Service, including Social Welfare, tax, education and health services. Having the PPSN on the database will help ensure that there are no duplicate records in the system i.e that two schools do not have the same child on their roll. In the future we will be able to track pupils from early childhood education, to primary school and onto post-primary, which will allow us to ensure that every child in the State of compulsory school age is in education.</p></reply>

This represents an increase in four percentage points since the previous Lifeskills survey in 2009.</p>  <p>  The findings from the 2012 survey also indicate that 100% of respondent primary schools support their pupils to develop the skills of identifying and responding to unsafe situations, know when and how to seek help, and to say no to keeping secrets. A similar response was achieved through the Lifeskills survey in 2009.</p>  <p>  The validity of the findings from the Lifeskills survey is contingent on school principals completing the relevant questionnaire as honestly and accurately as possible. The integrity of this process would be compromised if responses given by school principals were used to target particular schools. My Department uses the findings from the Lifeskills survey to develop appropriate policy responses that are aimed at all schools, rather than targeting individual schools.</p>  <p>  The Lifeskills survey is conducted every 3 years. I will be launching the next Lifeskills survey in the next month. This will allow for the measurement of progress made by schools since 2012.  </p></reply>

Each of these schools was given an opportunity to have a teacher trained as a Reading Recovery teacher. In some areas where training took place in local cluster groups, schools other than those outlined were allowed to participate in the programme.</p>  <p>  Since 2004 over 20,000 students have benefited from the Reading Recovery Programme together with a range of other literacy supports. My Department, through the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), continues to prioritise support for DEIS Band 1 and DEIS Band 2 schools as well as maintaining ongoing support for other schools already participating in the programme.</p>  <p>  New schools have not been permitted to join the Reading Recovery Programme in light of the extensive programme of support available in the area of literacy.</p>  <p>  Emerging evidence from work carried out by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) is positive on the range of interventions including Reading Recovery in place for DEIS schools. Inspectorate evaluations also demonstrate that the effectiveness of specialised programmes is maximised when they are integrated into the overall programme in a school.</p>  <p>  Support for all schools provided by the PDST takes this into account as part of the ongoing continuing professional development programme for "Literacy and Numeracy for Learning and Life - The National Strategy to Improve Literacy and Numeracy for Children and Young People 2011-2020".</p></reply>

It is an area of spending which has been prioritised above most other areas by this Government, despite the enormous pressures on all areas of public spending.</p>  <p>  Some &euro;1.37 billion will be spent in support of children with Special Educational Needs this year, which represents approximately 15% of my Department's budget.</p>  <p>  Three hundred and sixty-five new Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts and 480 resource teaching posts have been provided to support children with special educational needs in schools in 2015, bringing the total number of SNAs available for allocation in 2015 to 11,330 posts and the total number of resource teaching posts to 6,705. Over 11,000 resource and learning support teaching posts are now available. This is the highest level of SNA and resource teaching allocations that we have ever had, and will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-02-10a.1121.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015021000075#WRX00700"><p>Budget 2015 included an increase in spending on education for the first time in recent years, amounting to additional funding of &euro;60m during 2015.<br/><br/>This funding will be used to provide 1,700 additional teachers and SNAs for our schools, as well as to fund prioritised reforms, such as implementation of the literacy and numeracy strategy, reform of junior cycle, and the introduction of education focussed preschool inspections.  It was not possible to also secure the funding which would have been required to change the staffing schedule for schools.<br/><br/>With regard to Resource Teachers for Travellers, the principle of inclusion is at the core of the Report and Recommendations for a Traveller Education Strategy published in 2006 and, accordingly, the focus of both current and future provision is on the development of a more inclusive school environment. In keeping with this principle, additional resources provided in the education system are allocated on the basis of identified individual educational need rather than that of ethnic or cultural background.<br/><br/>Following decisions of the last Government, as part of the December 2010 budgetary process, Traveller pupils who are eligible for learning support teaching now receive this tuition through the existing learning support provision in schools. This is in keeping with the policy of inclusion and the 2006 report.<br/><br/>The General Allocation Model, which provides additional learning support and English as an additional language allocations for primary schools, was updated for all primary schools from the 2012/13 school year and now includes the Traveller pupils who had previously been supported by Resource Teacher for Traveller (RTT) posts under the General Allocation Model.<br/><br/>Limited alleviation measures were put in place to assist schools who had high concentrations of Traveller pupils previously supported by Resource Teacher for Traveller posts/hours, in the context of the limited resources available.<br/><br/>Provision for English Language Support posts is now provided for under the General Allocation Model for schools, while further additional temporary language support posts provided on the basis of appeals to the Staffing Appeals Boards.  The appeal criteria are set out in the published staffing arrangements.<br/><br/>It should be noted that there has been no overall reduction to the level of investment being provided to support children with special educational needs in our schools.  On the contrary, the number of SNA and Resource Teaching post being allocated to support children with special educational needs has increased in recent years to reflect demographic growth and increased demand in this area.<br/><br/>This Government has been resolutely committed to protecting, and where possible, increasing, the level of investment being made to support children with special educational needs at a time when there has been a requirement to make expenditure reductions across a range of areas. It is an area of spending which has been prioritised above most other areas by this Government, despite the enormous pressures on all areas of public spending.<br/><br/>Some &euro;1.37 billion will be spent in support of children with Special Educational Needs this year, which represents approximately 15% of my Department's budget.<br/><br/>365 new Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts and 480 resource teaching posts have been provided to support children with special educational needs in schools in 2015, bringing the total number of SNAs available for allocation in 2015 to 11,330 posts and the total number of resource teaching posts to 6,705. Over 11,000 resource and learning support teaching posts are now available. This is the highest level of SNA and resource teaching allocations that we have ever had, and will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.<br/><br/>With regard to the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, a number of sections have been commenced, including those establishing the National Council for Special Education and those promoting an inclusive approach to education of children.<br/><br/>The NCSE report on 'Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools' which was published in 2013 and is available on the NCSE website <i>www.ncse.ie</i>, recommends that the EPSEN Act be fully implemented as soon as possible. The report also states that the NCSE recognises that the current economic climate makes it unlikely that the Government will be able to implement this recommendation in the short to medium term.<br/><br/>It is therefore intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice.<br/><br/>This includes the National Council for Special Education's (NCSE) Report on a Proposed New Model for Allocating Teachers for Students with Special Educational Needs, published on 18th June 2014.<br/><br/>I hope to make an announcement in relation to this report shortly, in order to give clarity to schools regarding the allocation process for the coming school year.</p></reply>

Some categories of ethnic or cultural background are required for international reporting purposes and in mainstream schools for enhanced capitation payments.  The Data Protection Commissioner advises that the most equitable way to collect this type of sensitive information is to give all pupils an opportunity to identify their own ethnic and cultural background and consent to the information being passed to the Department, rather than targeting a particular ethnic or cultural group in the data collection, and so we have proceeded with the question on that basis.  The question on Ethnic and Cultural background is not compulsory and parents have the option to choose no consent to answer the question.</p>  <p>  We are committed to reviewing the questions asked in POD.  As part of this we have reviewed our question In POD on the collection of information on Ethnic or Cultural Background.  We feel that the question used to collect data on ethnic or cultural background should be harmonised across all the education partners and other bodies who collect this type of information.  As the CSO is the National Statistical Office, we are taking our lead from them.  However, while the question asked in POD is not the exact same as the question asked in the Census of Population, it is based on the question.  The main difference between the Census of Population question and the question asked in POD was that we also included the category of Roma as Ireland has International data reporting requirements on this group.  The Census does not have a category of Roma.</p>  <p>  The Department is currently working on making changes to the text of some of the response categories to Ethnic and Cultural Background question.  This includes changes to the suggested consent form for schools to collect the information for POD and to the categories as they appear on the POD database. An updated consent form (in both English and Irish) will be available for downloading from the Department's website in the coming week.  These changes will also be reflected on the POD database in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The changes that will be made to the question asked in POD are outlined as follows.  Black African will be replaced with, Black or Black Irish - African,Any other Black Background will be replaced with, Black or Black Irish - Any other Background, Chinese will be replaced with, Asian or Asian Irish-Chinese, Any other Asian will be replaced with, Asian or Asian Irish - Any other background.</p>  <p>  While we accept the point that not everyone is happy with the a list of categories as they are laid out, it is very difficult to agree a list of categories that can satisfy everyone when discussing such a subjective matter, particularly the range of possible categories is infinitely wider than what is outlined in our question.In this regard the Statistics Section of the Department met with the CSO's Census of Population Division to discuss concerns such as yours.  They too accept that the variant of the ethnicity question on the 2016 census may fall short of what could be expected in today's multi -racial Ireland.  Unfortunately, given the no-change' census approach being adopted for Census of Population 2016 it is not possible to change the CSO question at this stage.  However the CSO has indicated that it is considering holding a seminar to examine how the data in this area can be improved from the point of view of maximising the number of write-in responses to increase the variety of ethnic descriptions captured, the classification system used, and also looking at the nationality vs. citizenship issue and examining generally how the outputs from the census can be improved in this important area.  The Department of Education and Skills will be participating in this seminar.  Note that the question on POD is intended to capture ethnic and cultural background only and there is a separate question on POD for nationality.</p></reply>

A high standard of scientific and mathematical skills for boys and girls is recognised to be critical in Ireland's economic development.</p>  <p>  Science became a compulsory subject for all primary pupils with the introduction of the Primary School Curriculum in 1999.  Infant pupils receive 45 minutes of instruction per week while 1st to 6th pupils receive one hour instruction per week.</p>  <p>  Discover Primary Science is a national programme designed to foster interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) in primary schools.  Last year they presented 517 schools with Awards of Science and Maths excellence.</p>  <p>  EMC Robotics Initiative (VEX IQ) was launched on 05/09/2014 by Minister for Skills, Research and Innovation Damien English TD.  EMC has teamed up with primary schools to design and build their own robots.  The global initiative is designed to encourage STEM learning and drive interest in technology from a young age.</p>  <p>  Scoilnet is the Department of Education and Skills (DES) official portal for Irish education.  The website is managed by Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) in Education on behalf of the DES.  The Sci-Spy Initiative which is a section of this website is aimed at primary students in 5th and 6th classes.</p>  <p>  Science Week Ireland is an annual event established to promote the relevance of science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) in our everyday lives.  It is coordinated by SFI Discover, the education-outreach programme of Science Foundation Ireland, who also help fund Engineers Week.</p>  <p>  Significant system developments have been introduced in the primary school system to promote teaching and learning in Mathematics for boys and girls including standardised national assessments of reading and mathematics introduced in 2007; the National strategy to improve literacy and numeracy introduced in 2011 and School self-evaluation guidelines for primary schools published in 2012.</p>  <p>  TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Studies) is a project of the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA).  It is designed to assess the mathematics and science achievement of fourth class pupils.  In 2011, Ireland took part in TIMSS for the first time since 1995.  Ireland's mean score of 527 is significantly above the TIMSS mathematics centre of 500.  Ireland is in 17th position in the TIMSS mathematics table.  In Ireland, girls averaged 526 and boys averaged 529.  The 3-point gap is not statistically significant, and is broadly similar to the overall international average gender age gap.</p>  <p>  Ireland is shown as 22nd position in the TIMSS science table.  In ireland, boys and girls obtained identical mean scores (516).</p>  <p>  The evidence from TIMSS indicates that girls are performing as well as their male counterparts in Science and Mathematics in primary schools.  The promotion of STEM subjects to girls only does not appear necessary.</p>  <p>  In January this year, I launched the performance report on the 2014 National Assessments of English and Reading and Mathematics which was prepared by the Educational Research Centre.  Their study of 8000 pupils in 150 primary schools found that overall performance in reading and maths in second and sixth classes was significantly higher than for the 2009 assessments.  These are the first significant improvements in over 30 years. Such improvements are to be welcomed.</p>  <p>  The NCCA has recently provided me with new specifications for Leaving Certificate Physics, Chemistry and Biology.  The NCCA has notified the Department that before the specifications made available to all schools that it, working with the SEC and my Department, will trial, in particular the proposed new practical examination.  It is expected, for example, that the new Physics specification, when it is introduced, will not attract more higher level students but it is hoped that it will also attract more girls and more students to study Physics at Ordinary level.  Work is underway on revising Leaving Certificate Applied Mathematics.  One of its aims would be to broaden the possible content so that it will be attractive to a wider cohort, especially for girls.</p>  <p>  The new Junior Cycle Science specification has been submitted to me, by NCCA, this month, for approval.  This will form a firm foundation for the sciences at senior cycle.  There is a significant overlap between the developments in the sciences at Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle.  Thus the CDP provided for Junior Cycle Science will also start to prepare science teachers for the changes which will follow in the Leaving Certificates sciences.  There will be many synergies between the two and there is a natural progression.  Of course there will be dedicated CPD provided to Leaving Certificate science teachers to prepare them to introduce the new specifications not only in Physics but also in Chemistry and Biology.  A unified CPD strategy will support a consistent experience of teaching and learning in the science curricula throughout post-primary education.</p></reply>

It proposed that additional resources be allocated to small primary schools that were willing to engage in a cluster, including the appointment of a cluster co-ordinator.  In  the period since the report was written, the country has experienced record birth rates and this has required  prioritising the provision of significant additional places at all levels of the education system, in a period of scarce resources.

It is an area of spending which has been prioritised above most other areas by this Government, despite the enormous pressures on all areas of public spending.</p>  <p>  Some &euro;1.37 billion will be spent in support of children with Special Educational Needs this year, which represents approximately 15% of my Department's budget.</p>  <p>  365 new Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts and 480 resource teaching posts have been provided to support children with special educational needs in schools in 2015, bringing the total number of SNAs available for allocation in 2015 to 11,330 posts and the total number of resource teaching posts to 6,705.  Over 11,000 resource and learning support teaching posts are now available.  This is the highest level of SNA and resource teaching allocations that we have ever had, and will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, a number of sections have been commenced, including those establishing the National Council for Special Education and those promoting an inclusive approach to education of children.</p>  <p>  The NCSE report on 'Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools' which was published in 2013 and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie, recommends that the EPSEN Act be fully implemented as soon as possible.  The report also states that the NCSE recognises that the current economic climate makes it unlikely that the Government will be able to implement this recommendation in the short to medium term.</p>  <p>  It is intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice.</p>  <p>  This includes the National Council for Special Education's (NCSE) Report on a Proposed New Model for Allocating Teachers for Students with Special Educational Needs, published on 18th June 2014.</p>  <p>  The report recommends that a new allocation model should be developed, based on a schools educational profile, while providing a baseline allocation to every mainstream school to support inclusion.</p>  <p>  I hope to make an announcement in relation to this matter shortly, in order to give clarity to schools regarding the allocation process for the coming school year.</p></reply>

The Act makes clear that my role in relation to this matter is to be consulted and that the ultimate decision regarding approval of programmes of medical education and the providers of those programmes rests with the Medical Council.</p>  <p>  On 4 December 2014 I received, in accordance with section 88(2)(a), correspondence from the Medical Council setting out the recommendations of a Committee established to perform the relevant functions under the Act in respect of a number of institutions, including the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Bahrain.</p>  <p>  The Government's position has been articulated by successive Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Ireland was also one of 47 United Nations Member States who participated in a joint statement at the UN Human Rights Council expressing serious concern regarding the protection of human rights in Bahrain and calling on the Bahraini Government to expedite the implementation of the recommendations received from the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry.  The issues involved have also been the subject of detailed consideration by the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Social Protection.</p>  <p>  The Government has always sought to draw a clear distinction between the wider human rights situation and the involvement of Irish institutions in the education and training of Bahraini medical personnel.  In that regard, I regard the process set out under Section 88 of the Act as a vital part of the quality assurance architecture for medical education and training in Irish institutions, ensuring compliance with relevant national and international standards.</p>  <p>  Therefore, while the Government will continue to use all appropriate diplomatic avenues to express its concerns regarding the human rights situation in Bahrain, it was important to ensure that the Medical Council's consultation with me remained focused on the matters which have been properly identified by the Medical Council under both the Act and other relevant national and international standards.</p>  <p>  In the context of the above, in responding to the Medical Council, I noted that it was proposed that "the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland Bahrain's six year programme of basic medical education and training should be approved for a period of five years under the terms of Section 88(2)(a)(i)(I) of the Act.  This recommendation is made on the grounds that the programme adheres to the rules, criteria, guidelines and standards approved by Council, as specified in Section 88(2)(a) and 88(2)(d) of the Act."  I also noted that "The Medical Council Team is satisfied that, while not a separate programme, and therefore not being separately accredited under the Act, the five year programme as delivered by RCSI Bahrain is satisfactory."</p>  <p>  I also expressed my expectation that the Medical Council would have had regard to all of the information relevant to its consideration of national and international standards, including relevant legislation and the World Federation for Medical Education's (WFME) Standards in Basic Medical Education.  In this regard, I understand that the panel of assessors were given a copy of the Ceartas report outlining that organisation's perspective on the human rights situation in Bahrain.</p>  <p>  I also noted my expectation that appropriate engagement would have taken place with the "wider range of stakeholders" envisaged by the WFME in its Global Standards for Quality Improvement in Medical Education: European Specification, including representatives of "academic staff, students, the community, education and health care authorities, professional organisations and postgraduate educators."</p></reply>

One of the principles on which assessment of that course was based was that 'full coverage of both knowledge and skills should be encouraged'.  Evidence from candidates' scripts under previous examination arrangements indicated that some parts of the course were not being addressed in teaching and learning.  The removal of choice in the examinations from 2003 sought to ensure that the whole course was studied.  Since the vast majority of students proceed to senior cycle, where almost all study mathematics, it was seen as important that their study of mathematics in the junior cycle would lay an appropriate foundation for progression to subsequent study of the subject at senior cycle.</p>  <p>  In the revised syllabuses introduced under the Project Maths initiative, this position was maintained.  Given the inter-relatedness of the various syllabus strands and the requirement for students to integrate knowledge and skills from across the syllabus when solving problems &ndash; of a mathematical nature, as well as problems set in both familiar and unfamiliar contexts &ndash; it is important that all topics on the course are studied by all students, regardless of syllabus level.  Furthermore, the absence of choice allows for questions of varying length and complexity to be included in the examination papers and removes the need for all questions to be of equal difficulty in terms of the challenge they present to candidates and the time taken for their completion.</p></reply>

In the budget it was not possible to provide for extra teaching posts that would change the staffing schedule for primary schools, including small schools.  The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities and will continue to be so.  However, this does not mean that small schools can stand still or never have their staffing levels changed to something that is more affordable and sustainable.  All public servants are being asked to do more with less and the teachers in our small schools cannot be exempt from this requirement.  As part of the Budget 2012 decisions, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools was gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014.  An appeals process is available to schools that are affected by this measure.</p>  <p>  Our current configuration of small primary schools has been examined by the Department in a value for money (VFM) review.  The report of the value for money review of small primary schools will be published as soon as my Government colleagues and I have finalised our consideration of the report and its recommendations.</p>  <p>  The report contains much detailed and technical data in relation to the small schools in the primary sector and it also contains a suite of recommendations and options.  Government needs time to properly consider the review report and its recommendations.  There are a range of important matters to be considered.  Decisions on school provision and any possible reorganisation must be widely perceived to be cost-effective, equitable and reasonable.  These decisions need to be based on a rigorous evaluation of requirements and needs, not just at a local level but also at both regional and national levels.</p>  <p>  Since becoming Minister each of the education partners that I have met have indicated their own set of priorities.  In the school sector these priorities include school leadership, pay restoration, reductions in pupil-teacher ratios, increases to capitation, and the restoration of ex-quota guidance counsellors in schools.  Outside of the schools sector, the list of demands includes funding of third level, investment in early years and investment in technology.  It is not, and never will be, possible to satisfy all of the demands of the education system at one time.  Hence the need to identify priorities for consideration as part of future budgets and as our economy recovers.</p></reply>

The remaining 20% will be re-distributed to provide top-up funding to certain local authorities that have lower property tax bases due to the variance in property values across the State.  Local Property Tax was introduced to provide an alternative, stable and sustainable funding base for the local authority sector, providing greater levels of connection between local revenue raising and associated expenditure decisions.  Given that local authorities vary significantly from one another in terms of size, population, public service demands, infrastructure and income sources, the Government has decided that no local authority will receive less income from LPT in 2015 than they received for General Purpose Grants (GPGs) from the Local Government Fund in 2014.  Certain local authorities, with stronger property bases, will receive greater levels of funding from local retention of LPT in 2015 than they received from the Local Government Fund in 2014.</p>  <p>  The Government has decided that these latter local authorities will use this surplus funding in two ways, with a portion available for their own discretionary purposes and the remainder, if any, to fund some local services in the Housing and Roads areas for which they currently receive Central Government funding.  The portion that will be retained for discretionary purposes by these authorities will be an amount equal to 20% of the total expected LPT income in the relevant local authority area (before any decision to vary rates) or, in the case where that surplus will be less than 20%, the full amount.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, 10 local authorities will receive higher levels of LPT income in 2015 compared to GPG funding in 2014 that will enable them to fund local services of up to &euro;131.7m in the Housing and &euro;21.7m in the Roads areas, respectively, and, therefore, free up some Central Government funding for other purposes. Those local authorities are - Clare, Cork County, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown, Dublin City, Fingal, Galway City, Kildare, Meath, South Dublin and Wicklow.  I have advised all local authorities of their individual provisional LPT allocations, totalling &euro;458.9m, for 2015, of which up to &euro;153.4m is ring fenced to fund   local services in the Housing and Roads areas by the 10 local authorities as outlined above.  Further details in relation to the specific obligations that my Department will seek to be satisfied from these self-funding levels in the Housing area will be provided as part of the overall Housing grant allocations process for 2015, which will be completed in due course.  It is a matter for the individual local authorities to decide how to spend the remaining &euro;305.5m,   in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources.</p>  <p>  The decision to allow local authorities to retain 80% of LPT locally and the power to vary LPT rates will facilitate further implementation of the overall objective of the local government reform programme, which is to achieve greater devolution to the local government sector, through supporting enhanced local decision making on spending priorities.</p></reply>

The Commissioner of Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters, including the method of valuation.  The Valuation Act 2001 comes under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation for each property determined by the Valuation Office to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.</p>  <p>  The Commissioner of Valuation, who has sole responsibility for all valuation matters, is conducting a programme of revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State on a county by county basis.  The national revaluation programme is the first general valuation since the middle of the 19th century, and it is a significant undertaking.    If there is to be a fair distribution of the rates burden then valuation should be based on modern rental values.</p>  <p>  I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, that, following the completion of the revaluation of the four local authority areas in Dublin, the three former local authorities in Waterford and the revaluation of Limerick, over 48,000 properties have been revalued.  While this represents in excess of 33% of all rateable properties, it constitutes about 57% of the valuation base for levying rates.  The Valuation Act 2001 provides that the valuation be carried out on a rolling basis.  This means that each rating authority area will be separately valued as part of a planned sequential valuation of the whole country.  The sequence is decided by the Commissioner of Valuation, who is independent in carrying out his function.  Valuation Orders for the revaluation of further Local Authority areas are expected to be made by the Commissioner in the near future.</p>  <p>  The Valuation (Amendment) (No.2) Bill 2012, which was initiated in the Seanad, was passed by that House on 20th November 2014 and   is scheduled to be introduced in the D&aacute;il shortly.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to introduce measures that will enable the Commissioner of Valuation to accelerate the national programme of revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties across the State.  The measures included in the Bill include provisions for Outsourcing, Occupier Assisted Valuation and the use of computer-aided techniques.</p></reply>

It is proposed that the grant will be paid in one instalment to all eligible households in September 2015 and on an annual basis thereafter. </p>  <p>  The water conservation grant replaces the tax rebate and social protection measures previously announced, as it is a more straightforward means of addressing water issues for all households on equal terms and will reduce households&rsquo; outlay on water services both now and in the future.</p>  <p>  An allocation of &euro;130m for the grant scheme has been provided in my Department&rsquo;s Estimate for 2015.  This is based on an estimate of up to 1.3 million households applying for the grant.  This estimated level of demand for 2015 takes account of the number of primary residences recorded in Census 2011 as well as experiences with other demand-led schemes.  The provisions required in future years will be determined as part of the annual budgetary process, having regard to the take-up of the scheme and forecast growth in household numbers.   </p>  <p>  My Department, in consultation with the Department of Social Protection, is currently finalising the modalities of the water conservation grant.  I will thereafter make Regulations under the Water Services Act 2014 which will provide for the terms and conditions attaching to the grant, including the date by which households will need to have responded to the Irish Water campaign if they are to be eligible for the grant.  All households registered with Irish Water under its application campaign will be contacted directly by the Department of Social Protection in due course.</p></reply>

The related Technical Guidance Documents provide technical guidance on how to achieve compliance with the Regulations.  All buildings, both public and private, must comply with the Building Regulations that are in force at the time of their construction.  The Building Regulations are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that they remain in line with both national and international best practice.<br/><br/>Part M of the Building Regulations sets out the regulatory requirements in respect of access and use.  Under the <i>Building Regulations (Part M Amendment) Regulations 2010</i>and the associated <i>Technical Guidance Document M &ndash; Access and Use</i>(2010), which came into effect on 1 January 2012, adequate provision shall be made for people to access and use a building, its facilities and its environs.<br/><br/>The aim of Part M is to ensure that regardless of age, size or disability:<br/><br/>-new buildings other than dwellings are accessible and usable;<br/><br/>-extensions to existing buildings other than dwellings are, where practicable, accessible and useable;<br/><br/>-material alterations to existing buildings other than dwellings increase the accessibility and usability of existing buildings, where practicable;<br/><br/>-certain changes of use to existing buildings other than dwellings increase the accessibility and usability of existing buildings, where practicable;and<br/><br/>-new dwellings are visitable.<br/><br/>The underlying philosophy of Part M is to ensure that buildings and their facilities should be accessible and usable by persons of all ages and abilities and that the designers and builders of new buildings take accessibility issues into account throughout the design process in order to deliver a built environment that is more inclusive of all elements of society.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding requirements under the Building Regulations, the Disability Act 2005 requires public bodies to ensure that their public buildings are, as far as practicable, accessible to persons with disabilities.  Under Section 25 of the Act, there is an obligation on public bodies to make their public buildings comply with Part M of the Building Regulations by 31 December 2015 [i.e. Technical Guidance Document M (2000 edition)].  Section 25 also requires that public buildings be brought into compliance with any amendments to Part M not later than 10 years after the commencement of such amendments [i.e. Technical Guidance Document M (2010 edition)].  The Act also provides that the Minister for Justice and Equality may request the National Disability Authority to prepare and submit a draft code of practice , which the Minster may approve, amend or refuse as the case may be,relating to the accessibility of public buildings to persons with disabilities for the purpose of giving guidance to public bodies in these matters.</p></reply>

The NPPR Charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence.  The NPPR Charge is based on self-declaration and therefore the onus is on the property owner themselves to register their property and make the payment.  The 2009 Act places the Charge under the care and management of the local authorities and application in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority; Part 12 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 deals with the collection of undischarged liabilities relating to the NPPR Charge.</p>  <p>  A number of exemptions from the charge are set out in section 4 of the 2009 Act and section 4(6) provides for an exemption from the charge in a situation where a residential property is occupied rent-free as the sole or main residence of a relative of the owner and the sole or main residence of the owner is either on the same property or within two kilometres of it. </p>  <p>  I have no plans to revise the legislation.  </p></reply>

The Housing Finance Agency (HFA) advanced the associated funds to local authorities.<br/><br/>A total of &euro;403 m was advanced by local authorities under the pre - May 1986 income-related loan scheme for 15,571 mortgages.  On 30 June 2014, 286  of these loans were still outstanding with a corresponding total loan balance of &euro;10.5 m (i.e. an average loan amount of less than &euro;37,000).  Current interest rates are as listed in Schedule 1 A and 1 B of Circular HFA 236 which can be found on the HFA website at: <font color="#1F497D">.</font><br/><br/>Overall, the Scheme has successfully funded over 15,000 homes for families who would, otherwise, not have obtained a house loan.  No new loans have issued under this Scheme since 1986 and there are no plans to alter this position. Individual local authorities administer the Scheme and deal directly with borrowers.<br/><br/>As with all local authority mortgages, evidence of having been refused a loan by two financial institutions was necessary in order to apply under the Scheme. Less than 2% of borrowers under the Scheme have outstanding loans.  In some pre-May 1986 loan cases, the income related repayment did not fully cover the interest charges on the loan and, as a result, the loan values appreciated.  The outstanding loan balance, in most cases, relates to a property whose value greatly exceeds the outstanding debt.<br/><br/>Since the extension of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) Scheme to pre-May 1986 income-related loans in 1996, a borrower availing of SWA who has a loan balance that has increased since the time of advance can have the interest on the increased portion of the loan, less any arrears, provided for by the HFA.  The interest on the original advance amount is covered by the SWA scheme through the Department of Social Protection, subject to borrower eligibility.This arrangement operates through local authorities.<br/><br/>To assist local authority borrowers in financial distress, my Department issued revised guidelines to local authorities for dealing with mortgage arrears within the local authority sector in June 2014.  <i>Dealing with Mortgage Arrears &ndash; A Guide for Local Authorities</i>is available on my Department&rsquo;s website by clicking on the following link:<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>The Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), already in place in respect of commercial mortgages, is now being implemented across all local authorities.  In cases of acute mortgage distress, homeowners also have the option of seeking to avail of the legal process now also in place to deal with personal insolvency.  The most important step any family in arrears can take is to engage early with the Arrears Support Unit of the local authority.  Solutions are available and advice should be sought as early as possible.<br/><br/>In addition, the Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) scheme was rolled out nationally in February 2014.  The Scheme allows local authorities to offer the mortgage to rent scheme to local authority mortgage holders with unsustainable mortgages.  This enables families to stay in their home and their established community.  Surrendering the ownership equity in a home is a very difficult decision for a family; however, the mortgage to rent option does provide families with stability and continuity, after an often long period of financial turmoil.  Ownership of the home transfers to the local authority and the family pays a differential rent.  LAMTR is just one of a range of short term and long term solutions available to local authority mortgage holders in arrears.</p></reply>

The ban proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels in Dublin.  As well as bringing air quality levels into compliance with the then EU standards, the ban also had the effect of significantly improving human health in the capital. Research indicated that the ban in Dublin has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths.  The ban was subsequently extended to other urban areas.</p>  <p>   In August 2012, following a public consultation process, new solid fuel regulations were introduced with the aim of ensuring that the smoky coal ban remains fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of certain residential solid fuels.  The ban now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide, including all Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designated towns for the purpose of air quality management under the EU Cleaner Air for Europe Directive 2008/50/EC.   </p>  <p>  The ban has not previously been applied in Midleton, as it is not an EPA designated urban air quality management zone.  However, the local authorities may at any time write to me to propose new towns for consideration for inclusion under the ban, if it is considered necessary to protect local air quality.  It is suggested that, if a local authority is considering such a proposal, then this should first be debated as a Council motion and subject to a period of local consultation.  This was the approach taken in relation to the recent consolidation of ban area boundaries in Celbridge/Maynooth and Wexford. </p>  <p>  Air quality monitoring by the EPA has indicated that air quality is poorer in towns where the smoky coal ban does not apply, although smaller smoky coal ban areas may be more difficult to enforce.  The further extension of the ban to smaller towns on an individual basis may not be the most effective solution to addressing the problem of emissions from residential solid fuel use in these areas.  However, it is recognised that having different regulations between urban and rural locations is not ideal, as it results in different levels of environmental protection and clean air benefits for citizens in different locations.</p></reply>

In relation to the Rural Innovation and Development fund, which the Deputy refers to, an amount of &euro;1 million has been allocated for this purpose in 2015 and I am currently examining ways to distribute this funding in order to maximise its impact at local level.<br/><br/>A number of the recommendations contained in the CEDRA report relate to the provision of broadband infrastructure in rural areas and form part of the work programme of the IDG.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is represented on the IDG and I am advised that the Department has recently launched a new website entitled , which sets out the importance of all citizens having access to high speed broadband no matter where they live or work.  The national broadband plan , which is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, is an ambitious initiative that will take time to implement but I am confident will deliver for rural areas.<br/><br/>The LEADER element of the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2007-2013 which falls under my Department&rsquo;s remit did provide support to both new and already established enterprise in rural areas.  Since the current programme period began in 2009, 8, 698 enterprises have been supported and 4, 084 jobs created.  In 2014, 1, 880 enterprises were supported with 1,148 jobs created.  LEADER has also provided support in the past to Community Enterprise Centers in the context of the requirement for such centers having been identified in the needs analysis of the area concerned.  As LEADER is a community led approach to development there are no allocations specifically for community enterprise centres; however, they are eligible for funding if the need for them is identified by the community concerned.  LEADER is not the only avenue for funding to rural enterprise related activity, and in this context the information above should be supplemented by information from other relevant Departments.<br/><br/>It should be noted that support for rural enterprise development will also be available through the LEADER elements of RDP 2014-2020 where a total of &euro;250 million euro will be available over the next 5-6 years to support the development of sustainable rural communities.  LEADER is delivered through the medium of Local Development Strategies (LDS) by Local Action Groups and I hope to be in a position to launch the selection process for LDSs very shortly, with a view to having strategies operational towards the end of 2015.<br/><br/>The resources available through the LEADER elements of the RDP are critical to the future economic development of rural Ireland.  However, it is also essential to ensure that these resources are working in a complementary way at a local level.  In this context the delivery of a more coordinated approach to local development as envisaged by the local government reform process is also critical and I am confident that the delivery of LEADER and other resources in a coordinated way at a local level will provide strong support for the future sustainable development of rural Ireland.</p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water shall collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it.  Accordingly, the collection of water charges is now the statutory responsibility of Irish Water.

My Department does not holdinformation on the amount of outstanding non-domestic water charges owed to Irish Water.<br/><br/>The collection of non-domestic water charges until 31 December 2013 was a matter for the local authority concerned.  Income data is published by local authorities in their Annual Financial Statements.  The latest year for which audited Local Authority Annual Financial Statement data are available is 2012.  Commercial water charges billed in that year amounted to some &euro;187.6 million, while &euro;180.7 million was collected.  However, due to the historical arrears which had accumulated in preceding years, a total of &euro;145,110,593 was owed to local authorities in respect of unpaid commercial water charges at the end of 2012, representing a 55% collection rate of all revenues due.  The Local Authority Annual Financial Statement 2012 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>My Department understands that the amount billed to the non-domestic sector, excluding connection charges, for 2014 was approx &euro;180m.

The Social Housing Strategy 2020, which I published in November 2014, sets out clear, measureable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, while the implementation of the range of actions under the Government&rsquo;s Construction 2020 Strategy will also support increased supply in the wider housing market.  The implementation of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a key Government priority and a major pillar of the Social Housing Strategy 2020.  The HAP scheme will bring all social housing supports provided by the State under the aegis of local authorities.  The scheme will remove a barrier to employment by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment. HAP will also improve regulation of the rented accommodation being supported and provide certainty for landlords as regards their rental income.</p>  <p>  The statutory pilot phase of HAP commenced in September 2014 and is now in effect in 7 local authority areas, which are Limerick City and County, Waterford City and County, Cork County, Louth, Kilkenny, South Dublin and Monaghan.  Some 800 households are in receipt of HAP at present across these 7 local authority areas.  Dublin City Council is also part of the statutory HAP pilot with a specific focus on accommodating homeless households, as provided for in the Action Plan to Address Homelessness.  Dublin City Council is implementing the HAP pilot for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of all 4 Dublin local authorities.</p>  <p>  Section 43(2)(a) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 provides for the making of Regulations to prescribe the maximum rent limits for different household classes that will apply in each local authority where HAP has been commenced.  In prescribing these limits, household size and prevailing rents in the relevant areas are taken into consideration.  These limits are based on the current rent supplement limits as set out by the Department of Social Protection, in advance of the introduction of a national differential rents framework for local authorities, as provided for under section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, later this year.  I understand that the Department of Social Protection is currently finalising a review of maximum rent limits.</p>  <p>  There is evidence of a growing pressure on rents in the lower segment of the market in some high demand areas. In the context of the implementation of HAP, my Department works closely with the Department of Social Protection, and continues to closely monitor trends in the housing market and the potential impacts on housing supply, including data gathered by HAP pilot authorities in relation to this issue.  These factors are being carefully considered in the context of the further roll out of HAP and particularly in relation to any future changes to maximum rent limits that apply in local authorities where HAP is operating.</p></reply>

Irish Water is providing landlords with the opportunity to prove that they are not the occupier by providing the tenants name.

Section 5 of the Act provides that one share in Irish Water shall be issued to Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann (now Ervia) with the remaining shares allocated equally between the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Finance.  Accordingly, Irish Water is in full State ownership.

The recommendation was that there should be a right for citizens to petition on influencing the legislative agenda and to petition for referendums.  In response, the Government has pointed to the fact that constitutional referendums are already common in Ireland and there is nothing to prevent citizens from presenting petitions.  In addition, Article 27 of the Constitution already provides a facility for a Bill to be put to the people if it contains a matter of such public importance that the will of the people ought to be ascertained on it.</p>  <p>  The Government has substantially opened up the legislative process through a number of initiatives.  These include the work of the Constitutional Convention itself as well as significant packages of D&aacute;il reform put in place since 2011.  These reforms include the setting up of the Public Service Oversight and Petitions Committee.  As part of its remit, the Committee receives and considers public petitions submitted to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It also engages regularly with the Ombudsman and other oversight bodies.</p>  <p>  In 2011 the Government introduced a system of pre-legislative review before Oireachtas Committees.  In 2013 this was expanded to become a pre-legislative stage before the relevant Oireachtas Committee, as a requirement for all non-emergency legislation.  This system now allows for an extensive engagement by the public, civic society and other interested groups and academics in the law-making process.</p>  <p>  The Government has indicated that it will bear in mind the particular Constitutional Convention recommendation on direct democracy when the latest package of D&aacute;il reform measures and its success in opening up the legislative process is being reviewed.</p></reply>

As such, Ireland must develop a register of, and a regulatory control system for, water abstraction points.  My Department is currently examining how best to address this requirement in a proportionate and efficient way and it has convened a working group to consider the issues arising and to make recommendations.  While no decisions will be made on this matter until extensive research and public consultation is undertaken, it would be my intention that a proportionate abstraction control regime will effectively manage abstraction risks and pressures without imposing unnecessary regulatory burden.  Recognising the relatively low abstraction pressures in Ireland it is expected that a regime would focus on the most significant abstraction volumes and pressures recognising that the Directive does not require the registration and licencing of private wells serving individual domestic dwellings.  The initial research phase, which will take up much of 2015, will provide a basis for my Department to engage in extensive consultation with the key sectors and with the wider public. <br/><br/><b><i>Irish Water has sent out customer application packs and letters to all households to enable customers to confirm their details and to ensure that a correct and up-to-date database of customers exists. </i></b>As part of this process, households who are not customers of Irish Water, such as owners of private wells and waste water treatment systems, are requested to confirm this to the company so that they are not charged as customers in error.  Furthermore, by registering these details, such households become eligible for the water conservation grant if it is their primary residence.  These are the only purposes for which such information will be used.</p></reply>

This was intended to support communities by restoring roads, coastal protection, amenities/facilities and other public infrastructure which had been damaged.  It was agreed that the funding would be made available via the Votes of the appropriate Departments, viz, Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, the Office of Public Works and my own Department.  While my Department had an initial role in collating details and costs of damage in the immediate aftermath of the severe weather based on returns and estimates provided by local authorities, the other Departments and Offices listed above liaise directly with the local authorities on funding which falls under their remit.  In the case of funding requirements which fall under the remit of my Department, viz, tourism infrastructure funded by the local authorities, certain piers, harbours and other facilities in the charge of the local authorities, current costs totalling &euro;4 million and capital costs totalling &euro;13.1 million were estimated initially for the first phase of severe weather.  For the 2nd phase of severe weather, from 27 January to 17 February 2014, local authorities estimated current costs of &euro;3.5 million and &euro;8.5 million in capital costs.  Some additional works beyond the original &euro;7.5 m initially estimated were identified under the current costs heading covering clean-up and necessary immediate repairs and by the end of 2014 &euro;7.859 m was disbursed by my Department.  A further &euro;5.994 million has been paid by my Department in respect of capital costs in 2014.  Provision has been made in my Department&rsquo;s Vote for a further &euro;10 million in respect of capital costs to be incurred by local authorities in 2015 on repair and remediation projects. </p>  <p>  Although local authorities were asked to give priority to works which are significant for economic activity and support for the tourism industry in particular, it is a matter for the local authorities to decide which projects are to be progressed and in which timescales.  My Department does not have a role with regard to the sanctioning or ongoing monitoring of individual projects and local authorities recoup funding for these projects from my Department on the basis of the submission of certification that expenditure has been incurred within the overall expenditure ceilings allocated.   </p>  <p>  No funding has been drawn down from my Department by local authorities to date in 2015. </p></reply>

Firstly, environmental noise must be assessed through the preparation of strategic noise maps for areas and infrastructure falling within defined criteria.  This is undertaken by prescribed noise mapping bodies, which includes Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) and local authorities.  Secondly, based on the results of the mapping process, the Regulations require the preparation of noise action plans for each area concerned, which is undertaken by the relevant local authority, the prescribed noise action planning body.  The fundamental objective of action plans is the prevention and reduction of environmental noise.<br/><br/>The Regulations require the review and revision of strategic noise maps and noise action plans on a five year cycle.  A new round of noise mapping was conducted during 2012.  Following the noise mapping exercise, the four Dublin local authorities prepared a new Noise Action Plan for the period 2013 &ndash; 2018.  This plan sets out an approach to the strategic management and control of environmental noise.  The plan is available on the Dublin City Council website at the following link - <br/><br/>.<br/><br/>The most recent noise mapping exercise found that 200 people are exposed to undesirable night-time levels above 55 dB(A) from aircraft using Dublin Airport.  As compared to the previous mapping exercise in 2007, there has been an overall reduction in the number of people exposed to undesirable night-time noise levels.<br/><br/>In 2008, Dublin Airport Stakeholders Forum set up an Environmental Working Group that works closely with Fingal County Council.  This group provides an effective forum for the discussion of all environment matters concerning the development and operation of the airport that have an impact on users, customers of the airport and on people living and working in the surrounding communities.<br/><br/>The management of noise abatement of operational procedures at Dublin Airport is shared by the airport operator, the DAA, and the airlines operating at the airport.  Under the European Communities (Air Navigation and Transport Rules and Procedures for Noise Related Operating Restrictions at Airports) Regulations 2003, the Irish Aviation Authority has the responsibility of ensuring that the airport operator has in place a system of noise monitoring. <br/><br/>I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, that, in recognition of its responsibilities in this area, the DAA has introduced, and continues to evaluate, a number of initiatives to monitor aircraft noise levels and to mitigate their impact.  A flight tracking system is now operated that allows aircraft movements to be analysed and to respond to any complaints relating to aircraft noise.  The primary objective of the Noise &amp;amp; Flight Track Department of the DAA is to gather information on aircraft approach and departure routes and resultant noise levels at a number of key locations. </p></reply>

It is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by these producers.  The PSO levy is also vital to enable Ireland to meet its 2020 40% target for electricity generated from renewable sources by 2020, which in turn is important for the achievement of Ireland's 16% EU 2020 target for renewable energy.  </p>  <p>  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) determines the PSO levy which is a charge on all electricity customers without exception.  The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation are set out in Regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (S.I. 217 of 2002).  The annual PSO levy amount for 2014/2015 is &euro;335.4 million.  This equates to &euro;64.37 per annum for residential customers, &euro;221.66 per annum for small to medium sized business customers and &euro;34.20/kVA for medium and large customers.</p>  <p>  The biggest driver for the levy rise for this year is the lower predicted wholesale market electricity price, which is estimated to be around 10% lower than last year.  This results in lower predicted market income for the PSO plants and, therefore, a higher levy is required to cover their allowed costs.  The lower wholesale electricity price is currently being driven by lower international gas prices in evidence since mid-2013.  This drives up the proposed PSO levy.  However, if these lower gas and wholesale prices are sustained, the lower wholesale prices would reduce the wholesale cost of electricity that suppliers pay.  In turn, suppliers would be in a position to reduce their retail prices and potentially offset the PSO levy increase.  Increased competition in the retail electricity has led to some suppliers reducing their retail prices.  The CER is tasked with retail market monitoring and executes this role vigorously to ensure competition leads to the fairest prices for customers.  </p></reply>

The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband and fibre optic backhaul cables are a matter, in the first instance, for the commercial players who operate in the Irish market.<br/><br/>The Government's intervention under the National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to ensure that every citizen and business, regardless of location, has access to a high quality, high speed broadband service, including Erris and the West of Ireland.  The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades.  Approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland are expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next two years.  These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.<br/><br/>On the 24th November last, a public consultation on a national high speed coverage map 2016 was launched.  This consultation will close on Thursday next, 12th February 2015.  The map can be accessed at .  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas that will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016 and includes Belmullet.  I understand that at least one operator has committed to bringing high speed broadband of 30mbps to 100mbps to Belmullet by mid-2016.  The AMBER areas show the target areas for the State intervention. <br/><br/>In tandem with the mapping consultation, intensive design and planning work is under way in my Department to produce a detailed intervention strategy.  I intend to launch a further public consultation on the detailed intervention strategy in mid-2015.<br/><br/>In relation to the telecommunications duct which was installed adjacent to the Galway Mayo Gas Pipeline, my Department has commenced a procurement process for the appointment of a Management Services Entity to operate the Galway-Mayo Telecommunications Duct. <br/><br/>The question of whether the duct should be extended to Belmullet will be considered in light of the anticipated commercial developments in the area and the proposed State intervention under the National Broadband Plan. <br/><br/>The State's intervention under the National Broadband Plan aims to deliver speeds of at least 30Mbps through a network that will also be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.  This means that every premises in Ireland, including those in Belmullet and surrounding areas, will have access to high speed broadband provided through commercial operators or through the State's intervention strategy. </p></reply>

The draft Plan will undergo Strategic Environmental and Appropriate Assessments, including public consultation, which will inform the content of the finalised Plan.    </p>  <p>  The analysis underpinning the draft Plan is that an additional bioenergy focused measure in the heat sector would represent the most cost effective means of meeting a number of different policy goals.  Therefore, the draft Plan recommends the introduction of a Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) for larger heat users to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources.  There are no plans at this time to introduce such a scheme for domestic heat users.</p>  <p>  However, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) administers the Better Energy Programme on my behalf.  This includes the Better Energy Homes scheme, the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme and the Better Energy Warmer Homes Area based programme, which has subsequently been merged with the Better Communities programme. </p>  <p>  Better Energy Homes provides a financial incentive to private homeowners who wish to improve the energy performance of their homes.  The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to low income households who meet the defined eligibility criteria and who are vulnerable to energy poverty.  The Better Energy Areas scheme, which is free of charge to the customer, delivers energy upgrades to low income homeowners experiencing extreme energy poverty in all housing sectors including Local Authority houses, Housing Association houses and private homes.  The Better Energy Communities programme supports sustainable energy upgrades to existing buildings, services, facilities and processes in the community sector.  Under all of these schemes, high efficiency heating system upgrades are eligible for grant support.  Any query regarding whether or not a particular technology is considered to be high efficiency should be addressed to the SEAI.</p></reply>

In 2006, the CER approved a new network connections policy which enabled assessment of the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.  In order for any town to be connected to the network, certain economic criteria need to be met as a prerequisite.  The policy allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns. <br/><br/>The policy framework provides that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting a town or group of towns to the network are recouped through the actual economic consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.  Uneconomic projects would increase costs for all energy consumers. <br/><br/>Under the connections policy framework, Bord G&aacute;is Networks and more recently Gaslink carried out a comprehensive assessment of towns not already connected to the national gas network.  A &quot;New Towns Analysis Phase 1&quot; report was published in 2006<font color="#1F497D">. </font>The study included a review of the feasibility of connecting towns to the natural gas network in Galway/Mayo and the CER made the decision to allow Gaslink to extend the network to eleven of these towns, including Athenry.  Prior to the roll out of gas to each town, a detailed analysis of the loads within the town and the revenues associated with them is carried out.  There is also a requirement to secure a certain level of customers prior to the development commencing.  The gas network has been extended to eight of these towns.  Work is ongoing to secure economic loads in the three remaining towns, i.e. Athenry, Knock and Balyhaunis, prior to the commencement of construction.  To date, the projected loads are insufficient to justify commencement of construction.<br/><br/>The CER is currently consulting on a submission received by it from the gas transmission system operator Gas Networks Ireland, the successor to Gaslink, on revisions to the existing connections policy as set out above.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority. The grant allocations to local authorities for this year were released on the 3rd February and the details are in the allocations booklet in the D&aacute;il Library.</p>  <p>  As regards roads not taken in charge by local authorities, the maintenance and improvement of these is, in the first instance, a matter for the relevant landowner.  The Local Improvement Scheme for regional and local roads does remain in place and under this Scheme Councils can provide funding for roads and laneways not taken in charge.</p>  <p>  At present, local authorities may use up to 15% of their initial Discretionary Grant towards local improvement schemes should they wish to do so. The local contribution for these schemes is 20% of the total cost of the project.  Furthermore, it is open to local authorities to supplement the percentage of their Discretionary Grant that they can use for the LIS with their own resources.</p>  <p>  Some local authorities want a ring-fenced LIS allocation for private roads while others prefer to put the funding into public roads. I think this decision is best made at a local level.</p></reply>

In light of all the evidence, I am of the view that safety considerations for pedestrians outweigh any benefits from the proposal to allow partial parking on footpaths in any circumstances and I have no plan to change the Traffic and Parking Regulations to allow for this.</p></reply>

There are prescribed procedures and limitations in place governing any reductions in pension rights introduced to address funding difficulties in a scheme such as the IASS.</p>  <p>  The IASS Trustee has confirmed that the proposals that are now being implemented are in the overall best interests of the members of the IASS as a whole.  As you know, this was also the view of the Expert Panel.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the difficulties these necessary changes cause for many scheme members, including pensioners, but the risks that would have arisen for all members, the companies involved and the wider economy if this solution had not been implemented were even greater.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that no formal offer has yet been made by IAG for Aer Lingus. Remuneration matters in Aer Lingus are a matter for the Board of Aer Lingus in the first instance and the Remuneration report is considered at Annual General Meetings of the company.  The Deputy will be aware that the State's shareholding voted against the non-binding resolution on the consideration of the Remuneration Report last year at last year's Annual General meeting at which the 2013 Annual Report and Accounts were considered due to circumstances that were outlined by my predecessor at the time and which are on the record of the House.  While many other shareholders supported the government's position, most did not and the remuneration report was approved.</p></reply>

I announced the 2015 regional and local road grant allocations on 3rd February providing &euro;294 million to local authorities for works on regional and local roads.</p>  <p>  The three main road grant categories are the Restoration Improvement, Discretionary Grant and the Restoration Maintenance grant programmes. All of these grants are allocated based on the length of regional and local roads within a local authority area. In the case of counties/cities that experience higher road traffic than the norm, a factor is applied to the kilometre length within the county or city. In the case of Meath and Kildare a factor of 1.3 is applied, while a factor of 2 is applied to the cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. A factor of 1.0 is applied to the remaining counties which receive funding. The three Dublin councils and Dublin City are no longer funded under these programmes as they have become self-funding under the new Local Property Tax arrangements.</p>  <p>  Details of the 2014 regional and local road grant payments to local authorities are available in the D&aacute;il library.  Details of the 2015 regional and local road grant allocations to each local authority are also available in the D&aacute;il library.</p></reply>

Under Phase 1, it was proposed to make available online the genealogical records of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and of key agencies within its ambit, namely, the National Library of Ireland and the National Archives of Ireland, by developing the website as a virtual entry point and a portal for those wishing to search for genealogical records.<br/><br/>Under Phase 2, it was proposed, among other things, to advance agreement with other State entities, notably the General Register Office, to facilitate access to its primary historic records, which are register entries of births, deaths and marriages, through the website.<br/><br/>Under Phase 3, it was proposed to enter into negotiations with non-State bodies holding genealogy records, with a view to enabling access to them through the website.<br/><br/>To date, my Department has concentrated its resources on implementing Phases 1 and 2 of the national policy.<br/><br/>The website has been developed as a virtual entry point and a portal for those wishing to search for Irish genealogical records. This includes the following record sets, which are provided on an all-island basis:<br/><br/>- The 1901 and 1911 census records and partial census returns for parts of the 19<sup>th</sup>century;<br/><br/>- The tithe applotment records from 1823 to 1837;<br/><br/>- The Griffiths valuations published between 1847 and 1864; and <br/><br/>- A number of other smaller sets of records. <br/><br/>There are also plans to provide on-line access on this site to the indexes and registered images of civil records, covering all of the island of Ireland for the pre-1922 period.<br/><br/>The site also has a useful links page to allow visitors access to all of the main record repository websites on the island of Ireland. This includes the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland and the General Register Office, Northern Ireland. The site has proved very popular since the upgrades which began in 2009 and has facilitated research on an all-island basis.<br/><br/>While there are no plans at present to formally implement an all-island approach to facilitating genealogical research and heritage, my Department remains open to examining further ways of advancing such matters, within the available resources.</p></reply>

The National Archives can also acquire archives from other sources, such as business, hospitals, charities and voluntary bodies, where it is considered that the archives are of outstanding quality and value. This can, on occasion, entail the rescue of archives that are in danger of destruction.  I am advised that the National Archives has a historic backlog of approximately 70,000 boxes of archives, which need archival and preservation processing to varying degrees.  These archives are non-statutory records and are held in safe and secure conditions but, in light of the pressure on resources, progress on cataloguing this historic backlog is likely to be slow.</p>  <p>  I would like to make it clear that the National Archives annual intake of statutory records, amounting to some 5,000 boxes per annum, does not generate any backlog in cataloguing work and is catalogued within existing resources each year.</p>  <p>  I am pleased that, after a number of years of funding reductions, I was in a position this year to increase the National Archives budget and, in addition, that sanction has been given to run a competition for additional archivists for the National Archives. I understand that these increased resources will be used, inter alia, to address the archiving backlog.</p>  <p>  I am also very conscious that the storage capacity of the National Archives needs to be improved and, to that end, as part of its capital stimulus package, the Government  agreed to provide funding this year for phase one of a development plan at the Archives headquarters in Bishop Street.  The OPW will shortly go to tender for the project and it is anticipated that works could begin by mid-2015.  This will greatly increase the storage capacity of the National Archives.</p></reply>

There are over 14,000 registered boat owners on the seven waterways managed by Waterways Ireland. These seven waterways make a vital contribution to tourism, attracting visitors from around Ireland and from abroad.<br/><br/>The proposed new bye-laws are intended to enhance the ability of Waterways Ireland to manage the Royal and Grand Canals and the Barrow Navigation for the benefit of all canal users. Investment by Waterways Ireland in these waterways has made them more attractive for boat owners and is helping to develop them as a vibrant recreational and tourist amenity for all waterway users. In this context, it is now necessary to update the bye-laws to ensure that the rules governing use of the waterways are fit for purpose and best meet the needs of all waterway users.<br/><br/>I am aware that concerns have been raised regarding certain aspects of the proposed bye-laws. Waterways Ireland undertook a public consultation process in relation to the proposed bye-laws in 2014. I am advised that the main stakeholders, including the Inland Waterway Association of Ireland, the Heritage Boat Association, the Royal Canal Amenity Group and the Irish Boat Rental Association, were contacted individually and invited to meet with the Chief Executive and the senior management team of Waterways Ireland prior to submitting their views. The current permit holders on the three waterways, including traditional canal users and canal dwellers, received individual written notices and were given the opportunity to make their views known. <br/><br/>I understand that over 2,000 submissions were made in the course of the public consultation process and that Waterways Ireland has concluded its analysis of the submissions received. A summary of the consultation process and of the submissions received is available on the Waterways Ireland website at .<br/><br/>My officials are currently liaising with Waterways Ireland with a view to finalising draft bye-laws which will be referred to me, as Minister, with recommendations for consideration and final decision. It is my intention to afford interested Deputies and Senators an opportunity to discuss the proposals with me prior to making a final decision on the draft bye-laws.</p></reply>

These Directives aim to ensure the protection of habitats and species which have been selected for conservation within special areas of conservation and special protection areas.  The Directives has been transposed into national law under the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 and the Wildlife Acts.   In advance of the designation of a site, my Department writes to all identified land owners with a legal interest in the site, outlining the intention to designate the site, the appeals process and how to get further information.   Public notices in relation to the proposed designation are also placed in local media. </p>  <p>  Landowners may object to the proposed designation of a site as a special area of conservation or special protection area. Following the completion of a Departmental review of an objection to the proposed designation, landowners may opt to take their cases to the Designated Areas Appeals Advisory Board, an independently chaired Board which makes recommendations to me, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, on such cases. The appeals process includes an oral hearing.</p>  <p>  The Board heard 17 appeals over the 2013-2014 period. In each case the recommendation of the Board was accepted.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that the nomination of a site for designation as a special area of conservation or special protection area may have an impact, for example, on the manner in which certain lands may be farmed. The designation of lands does not mean that the lands are subject to blanket restrictions. However, they must be managed appropriately. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the relevant legislation, certain activities in protected sites may only be undertaken with my consent. Compensation may be payable where a person has been refused consent by me for a prescribed activity within a designated site that he or she had been undertaking in the five year period prior to the refusal. However, compensation schemes have generally been put in place, where required, without the need to undergo a formal process under the relevant legislation.</p>  <p>While my Department has the lead role in relation to the implementation of the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive, significant funding is provided through the rural development programme, operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. This programme provides for a range of supports for farmers, including payments in respect of sites nominated for designation or designated in accordance with the Directives. I understand that i  n future, EU financial supports for agri-environmental actions by farmers in special areas of conservation and special protection areas will be made through the green, low carbon agri-environment scheme (GLAS), to be operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></reply>

The <i>Ireland 2016</i>Programme to mark the hundredth anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising is a major priority for me.  This programme is underpinned by a &euro;4 million current budget in 2015, which will support a wide range of activities across the arts, cultural and educational sectors. In particular, I have been working closely with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Ms Jan O'Sullivan, T.D., on the development of the formal education sector input into the Decade of Centenaries commemorations.  As part of this overall programme, the Department of Education and Skills is planning a number of specific events to mark the centenary of 2016 across primary, post-primary and third level sectors.<br/><br/>It is very important to me that the arts are made more accessible. Immersing school students in the arts through a targeted strategy will benefit future generations and give young people a greater understanding and appreciation of the arts as they progress to adulthood.  I have met my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, on a number of occasions to discuss the Arts in Education Charter.  The Arts in Education Implementation Group has been proactive in meeting many organisations from both the arts and education sectors and progressing a number of initiatives. Of particular interest is the current development of a portal, which will form a key communications and information channel for both the education and arts sectors. <br/><br/>The National Cultural Institutions include a diverse range of cultural institutions and agencies, which are involved in a wide number of initiatives with a view to engaging with a wide range of stakeholders, including schools, both primary and post-primary.Each of these cultural institutions has a range of education initiatives, including exhibitions, events and school outreach programmes, through which  schools can explore and engage in our rich cultural heritage.<br/><br/>Another important priority for me is to deliver Ireland's first national cultural policy. Last June, the Government agreed to the drafting of a national cultural policy - <i>Culture 2025</i>&ndash; which will set out high-level policy for the period up to 2025.

It can include those engaged in the arts practice within specific artistic genres and can encompass areas that flow from such artistic pursuits.  It may also embody the industrial creative sectors, including audiovisual production.The Government appreciates the importance of the arts, culture and the creative industries to our society and economy.  Within the current economic constraints, investment in the arts, culture and creative sectors is more important than ever, having regard to the employment intensity of the sector.<br/><br/>The arts sector continues to offer vital opportunities for the provision of important cultural, social and employment benefits to communities throughout the country.  Primary responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is devolved to the Arts Council. The Council is funded by my Department and is statutorily independent in its day-to-day operations, including its funding decisions.  Details of all funding provided by the Arts Council to arts practitioners, groups and venues, including arts centres, are available on its website at <br/><br/>Funding for the protection of heritage sites and buildings will continue to be provided by my Department in 2015 via a number of schemes, which will be either directly administered or delivered through local authorities or through the Heritage Council.This week I announced an allocation of &euro;624,000 for the <i>Structures at Risk Fund 2015, </i>to enable conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration and which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000&ndash;2012. In 2014, my Department awarded &euro;5 million to conservation works to 540 heritage structures through the <i>Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme</i>, which directly generated 175 full-time equivalent jobs across the country in the niche conservation sector of the construction industry and in associated areas.I also understand that the heritage grants programmes of the Heritage Council, which my Department funds, generated 19 full-time equivalent jobs in 2014, predominantly in rural Ireland, from a spend of &euro;695,000.  Capital investment in built heritage conservation also assists in developing and maintaining specialised skills among conservation professionals and craftspeople.<br/><br/>Research has shown that investment in heritage also generates significant indirect employment.  The research report <b><i>Economic Value of Ireland&rsquo;s Historic Environment</i></b>, commissioned by the Heritage Council and published in 2012, established that Ireland&rsquo;s historic environment supports over 35,000 jobs.</p></reply>

A total of 235 annual payments, 146 turf deliveries and 20 once-off incentive payments have been made in respect of the applications received from Mouds Bog and 86 annual payments, 18 turf deliveries and 9 once-off incentive payments have been made in respect of the applications received from Ballynafagh Bog. 66 applicants from Mouds Bog and 25 applicants from Ballynafagh Bog have expressed an interest in relocation to a non-designated bog.Progress has been made with a view to the relocation of 9 qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog to Timahoe North, County Kildare, which is in the ownership of Bord na M&oacute;na. While the site had been available for turf cutting during the 2014 season, turf cutters had not agreed with my Department to cut turf there.<br/><br/>Lattins Bog, also known as Mouds North Bog, in County Kildare, has been assessed as a suitable relocation site for turf cutters from Mouds Bog. My Department had sought expressions of interest from qualifying applicants under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme with a view to relocation to this site. However, the level of interest received in relocation to this site has been muted to date.<br/><br/>The <i>Review of Raised Bog Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs),</i>which is available to download from my Department&rsquo;s website at <b><i><font color="#0082BF"></font></i></b>, provides details on future arrangements regarding turf cutting on each of the 75 raised bog natural heritage areas.<br/><br/>Carbury Bog natural heritage area in County Kildare is one of the natural heritage areas which are to be conserved. In the case of this bog, the review envisages the cessation of turf cutting on the site by 1 January 2017 to preserve its conservation value. Turf cutting may continue on the bog until that date, on plots that have been cut in the five year period prior to the Government decision of 14 January 2014 on the NHA review.<br/><br/>To ensure that cutting does not intensify prior to 1 January 2017, owners of plots or of turbary rights who have cut over the relevant 5 year period must obtain a permit to cut from my Department. Contractors are also obliged to obtain permits.  <br/><br/>The cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme has been extended to land owners and turbary right holders affected by the restrictions on turf cutting in raised bog natural heritage areas. No applications for compensation have been received, to date, in respect of Carbury Bog. <br/><br/>The NHA review also envisages the complete or partial de-designation of 46 existing natural heritage areas where turf cutting may continue into the future. In these de-designation cases, it is not necessary for individuals to seek consent to cut turf. Hodgestown Bog natural heritage area in County Kildare is one of those de-designation cases.</p></reply>
