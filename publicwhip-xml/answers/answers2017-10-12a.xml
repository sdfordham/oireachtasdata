    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-12a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101200040#WRA00700"><p>The Government is committed to regional development and my Department and its agencies are working towards ambitious targets to ensure that employment and investment are as fairly distributed as possible across the country, including in Tipperary.  While more work remains to be done in the County, it has made steady progress in job creation terms, with unemployment having decreased by 28% since 2011.  At the end of last year total State agency supported employment in Tipperary stood at 10,157.</p>  <p>  A key tool for supporting job creation and fostering enterprise in Tipperary is the Regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative.  This was launched in January 2015 and remains a central pillar of the Government&rsquo;s work to create 135,000 new jobs outside of Dublin by 2020. Tipperary is covered by both the South East and Mid West Action Plans, with core objectives of both being an increase of 10-15% in the numbers employed by 2020 and the reduction of unemployment to within one percentage point of the State average.  </p>  <p>  The two regions in which Tipperary is situated have both made significant economic strides forward.  The South East has seen good growth in employment over the last five years, with an additional 33,600 in employment in Q2 2017 compared to Q1 2012. The Mid West has also performed strongly and was the third fastest growing region in the country in employment terms from Q2 2016 to Q2 2017.</p>  <p>  The implementation of the two Action Plans for Tipperary involves a wide range of stakeholders, both local and national.  This includes representatives from the Local Authorities, the enterprise agencies and other key public and private sector stakeholders in Tipperary.  All have been strongly involved in, and remain key drivers of, both the South East and the Mid West Action Plans for Jobs. </p>  <p>  With regard to the IDA, its strategy for 2015-2019 is aligned to our regional development goals and includes a commitment to increase foreign direct investment in every region outside Dublin by 30% to 40% by 2019. I am pleased that the Agency&rsquo;s 2016 results show that progress is being made towards that end, with 52% of all jobs created by the Agency&rsquo;s clients last year based outside of Dublin. </p>  <p>  The IDA remains focused on attracting further FDI to Tipperary.  The Agency markets the northern and southern halves of the County respectively as parts of its national Mid-West and South East regions.  There are a total of 12 IDA client companies currently situated across the County, collectively employing 3,368 people. Given the County&rsquo;s significant manufacturing base, and its particular profile as a home to medical devices companies, the IDA strongly promotes Tipperary as an excellent location for new FDI from that wider sector. </p>  <p>  The FDI base is complemented by a strong indigenous sector in both North and South Tipperary. Enterprise Ireland has 120 clients across the County and works closely with them &ndash; including from the Agency&rsquo;s office in Shannon &ndash; to drive export growth and job creation. Enterprise Ireland has also invested significantly in companies situated there, with businesses receiving grants totalling &euro;11.74 million from 2014-2016. Enterprise Ireland has funded as well five Community Enterprise Centres which provide important enterprise hubs in the county.</p>  <p>  At local level, the Tipperary Local Enterprise Office successfully secured funding for five projects funded under Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Competitive Fund for LEOs. Additionally, a project from within the county was awarded funding to assess the viability of establishing a Food Centre of Excellence for Tipperary under Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Community Enterprise Initiative Scheme 2016.</p>  <p>  While we remain determined to achieve further progress in Tipperary, the overall enterprise trend in the area is one of steady improvement. My Department and its Agencies will continue to do their utmost to ensure that the highest level of investment and job creation possible is secured for County Tipperary in the time ahead. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-12a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101200040#WRA01100"><p>I recognise that the impact of Brexit is one of the most immediate concerns facing the retail sector.</p>  <p>  As a result, my Department has ensured that Retail representatives have been included in all relevant stakeholder engagements on Brexit, including the Enterprise Forum on Brexit and Global Challenges. </p>  <p>  Brexit has also become a standing item on the agenda at meetings of the Retail Consultation Forum, which was set up in 2014 to provide a platform for engagement between the sector and Government.</p>  <p>  Membership of this Forum includes retail associations such as RGDATA, Retail Ireland, Retail Excellence, other bodies such as ISME, SFA and Chambers Ireland, a number of retailers, the City and County Managers Association, and relevant Government Departments.</p>  <p>  The Forum meets 3-4 times per year, with working groups meeting more often to progress the work programme. The current work programme is driven by the key concerns of the Forum members, which include developing skills in the sector, reducing business costs, town centre renewal, and the impacts of Brexit.</p>  <p>  The Forum will meet next on the 20th of November. At each of the last four meetings, since the announcement of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the European Union, Forum members have been briefed on the Government&rsquo;s approach to Brexit and work undertaken to date, and have had the opportunity to voice their concerns. </p>  <p>  At its last meeting on 12th June, the Forum discussed the progress of its working groups on Retail Skills, Town Centre Renewal, and Reducing Energy Costs. Members were also briefed on research being undertaken by my Department into the firm-level impacts of Brexit in Ireland&rsquo;s most exposed enterprise sectors, which will be completed by year end. This research is looking at the impact of the UK being outside of the European Single Market and Customs Union on firms, the associated implications for investment, and how this informs our approach to negotiations. A pilot of this research was undertaken from January to March in three sectors: wholesale/retail, food/drink, and computer consultancy.</p>  <p>  Participants in the pilot identified the following areas as being the top three areas of particular concern post-Brexit to the Wholesale / Retail Sector: tariffs and rules of origin, physical border and free movement of labour.</p>  <p>  Announcements made in Budget 2018 in addition to a number of initiatives developed by the Retail Consultation Forum, my Department and other Government Departments will strengthen the capability, competitiveness, and resilience of the retail sector to meet the challenges resulting from Brexit.</p>  <p>  For example, my Department has secured Budget funding for a new Brexit Loan Scheme which will provide affordable financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or will be in the future. The new Scheme will be delivered by the Strategic Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) through commercial lenders to get much needed working capital into Irish businesses.</p>  <p>  The new Brexit Loan Scheme aims to make up to &euro;300 million available to businesses with up to 499 employees at a proposed interest rate of 4%. Retail businesses that are adversely affected by or will be affected by Brexit are eligible under this scheme as long as they submit a business sustainability plan which demonstrates how they plan to adapt, innovate or change in response to Brexit. I expect this scheme to be up and running by March 2018.</p>  <p>  The retail sector will also benefit from the increase in disposable income through taxation and social welfare measures. Another welcome announcement for the retail sector, among others, is the retention of the 9% VAT rate for the tourism and hospitality sector. I am keenly aware that this has knock-on benefits to retailers, in particular in the regions. </p>  <p>  Through the Retail Consultation Forum we are also focusing on building online capability. Through initiatives like the Trading Online Voucher scheme and work being done by the Retail and Skills Working Group, retailers will be supported in addressing digital skills gaps and moving into online trading. In line with this, under the Action Plan for Jobs, my Department is exploring the development of a pilot programme to support retailers to scale up their domestic and international online trading activity.</p>  <p>  We are providing stakeholders with the tools to address the demise of the high street through &ldquo;A Framework for Town Centre Renewal&rdquo;, launched in April this year.</p>  <p>  We are also assisting retailers to improve competitiveness by reducing their energy costs, through a pilot efficiency programme delivered through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. </p>  <p>  Retailers also have access to supports such as the Enterprise Ireland Brexit SME Scorecard to assist with planning and preparation for Brexit; the business advice, training and capability building services provided by the LEOs and to Intertrade Ireland &ldquo;Brexit readiness workshops&rdquo; that are held around the country.  </p>  <p>  I also recognise that retailers are concerned about the impact of sterling fluctuations on Irish consumer sentiment; however the volume of retail sales is growing at a faster rate than the value of sales growth, which demonstrates that there continues to be heavy discounting by retailers and promotional activities to drive footfall and sales.</p>  <p>  Engagement with the sector will continue through the Retail Consultation Forum, bilateral engagements with sector representatives, and Brexit-focused stakeholder engagement. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-12a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1272" speakername="Pat Breen" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101200040#WRA01400"><p>In response to parliamentary questions asked by the deputy on 28 June 2017, I passed the information provided by the deputy at that time to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) for further investigation.  The Inspection and Enforcement Services of the WRC monitor employment conditions to ensure compliance with and, where necessary, the enforcement of employment rights legislation in Ireland. This includes redress for the employees concerned and payment of any unpaid wages arising from breaches of employment rights. </p>  <p>  The deputy&rsquo;s concern arose from reports that seafarers working within Irish waters were being paid below the minimum wage.  The names of three specific companies were provided and I undertook to have this information investigated further through the offices of the WRC.  </p>  <p>  At my request, the WRC has carried out further enquiries into the issue raised by the deputy in relation to the three companies identified.   The Mercantile Marine Office under the aegis of the Department of Transport Tourism &amp;amp; Sport maintains a general Register of Shipping in Ireland.  This indicates that none of the companies identified have ships that are registered in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  As the vessels operated by these companies are not Irish flagged ships, the corpus of Irish employment legislation does not apply to them and therefore, the companies are not subject to inspection by the WRC. Conversely, Irish flagged vessels operating abroad are subject to Irish employment rights legislation, including payment of the National Minimum Wage.</p>  <p>  I should point out to the deputy that primary responsibility for maritime policy and legislation underpinning that policy resides with my colleague Mr. Shane Ross, TD, Minister for Transport and Sport.  I understand that, as a general rule the flag state (i.e. the state where the ship is registered) has the exclusive right to exercise jurisdiction over its ships on the high seas. In accordance with international maritime law and practice, enforcement of terms and conditions of employment are a matter for the flag State. </p>  <p>  I understand also that non-Irish flagged vessels may be subject to port state control inspections by the Marine Survey Office for compliance in relation to relevant international conventions when they are in a port in the State. This includes the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) Maritime Labour Convention. However, this does not include issues in relation to wages which are a matter for the relevant flag state to enforce. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-12a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101200040#WRA01700"><p>Enterprise 2025 sets a roadmap for long-term enterprise development and resilience, with the ambition to achieve a step-change in the performance of our enterprises, to build a real and distinctive competitive edge sector-by-sector and to excel in creating a jobs-fit environment with top-3 competitiveness ranking. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2017, which I lead across Government, sets ambitious targets and actions to be delivered as part of Enterprise 2025. </p>  <p>  The Review of Enterprise 2025 aims to ensure that our policy framework and priorities are robust and remain current in the uncertain environment. This review is being undertaken in the context of global changes that are likely to have an immediate impact on Ireland's enterprise development, and specifically Brexit and potential policy changes under the new US administration. </p>  <p>  In addition the advances in digital technologies continue apace, opening up new market opportunities, spawning new global business models and impacting on every sector of the economy. Such advances can also pose challenges for companies in adopting technologies, whether in the factory or the customer experience centre, and reinforce the need for continuous skills development for those already in the workplace. While we are well placed to respond to these new developments and capture new opportunities, I am conscious that we need to work through, sector  by sector, the necessary responses whether that is at firm level, or through investment in our innovation system or education system and that we have effective collaboration between the key stakeholders. </p>  <p>  A senior-level Principal Officer forum has been established that includes representatives from a number of key economic government departments and the development agencies. Analysis of performance to date on the targets set shows good performance against the 30 metrics set out in Enterprise 2025 and solid progress on implementation of 56 strategic actions. A more comprehensive review of enterprise performance over the past decade, and since the publication of Enterprise 2025 has recently been completed. Informed by this evidence base, we will engage with industry and other stakeholders to debate the extent to which our priorities remain robust or need a greater emphasis in today's environment. </p>  <p>  While there is a need to have a change in emphasis in the context of the highly uncertain external environment, we are continuing to focus on getting the fundamentals of our enterprise policy right as the Government has demonstrated in the Budget 2018 announced on Tuesday this week - including our continued focus on export-led growth, underpinned by investments in innovation and skills to respond to a changing world and our continuing focus on enhancing competitiveness and productivity. We are well placed to take advantage of technological advances, have invested significantly in world class research centres and benefit from having a strong base of both international and Irish technology-rich enterprises.</p>  <p>  In today's  particularly challenging times, I know that the potential set out in Enterprise 2025 and in the Programme for a Partnership Government for employment, exports, productivity and growth is  ambitious. Notwithstanding that uncertain environment we are engaging continuously with enterprise stakeholders and we are taking mitigating action - not only in my Department and enterprise development agencies, but also across Government - so that we can achieve the ambition to create jobs for our people and a higher standard of living for all.</p>  <p>  I and my agencies remain focused very clearly on the stretch targets set out in Enterprise 2025, which include reducing unemployment in each region to within one percent of the State average by 2020; achieving export growth in Irish-owned enterprises of 6-8 percent per annum; an increase in the number of startups by 25 percent per annum &ndash; startups with better survival rates &ndash; this would see us with 15,700 enterprise births a year; a 30 percent increase in the numbers of exporters of scale; an additional 1,080 inward investment projects; a 60 percent increase in EI enterprises spending more than &euro;1m on R&amp;D and winning &euro;3.6bn in R&amp;D related FDI; and, a 25 percent uplift in direct economic expenditures by agency supported companies. </p>  <p>  My objective remains to complete this Review by the end of the year - and this review will be complemented by the Action Plan for Jobs 2018.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-12a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101200040#WRA02000"><p>The &ldquo;Winning Abroad&rdquo; Programme was launched by IDA Ireland in 2014.  It provided for the engagement of up to 35 additional personnel by the Agency to deliver new jobs for people in Ireland.  Its other key objectives included targeting new forms of foreign direct investment and broadening the geographic base from which the Agency seeks and secures overseas investment. </p>  <p>  Since its inception, IDA Ireland has spent &euro;11.1m on the Winning Abroad Programme.  This comprised an outlay of &euro;437,000 in 2014; &euro;3.86 million in 2015; &euro;3.86 million again in 2016; and &euro;2.93 million in 2017. </p>  <p>  The initiative has had a very positive impact in terms of job creation since its implementation, with a total of 3242 jobs having already been created.  Moreover, the IDA expects the Winning Abroad Programme to have helped create 14,000 new jobs over the wider period between 2014-2019. This is considerably ahead of the target of 10,000 jobs that was originally set by the Agency for this initiative. </p>  <p>  Another positive feature of Winning Abroad is that the jobs that are being created by the Programme are spread across a range of sectors.  This includes areas such as life sciences, technology, digital media services, and financial services. To date team members hired under the Winning Abroad Programme have contributed strongly to the Agency&rsquo;s overall results in these sectors, winning 140 investments in total.</p>  <p>  The excellent value for money represented by the Winning Abroad Programme is not just measured in jobs created or investments won. Projects associated with the Programme have also made a significant overall contribution to the Irish economy, with those secured to date contributing &euro;160 million in payroll, &euro;61.7 million of which has been returned to the Exchequer through taxes. These figures are expected to increase even further over the time ahead. </p>  <p>  In light of the excellent performance - and the value for money delivered - by the Winning Abroad initiative, it was decided earlier this year to place it on a permanent footing through the regularisation of its 35 posts within IDA Ireland. This will ensure that our economy continues to benefit from the increased stream of investment and job creation that the programme has helped bring to Ireland. It will also help provide the Agency with human resources it requires in the time ahead to seek and secure new investment opportunities abroad and to address the challenges and opportunities associated with Brexit. </p>  <p>  The IDA is now better equipped in staffing terms than ever before. The Winning Abroad Programme has boosted the IDA&rsquo;s permanent headcount by over 12%. This was in addition to the 10 additional Brexit posts that were sanctioned for the IDA as part of last year's budget. I am pleased that an additional &euro;700,000 in funding via Budget 2018 is now being provided so that the Agency can engage 10 more personnel to respond to the challenges and opportunities associated with Brexit.

Membership of leading International Research Organisations is an important mechanism for facilitating this engagement.  For this reason, the Government gave a commitment in Innovation 2020 to explore Ireland's membership options with CERN and also the European Southern Observatory (ESO).  </p>  <p>  I am pleased that I have secured a capital allocation in Budget 2018 specifically to ensure Ireland's membership of ESO during 2018.  This will cost &euro;0.75 million in 2018 and increase to about &euro;3 million in 2019.  </p>  <p>  This decision to proceed to join ESO first reflects an assessment of the costs and benefits of each membership.  ESO has been prioritised over CERN because of the large, established community of astronomy researchers in Ireland. Astronomy is an active area of research in each of our universities and several of our institutes of technology. </p>  <p>  This community is well positioned to avail of the opportunities provided by ESO membership, thereby maximising the immediate benefit to Ireland. </p>  <p>  These opportunities include participation in pioneering frontier research, access to cutting-edge technology, commercial opportunities for enterprise, the creation of human capital and skills and the further promotion of STEM subjects in Ireland.</p>  <p>  In addition, the companies in Ireland that have had great success in securing contracts from the European Space Agency are well placed to bid for ESO contracts due to the overlap between the technologies used by ESO and ESA.  </p>  <p>  Joining ESO in 2018 will result in significant savings to the Exchequer (in excess of &euro;3 million) because ESO has agreed that if we join in 2018, it will calculate the once-off joining fee using our 2014 GDP, thereby excluding the impact of the 26% increase in GDP in 2015.  </p>  <p>  In parallel with this consideration of ESO membership, my department has also been assessing the case for membership of CERN.</p>  <p>  CERN is a leading global scientific collaboration investigating the fundamental composition of matter. It was established in 1952 and currently has 21 member states and co-operation agreements with approximately 40 other states.</p>  <p>  Regrettably, in view of the intense demands on the capital programme and the tight fiscal constraints it will not be possible to progress membership of both CERN and the European Southern Observatory in 2018. </p>  <p>  I fully recognise the value of membership of International Research Organisations (IROs) and my department has an on-going objective to increase Ireland's participation in IROs. For example, in 2016 my department funded Ireland's membership of ELIXIR, the life sciences data infrastructure and in 2017 my department funded Ireland's membership of the International LOFAR Radio Telescope.</p>  <p>  We will keep the issue of CERN membership under review and it is my hope that we will be in a position to progress CERN membership in the future, when the fiscal situation permits.</p></reply>

The designated official, at Assistant Secretary level, is supported by a staff compliment of five (one Principal Officer, two Assistant Principals, one Higher Executive Officer and one Clerical Officer).  An additional staffing resource is currently being sought to support the Brexit Unit and it is hoped that an assignment will be made in the coming weeks.</p><p>The work of very many Business Units within my Department and our Agencies are impacted by Brexit. We are prioritising the Brexit challenges and will actively keep the staffing requirements under review through workforce planning. </p><p>Recently, a further additional &euro;3 million in respect of Pay has been secured for my Department in Budget 2018, for the purposes of recruiting additional staff resources to further respond to Brexit and help meet the Government plans to double Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint.</p></reply>

There are now 13,000 more people in work in the region since the launch of the Regional Action Plan initiative in Q1 2015. Moreover, the unemployment rate in the South East region has fallen from 12.8% in Q1 2015 to 8.1% in Q2 of this year.</p>  <p>  While external shocks, such as Brexit, may impact on regional job delivery in the future, the Regional Action Plans are flexible and dynamic and can be adapted to address Brexit challenges and opportunities arising within the regions.</p>  <p>  In addition, all the enterprise development agencies have Brexit plans. Enterprise Ireland, for example, has undertaken the following actions to assist companies around the country navigate Brexit related challenges: </p>  <p>- Launched a &lsquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rsquo;, a new interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars where they have not already done so. </p>  <p>- Launched a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; that supports the costs of SME clients in preparing a plan to mitigate risks and optimise opportunities arising from Brexit.</p>  <p>- Launched a new Eurozone Strategy to assist Irish exporters increase exports to Eurozone countries by 50% by 2020.</p>  <p>- These strategies are supported by strategic communications campaigns, namely &ldquo;Global Ambition&rdquo;, &ldquo;PrepareforBrexit&rdquo; and a new &ldquo;Irish Advantage&rdquo; campaign which will target Eurozone buyers to promote Irish innovation in key Brexit impacted sectors.</p>  <p>- Ran a national Brexit roadshow, including events in the Border Region. Additional national Brexit roadshow will happen over the course of the coming months. </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are providing: Brexit specific information sessions for both core and non-core clients in all counties; an online Brexit SME Scorecard that LEO clients can complete to self-assess their readiness for Brexit; and a Lean4Micro programme, which was designed to encourage clients to adopt Lean business principles in their organisation to increase performance and competitiveness, particularly in relation to being Brexit-ready. In addition, the LEOs are now offering a new funding programme to assist micro-enterprises affected by Brexit by helping clients find new markets and exports. </p>  <p>  The implications of the Brexit vote and the challenges and opportunities that the decision poses for all Irish Regions, including the South East region, continue to be considered by all Regional Action Plan for Jobs Implementation Committees.</p></reply>

In 2016, Enterprise Ireland supported clients reported exports of &euro;21.6 billion, 49 per cent of this was from the Food Sector.  Of the 201,108 people employed in Enterprise Ireland supported companies, just over 58,000 were from the Food sector (28.8%). Food sector clients represented 19% (just over 3,700) of the total jobs created in Enterprise Ireland companies in 2016 (19,244). </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s investment in research and innovation has been instrumental in strengthening indigenous enterprise, in securing, diversifying and growing foreign direct investment, in licensing new technologies, in establishing new companies, and in providing the highly educated workforce needed to grow the economy and contribute to society. Innovation is, and will continue to be, one of Ireland&rsquo;s key differentiators.  </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s trade events are key supports for companies with global ambition and market diversification strategies. The agency&rsquo;s programme of trade missions, trade fairs and knowledge events give clients the opportunity to connect with existing and new customers, access key decision makers, increase sales in international markets and exchange ideas. This is increasingly important in the light of Brexit and other global challenges.</p>  <p>  In September of this year, Minister for Trade, Employment and Business, Pat Breen TD, led Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s delegation to SPACE, the largest animal production show in France.  This trade visit focused on promoting the innovative capabilities of Irish agri-tech companies in areas including connected agriculture, the use of data in agriculture and progress in the area of automation and robotics.  At this event Irish agri-tech companies showcased their innovations to over 100,000 attendees from 120 countries. </p>  <p>  The trade visit also maximised business opportunities for Enterprise Ireland client companies to pitch their products to an audience of farmers, influencers and potential buyers in the specially convened &lsquo;Enterprise Ireland Innovation Area&rsquo;, the programme for which included;  </p>  <p>  * Pitches from seven Enterprise Ireland agri-tech clients to potential customers,  </p>  <p>  * A Technology in Agriculture panel which was addressed by Minister Breen followed by a short talk by Kieran Furlong, Finistere of the Agri tech landscape both in France and Ireland and the challenges and opportunities for the Agri tech sector in France presented by Jean-Baptiste Cuisinier, Pr&eacute;sident/CEO of CapAgro, France. </p>  <p>  * A networking area where Enterprise Ireland facilitated introductions between Irish client companies and French agri-tech decision-makers as well as potential partners and distributors in France </p>  <p>  * Business to business meetings between potential distributors and partners coordinated by the Enterprise Europe Network. </p>  <p>  With regards to animal welfare, it is stated in all contracts between EI and client companies that the client must be compliant with all relevant national legislation. Enterprise Ireland itself is not responsible for such legislation &ndash; that falls under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I am aware that their Competitive Research Programme has provided over &euro;3.6 million in funding to seven ongoing or recently completed projects that include in the scope of their work ideas surrounding the adoption of technology-based tools in order to address animal welfare challenges. Any further questions on this would be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Michael Creed, T.D..</p></reply>

That is particularly true of Government Departments and public service bodies in all countries, given the impact of their activities on the lives of their citizens. </p>  <p>  Communication to the public is an essential service: people should know what their government is doing on their behalf, and why.  That is why communications should be treated as a strategic, whole-of-government activity which should be conducted with the same level of professionalism as any other core service, such as human resource management or financial management. </p>  <p>  As you will be aware, the Cabinet recently agreed that a new Strategic Communications Unit is to be established in the Department of the Taoiseach.  Based on international best practice, and with the citizen at the centre of its work, the focus of this Unit will be to simplify Government communications and to increase efficiencies across the public sector when dealing with the Irish public. </p>  <p>  The Unit aims to help achieve that in three ways: by streamlining communications for citizens; by developing and delivering major cross-Government communication campaigns; and improving communications capacity across Government. </p>  <p>  As these work streams have a whole-of-government approach, the strategic communications unit will be consulting, and working closely, with all Departments, including my Department of Business Enterprise and Innovation, in the delivery of these aims. </p>  <p>  The unit is currently staffed by serving public and civil servants, who have either been assigned on secondment or have been reallocated to the unit from within the Department of the Taoiseach and a State Agency. </p>  <p>  It is likely that further vacancies will be filled through advertisement for staff on secondment from within the Public Service, as appropriate.</p></reply>

Our focus remains on taking steps to mitigate the potentially adverse consequences Brexit may have for our economy whilst also ensuring that Ireland is well-placed to capitalise on the opportunities that might emerge. </p>  <p>  Since the Brexit vote outcome, my Department has had extensive engagement with business to understand what they need to help them adapt to the challenges posed by Brexit, and to provide support for diversification, development and innovation. Informed by this engagement my Department has been working with the Department of Finance, Enterprise Ireland (EI), Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and Department of Agriculture to develop potential supports to respond to the needs of businesses impacted by Brexit. </p>  <p>  In Tuesday&rsquo;s Budget, a new Brexit Loan Scheme was announced which will provide affordable working capital financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit, or will be in the future. The new Scheme will be delivered by the SBCI through commercial lenders to get much needed working capital into Irish businesses. </p>  <p>  The new Brexit Loan Scheme aims to make up to &euro;300 million available SMEs and Small Mid-Caps. The scheme will be open both to State Agency clients and those businesses that do not have any relationship with State Agencies. My Department is also exploring the development of a longer-term Business Development Loan Scheme which would assist firms in long term investing for a post-Brexit environment.</p>  <p>  EI&rsquo;s current &ldquo;#Prepare for Brexit&rdquo; campaign includes a Brexit Scorecard available to all companies to self-assess their preparedness for Brexit across all aspects of their business and which generates a report suggesting appropriate responses.  They are running a series of Brexit roadshow events featuring expert speakers throughout the country to promote the Brexit Scorecard and encourage companies to prepare for Brexit. A &euro;5,000 &lsquo;BePrepared&rsquo; grant is also available to clients to prepare a Brexit action plan.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are providing Brexit specific information sessions for both core and non-core clients in all counties, an online Brexit SME Scorecard that LEO clients can complete to self-assess their readiness for Brexit, and a Lean4Micro programme, which was designed to encourage clients to adopt Lean business principles in their organisation to increase performance and competitiveness, particularly in relation to being Brexit-ready. In addition, the LEOs are now offering a new funding programme to assist micro-enterprises affected by Brexit by helping clients find new markets and exports. </p>  <p>  InterTrade Ireland (ITI), given its experience in promoting and strengthening North-South trade, is especially well positioned to assist businesses in Ireland address the particular commercial challenges that Brexit may present for cross-border commerce. That is why the Government provided &euro;250,000 in additional funding to ITI this year to allow it to undertake a range of initiatives aimed at better preparing Irish SMEs for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. This included the introduction of a Brexit readiness voucher scheme, strengthening the body's capacity to deliver expert advice and a series of events focused on building awareness amongst SMEs of Brexit-related challenges. The extra financial resources provided brought my Department's total funding of ITI to &euro;7.9 million in 2017.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland, like the other enterprise agencies, has a clear Brexit Plan, and includes one-to-one investor engagements, public relations/media campaign and an international marketing campaign. The Agency has established a Brexit Committee to oversee its response to the opportunities and challenges arising from Brexit.  The IDA is working hard to convert the interest shown to date by potential investors into investments on the ground here in Ireland. IDA Ireland is constantly engaged with clients across its entire regional portfolio and Brexit has become a significant feature of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy spanning all of it its activities, including operations activities, overseas, finance, planning marketing and promotion departments. </p></reply>

Progress is therefore being made in our collective efforts to help regional Ireland benefit further from FDI. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland continues to highlight the benefits of expanding or locating in the regions to its client base and it makes every effort to ensure that FDI is spread as widely as possible across the country. It is important to remember, however, that the final decision as to where to invest always rests with the company concerned. It is also the case that site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as at least 70% of all new FDI comes from existing IDA Ireland client companies.  </p>  <p>  Site visits nevertheless represent an important tool through which investors can be encouraged to invest in regional areas and the IDA always does its utmost to ensure that investors consider all potential locations. Determining which particular sites may be attractive to a client depends very much on the particular requirements of the firm concerned. Factors that are habitually important to overseas investors include the suitability of local infrastructure, the proximity of transport hubs and the availability of skilled talent. Multinational companies frequently seek as well to base themselves as close as possible to businesses operating in the same industry.  </p>  <p>  In relation to IDA Ireland's vacant buildings, there are 17 IDA-owned buildings currently available. In addition, the Agency leases units from private investors, of which 24 are currently available. </p>  <p>  The availability of such an adequate supply of marketable serviced land, together with office and industrial/technology buildings, in advance of demand is a key element in IDA Ireland&rsquo;s ability to compete for mobile FDI. The availability of property solutions eliminates the lead times normally associated with acquiring property, enables clients to plan their property needs with a greater degree of certainty and allows for the commencement of projects at an earlier date by diminishing much of the difficulties associated with land acquisition, planning and construction. It is therefore an important means by which the IDA can encourage and attract new investors to the country, especially to regional Ireland. </p>  <p>  The IDA's regional property programme is another important mechanism that supports investment outside of our main urban areas. It helps to ensure property solutions are in place for overseas companies considering investing or expanding, thereby encouraging FDI in regional Ireland. A number of buildings have already been constructed through the programme and 2018 will see the completion of further facilities in Galway, Athlone, Dundalk and Limerick. Design of similar facilities in Wateford and Carlow will also be progressed next year with a view to their completion in 2019. </p>  <p>   </p></reply>

The park is fully zoned and serviced and is currently home to one IDA client company, an engineering and industrial firm which employs approximately 40 people at the site.   </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland continues to market the park to potential investors through its network of overseas offices. The park has also been brought to the attention of companies already located in Ireland who may be considering expanding further here. The Agency remains focused on finding further investors for the facility.  </p>  <p>  More broadly, the IDA markets Mullingar as part of the Midlands Region, which includes three other counties: Longford, Laois and Offaly.  There are 30 multinational companies based in the region, employing 4,280 across all four counties. The Agency is determined to increase those numbers and it has appointed a dedicated Regional Manager to the region to further aid its efforts to grow investment in the wider area. </p>  <p>  County Westmeath has a strong base of foreign direct investment (FDI) with 13 companies employing 2,571 people there. Three of these companies are based in Mullingar and between them employ 150 people. The IDA actively engages with this existing client base to support them in growing their business and to encourage efforts to expand their current footprint. The company currently located in the Marlinstown Business Park, for example, previously announced a 30 person expansion at the opening of its new manufacturing facility in 2015. </p>  <p>  The IDA is also investing directly in property solutions for FDI in the Midlands and has received planning permission for one office building in Athlone, which should be ready for occupation in 2018. This is in addition to an advanced technology building which is now occupied by Aerie Pharmaceuticals. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Agency has undertaken a number of general initiatives in the Midlands region to encourage investment. This has included introducing indigenous companies to multinational firms so that Irish businesses are best placed to win new contracts and thereby ensure their long-term sustainability. The Agency has also launched a digital marketing campaign to market the Midlands Region for potential investors and this is used overseas by IDA executives to showcase particular locations. The Agency also has regular engagement with the Chief Executives of the relevant Local Authorities to ensure that a mutually supportive approach is taken to win new investment and jobs. </p></reply>

That original contract was due to expire on 26 March 2016. In advance of that date, however, Connect Ireland and the IDA jointly agreed to extend the term for a maximum period of one year. </p>  <p>  The purpose of that one-year extension was very clear: to facilitate both parties in effecting an orderly wind down of the original agreement.  That contract could not have been continued any further as the maximum number of extensions had already been granted and any further extension would have constituted a breach of public procurement law. </p>  <p>  The Board of IDA Ireland subsequently considered the future of the initiative at a meeting in November 2016.  It decided that the Agency would not re-tender for its continuation.  A definitive decision was not taken, however, on the ultimate future of the Succeed-in-Ireland programme. </p>  <p>  As was announced previously, my Department will be commissioning an independent review of the initiative.  That review, which will be carried out after details of the initiative&rsquo;s full and final costs are available, will equip us with a thorough understanding of the programme&rsquo;s results and its contribution to employment generation in the State.  We will then be in a position to make a determination on its long-term future. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, my Department launched a public consultation calling for observations on the draft terms of reference for that review.  I am pleased that the consultation process elicited a large number of submissions (17) and that responses were received from a range of stakeholders, including public representatives and the general public.</p>  <p>  I believe it is clearly in the interests of good governance that the review be undertaken before a decision is reached on the ultimate future of the programme. We need to fully understand how the initiative has functioned, its strong and weak points, and how we could potentially improve it for the future. This is in the interests of the taxpayer, of the State and ultimately of the programme itself. </p>  <p>  I want to make absolutely clear that no decision has been taken with regard to the ultimate future of the Succeed-in-Ireland initiative and that the initiative is not necessarily ending.  As I have already stated, a decision on its future will await the outcome of the comprehensive review. However, the review cannot proceed until the full and final costs of the programme are clear, which will necessitate the resolution of the dispute between Connect Ireland and IDA Ireland.  </p></reply>

Improving competitiveness performance is a core focus of the work of my Department and wider Government policy and is particularly vital in light of the challenges posed by Brexit. </p>  <p>  The 2017/2018 Global Competitiveness Report published by the World Economic Forum in September shows Ireland&rsquo;s ranking has fallen by 1 place this year. Ireland is the 8th most competitive economy in the euro area and the 11th most competitive economy in the EU28.  Despite the fall in ranking, it is encouraging that the overall trajectory of Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness performance and scores in indices such as the WEF&rsquo;s in recent years is positive.  The World Bank&rsquo;s Ease of Doing Business report currently ranks Ireland 18th out of 190 economies.  The Institute for Management Development measure of competitiveness ranks Ireland 6th most competitive out of 63 countries.  Both the nominal and real Harmonised Competitiveness Indicators are at relatively low levels by historic standards and recent data points to continued HCI competitiveness in Ireland. Most importantly, our improved competitiveness is reflected in strong employment growth across sectors and regions. The strong performance of clients supported by the enterprise agencies in winning exports, market share and job creation in the face of intense global competition is to be commended and reflects the competitiveness of the environment in which to do business in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Irelands&rsquo; performance in international rankings is a reminder of the intense global competition we face for exports and inward investment.  Global uncertainty and Brexit in particular, has underlined the importance of building competitive advantage and generating an uplift in enterprise export competitiveness to secure sustainable jobs and growth.  My objective is to ensure the economy is resilient at sectoral and firm level to deal with imminent competitiveness challenges and to build further on the progress we have made.</p>  <p>  Building the foundations of future growth means we must further enhance the competitiveness of our business environment.  We must continue to invest in infrastructure, innovation and talent and continue to harness the benefits from trade and the Single Market.  As Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I will ensure our policies enhance national competitiveness and create the best possible environment for enterprise and that innovation and investment across all regions are prioritised and implemented.  Ensuring enterprise stays at the forefront of innovative activity is vital to deepening the resilience of our enterprise base and necessary for success in global markets, which for a small open economy like Ireland, is necessary for creating sustainable growth. </p></reply>

The Action Plan for Jobs process is working. Since the first Plan was launched in early 2012, there are over 225,000 more people at work bringing total employment in the State to almost 2,063,000 by end of Quarter 2, 2017, with more than three out of every four new jobs created outside of Dublin.</p><p>While unemployment has fallen significantly and employment continues to grow strongly, this Government&rsquo;s goal is to have an additional 200,000 people at work by 2020, including 135,000 jobs outside of Dublin.</p><p>In July 2017 my Department commenced the whole of government process to develop the Action Plan for Jobs 2018. </p><p>To date, I have met with a wide range of representative organisations and businesses. In addition, the Department has invited submissions for ideas and actions that could be included in the 2018 Action Plan to support its 2020 goals and contribute to creating the right environment for continued job growth and retention right across the country. While it is important that the Department&rsquo;s day-to-day activities to support job creation should continue to be delivered, proposals for the 2018 Plan will focus on new and more strategic actions that will have a significant impact on sustainable job creation. </p><p>Building a strong economy and enterprise sector that can deliver sustainable full employment is significantly more challenging in light of increasing international uncertainty, particularly in the global trading and investment environment. As set out in the Government&rsquo;s Summer Economic Statement we, now more than ever, need to build economic resilience, so as to strengthen our ability to absorb, adjust and respond to severe shocks. </p><p>We must intensify our efforts to enhance and improve competitiveness and focus on structural reforms which improve productivity across the economy, including increasing efficiencies, and reducing unnecessary administrative burdens. We must continue to develop, nurture and attract world class talent and drive investment in innovation to sustain a competitive advantage, particularly in strategically important areas.</p><p>A sustained cross-Government focus is necessary to secure the gains already made and to deliver sustainable economic and employment growth across the country. </p><p>My Department is particularly interested in actions that support the following themes:</p><p>- Maintaining and enhancing resilience, productivity and competitiveness;</p><p>- Supporting and fostering enterprise via actions including the following:</p><p>- Growing Irish companies and enhancing their agility and resilience to the changing external environment for trading;</p><p>- Driving entrepreneurship and start-up companies;</p><p>- Developing and deepening the impact of foreign direct investment and ensuring it continues to be spread throughout regional Ireland;</p><p>- Accelerating regional development and growth;</p><p>- Delivering the skills for maintaining a talented and dynamic workforce;</p><p>- Promoting innovation that delivers success in international markets;</p><p>- Supporting the growth of the Digital Economy, building on existing initiatives such as Industry 4.0 and Digital Skills;</p><p>- Addressing new labour market challenges, such as expanding labour market participation across all sections of society;</p><p>- Ensuring access to competitive finance; and</p><p>- Identifying a small number of big ideas and reforms that could make meaningful impacts on the business environment.</p><p>The 2018 Action Plan for Jobs will be published by Feb 2018. Submissions from all stakeholders will be considered for inclusion. </p><p>I will be working with Ministerial colleagues to ensure that the 2018 Plan is ambitious and impactful and keeps us on track to deliver on our 2020 targets.</p></reply>

Ireland nevertheless attracts global FDI that helps to fuel employment creation and economic growth across the country. Multinational companies continue to invest and re-invest here with leading global firms from many sectors - including life sciences, ICT, engineering and digital media - all based in Ireland. The contribution that these investments make to our wider economy remains highly significant. </p>  <p>  Ireland has many strengths when it comes to attracting FDI. This includes, for example, our international competiveness ranking, where we are rated as the 6th most competitive country by the Institute for Management Development (IMD). Ireland also scores very highly in terms of key criteria for FDI including investment incentives, labour productivity and the adaptability and retention of talent. As recognised by the IMD, many of Ireland&rsquo;s traditional assets including our education system, highly skilled workforce and pro-enterprise business environment add to our competitive advantage and are extremely attractive to inward investors. </p>  <p>  While the Government is proud of the country's proven track record in attracting and sustaining FDI, we are very much aware that continued success cannot be taken for granted. That is why we are continually examining how we can improve on factors that are crucial to fostering further investment here, including our cost base, infrastructure, the availability of talent and our legal and regulatory environment. </p>  <p>  Ireland continues to compete with many different jurisdictions - both in the EU and further afield - for FDI. We remain confident, however, that Ireland's strengths make us attractive to overseas companies. Our continued membership of the European Union and Eurozone have become particularly important in this context recently.</p>  <p>  More generally, the State has a long track record of winning overseas investment for the Irish people. Over that period, the world economy has changed shape many times, yet Ireland has remained an attractive destination for FDI. Our capacity to continue winning such new investment, despite geopolitical changes and intense competition, will be aided by the underlying strengths of our FDI offering. As the global investment climate continues to evolve, we will adapt accordingly &ndash; as we have done in the past &ndash; and make sure that Ireland continues to secure new FDI projects and the jobs that go with them.</p></reply>

Both are keen to deepen and strengthen that presence to maximise opportunities for Irish business by;</p><p>- Increasing the number of Irish companies that export, increasing the number of markets served by Irish exports and increasing the value of total exports. A feature of the challenge of Brexit is that we must further diversify our exports so as to reduce our dependence on the UK market.</p><p>- Increasing foreign direct investment from both mature markets, which are already a valuable source of FDI, and diversification into new markets, for example into those markets that would traditionally turn to the UK as the location of choice from which to service the EU market.</p><p>We should also acknowledge that expansion of the Agency Overseas Office Networks will also require investment in the Agencies at home.</p><p>- To build the pipeline of companies capable of exporting to these markets in the case of EI; and</p><p>- To service FDI client visits to Ireland, win investments and ensure job retention, in the case of IDA. </p><p>The rewards for the hard work of our agencies at home and abroad are great.

The agencies and my Department are members of the Global Footprint 2025 Steering Group which is Chaired by An Taoiseach&rsquo;s office. The goal of the Global Footprint Initiative is to double Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint by 2025. This expansion will help drive efforts to diversify and increase trade, including in the wake of Brexit. The project will require an ambitious whole-of-Government approach, engaging actors across the system, to develop a comprehensive plan. To that end the Taoiseach has written to the Ministers asking them to develop a clear plan for doubling our presence overseas by 2025.</p></reply>

It contributes significantly to job creation, exports and investment and the competitiveness of the indigenous enterprise base. Innovation also contributes to embedding the foreign direct investment base in Ireland. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland, an agency of my Department, supports companies in regional and rural areas to start, innovate and remain competitive in international markets, now and into the future. The 5,000 manufacturing and internationally traded services companies that Enterprise Ireland works with are a critical source of existing employment and job creation in every county in Ireland. </p><p>In 2016, companies supported by Enterprise Ireland employed 201,108 people (173,868 FTE and 27,240 Other). </p><p>Within this, 19,244 new jobs were created resulting in a net gain of 9,117 jobs.</p><p>- 65 % of client employment is outside of Dublin.</p><p>- 42.2 % of client employment is outside the five counties which are home to the five urban centres (Dublin, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Cork).</p><p>- 36 % of the net new jobs created in 2016 by Enterprise Ireland supported clients were outside of the five counties which are home to the five urban centres. </p><p>From interactions with clients, Enterprise Ireland is seeing companies that are born in rural locations, creating jobs in rural areas and innovating in rural areas to provide globally competitive products for international markets.</p><p>Innovation is key in ensuring our firms are competitive in international markets and is vital for companies to meet the challenges posed by Brexit. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s role in Ireland&rsquo;s research and innovation landscape is focused on empowering Irish companies, irrespective of location throughout the country, to create high-value, innovative and differentiated products for international markets, leading to revenue and jobs growth in Ireland. Enterprise Ireland has a range of offers focusing on supporting businesses of all sizes to develop and build their innovative capability and to incentivise increased investment in innovation. These offers are available to companies throughout the country.</p><p>In January 2017, Enterprise Ireland published its strategy for the period 2017-2020 &lsquo;Building Scale, Expanding Reach&rsquo;. The strategy was developed in the context of Brexit and focuses on supporting clients to both build their scale and expand their reach. Despite economic and market uncertainties, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategic aims, working with clients are to:</p><p>- Assist clients to create 60,000 new jobs by 2020 and to sustain the existing record level of jobs</p><p>- Grow annual exports by &euro;5bn to &euro;26bn per annum</p><p>- Increase the level of spend in the Irish economy by &euro;4bn to &euro;27bn per annum by 2020.</p><p>- Ambition: Inspiring more companies to have global ambition.</p><p>The distribution of higher education institutions throughout the country provides companies with access to knowledge providers irrespective of location. At these locations, companies can access knowledge, skills and the physical infrastructure required to drive innovation. </p><p>To build innovation capacity at these locations, Enterprise Ireland has:</p><p>- Funded the established of campus incubators in every Higher Education Institution in partnership with the European Union under the Regional Innovation Strategies Measures. This programme seeks to (1) foster entrepreneurship and campus company activity; (2) help realise the commercial potential of</p><p>- Ireland&rsquo;s research community; and (3) support balanced regional development.</p><p>- Built a network of 15 Gateways at Institutes of Technology to give companies access to innovation expertise required to find solutions to business challenges. </p><p>Funded Technology Centres as part of a joint initiative with IDA Ireland. Technology Centres are collaborative entities, established and led by industry, which undertake R&amp;amp;D of strategic interest to its member companies, in partnership with a Higher Education Institution. </p><p>Provide financial supports, such as Innovation Vouchers and Innovation Partnerships, to client companies throughout Ireland. Location is not a factor in decisions made by Enterprise Ireland in regard to R&amp;amp;D support.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland will continue to work with client companies to drive innovation as means to  increasing employment across the country.</p><p>My Department has developed its Innovation 2020 strategy for Research and Development, Science and Technology and its Enterprise 2025 policy side by side. A critical objective for my Department is delivering on the actions and commitments set out in Innovation 2020. It is clear that a strong interdependence exists between science, technology and innovation policy and enterprise policy.</p><p>The National Support System for Horizon 2020, the EU Framework Programme for research and innovation, is coordinated by Enterprise Ireland. It has a budget of almost &euro;75 billion and runs over the period 2014-2020. Horizon 2020 includes a programme tailored specifically to the needs of SMEs, namely the SME Instrument, which has &euro;3 billion in funding available over the period 2014-2020. The SME Instrument helps high-potential SMEs to develop ground-breaking innovative ideas for products, services or processes that are ready to face global market competition.</p><p>Companies in Ireland (both foreign-owned and Irish-owned) that compete successfully for funding from Horizon 2020 will boost their innovative capability and competitiveness which in turn will deliver strong national economic impacts, including job creation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-12a.91.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101200041#WRB05500"><p>As Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation I recognise that investing in education, training and upskilling is vital for a strong workforce and to ensure a stable and healthy economy.  This Government has shown its commitment to this through the Action Plan for Jobs 2017 which recognises the need for upskilling and reskilling jobseekers and the importance of providing training for the long term unemployed.  As the economy approaches full employment it is likely that labour and skills shortages will become more common. The Government is working hard to address such shortages. </p>  <p>  As part of the Action Plan for Jobs, the Government has continually implemented actions to improve and expand Springboard. Over &euro;113 million has been allocated to Springboard+ from the National Training Fund. This funding has provided for over 30,000 free part-time and full-time higher education places. Springboard courses are delivered in public and private education institutions across the country, in a broad variety of sectors including ICT, construction and international financial services. As of July 2016, 80 per cent of those who participated on a Springboard+ course since 2011 are no longer on the Live Register.</p>  <p>  My Department engages with other Departments in relation to education, training and upskilling through the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN). The EGFSN advises the Irish Government on current and future skills needs on the economy and on other labour market issues that impact on Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise and employment growth. The EGFSN carries out research, analysis and horizon scanning in relation to emerging skills requirements at thematic and sectoral levels. The SOLAS Skills and Labour Market Research Unit provides the Group with data, analysis and research and manages the National Skills Database. My Department, in conjunction with SOLAS, provides the EGFSN with research and secretariat support. </p>  <p>  Over the years the EGFSN has produced reports with key recommendations including the upskilling and training of the current labour market in order to fill skills gaps and work with stakeholders to ensure implementation of these actions. An example of this is the recent &lsquo;Future Skills Needs in the Biopharma Industry in Ireland&rsquo; report called for vacancies to be filled by a combination of graduate intake, upskilling of those seeking employment and the continuous professional development of those working in the sector. The report also recommended both maximising available Jobseekers programmes to consolidate supply of skills and for a new biopharma apprenticeship and career traineeship to be developed. </p>  <p>  The Biopharma report is not unique in this regard. EGFSN reports regularly recommend the implementation of training and upskilling. </p>  <p>  Another example of this is the EGFSN&rsquo;s upcoming work report on Skills for the Digital Economy which will emphasise the importance of the constant reskilling and upskilling of the workforce in creating a resilient economy. The report will focus on how different roles and different sectors will be impacted by digitalisation and will develop a synopsis of approaches to upskilling the existing workforce. This report will add to the body of work completed by the EGFSN since its inception in relation to filling skills gaps using our current labour market.</p></reply>

This incorporates an extensive suite of studies (both externally commissioned and in-house research) and surveys, addressing the key enterprise aspects of Brexit.</p>  <p>  - In April my Department published the outputs from a series of structured engagements with companies (of different sizes, across different sectors and across the regions) and from a survey of a thousand SME business owners to "Understand the Implications of Brexit for Irish SME&rsquo;s".</p>  <p>  - A study analysing the "Potential Impact of WTO Tariffs on Cross-Border Trade" has been published in conjunction with InterTrade Ireland. This study provides an understanding of the impact of different trade and tariff regimes which might be imposed following Brexit, together with data on the extent and concentration of Cross Border Trade, including information on this trade by product and firm types, and barriers to exporting, all in the context of Brexit.</p>  <p>  In terms of ongoing research commitments, the Department is currently working on:</p>  <p>  - A major study examining the "Strategic Implications arising from EU-UK Trading Patterns". This study will provide an evidence base on key trade and investment questions to inform Ireland&rsquo;s position as part of the wider negotiation on the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU. It will quantify the possible impact of a range of Brexit scenarios on trade and investment and will provide significant data on possible sectoral impacts of Brexit.</p>  <p>  - A study examining the "Sectoral implications arising from Brexit" focused on 18 sectors most exposed to the UK is underway and is due to be completed by end 2017. This research examines the implications at firm-level for Ireland&rsquo;s most exposed enterprise sectors of the UK being outside of the European Single Market and Customs Union. The study is expected to be completed by end 2017.</p>  <p>  - A study examining the "Import Content of Irish Exports: Implications of Brexit for Inputs and Competitiveness" and the extent to which Irish firms source intermediate inputs from the UK has just commenced. This research will provide empirical evidence on the import content of Irish firms&rsquo; exports, how firms &amp;amp; sectors may be exposed to changes in the trading environment after Brexit and the impact of Brexit on inputs, and competitiveness.</p>  <p>  - A study examining the "Skills needs arising from the Potential Trading and Regulatory Implications of Brexit" has commenced &ndash; with a particular focus on sectors such as logistics and freight. This research is being undertaken in my Department on behalf of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs. </p>  <p>  Informed by this evidence base and extensive stakeholder engagement, we are inputting to and helping to shape the Irish position in the negotiations regarding the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU. DBEI officials based in the Permanent Representation in Brussels, the Embassy London and at the WTO in Geneva are also essential to this work, engaging with other Member States and institutions and sharing intelligence with the wider Departmental system.</p>  <p>  At Ministerial and official level we are central to the diplomatic effort across Government engaging our EU partners including the European Commission, individual Member States and the European Parliament. </p>  <p>  This has led to a much greater understanding and appreciation across the EU of the uniqueness of Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with the UK and the potential impact of Brexit on Ireland &ndash; including the impacts at a sectoral level. </p>  <p>  We are also engaging with counterparts in the UK at Ministerial and official level to deepen bilateral contacts generally and to ensure that our concerns regarding the potential impact of Brexit on Irish enterprise in particular are well understood.</p>  <p>  In terms of our policy response, the focus has been to assess the possible implications and impacts of Brexit across policy areas of the Department and to ensure that the necessary supports are in place. </p>  <p>  We are leveraging the expertise and enhancing the capacity of our Enterprise Agencies to ensure that they are in the best possible position to address the needs of their client in relation to competitiveness, innovation and market diversification. This is being achieved through the provision of information, training and other supports. </p>  <p>  I have also secured an additional &euro;3 million to enable the recruitment of a further 40-50 staff as part of DBEI 'Boots on the Ground'. This will bring the total additional Brexit related posts in the Department and across the Agencies to 100 in 2018.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland is key in this regard. In responding to Brexit, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy is to support clients in sustaining and growing exports to the UK while also encouraging and supporting diversification into new markets outside the UK.</p>  <p>  EI is in regular contact with some 600 clients across all sectors who are most reliant on the UK market; there is a particular focus on sectors such as food, construction and engineering that are most exposed to the UK and which provide major employment across all the regions.</p>  <p>  EI&rsquo;s 'Brexit SME Scorecard' is an interactive online tool which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit. The tool prompts companies to consider the potential impact of Brexit across their business and provides suggested actions.</p>  <p>  EI has introduced a 'Be Prepared Grant' which offers up to &euro;5,000 in funding to support exporting client companies to research and develop a Brexit Action Plan.</p>  <p>  Likewise, the Local Enterprise Offices are key points of context for engagement with enterprise. The LEO&rsquo;s are organising local workshops, seminars and training to assist companies to better understand the challenges of Brexit. LEOs also have a range of supports to help clients to respond to those challenges, to become more competitive and to source new markets.</p>  <p>  Finally, we are targeting State supports to help vulnerable firms to adapt, in order to reinforce enterprise and employment, across all sectors and regions. In Budget 2018, a new &euro;300m Brexit Loan Scheme was announced to provide affordable financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or will be in the future. The new scheme is open to all trading SMEs and large firms employing less than 500. </p>  <p>  In addition, I have asked my officials to progress with the Department of Finance and the SBCI and EIB the development of a Longer-Term Loan Scheme, together with a new Business Advisory Hub service, which would focus on business development to allow enterprises to position them for a post-Brexit environment.</p>  <p>  Of course, there may also be sectoral opportunities as a result of Brexit. IDA continues to identify potential for mobile FDI in key sectors and actively pursue these opportunities including through targeted trade missions and rollout of advertising campaigns to promote Ireland&rsquo;s offering particularly in talent and tax.</p>  <p>  Financial Services is a key sector where we have strengths and opportunities. IDA is taking a targeted but realistic approach to pursuing these opportunities &ndash; this is being done in the context of upholding regulatory standards that apply in Ireland managed by the Central Bank.</p></reply>

The AGSB was set up to give a greater voice in the development of policy to SMEs.  Issues negatively affecting the growth and development of SMEs are identified, and possible solutions are suggested by the Group.  My colleague, Minister of State for Trade, Employment, Business, EU Digital Single Market and Data Protection, Pat Breen TD, chairs the group and will ensure we continue to monitor current and impending impediments impacting on business. </p><p>Another formal structure is the Retail Consultation Forum. Given the importance of this sector to the economy it was established is to allow key issues of relevance to the retail sector to be discussed, with a view to identifying practical actions which could be taken by Government, or by industry itself, to support the sector with particular emphasis on achieving sustainable jobs growth in the sector.</p><p>As well as these formal structures, my Department regularly undertakes consultation exercises on various matters that are open to SMEs and their representative organisations to provide input.</p><p>Another method my Department uses to monitor any potential impediments to the business environment is Ireland&rsquo;s Small Business Act (SBA) Factsheet by the European Commission, the latest annual report being published in November 2016. The Small Business Act for Europe (SBA) is the EU&rsquo;s flagship policy initiative to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It comprises a set of policy measures organised around 10 principles. </p><p>2016 Report on Ireland:</p><p>This 2016 report shows once again that Ireland has one of the most SME friendly environments in the EU. </p><p>Ireland features among the top three performers in the EU in two of those ten principles:</p><p>- Skills &amp;amp; innovation of SMEs, and</p><p>- Single market (Single market refers to the integration and interaction of a countries administration and SME&rsquo;s to the Single Market). </p><p>Ireland performs well above the EU average in three other SBA areas:</p><p>- Entrepreneurship</p><p>- Second chance, and</p><p>- Responsive administration</p><p>In addition, my Department, as set out in the Action 166 of the APJ 2016, began monitoring a range of nationally and internationally available indicators to assess national performance across the entrepreneurship ecosystem in order to inform policy relating to new and growing businesses. </p><p>The reason behind this measurement exercise was to identify Ireland's international performance in each of the six fields in the ecosystem for entrepreneurship. They are:</p><p>1. Culture, human capital and education</p><p>2. Business environment and supports</p><p>3. Innovation</p><p>4. Access to finance</p><p>5. Entrepreneurial networks and mentoring</p><p>6. Access to markets</p><p>By assessing Ireland&rsquo;s performance in each field through a number of internationally respected entities, we can see the lay of the land in our ecosystem. </p><p>When viewed, the measurements show good to excellent performance in a number of fields, particularly Business Environment and Innovation. In the Access to Finance field, it appears that the SME sector, of which entrepreneurs are a cohort, rely heavily on reinvesting profits and inter trade lending. They appear to be below the mean, when compared to their EU counterparts, in accessing finance from banks.

In 2016, Enterprise Ireland supported companies employed 201,108 people (173,868 FTE and 27,240 other). Within this, 19,244 new jobs were created resulting in a net gain of 9,117 jobs.</p>  <p>  65 per cent of Enterprise Ireland client employment is outside of Dublin. 42.2 per cent of client employment is outside the five counties which are home to the five urban centres (Dublin, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Cork). 36 per cent of the net new jobs created in 2016 by Enterprise Ireland support clients were outside of this geographic region. From interactions with clients, the agency is seeing companies that are born in rural locations, creating jobs in rural areas and innovating to provide globally competitive product for international markets.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has 10 regional offices throughout Ireland including offices in Athlone, Tralee, Letterkenny, Sligo, Shannon and Dundalk. This enables Enterprise Ireland to connect and collaborate at a local level with enterprise development partners to assist in driving the multiagency response required to encourage start-up enterprises.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland provides a range of financial and non-financial supports for start-up enterprises throughout the country, such as:</p>  <p>  - The National Entrepreneurial Development Programme delivered in partnership with Institutes of Technology through the country.</p>  <p>  - A Competitive Start Fund ran by the agency to accelerate the growth of start-up companies that have the capability to become High Potential Start-Up (HPSU) Companies. This fund routinely targets specific sectors, regions and cohorts to ensure that the assets of the state are utilised to promote start-up enterprises and to drive job creation. In 2016, 128 new start-up enterprises were approved funding under this initiative.</p>  <p>  - Equity investment High Potential Start-ups (HPSUs) with the potential to develop an innovative product or service for sale on international markets and the potential to create 10 jobs and &euro;1m in sales within 3 to 4 years of starting up. 101 new High Potential Start-Ups were supported in 2016, 48% of which were from outside Dublin.</p>  <p>  - Enterprise Ireland has a service level agreement with four Business Incubation Centres through the country to assess, advise, validate and progress early stage-business plans of Enterprise Ireland clients to an investor ready stage-point, with an objective of driving the number of High Potential Start-Ups approved each year by Enterprise Ireland.  </p>  <p>  - In 2016, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s entrepreneurship programmes had 407 participants. In 2016 there was six newly established funds under the Seed &amp;amp; Venture Capital Scheme (2013- 2018) making additional funds of over &euro;330m available for investment in Irish companies.</p>  <p>  - Enterprise Ireland has funded campus incubators in every Higher Education Institute throughout the country. These facilities are internationally recognised as an important element of public assistance for technology-intensive start-ups.  These facilities are also an important driver of regional development with the majority of companies remaining in their region after they have completed their incubation period.</p>  <p>  - Under the 2015 -2017 Accelerator Development Scheme, Enterprise Ireland has funded two accelerators outside of Dublin to enhance the start-up eco-system in their region. More accelerators will be announced in due course.</p>  <p>  At local level, the advent of the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) has enabled Enterprise Ireland to play a critical role in driving and nurturing entrepreneurship from the original local level idea, through to successfully competing in global markets.</p>  <p>  The LEOs were established as the &lsquo;first-stop-shops&rsquo; for advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports for anyone who intends to start or grow their own business. In the first instance, the LEOs provide a &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; service in relation to all relevant State supports available through agencies such as Revenue, the Department of Social Protection, Education and Training Boards, Credit Review Office, and Microfinance Ireland. The LEOs can also offer advice and guidance in areas such as Local Authority rates, public procurement and other regulations affecting business.</p>  <p>  There are a range of supports available from the LEOs to assist start-ups. The LEOs can offer direct grant aid to microenterprises (10 employees or fewer) in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities. These include feasibility grants (investigating the potential of a business idea) and priming grants (to part-fund a start-up). In 2016, over &euro;7 million in priming grants was approved for 357 new LEO clients across the country.</p>  <p>  Anyone with a viable business proposal can also use the LEOs to make an application to MicroFinance Ireland, which offers support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-ups with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks. Successful applicants can avail of a more favourable interest rate from MFI if they make their application through the LEO.</p>  <p>  The LEOs attracted 1,471 applicants to the Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur (IBYE) 2018 competition by the closing date at the end of September 2017. IBYE is a programme run by the 31 LEOs with the support of my Department and Enterprise Ireland and is aimed at encouraging entrepreneurship as a career choice among young people. The competition is open to people between the ages of 18 and 35 with an innovative business idea and has an investment fund of up to &euro;2million. </p>  <p>  The LEOs also run promotional events such as the National Women&rsquo;s Enterprise Day and the Local Enterprise Week, which are aimed at, inter alia, promoting the LEO services and encouraging people to start or grow a business. These events are supplemented by LEO participation in other promotional events such as the National Ploughing Championships and the forthcoming Taking Care of Business event in Dublin Castle on 8 November.</p></reply>

This is at the crux of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s 2017-2020 Build Scale and Expand Reach strategy and its new Eurozone Strategy.</p>  <p>   The Enterprise Ireland Eurozone Strategy was launched in May 2017 as part of their overarching strategy to &lsquo;Build Scale, Expand Reach&rsquo; by 2020.</p>  <p>  - The strategy aims to help Irish exporters increase exports into the Eurozone by &euro;2bn (50%) by 2020.</p>  <p>  - The Eurozone is a very attractive market for Irish exporters because of currency stability, free trade agreements and growth potential. </p>  <p>  - Priority sectors and export growth will be targeted in areas like construction, engineering and the life sciences/medtech sectors.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland will seek to inspire more companies to have Eurozone and global ambition and will implement extensive trade mission and event schedules focussed on global and sectoral opportunities, further develop in-market expertise and networks, place greater focus on identifying new sectoral opportunities and stimulate demand for Irish products and services through international marketing campaigns.  In 2017, Enterprise Ireland will run 145 promotional trade events, of which 44 were minister-led.  An additional 39 posts have been sanctioned for the agency, including in some EU markets, in order to increase its ability to support clients in finding new markets.</p>  <p>  Assisted by Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategic communications campaigns such as &ldquo;Global Ambition&rdquo; and &ldquo;PrepareforBrexit&rdquo;, the agency has: </p>  <p>  - Launched a &lsquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rsquo;, a new interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars.  Based on answers supplied by the user, the Scorecard generates an immediate report which contains suggested actions and resources, and information on events for companies to attend, to prepare for Brexit. To date approximately 1,500 companies have utilised the Brexit SME Scorecard.</p>  <p>  - Rolled out a national Prepare for Brexit Breakfast roadshow across the country.</p>  <p>  - Incorporated a Brexit zone into International Markets Week. This zone provided Enterprise Ireland client companies with access to independent experts in areas such as currency management, transport and logistics and procurement. Enterprise Ireland staff were also available to discuss sales and marketing capability and client management development programmes with a focus on Brexit</p>  <p>  - Launched a Be Prepared Grant which provides client companies with the cost of preparing a plan to mitigate risks and optimise opportunities arising from Brexit. This grant support, of up to &euro;5,000, can be used to help cover consultancy, travel and out of pocket expenses associated with researching the direction of their Brexit action plan. </p>  <p>  All of the above actions are aimed at assisting companies to grow new markets so as to reduce our dependence on the UK.  To that end, Enterprise Ireland is proactively engaging with client companies on Brexit issues and is working with clients on their business development plans based on a company diagnostic led approach.</p></reply>

That is because multinational businesses value our talented workforce, membership of the EU and Eurozone as well as our proven track record as a home to FDI.</p>  <p>  The Government is very much aware, however, that we must work hard in order both to sustain FDI and encourage more companies to locate or expand here. That is why we are continuing to improve our offering to international investors. This includes taking steps to enhance our competitiveness and infrastructure, together with the supply of talent for overseas businesses.</p>  <p>  In terms of innovation and technology, a concerted and successful effort has been made to develop an innovation-driven enterprise and academic culture and our country is now firmly on the global map for the excellence of our research. Our investment in research and innovation has also helped to foster indigenous enterprise and to attract FDI from some of the world's leading companies. </p>  <p>  While significant strides have therefore been taken to grow our international innovation and technology profile, more work remains to be done. That is why the Government developed its Innovation 2020 strategy, which is our five-year roadmap for research and development, science and technology. We are committed to the implementation of the actions set out in that strategy which will help to drive our economy and deliver a better society.</p></reply>

Improving competitiveness performance is a core focus of the work of my Department and wider Government policy and is particularly vital in light of the challenges posed by Brexit. </p>  <p>  The 2017/2018 Global Competitiveness Report published by the World Economic Forum in September shows Ireland&rsquo;s ranking has fallen by 1 place this year. Despite the fall in ranking, Ireland continues to be the 8th most competitive economy in the euro area and the 11th most competitive economy in the EU28. The Institute for Management Development measure of competitiveness ranks Ireland 6th most competitive out of 63 countries and the 2nd most competitive in the Euro area. Ireland&rsquo;s performance reflects significant and continuous improvements in rankings related to economic performance, business efficiency, government efficiency and infrastructure. It is an important signal to international investors. The World Bank&rsquo;s Ease of Doing Business report currently ranks Ireland 18th out of 190 economies, ahead of the UK in terms of starting a business and paying taxes but behind in the overall rankings. </p>  <p>  Most importantly, our improved competitiveness is reflected in strong employment growth across sectors and regions. The strong performance of clients supported by the enterprise agencies in winning exports, market share and job creation in the face of intense global competition is to be commended and reflects the competitiveness of the environment in which to do business in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Recent reports by the National Competitiveness Council have highlighted the need to continually enhance competitiveness performance. I share the Council&rsquo;s view that to further improve competitiveness we must preserve fiscal sustainability, maximise investment in infrastructure and talent, maintain cost competitiveness, and drive innovation and productivity across all economic sectors. Global uncertainty, and Brexit in particular, has underlined the importance of building competitive advantage, generating an uplift in enterprise export competitiveness and continuing to harness the benefits from trade and the Single Market to secure sustainable jobs and growth. My objective is to ensure the economy is resilient at sectoral and enterprise level to deal with imminent competitiveness challenges and to build further on the progress we have made. </p>  <p>  Competitiveness is key to success in international markets and helping businesses to improve their competitiveness will remain a key focus for my Department. We are driving the implementation of our research strategy, Innovation 2020. We are putting more people on the ground in foreign markets to attract investment and helping Irish businesses which export to the UK and helping others diversify into new products and markets. We are introducing a Brexit loan scheme of up to &euro;300 million targeting the short-term capital needs of SMEs, which will allow them to put in place the necessary change to help their business grow into the future. </p></reply>

This is at the crux of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s 2017-2020 Build Scale and Expand Reach strategy and its new Eurozone Strategy to assist Irish exporters increase exports in Eurozone countries by 50% by 2020.</p>  <p>  The devaluation and volatility of sterling, and the uncertainty that has unfolded in the business environment since the UK vote to leave the EU cannot be underestimated. At the same time, Enterprise Ireland clients are challenged to prepare to operate in a yet unknown trading environment post Brexit &ndash; they must prepare for a hard Brexit.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s clients are actively utilising the agency&rsquo;s financial and non-financial supports to meet the innovation, competitiveness and market diversification challenges of Brexit as part of their strategic growth plans.</p>  <p>  In March 2017, Enterprise Ireland launched a &lsquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rsquo;, a new interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars. Based on answers supplied by the user, the Scorecard generates an immediate report which contains suggested actions and resources, and information on events for companies to attend, to prepare for Brexit. To date approximately 1,500 companies have utilised the Brexit SME Scorecard.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Be Prepared Grant provides client companies with the cost of preparing a plan to mitigate risks and optimise opportunities arising from Brexit. This grant support, of up to &euro;5,000, can be used to help cover consultancy, travel and out of pocket expenses associated with researching the direction of their Brexit action plan.</p>  <p>  To date 54 companies have received approval for support under this initiative, and a strong pipeline of companies have applications undergoing review for approval. The number of applications at this early stage means that a county by county analysis is not particularly meaningful. Approximately 45% of applications are from the Dublin region and the rest from the other regions. Enterprise Ireland will continue to promote the Scorecard and the Be Prepare Grant to all counties and regions to ensure that the maximum number of clients are engaged in preparing for the impact of Brexit.</p></reply>

Government policy is focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources.  </p><p>My Department conducts a biannual SME Credit Demand Survey. This survey series is the most comprehensive survey of SME credit demand in Ireland, covering over 1,500 respondents and involving over 6,000 direct telephone calls to SMEs.

The latest survey can be found here: </p><p><i><i></i></i></p><p>The survey shows that demand for credit amongst the SME sector remains subdued with 20% seeking credit, however, only 1% of the SMEs that did not seek credit stated this was because it was too expensive to borrow.

Such proceedings include  proceedings for the recovery of tax that is due on foot of assessments that are final and conclusive.</p></reply>

Under the scheme an employer may provide an employee or director with a bicycle and / or cycle safety equipment without the employee being liable for benefit-in-kind taxation. However, where the expenditure by the employer exceeds &euro;1,000, the excess amount is liable to tax. The employer may agree to operate the scheme under a salary sacrifice arrangement. The legislation allows for one purchase of a bicycle in respect of an employee in a 5-year period.

In order to qualify for relief, an individual must have a source of &ldquo;relevant earnings&rdquo; which, in broad terms, means income arising from a trade, profession or a non-pensionable employment.  Under section 787, where full relief cannot be given in a tax year in respect of premiums paid for that year because of an insufficiency of net relevant earnings, the unrelieved amount is carried forward to the next year and treated as a qualifying premium paid in that year.</p><p>I am also advised that section 955 of the TCA 1997, which is concerned with the tax years up to and including 2012, sets out the time limits for the making and amendment of assessments. It provides that, in general, assessments must be made or amended within a period of 4 years of the end of the tax year in which an individual has made a return containing a full and true disclosure of all material facts necessary for the making of an assessment and that no additional tax is payable after the end of that period. It also provides that repayments shall not be made outside of the 4 year period from the end of the tax year for which such a return is made.</p><p>Under section 955, an assessment may be amended at any time in the following circumstances&mdash;</p><p>- where the return made does not contain a fulland true disclosure of all material facts necessary for the making of anassessment,</p><p>- to give effect to the determination of an appeal against an assessment,</p><p>- to take account of a fact or matter arising from an event that happens after the making of a return,</p><p>- to correct an error in calculation, or</p><p>- to correct any factual mistake so as to align the assessment with the position as dis-closed by a taxpayer.</p><p>In these specific circumstances, any additional tax must be paid by the taxpayer and any overpaid tax must be repaid by Revenue, notwithstanding the general 4 year time limit for making repayments.</p><p>This statutory limit is binding on Revenue as well as on the taxpayer.  Without having the facts of the case presented by the Deputy, it would appear that in this instance the individual is outside the 4 year time limit in which to request a repayment.</p></reply>

The Kelly report, published in 2015, involved an extensive process of consultation and engagement with stakeholders in the South East, summarised the challenges and difficulties encountered by the TUSE project and articulated a rationale for a new type of higher education institution to support a step-change in the economic and social development of the South-East region. Following the publication of the Kelly Report, a preliminary facilitation process was completed with a report of the process being delivered in May 2016.  </p>  <p>  The TUSE consortium made a presentation and submission to the Higher Education Authority (HEA) in 2016 and were allocated &euro;1.45m in funding to support the next phase of development of the technology university project.  To date the HEA has provided the consortium with &euro;0.57m in funding for the project development. The HEA has this week launched a new call for the funding of technological university development projects and other higher education landscape restructuring to which technological university consortia may make submissions. Institutes in the relevant consortia lead on the progression of their plans to seek designation as a technological university.    Funding has also been ringfenced in budget 2018 to support consortia to progress their projects.</p>  <p>  The enactment of legislation is required to provide for the establishment of technological universities and work is ongoing on the Bill at present and I plan to reintroduce to the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity.   Once the legislation is enacted, the timing of applications for designation are a matter for the relevant consortium. </p></reply>

Such violence is entirely unacceptable. It must be thoroughly investigated and its perpetrators brought to justice. </p>  <p>  I note that the President of Colombia has instructed the National Police and the Colombian Armed Forces to cooperate with the Colombian DPP to determine what occurred on 5 October and that the Colombian National Police have ordered the suspension of four of its officers in connection with the incident. I welcome this as a sign of the resolve of the Colombian government to ensure that the events are investigated in full. </p>  <p>  I am also deeply concerned at the attack which took place on 8 October against the United Nations-led humanitarian mission which travelled to the scene of the violence in Tumaco to investigate the shooting of civilians.  I urge the Government of Colombia to carry out a full investigation of this incident also. </p>  <p>  Tumaco is among the regions of Colombia which has suffered most the consequences of the country&rsquo;s conflict.  My Department has an ongoing commitment to supporting peace and human rights in this troubled region and officials from my Department visited the region in 2015 and 2016.  </p>  <p>  Incidences of violence and intimidation against local communities in the Departments of Cauca, Argelia and Nari&ntilde;o, and elsewhere in Colombia, as well as the continued presence of armed groups in such communities, remain a matter of great concern.  As well as ongoing exchanges with the Colombian authorities at Government-level, officials of my Department engage regularly with human rights defenders and civil society leaders active in Colombia, including those working in some of the communities most affected by conflict.  </p>  <p>  I reiterate that I am deeply concerned at the recent violent incidents, which must be thoroughly investigated. </p>  <p>  At the same time, I must acknowledge the extraordinary strides which have been made in the implementation of the peace process to date.  The full decommissioning of FARC weapons was complete by July 2017, eight months after the agreement was finalised.  A ceasefire with the country&rsquo;s second largest guerrilla group, the ELN, took effect at the beginning of October.  The peace process provides the framework in which the endemic violence and impunity which has afflicted Colombian society can successfully be addressed.  Ireland is committed to supporting its full implementation to ensure a future of peace for all Colombians. </p></reply>

We are therefore committed to reforming the Direct Provision system, with particular focus on families and children.&rdquo;  </p>  <p>  In addressing these issues, the Government has established a process for the provision of cooking facilities and food through a points system. This has been fully implemented in Mosney, the Old Convent, Ballyhaunis, Co. Mayo and in Clonakilty Lodge, Clonakilty, Co. Cork. Cooking facilities are provided in each accommodation unit in Mosney and Ballyhaunis and by way of communal kitchens in Clonakilty.</p>  <p>  Both the accommodation centres in Athlone, Co. Westmeath and Kinsale Road, Cork are owned by the State and managed on its behalf by a contractor who was appointed following a public procurement process. My Department, through the Reception and Integration Agency, is currently working towards the provision of a food hall at each location so that residents will be able to choose food items through a points system. While each accommodation unit in Athlone is already fitted with cooking facilities, a communal kitchen is available for residents in Kinsale Road. </p>  <p>  The Government will continue with this process across all family centres until the commitment in the McMahon report and the Programme for Partnership Government is fully met.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service. However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner. The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; is forecast at just over &euro;1.7 billion in 2017. </p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively. This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster (Versatis) is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010. The projected budget impact was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure has increased significantly, from &euro;9.4 million in 2012 to over &euro;30 million in 2016, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles. Currently, over 25,000 patients are in receipt of this item. </p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of Versatis highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data and its value is uncertain for all other types of pain. The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, between 5-10% of prescribing of this product is for the licensed indication of PHN. </p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for Versatis from 1 September 2017. This process supports the appropriate use of Versatis, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment. The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.</p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who receive antivirals for shingles are automatically approved for Versatis for three months. No action is required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy is notified of his or her approval status.</p><p>All patients who currently use Versatis have been identified and automatically registered on the HSE-PCRS system for three months and will continue to receive the treatment from their pharmacy until 30 November 2017. However, from 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients will no longer get Versatis under the community drugs schemes. The HSE has produced information leaflets for patients and advised GPs on treatment alternatives. </p><p>In exceptional circumstances, the product may be approved for supply through the community schemes for unlicensed indications. GPs apply for reimbursement for unlicensed indications through the online system. The MMP reviews applications before a decision is made and communicated to the GP.</p><p>Full details of the Versatis review are available on the HSE website at .</p><p>As this is a matter for the HSE, I have no role in this decision in relation to individual treatments. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government and Sl&aacute;intecare commit to shifting the model of healthcare towards a more comprehensive and accessible primary care service in order to deliver better care close to home in communities across the country. The development of a new, modernised contract for the provision of general practitioner services will be a key element in facilitating this process. The aim is to develop a contract which has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion and disease prevention and for the structured ongoing care of chronic conditions. </p>  <p>   Since 2015, negotiations have resulted in a number of service developments including the provision of free GP care to under 6's and over 70's, the introduction of a Diabetes Cycle of Care for adult GMS patients with Type 2 Diabetes and enhanced supports for rural GPs.  The next phase of discussions on a new GP contract is under way and I expect that the sustainability of general practice in rural areas will be considered in this context.</p>  <p>  Budget 2018 has provided &euro;25 million new funding for primary care that will enable a range of initiatives to be progressed in 2018 which will focus on disease prevention, early intervention and GP care. I am hopeful that progress can be made over the coming months on service developments that can be introduced during 2018 and that we can then build on this with further resourcing in future years. I look forward to continued ongoing positive engagement with GP representatives in the months ahead. </p>  <p>  In addition, I would like to assure the Deputy of the Government's commitment to the continued development of GP capacity to ensure that patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future. I want to ensure that existing GP services are retained and that general practice remains an attractive career option for newly-qualified GPs.</p>  <p>  Efforts undertaken in recent years to increase the number of practising GPs include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible/shared GMS/GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday, as well as the introduction of an enhanced supports package for rural GP practices. Separately, the State is seeking to train more GPs to provide GP services to the population. In 2009, there were 120 GP training places and in 2017 there were 170 training places filled. The Government is committed to further increasing this number to 259 places annually in future years. </p></reply>

I would like to outline steps the HSE has taken to ensure that consultants employed in the public services are on the specialist register of the Medical Council and that where this is not the case appropriate clinical supervision is in place.</p><p>In March 2008 the HSE amended the qualifications specified for Consultant posts to require membership of the specialist division of the Register of Medical Practitioners maintained by the Medical Council.  Consultant Contract 2008 reflects this requirement. Data from HSE National Doctors Training and Planning indicates that approximately 80 Consultant post holders out of over 3,000 do not hold specialist division registration. Some of these were appointed prior to March 2008 and therefore did not have to meet that requirement on appointment.</p><p>In December 20015 the Director General of the HSE requested Professor Frank Keane to lead a process to address a range of issues associated with the creation and approval of Consultant posts and successful recruitment to such posts. In February 2017 the HSE published the Report of the Committee established to undertake this work:- &lsquo;<i>Successful Consultant Recruitment, Appointment and Retention</i>&rsquo;. The Committee recommended that measures be adopted to cease the poor employment practice which gives rise to contracts of indefinite duration and risk to the public arising from provision of services by persons who are not appropriately qualified. The HSE is focused on implementing the recommendations of the Committee.</p><p>On 17 July 2017 National HR, HSE issued a detailed Circular &ldquo;<i>HR Circular 021/2017 re Qualifications required for Consultant Posts</i>&rdquo;. The Circular reaffirmed the HSE&rsquo;s regulatory functions in relation to all consultant appointments in the public service in Ireland, including new and replacement posts, locum and temporary posts, contract type and qualifications to apply.  It stated that health service employers are required to seek the prior approval of the HSE before making a Consultant appointment (whether permanent or non-permanent) and to comply with the HSE Letter of Approval concerning any post in making an appointment.  It also provided that a risk mitigation plan be put in place for each consultant post where the appointee does not hold the qualifications specified for the appointment, and this should include appropriate arrangements for senior clinical oversight as required.  It also provided for the early termination of contracts of temporary/locum doctors who do not hold the qualifications required.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be familiar with the background to the closure of both the Mobility Allowance and Motorised Transport Grant schemes in February 2013.  Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the 4,700 people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.</p><p>The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government </i>acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs.  The Government's legislative programme for 2017 includes the Health (Transport Support) Bill.  I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage.  The proposals seek to ensure that:</p><p>-  There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;</p><p>-  There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;</p><p>-  Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and</p><p>-  The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.</p><p>The draft General Scheme and Heads of Bill were circulated to other government Departments and have been the subject of consultation between the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  When the consultation with other relevant Departments has been completed, the next step will be to seek Government approval to the drafting of a Bill for the new Scheme.</p><p>It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.</p><p>Specifically adapted vehicles driven by disabled persons are also exempt from payment of tolls on national toll roads and toll bridges.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular Scheme.</p></reply>

I would like to outline steps the HSE has taken to ensure that consultants employed in the public services are on the specialist register of the Medical Council and that where this is not the case appropriate clinical supervision is in place.</p>  <p>  In March 2008 the HSE amended the qualifications specified for Consultant posts to require membership of the specialist division of the Register of Medical Practitioners maintained by the Medical Council. Consultant Contract 2008 reflects this requirement. Data from HSE National Doctors Training and Planning indicates that approximately 80 Consultant post holders out of over 3,000 do not hold specialist division registration. Some of these were appointed prior to March 2008 and therefore did not have to meet that requirement on appointment.</p>  <p>  In December 20015 the Director General of the HSE requested Professor Frank Keane to lead a process to address a range of issues associated with the creation and approval of Consultant posts and successful recruitment to such posts. In February 2017 the HSE published the Report of the Committee established to undertake this work:- &lsquo;Successful Consultant Recruitment, Appointment and Retention&rsquo;. The Committee recommended that measures be adopted to cease the poor employment practice which gives rise to contracts of indefinite duration and risk to the public arising from provision of services by persons who are not appropriately qualified. The HSE is focused on implementing the recommendations of the Committee.</p>  <p>  On 17th July National HR, HSE issued a detailed Circular &ldquo;HR Circular 021/2017 re Qualifications required for Consultant Posts&rdquo;. The Circular reaffirmed the HSE&rsquo;s regulatory functions in relation to all consultant appointments in the public service in Ireland, including new and replacement posts, locum and temporary posts, contract type and qualifications to apply. It stated that health service employers are required to seek the prior approval of the HSE before making a Consultant appointment (whether permanent or non-permanent) and to comply with the HSE Letter of Approval concerning any post in making an appointment. It also provided that a risk mitigation plan be put in place for each consultant post where the appointee does not hold the qualifications specified for the appointment, and this should include appropriate arrangements for senior clinical oversight as required. It also provided for the early termination of contracts of temporary/locum doctors who do not hold the qualifications required.</p></reply>

The BSE ban in respect of Irish beef was lifted by the Chinese authorities in early 2015. This was a very positive development which paved the way for the start of the process to secure access.  The Chinese General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) then carried out a systems audit in Ireland in January 2016.  In April 2017 together with the AQSIQ Minister Zhi Shuping, I signed a Protocol on the requirements for Frozen Beef to be exported from Ireland to China. The signing of this Protocol was another significant step towards securing beef market access. A veterinary health certificate based on this Protocol is being finalised and will be submitted to the Chinese Authorities shortly.</p>  <p>  In August 2017 my Department hosted an audit visit from the Chinese Certification and Accreditation Administration (CNCA) who undertook a series of plant inspection visits in order to assess the applications by Irish beef processors to gain access to the Chinese market. Feedback from the audit team was broadly positive and we are now awaiting the official report of their audit visit. </p>  <p>  Despite this significant progress, the fact is that the pace of market access will be determined by the Chinese authorities, and not by my Department.  My officials continue to liaise closely with their Chinese counterparts to ensure every assurance is provided in relation to the quality and safety of Irish beef. </p>  <p>  Ireland currently has access for fresh/frozen pig meat and pig offals and by-products to China.  Exports of pig meat to China in 2016 totalled approximately 73,090 tonnes valued at &euro;119.29m. </p>  <p>  Applications have also been submitted to AQSIQ China for access for Irish poultrymeat and sheepmeat. AQSIQ will only consider one commodity at a time and when the process of access for beef has been completed, they will in due course move on to assessment of other market access applications.</p></reply>

In late 2015 we were informed via the European Commission that South Korea was to undertake inspection visits to Ireland in May 2016.</p><p>In May 2016 a delegation of 3 inspectors from the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency (QIA<b>)</b>within the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (MAFRA) held a week long inspection visit to Ireland. They had meetings with the Department and site visits including two beef production establishments, beef &amp;amp; sheep farm, laboratories, rendering plant and knackery. </p><p>A follow on questionnaire was then submitted to South Korea as part of the process of seeking beef market access during the trade mission in September 2016. In June 2017, a delegation from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) inspected a number of meat processing plants and cold stores.</p><p>Ireland is currently at step four<b></b>in a six step process for beef market access to South Korea.  We are awaiting reports from both the QIA delegation and the MFDS visit.  These reports will recommend whether market access should be granted to Ireland. This recommendation represents step five of the process. Should Ireland be successful in gaining market access for Irish beef, the delegation will return to inspect individual plants that want to export to Korea. </p><p>I intend to raise the matter of beef access and try to expedite the process during the Trade Mission to South Korea next month. In parallel,  my officials plan to meet their counterparts for technical discussions aimed at moving the process forward.</p><p>Ireland currently has access for fresh/frozen pig meat and by-products to South Korea and a successful re-inspection visit was carried out in October/November 2016.  Exports of pig meat to South Korea in 2016 totalled approximately 5048 tonnes valued at &euro;11.2m. </p><p>When full access for beef has been granted, my Department can then proceed with an application to seek access to export sheepmeat to South Korea should anticipated demand for Irish sheepmeat indicate this as priority. </p></reply>

This system is used to identify to which, of three separate categories, land is assigned; these categories are either Suitable Land (Grant and Premium Category 2-12), Suitable Land (Grant and Premium Category 1) or Unsuitable Land.  The second category, Suitable Land: Grant and Premium Category  1, is referred to as productive marginal land. Currently, the &lsquo;20% rule&rsquo; still applies.  This rule, introduced in 2010 for silvicultural and environmental reasons, stipulates that such land cannot exceed 20% of the total area of an afforestation application.  </p>  <p>  As it forms part of the Forestry Programme 2014-2020, my Department cannot unilaterally lift this restriction.

Following a public consultation process, it was further extended in 2012, and now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide.  The ban has proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels and has had the effect of significantly improving public health. Research indicates, for example, that the ban has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths in Dublin alone.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, monitoring has revealed that the air quality in some of our smaller towns in winter is worse than that in larger towns where the ban is in place.  Given the clear human health benefits, I am committed to extending the ban nationwide.  </p>  <p>  This process necessarily involves discussion and consultation with a wide number of stakeholders, including with the European Commission, relevant Government Departments and Agencies, the residential fuel industry, and the general public.  Discussions with many of these stakeholders on issues that may arise in connection with the proposed nationwide ban are underway.</p>  <p>My next step will be to introduce the specific legal measures to give effect to the ban over a twelve month period commencing in Autumn 2018.    </p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the local authority's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the relevant local authorities.</p>  <p>  The Department initiated a regional road bridge inspection programme in 2011 to assess the condition of bridges on the network and this has been followed up with a Bridge Rehabilitation Grant programme.  Under the Bridge Rehabilitation Grant scheme local authorities submit a list of bridges in order of priority for consideration for funding.  Within the constraints of the overall roads budget, allocations are made to local authorities for remedial bridge works.  Given the current spending constraints it is the Department's policy when grant applications are received from local authorities for bridge improvement works to prioritise rehabilitation works over widening projects and proposed new bridges. </p>  <p>  As regards higher cost bridge projects these have to be considered under the Specific Grant Programme.  This Grant Programme was curtailed significantly during the recession and while the Capital Plan 2016-2021 does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network it will take some years yet to reach the level required for the adequate maintenance and renewal of the network.  There is, therefore, limited scope at present for funding projects under the Specific Grant Programme. </p>  <p>  Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under this Programme will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, with particular consideration given to higher cost Bridge Rehabilitation Works, significant safety schemes and improvement works that promote employment.  All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and the Department&rsquo;s Capital Appraisal Framework and it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind. </p>  <p>  As regards Roosky bridge, Leitrim County Council wrote to the Department in January this year regarding the provision of funding for 4 bridges.  In its response the Department indicated that if any of these bridges were to be considered for funding under the Specific Grant programme the first step was for the Council to undertake a preliminary appraisal as required in the Department&rsquo;s Common Appraisal Framework for Transport Projects and Programmes.  A preliminary appraisal has not been submitted to date in relation to Roosky bridge.</p></reply>

Communities benefit from the skills and talents of local farmers and fishermen and participants have the opportunity to improve existing skills, or develop new skills, while performing this valuable work in their local communities. As part of the social welfare budget package for 2018, I am pleased to announce an additional 250 RSS places are being provided, increasing the total number of RSS participants from 3,100 to 3,350.</p><p>To be eligible to participate on the RSS, an individual must satisfy the qualifying criteria for the scheme and maintain an underlying entitlement to Farm/Fish Assist while participating on the scheme.  This ensures that only those in need of income support for their farming/fishing enterprise benefit from the scheme. In addition, the rate of payment to the participant can be reviewed at any stage to ensure that participants continue to receive their correct entitlement.  This practice has been in place since the commencement of the scheme and applies to all participants on the scheme regardless of their location.  </p><p><b>Table 1</b>gives a breakdown by county of the number of RSS participants at the 30<sup>th</sup>September, 2017 and a breakdown of the RSS reviews to date in 2017.  </p><p><b>Table 1</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>No. RSS participants at end Sept 2017</th><th>No. of Reviews in 2017 (Jan &ndash;30th Sept)</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>18</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>80</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>140</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>179</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>244</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>317</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>293</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>24</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>14</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>21</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>105</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>87</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>57</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>12</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>583</td><td>47</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>20</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>41</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>49</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>149</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>67</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>13</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>42</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>136</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>39</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>22</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>2752</td><td>169</td></tr></table></p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The conditions include progressing in the level of education held by the client with reference to the national framework of qualifications.Applicants holding a qualification at tertiary education level (certificate, diploma, primary degree or post graduate qualification) are not eligible under the BTEA to pursue a course at a similar or lower qualification level.  However, the BTEA may be approved if a person holds a level 8 Honours degree and wishes to pursue a Higher Diploma at Level 8 as this is considered progression.</p><p>There are a small number of situations where the progression rule is not applied.  For instance, where a person holds a Level 5 or Level 6, the progression rule can be waived if their previous qualification was obtained three years prior to re-entry into education.  The course must also be deemed to enhance a person&rsquo;s job prospects and the participant must satisfy all other eligibility criteria. </p><p>Additionally, Springboard is an initiative to enable jobseekers to upskill or reskill in areas where there are employment opportunities.  The BTEA can be approved for a person who holds a qualification equivalent to, or higher than, the qualification for which the BTEA application has been received for Springboard full-time courses.  For example, if a participant already holds a level 8 qualification, they may pursue a level 8 Springboard course.</p><p>Overall, it is important to note that the purpose of the BTEA is to raise educational and skill levels so as to improve a welfare recipient&rsquo;s employment prospects.  Progression in education is an important condition of the support provided.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

This has impacted on our urban streetscape, resulting in increased rates of commercial property vacancies.</p>  <p>  In recognition of this, the Programme for a Partnership Government, published in May 2016, set out the ambitious priority now attached to the area of urban renewal generally with a view to breathing life back into urban centres and helping to make them more attractive places in which to live and work.</p>  <p>  In this regard, a Ministerial-led Urban Renewal Working Group, which I chaired, was established to bring forward proposals for new urban regeneration measures in respect of which initial funding was announced in this week's Budget.  It is intended that the new scheme, details of which will be announced once finalised, will complement a range of other urban renewal related actions already underway including the existing regeneration programme under my Department's Social Housing Capital Programme.</p>  <p>  The renewal of Ireland's towns and villages is also the subject of focused attention under the Government's Action Plan for Rural Development, launched in January 2017, including an enhanced Town and Village Renewal Scheme in respect of which my colleague the Minister for Rural and Community Development last week announced increased funding for 2018, with a particular emphasis on stimulating economic development in rural towns and villages.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to examine reclassifying and incentivising the use of under-utilised or vacant premises in urban areas.  Specifically, Action 5.9 of of the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homlessness commits to reviewing planning legislation to allow the change of use of vacant commercial units in urban areas, including vacant or under-utilised areas over ground-floor premises, into residential units without having to go through the planning process.  This proposal is also incorporated in Action 6 of the Action Plan for Rural Development.  My Department is currently progressing the drafting of the necessary revisions to the Planning Regulations to give effect to this action and it is expected that draft Regulations will be submitted for Oireachtas approval by end-October 2017.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department has recently established a multi-disciplinary working group to prepare additional building control guidance for local authorities and the construction sector with a view to better facilitating the re-use or development of under-used or vacant buildings within the context of the existing building control regulatory requirements.</p></reply>

The Board may be contacted by phone at Lo call 1890 252842 or by email to<i><i>info@pyriteboard.ie</i></i>or alternatively at<i></i>.</p><p>In regard to the Testing and Categorisation Protocol, the Report of the Pyrite Panel (June 2012) recommended a categorisation system as a means of prioritising pyrite remediation works in recognition of the expensive and intrusive nature of pyrite remediation and the unpredictability of pyritic heave.  The independent Pyrite Panel was clear in its view that only dwellings with significant damage due to pyritic heave should be remediated and that it would be unreaso nable to expect dwellings not exhibiting such damage to be remediated.  Dwellings which have no significant damage but have reactive pyrite in the hardcore material should be monitored and only remediated if they display significant damage due to pyritic heave.  This remains the position with regard to dwellings which do not display significant pyritic damage.</p><p>On foot of this recommendation of the Pyrite Panel, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) published I.S. 398-1:2013 Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol in 2013.  The standard provides the means by which dwellings that may be affected by pyrite can be tested and categorised.</p><p>In late 2015, the National Standards Authority of Ireland commenced a review of I.S. 398-1:2013 in the light of practical experience since the standard was first introduced in January 2013.</p><p>The standard was updated and revised to reflect the on-site experiences and evidence gathered by technical experts, such as engineers, geologists, professionals providing sampling and testing services and other technical experts, who have been using the standard over the past four years and was published on 4 August 2017.</p><p>I welcome revised standards published by the NSAI.  In accordance with the provisions of the Act, I am currently in consultation with the Pyrite Resolution Board in relation to the revised standard. </p><p>My Department is in regular contact with the Pyrite Resolution Board and the Housing Agency with regard to the implementation of the scheme.  Any amendments which the Board consider are required to the scheme as a result of the revised standard will be given full consideration should they be submitted to me in accordance with the requirements of the Act. </p></reply>

This is based on a national survey of all lands zoned for residential or primarily residential development in statutory local authority development plans and local area plans across Ireland, to determine the location and quantity of lands that may be regarded as being undeveloped and available for primarily residential development purposes.  The Rebuilding Ireland map can be accessed at the following link<i><i>: .</i></i></p><p>While my Department does not hold specific data regarding the ownership of residential and commercial land, the Property Registration Authority records the names and addresses of every registered land owner.  The index is kept in respect of each county and can be accessed at<i><i>www.landdirect.ie. </i></i></p><p>Furthermore, information regarding the consideration paid and the details of the transfer of lands is maintained by the Revenue Commissioners from stamp duty returns filed relating to the transfer of land.</p><p>In the context of the current housing supply shortage, the Government recognises the pressing need to ensure that land, in urban areas in particular, that is suitable for the development of housing is not held back by developers.  A range of measures are being implemented under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan to ensure that such land is brought forward for development at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>The vacant site levy, provided for in the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, is designed to incentivise the development of vacant and under-utilised sites in urban areas for housing and regeneration purposes.  A 3% levy becomes liable for payment on such lands from January 2018.  As announced in Budget 2018, the 3% levy rate which applies in the first year of the vacant site appearing on the register will be increased to 7% in year 2 and subsequent years, resulting in an effective vacant site levy of 10% over the first two years.  Any levy outstanding will remain a charge on the land concerned until paid and therefore there will be a cumulative effect associated with not activating a site for development. </p><p>Furthermore, in order to address the issue of the hoarding of residentially zoned land, a number of amendments have been tabled in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016, which is currently at D&aacute;il Report Stage.  The amendments proposed are collectively aimed at tightening up existing provisions to ensure that extensions of duration of planning permissions cannot be granted where substantial development work has not been carried out during the initial life of the permission, with a particular focus on housing developments.</p><p>In addition, in relation to commercial land purchased for the development of housing, the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform signalled his intent to introduce a stamp duty refund scheme because of the housing supply challenge.  The refund will be subject to certain conditions, including a requirement that developers will have to commence the relevant development within 30 months of the land purchase.  The details in relation to this measure will be set out in the Finance Bill.</p><p>Rebuilding Ireland attaches a particular priority to using publicly owned lands for the delivery of housing as quickly as possible, supported by the acceleration in Exchequer-funded social housing and the delivery of more homes for sale and rent at lower and more affordable price points. All local authority housing sites and an initial set of broader State-owned sites have now been mapped and can be accessed at<i><font color="#2F2F2F">:</font></i></p><p><i><font color="#2F2F2F">.</font></i></p><p>Local authorities and the Housing Agency are now preparing strategic development plans for the prioritised development of these sites.</p></reply>

This is in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, the SEA Directive.  SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process. </p><p>It is envisaged that the SEA process will take approximately nine months and tendering to engage the necessary expertise to carry out that process is currently underway.  In light of the SEA requirements, it is expected that the revisions to the Guidelines will not be finalised and come into effect until 2018.  In the meantime, the current Guidelines remain in force. </p><p>When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities, and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts. </p><p>Under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is or may be concerned.  As a consequence, I cannot comment on any individual planning case.</p></reply>

Such reviews are intended to ensure that training syllabi remain efficient and effective.  As there is a level of turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Forces which is higher than the rest of the public service, targeted recruitment has been and is currently taking place so as to maintain the agreed strength levels.  The level of turnover also reflects that a significant number of personnel leave before the completion of basic training. In 2017, the Defence Forces have been targeting an increase in the level of recruitment across the range of recruitment streams.  A total of 99 Cadets were recently inducted (on the 25th September 2017) of which, just over 20% were female.  General Service recruitment campaigns for both the Army and Naval Service were launched earlier this year.  These competitions have progressed and general service recruitment has commenced from these campaigns. A further General Service recruitment campaign was launched in late September.   </p>  <p>  As with other areas of the public service, challenges have arisen in relation to the recruitment and retention of certain skilled personnel, including Pilots and Air Traffic Controllers.  This challenge was highlighted in the Department of Defence submission to the Public Service Pay Commission and can be considered when the Commission begins its next phase of work.   </p>  <p>  At the recent PDFORRA Annual Delegate Conference, I also announced a range of measures relating to contracts, promotions and other issues which had been identified within the Defence Forces Climate Survey.  The manpower requirement of the Defence Forces is monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with operational requirements. </p>  <p>  With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, the Government is committed to retaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.   </p></reply>
