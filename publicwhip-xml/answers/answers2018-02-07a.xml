They are working vigorously to enable companies to consolidate market share within the UK and also to become more resilient by broadening their sales to other international markets.  My Department provided for additional capital funding in 2017 to enable EI and the LEOs to ramp up its supports in light of Brexit to drive improvements in:</p><p>- productivity,</p><p>- innovation,</p><p>- management capability and leadership skills,</p><p>and really driving the ambition of managers to look to other markets around the world.</p><p>EI is driving competitiveness through a suite of supports that helps clients reduce supply-chain costs and increase efficiencies as a means of improving operating margins, building market share and creating new market opportunities.</p><p>Specific programmes introduced during 2017 have included;</p><p>- An online &lsquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rsquo; to help all Irish businesses self-assess their exposure to Brexit.  The Scorecard generates a report on weak areas and suggests initial next steps.  Almost 2000 companies have used the Scorecard by mid-December of 2017.</p><p>- A &lsquo;Prepare for Brexit&rsquo; online portal and communications campaign.</p><p>- An enhanced programme of trade and investment missions and other trade promotional events.</p><p>- A new Eurozone Strategy to increase exports to Eurozone countries by 50% by 2020.  This strategy aims to support companies to broaden their export footprint beyond the UK, and thereby improve economic resilience.</p><p>- A new &euro;5k &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; that supports the costs of SME clients in preparing a plan to mitigate risks and optimise opportunities arising from Brexit.</p><p>- Enterprise Ireland is hosting &ldquo;Prepare for Brexit&rdquo; breakfast roadshows nationally to engage with companies.</p><p>- Three new strategic communications campaigns launched to target separate elements of Brexit preparedness.  &lsquo;Global Ambition&rsquo; is aimed at encouraging companies to export; &lsquo;PrepareforBrexit&rsquo; highlights actions required by companies to improve resilience; and a new &lsquo;Irish Advantage&rsquo; campaign will target Eurozone buyers to buy Irish innovation in key Brexit impacted sectors.</p><p>This Brexit focus has continued into the 2018 plan.  In recent weeks, EI launched its new Market Discovery Fund to help more Irish companies accelerate their market diversification efforts.  </p><p>The challenge, and the opportunity, is to prime businesses with potential to become global players, resilient to challenges posed by Brexit and other market regulation, through superior quality products and services, management, innovation and marketing capability. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-02-07a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020700076#WRA01500"><p>This Government is strongly committed to regional development and my Department and its agencies are working towards ambitious targets to ensure that employment and investment are as evenly distributed as possible across the country.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland is focused on achieving the key development goals set out in its current strategy, including increasing investment by 30% to 40% in every region.  Real progress has been made towards that target over the first three years of this strategy with half of all jobs created by IDA client companies since 2015 based outside Dublin.  Just under 30,000 jobs have been created in the regions in three years and this shows us that real progress is being made towards increasing the regional spread of FDI all over our country.</p>  <p>  A key component of attracting potential multinational investors is the availability of IDA properties across all counties of Ireland.  If there were no available properties in the regions, IDA-owned or otherwise, it would significantly diminish the Agency&rsquo;s capacity to attract and win new investments. Overseas firms need to know that there are suitable sites and facilities in an area before they make a decision on where to locate.</p>  <p>  The IDA is directly investing in such sites and facilities to increase the attractiveness of regional locations for FDI.  The Agency&rsquo;s Regional Property Programme (RPP), as announced in 2015, committed &euro;150 million in Exchequer funding over five years to drive the growth of regional FDI by providing property solutions outside Dublin.  As well as upgrading existing facilities and acquiring strategic sites suitable for investment, this programme also includes the construction of nine new advance facilities around the country.  As part of the RPP advance buildings were constructed and completed in Athlone and Waterford in 2014 and early 2015. Last year IDA Ireland also completed buildings in Sligo, Tralee and Castlebar.  Buildings in Galway, Dundalk, Limerick, Athlone (2nd  build), Carlow and Waterford will be completed over the next two years.</p>  <p>  The level of interest by investors in these advance facilities has been very positive and clients have already been secured for the buildings in Athlone, Waterford and Sligo.  However, it is important to note that determining where a client locates depends very much on the particular requirements of the company concerned. Factors that are habitually important to overseas investors include the suitability of local infrastructure, the proximity of transport hubs and the availability of skilled talent. It is often the case as well that multinational companies seek to base themselves as close as possible to businesses operating in the same industry.</p></reply>

It should be noted that public funding for research is awarded according to the criteria set out in the various funding programmes operated by research funders irrespective of whether the research is basic or applied. </p>  <p>  Public funding for basic research comes from many sources, including through the block grant from the Department of Education and Skills through the Higher Education Authority.  The most recent survey of R&amp;D performed in the higher education sector (HERD survey published May 2017) shows that basic research accounted for 45.3% or &euro;331 million of R&amp;D performed in that sector in 2014.</p>  <p>  My Department and its agencies are important funders of research, with estimated expenditure of &euro;426m in 2017.  This accounts for approximately half of total Government investment in R&amp;D. Science Foundation Ireland, an agency of my Department, funds a significant amount of basic research.  Approximately 80%, or an estimated &euro;130 million, of Science Foundation Ireland&rsquo;s annual funding is committed to basic research projects which are aligned with the Government's  Research Priority areas.  Funding decisions are made through the international peer review on the basis of research excellence and impact. </p>  <p>  As an additional support to drive basic research in Ireland, Innovation 2020 committed to the development of a competitive fund to support qualified researchers undertake project-based frontier basic research.  In 2017, the Irish Research Council, an agency of the Department of Education and Skills, launched the Frontier Research Programme (LAUREATE), with initial funding of &euro;2.5 million.  Funding is awarded on the basis of the excellence of the research proposals and assessed through a rigorous and international peer-review process. </p></reply>

As the Government works to achieve balanced regional development, the LEO's will play a major role. The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; for providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and &lsquo;soft&rsquo; supports in the form of training and mentoring to anyone wishing to start or grow a business.  LEO Fingal continues to support enterprise and entrepreneurial development across the county through a substantial programme of initiatives and events. </p>  <p>  In 2017, LEO Fingal provided grants to the value of &euro;761,000 to 36 small businesses and it is expected that these financial supports will lead to the creation of 243 jobs within the next three years.</p>  <p>  LEO Fingal provides a range of management development programmes and business development initiatives on a collaborative basis with the other three LEOs in the Dublin region.</p>  <p>  Start Your Own Business&rsquo; (SYOB) programmes remained very strong in 2017. LEO Fingal provides a series of business and management development workshops to small and local businesses.  Business clinics are offered to individuals that wish to start up a new enterprise or expand their existing business and are provided by skilled mentors from the LEO mentor panel.</p>  <p>  Mentoring is a one to one professional business service, enabling small and start-up businesses to benefit from the expertise of a panel of business mentors.  Under the Trading Online Voucher scheme. 51 vouchers were approved in 2017 to the value of &euro;106,663.</p>  <p>  On 24 January 2018 Fingal was successful at the Dublin Regional Final of the Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur competition, scooping two of the three top prizes: Best Business Idea and Best Business Start-Up categories.</p>  <p>  A series of sectoral initiatives aimed at stimulating, supporting and developing the very important food sector in Fingal are ongoing. The Fingal final and awards event of the Student Enterprise Programme will take place on 22 March in the Crowne Plaza Hotel, Blanchardstown.  This is a National initiative aimed at developing an entrepreneurial culture by enabling second level school students to plan, start and run their own &ldquo;real-life&rdquo; mini-business.</p>  <p>  Local Enterprise Week commences on 5 March 2018 this year and will see a wide variety of events take place across Fingal and the region (20+).  Each year LEO Fingal brings together agencies and local business support organisations during Local Enterprise Week, running a very successful series of events.</p>  <p>  In addition to the LEO supports, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are working with Fingal County Council to develop a new business park in Balbriggan which is forecast to cater for 900 new jobs in the medium-term. </p></reply>

The Country continues to be an attractive location for businesses, as is evident in the IDA and EI job creation performance. Competitiveness is a cross government agenda.  It requires a focus on infrastructure, research, technology, innovation, education and skills as well as our fiscal regime.  </p>  <p>  My Department supports the work of the National Competitiveness Council (NCC) that identifies key challenges that affect our competitiveness.</p>  <p>  Recent global developments have placed a spotlight on the importance of competitiveness.  These developments relate not only to Brexit, but also to international tax, policy changes under the US administration and the unrelenting pace of technological change.</p>  <p>  There are now over 2.2 million people at work and our unemployment rate is down to 6.1%.  Total employment in IDA and EI supported companies has exceeded 400,000 with jobs being created throughout the country. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s improving competitiveness performance over the period 2011-2017 has been central to our strong employment growth.  In 2017, Ireland improved one place and is now ranked 6th out of 63 economies in the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook. </p>  <p>  However, we cannot be complacent.  We continue to face challenges.  The productivity performance of many of our Irish owned companies is weak.  They are facing a very different landscape as they deal with currency volatilities and the need to reduce exposure to the UK market in light of Brexit.</p>  <p>  My officials are finalising the review of Enterprise 2025.  This will place an increased emphasis on developing our Irish owned enterprises and embedding resilience.  We are already placing a spotlight on innovation and on skills.  The agencies continue to support firms with initiatives in Lean, RD and I, mentoring and training &ndash; initiatives that strengthen firm competitiveness.  Enterprise Ireland supports Irish companies to deepen their trading links with the UK and to diversify their export markets. Through IDA, we continue to attract new investments that deliver economic impact for Ireland.</p>  <p>  My officials have worked closely with the Department of Housing in shaping the National Planning Framework (NPF).  The alignment of the National Development Plan to the NPF is key to unlocking the potential of the regions and to strengthening the attractiveness of places throughout Ireland &ndash; for people to live and work in, and for business to invest in. </p>  <p>  My officials and the National Competitiveness Council will continue to focus on the competitiveness agenda. I intend to work closely with my Ministerial colleagues to develop and implement actions to enhance national competitiveness.</p></reply>

Louth.</p>  <p>  The Plan is stimulating job creation across the region, by facilitating collaborative initiatives between the public and private sector, and through the provision of new competitive funds, awarded through Enterprise Ireland to support regional enterprise projects. </p>  <p>  The core objective of the NE/NW Action Plan is to have a further 28,000 at work in the region by 2020.  A key objective of all of the Regional Plans is that unemployment in the regions lies no more than one percentage point above the  State average. </p>  <p>  Sectors targeted as part of the Border plan include traditionally strong sectors for the region like agrifood, manufacturing/engineering and tourism. </p>  <p>  The Local Authorities, enterprise agencies, and other key public and private sector stakeholders in Louth have been strongly involved in, and are key drivers of, the NE/NW Action Plan.</p>  <p>  Implementation of the Plan&rsquo;s 194 actions continues and is overseen and monitored by two Implementation Committees covering the North-West and the North-East regions which are composed of key regional stakeholders from both the private and public sector, and chaired by a regional enterprise champion.  Progress reports are showing an implementation rate of more than 90% across all of the actions.</p>  <p>  In terms of impact, 12,000 more people are in employment in the Border region from Q1 2015 (baseline year) to Q2 2017, representing good progress towards the target of 28,000 jobs by 2020 as set out in the Regional Action Plan.</p>  <p>  The latest regional CSO figures show a 6.5% unemployment rate for the Border region, which is lower than the State unemployment rate of 6.9% (as at Q3 2017).</p>  <p>  There has also been a remarkable improvement on the Live Register figures for County Louth. In January 2012, 17,745 people were in the Register compared to 9,016 in January 2018 &ndash; a drop of 49% over the last six years. </p>  <p>  The enterprise agencies continue their work to contribute towards the ambitious targets set out in the Regional Action Plan.  Enterprise Ireland recently announced a 5% employment growth in its client companies for County Louth, which now employ over 6,100 people.  On the FDI front, the number of IDA-backed jobs grew by 4% as a whole last year, with almost 12,500 people employed in IDA companies across the Border region. </p>  <p>  Through partnership between Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authority in Louth, the Local Enterprise Office (LEO) supported 231 small and micro-businesses employing over 780 people in the County during 2016.  LEO Louth continues to play a vital role in providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports to those wishing to start or grow their own businesses in Co. Louth. Results for 2017 are expected to be published shortly.</p>  <p>  Of course, the Regional Action Plans on their own are not sufficient.  They are being complemented by other programmes that the Government is working on at national level, including the national Action Plan for Jobs, the Action Plan for Rural Development, Regional Skills for a, and the forthcoming National Planning Framework.</p>  <p>  Finally, I look forward to launching a second call for projects under the Enterprise Ireland Regional Enterprise Development Fund in March which will make available the remainder of the &euro;60 million in funding to support enterprise capability in the regions following the initial allocation of up to &euro;30.5 million across 21 projects nationwide in December 2017. </p></reply>

All reports show that good progress is being made in the Mid- East region with an implementation rate of over 90% across all of the actions.  </p>  <p>  The efforts by the stakeholders and businesses in the region are paying off: there are now 19,300 more people at work across Meath, Kildare, and Wicklow since the launch of the Regional Action Plan initiative in Q1 2015.  This represents very good progress towards the 25,000 additional employment target to 2020 as set out in the Plan.</p>  <p>  The latest figures from the CSO show that the Mid East has an unemployment rate of 6.2%, the lowest in the State and below the average for the State (in Q3 2017).</p>  <p>  The enterprise agencies in particular are working very hard towards the ambitious targets set out in the Plan for the Mid-East.  In 2017, Enterprise Ireland client companies increased employment by 4% in the region, and now employ over 20,500 people in total. </p>  <p>  IDA have also recently announced that FDI-related jobs across the region have grown by 6% in the last year, with over 101,000 people employed in IDA client companies in the Mid-East and Dublin region.</p>  <p>  Through partnership with Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities, the Local Enterprise Offices (LEO) in Meath, Kildare and Wicklow supported 475 small and micro-businesses employing over 2,500 people in the Mid-East region during 2016.  The LEOs continue to play a vital role in providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports to those wishing to start or grow their own businesses in the region. Results for the LEOs in 2017 will be published shortly.</p>  <p>  To further support enterprise development across all regions, additional funding of up to &euro;60m is being rolled out by Enterprise Ireland over the next 4 years to support the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level.  This regional competitive fund will support the ambition, goals and implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs.  The results of Call 1 were announced in December 2017 with up to &euro;30.5 million allocated towards 21 projects from all around the country.  Co. Kildare Community Network Company CLG was one of the successful applicants under the competitive fund under Stream 2 (&euro;250k to &euro;2m) for their MERITS project (Mid East Regional Innovation Think Space).</p>  <p>  Since 2015, The Regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative has been a central pillar of the Government&rsquo;s ambition to create 200,000 new jobs by 2020, with 135,000 of these jobs to be located outside of Dublin. Building on the strong progress that has been recorded to date in the Mid-East region is a key priority for me, and officials from my Department are engaged with all of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs Committees with a view to continuing and refining their work to realise the employment targets focused on the period to 2020.</p></reply>

A key objective of each of the 8 regional plans is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the unemployment rate of each region not more than one percentage point greater than the national average.</p>  <p>  The Midlands Regional Action Plan for Jobs was launched in June 2015, and is the key policy response for supporting employment growth in the region.  It includes a series of practical actions to support enterprise growth and job creation in the region, within clear timelines for delivery.  The Action Plans seek to capitalise on the particular strengths and opportunities of the region and has been developed by my Department, with the support of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, in close consultation with regional stakeholders from the public and private sectors.  </p>  <p>  A central aim of the regional Action Plans for Jobs is to champion the concept of regional collaboration from the &lsquo;ground up&rsquo; to achieve sustainable competitive advantage in the region that grows jobs and enterprises.</p>  <p>  There has been very good progress in the Midlands region in terms of employment creation since Q1 2015 with some 9,500 more people in employment up to Q2 2017.  This is against an overall target of 14,000 additional jobs by 2020 as set out in the Midlands Plan.</p>  <p>  While Live Register numbers have fallen in all four Midland counties in the past 12 months, CSO figures show that the unemployment rate in the Midlands is currently at 9.3% (Q3 2017), which places the region in a small group of those (including the South-East and Mid-West) whose unemployment rates are more than one percentage point higher than the State average. </p>  <p>  This is too high, especially since the Q3 2017 State average is 6.9%, and underlines the importance of retaining a focus on regional enterprise development and job creation in the Midlands.</p>  <p>  Importantly, the Midlands Plan has been embraced within the region and the Enterprise Agencies are working hard to drive local job creation and contribute to the job creation targets set out in the Plan. </p>  <p>  In 2017, both Enterprise Ireland and IDA reported job increases in the Midlands of 6% and 1% respectively.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Midland clients employed almost 12,500 people in the region in 2017 and County Westmeath enjoyed a 7% growth, the 7th highest in the country with 3,741 people now employed in the county.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices operating under the auspices of the Local Authorities and Enterprise Ireland in Laois, Offaly, Longford and Westmeath continue to play a vital role in providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports to those wishing to start or grow their own businesses in the region.  LEO Westmeath employed 1,375 people, an increase of 7% since 2014. Results for 2017 are expected to be published shortly.</p>  <p>  In December last year, I announced an allocation of &euro;30.5 million in funding to support enterprise capability in the regions, with 21 projects from all over the country receiving funding.  This Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) totalling &euro;60 million is being rolled out by Enterprise Ireland over the next 4 years to support the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level.  The Fund supports the ambition, goals and implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs.</p>  <p>  The Irish Manufacturing Research CLG project located in Mullingar was one of the significant funding recipients under Stream 1 of the REDF, which will be an important support to manufacturing activity in Westmeath and indeed, the Midlands region.  In addition, Longford is a partner in a Stream 2 project to develop a network of three Digital and Innovation Hubs with Leitrim and Cavan.</p>  <p>  I look forward to launching a second call under the REDF in March this year, which will make available the remainder of the &euro;60 million.</p>  <p>  My priority is to continue to work with stakeholders collectively within the Midlands to build on the progress to date on implementation of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs over the period to 2020, and to focus on leveraging the key strengths of the region. </p>  <p>  Finally, my Department is also working closely with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in relation to the National Planning Framework and development of Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies, and with the Department of Rural and Community Development on roll-out of the Action Plan for Rural Development. </p></reply>

It is key to maintaining competitiveness for Ireland in global markets, and for providing jobs and sustainable growth in our economy. </p><p>Supporting innovation is therefore a key pillar of Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise and innovation policy.  Innovation 2020, Ireland&rsquo;s cross-governmental strategy for Research and Development, Science and Technology, is based on a shared vision of Ireland becoming a Global Innovation Leader, driving a strong, sustainable, high employment economy and a better society. </p><p>The Strategy aims to build on the significant successes to date which have seen Ireland dramatically improve its innovation performance globally. Goals include:</p><p>- a strong, innovative and internationally competitive enterprise base, growing employment, sales and exports;</p><p>- a coherent, joined-up innovation ecosystem, responsive to emerging opportunities, delivering enhanced impact through the creation and application of knowledge; and</p><p>- an internationally competitive research system that acts as a magnet and catalyst for talent and industry.</p><p>The Innovation 2020 strategy also recognises the importance of the manufacturing and services sectors to Ireland&rsquo;s economy and the need to further develop the national ecosystem of research and technology centres in key areas including that of manufacturing.  </p><p>The 2nd Progress Report on the implementation of Innovation 2020 has been agreed by a cross-Departmental Implementation Group and outlines the advances made on strategic actions in the period to end June 2017. </p><p>Highlights include:</p><p>- Four new Science Foundation Ireland Research Centres announced</p><p>- A new Enterprise Ireland/IDA Ireland Meat Technology Centre launched;</p><p>- Three new Technology Gateways added to the national network;</p><p>- &euro;424m secured under Horizon 2020, the EU Framework Programme for R and D; and</p><p>- The launch by Knowledge Transfer Ireland of a further Technology Transfer Strengthening Initiative to further embed knowledge transfer within the public research system.</p><p>Significant investments are also being made in Manufacturing Research and Innovation, through Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland. </p><p>Two of the four new SFI Research Centres established have a specific manufacturing focus.  The SFI CONFIRM Centre will focus on smart manufacturing involving convergence of IT and industrial automation systems; while the SFI I-FORM Centre will concentrate on additive manufacturing.  </p><p>Last year also saw the official launch of the Enterprise Ireland/IDA Ireland Irish Manufacturing Research (IMR) Technology Centre.  IMR is a one-stop-shop where manufacturing companies - both multinational and indigenous - can collaborate to solve big manufacturing challenges in partnership with the researchers in Ireland and the EU.</p><p>Separately, under my Department&rsquo;s Regional Enterprise Development Fund allocations which were announced at the end of last year, we have made a further investment in the IMR Centre, in Mullingar, to ensure we can stay at the forefront of new 3D and additive manufacturing innovation. </p><p>The IMR Centre is a member of EARTO (the European Association of Research Technology Organisations) and is currently leading several European advanced manufacturing initiatives.  The Centre is also a key contact point for Irish companies seeking to connect with European manufacturing research for knowledge, expertise and project funding opportunities.  To date the IMR Centre has assisted companies connect and win projects and funding in a range of European mechanisms and networks. </p></reply>

While article 40 of the Irish Constitution guarantees the right of citizens to form associations and unions it has been established in a number of legal cases that the constitutional guarantee of the freedom of association does not guarantee workers the right to have their union recognised for the purpose of collective bargaining.  </p>  <p>  I can assure you however that it has been the consistent policy of successive Irish Governments to promote collective bargaining through the laws of this country and through the development of an institutional framework based on a voluntary system of industrial relations with freedom of contract and freedom of association at its core.  There is an extensive range of statutory provisions supporting this framework. </p>  <p>  Arising from an earlier Government commitment to bring Irish law on employees&rsquo; right to engage in collective bargaining into line with decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act was introduced in August 2015.  In the lead in to the enactment of this legislation, an in-depth consultation process with stakeholders, including employer and worker representatives, took place.</p>  <p>  This legislation provides an improved framework in relation to the right of employees to engage in collective bargaining together with a clear and balanced mechanism by which the fairness of the employment conditions of workers in their totality can be assessed where collective bargaining does not take place. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, and in addition to the improved framework provided for in the 2015 Act, the statutory Code of Practice on Victimisation was enhanced in October 2015 to include an explicit prohibition on the use by employers of inducements (financial or otherwise) designed specifically to have staff forego collective representation by a trade union.</p>  <p>  The introduction of the 2015 Act, combined with the Code of Practice on Victimisation, provide strong protections in the area of collective bargaining in this country. </p></reply>

It requires a focus on, inter alia, infrastructure, research, technology, innovation, education and skills as well as our fiscal regime.  </p>  <p>  My Department supports the work of the National Competitiveness Council (NCC) in the identification and analysis of key challenges that affect our competitiveness.</p>  <p>  Recent global developments have placed a spotlight on the importance of competitiveness.  These developments relate not only to Brexit, but also to international tax, policy changes under the US administration and the unrelenting pace of technological change.</p>  <p>  There are now over 2.2 million people at work and our unemployment rate is down to 6.1%.  Total employment in IDA and EI supported companies has exceeded 400,000 with jobs being created throughout the country. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s improving competitiveness performance over the period 2011-2017 has been central to our strong employment growth.  In 2017, Ireland improved one place and is now ranked 6th out of 63 economies in the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook. </p>  <p>  However, we cannot be complacent.  We continue to face challenges.  The productivity performance of many of our Irish owned companies is weak.  These companies are facing a very different landscape as they deal with currency volatilities and the need to reduce exposure to the UK market in light of Brexit.</p>  <p>  My officials are finalising the review of Enterprise 2025.  This will place an increased emphasis on developing our Irish owned enterprises and embedding resilience.  We are already placing a spotlight on innovation and on skills.  The agencies continue to support firms with initiatives in Lean, RD and I, mentoring and training &ndash; initiatives that strengthen firm competitiveness.  Enterprise Ireland supports Irish companies to deepen their trading links with the UK and to diversify their export markets.  Through IDA, we continue to attract new investments that deliver economic impact for Ireland.</p>  <p>  My officials have worked closely with the Department of Housing in shaping the National Planning Framework (NPF).  The alignment of the National Development Plan to the NPF is key to unlocking the potential of the regions and to strengthening the attractiveness of places throughout Ireland &ndash; for people to live and work in, and for business to invest in. </p>  <p>  My officials and the National Competitiveness Council will continue to focus on the competitiveness agenda.  I intend to work closely with my Ministerial colleagues to develop and implement actions to enhance national competitiveness.</p></reply>

Furthermore, the atypical work permission scheme established following the 2015 Government Task Force Report on EEA workers in the Irish fishing fleet, is administered by the Department of Justice and Equality and the Irish National Immigration Service (INIS) on behalf of that Department.</p>  <p>  As regards the monitoring and enforcement of the atypical scheme for non-EEA fishers, it should be noted that a number of Departments and State agencies are involved.  These include An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, INIS, the Marine Survey Office of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Naval Service, the Revenue Commissioners, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, the Health and Safety Authority (HSA), the Workplace Relations Commission and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. </p>  <p>  While the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, are under the remit of my Department, they are independent in the conduct of their statutory functions.  The WRC&rsquo;s responsibilities relate to the enforcement of the Employment Permits Acts and employment rights legislation generally, including minimum wage legislation.  The HSA is the enforcement agency under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and conducts inspections under health and safety legislation at all places of work, including fishing vessels while docked in harbour.  It does not carry out inspections of fishing vessels at sea even when operating within Irish territorial waters. </p>  <p>  The Marine Survey Office under the aegis of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has lead responsibility for fishing vessel safety, security and living and working conditions for the crew on board seagoing vessels.  It is responsible for enforcing legislation in this context for seafarers and fishing vessel crew. </p>  <p>  In response to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific enquiries, it will be clear from the explanation provided that health and safety falls outside the remit of the WRC so the issue of resources at the WRC does not arise.  Responsibility in this area rests with the Health and Safety Authority (HSA), an agency under the aegis of my department.  In relation to the recent unfortunate accident involving a non-EEA national on a fishing vessel, it is my understanding that the HSA is conducting an investigation into the circumstances of this incident in line with its remit under workplace health and safety legislation.  </p>  <p>  On the separate issue raised by the deputy of adequate training for WRC Inspectors to carry out inspections on fishing vessels, I can confirm to the Deputy that 9 Inspectors as well as a Regional Manager of the WRC completed comprehensive training in this regard.  This was delivered by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara on safety at sea and sea survival techniques, including fire-fighting and first aid.  This training was a prerequisite to the deployment of WRC Inspectors for on-board inspections and operations at ports and landing places as the WRC, like the HSA, does not undertake inspections at sea.</p>  <p>  As regards the rate of inspections by the WRC since the atypical scheme commenced, the position is that WRC Inspectors have not traditionally had an active presence in the enforcement of employment rights and employment permits legislation in the fishing industry given the low incidence of employees in the sector, as opposed to fishers that are self-employed.  Some 181 vessels on the Irish Fishing Vessel Register come within the scope of the atypical Worker Permission Scheme, with 174 of these vessels being active or operational.  165 of these vessels have, to date been inspected by the WRC and it is the intention, in the context of inspection activity more generally, to complete inspections of the remaining 9 vessels.  In total, some 240 inspections of these vessels were undertaken by the WRC in the period July 2016 to 31 December 2017. </p>  <p>  Insofar as compliance levels are concerned, 202 contraventions of employment rights and/or employment permits legislation were detected by WRC Inspectors in the period to the end of 2017: 29 or 14% of these contraventions relate to non-EEA fishers not having permission to work in the State.  The core requirement under the atypical Scheme is for non-EEA fishers to have a letter of permission from INIS to work on a specific vessel or vessels.  Other contraventions detected by WRC Inspectors include failure to keep records (35%), a failure to grant Public Holiday, Sunday Working and Annual Leave entitlements (19%) and failure to issue payslips (12%).  Contraventions were detected in some 112 of the 181 vessels coming within the scope of the Scheme.</p></reply>

I am confident that the agencies under my Department have the supports to enable companies to consolidate market share within the UK and also to become more resilient by broadening their sales to other international markets.  Enterprise Ireland (EI) and the LEOs are actively supporting their clients to achieve this.  My Department provided for additional monies in 2017 to enable EI and the LEOs to ramp up its supports in light of Brexit to drive improvements in:</p><p>- productivity,</p><p>- innovation,</p><p>- management capability and leadership skills,</p><p>and really driving the ambition of managers to look to other markets around the world.</p><p>At the centre of EI&rsquo;s strategy, Build Scale, Expand Reach 2017 &ndash; 2020, are strategic targets focused on:</p><p>- Assisting clients to  create 60,000 new jobs by 2020 while sustaining the existing record level of jobs;</p><p>- Growing the annual exports  of client companies by &euro;5bn to &euro;26bn per annum;</p><p>- Increasing the level of  spend made by client companies in the Irish economy by &euro;4bn to &euro;27bn per annum by 2020; and</p><p>- Inspiring more Irish owned companies to have global ambition.</p><p>In support of this, EI is implementing extensive trade mission and event schedules focussed on global and sectoral opportunities, further developing in-market expertise and networks, placing greater focus on identifying new sectoral opportunities and stimulating demand for Irish products and services through international marketing campaigns.  In 2017, EI launched a new Eurozone Strategy to increase exports to Eurozone countries by 50% by 2020. </p><p>The first year of the Strategy was a very strong year for job creation among EI clients with over 19,300 new jobs created in 2017, resulting in a net gain of 10,309 jobs across the country.  In 2017 EI supported companies employed 209,338 people. 65 % of client employment is outside of Dublin.</p><p>We are seeing growth in traditional industry sectors such as construction and manufacturing as well as in the Digital technology and LifeSciences sectors. </p><p>The Local Enterprise Offices are supporting their clients by providing information, training and mentoring on Brexit related issues as well as advice on other sources of support.  LEO&rsquo;s 2017 results are expected to be available in early March.</p><p>To support the eight Regional Action Plans, and as part of the Government&rsquo;s strategic response to Brexit, additional funding of up to &euro;60m is being rolled out by EI over the next 4 years.  The Regional Enterprise Development Fund will support the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level.  Twenty-one successful applicants representing all regions of the country have secured up to &euro;30.5m for their projects in the first competitive call.  The second call is planned to be launched by EI in March 2018. </p><p>A key priority of mine is to ensure that this Government remains true to our export led growth policies.  We will continue to support start-ups and ambitious companies across the country and help them scale faster through the work of the Local Enterprise Offices and Enterprise Ireland.  I will keep a focus on regional initiatives and on building strength and resilience among existing exporting companies and also on broadening the exporting base by doing all we can to get Irish companies the supports they need to get exporting and thereby create sustainable quality jobs.</p></reply>

These supports are aimed at strengthening the capacity of micro and small businesses to cope with the changing external environment, especially the impacts arising from Brexit.  The supports include grants to assist LEO clients in diversifying their markets, targeted training and mentoring to address Brexit-related challenges and opportunities, as well as a Lean for Micro programme to help micro-enterprises to address competitive issues within their businesses.  These supports are available throughout the country.</p>  <p>  In addition, the six LEOs in the Border region are working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme.  The aim of Co-Innovate is to give SMEs from the manufacturing and tradeable services sectors in the eligible regions the tools and tailored support to help them to innovate, differentiate and compete successfully. </p>  <p>  In 2017 209,338 people were employed at Enterprise Ireland supported companies with Louth seeing a 5% increase on the 2016 figure.</p>  <p>  Economic shocks, such as Brexit, places companies in the Border Region, whether exporting or not, in an area of uncertainty.  It will drive companies to focus on increasing their competitiveness, innovative capability and product differentiation in parallel with targeting new export markets.</p>  <p>  Activities currently being undertaken by Enterprise Ireland to ensure that client companies are resilient and agile include the following:</p>  <p>  - Enterprise Ireland launched a new Market Discovery Fund to incentivise companies to research viable and sustainable market entry strategies in new geographic markets.  This fund provides support towards internal and external costs incurred when researching new markets for products and services.</p>  <p>  - Enterprise Ireland is working with its clients in the Border Region to drive to innovation activity via a number of supports that enable companies to diagnose their innovation readiness; that provides financial support for in-house R&amp;D projects and also to foster collaborations between the research expertise within the Higher Education Sector and companies.</p>  <p>  - Competitiveness is critical for companies to scale and internationalise.  Enterprise Ireland is working with companies to identify and measure competitiveness issues and to support companies by providing access to a range of competitiveness building tools, including the Company Competitiveness Health Check, the Lean Offer and Green Offer.   </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland initiatives specifically aimed at mitigating the effects of Brexit include:</p>  <p>  - The &lsquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rsquo;, an interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars.  1,909 companies have used this Scorecard as of mid-December 2017.</p>  <p>  - The Be Prepared Grant, which supports the costs of SME clients in preparing a plan to mitigate risks and optimise opportunities arising from Brexit.  This grant can be used to help cover consultancy, travel and out of pocket expenses associated with researching the direction of their Brexit action plan.</p>  <p>  - National Prepare for Brexit Breakfast Roadshows are taking place, engaging with companies throughout the country on preparing for Brexit.</p>  <p>  - The launch of an in-market Irish Advantage campaign promoting Irish companies to buyers in key markets and sectors. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland is aware that further efforts are needed to ensure that companies in the Border Region are resilient to economic shocks, such as Brexit.  To this end, the agency will continue to work with companies from the region to drive their innovation, competitiveness, internationalisation and Brexit preparedness.</p></reply>

These vacancies arose in respect of posts identified as a result of the additional &euro;3 million that was secured in Budget 2017.  I have set out the specific updates in respect of each separate body as follows:</p><p><b>Department</b></p><p>With regard to my own Department and the Brexit Unit, there has been an increase in staffing of one Assistant Principal and one Higher Executive Officer since the question was last raised in October 2017.  The dedicated Brexit Unit continues to be led by an Assistant Secretary, and is now supported by a staff compliment of seven (one Principal Officer, three Assistant Principals, two Higher Executive Officer and one Clerical Officer).</p><p>In addition to this, the work of very many Business Units within my Department and our Agencies are impacted by Brexit.  We are prioritising the Brexit challenges and will actively keep the staffing requirements under review through workforce planning. </p><p><b>Enterprise Ireland </b></p><p>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s exchequer pay provision for 2017 included an additional &euro;1.7 million to assist in the recruitment of an additional 39 Brexit specific posts. 3 6 of these posts have been filled to date and 3 are currently under active recruitment.  </p><p><b>IDA</b></p><p>The IDA identified an additional 10 client-facing posts, in respect of the additional &euro;750,000 it was allocated in 2017.  They have filled all of these posts after a rigorous recruitment process across a wide variety of channels.</p><p><b>Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)</b></p><p>SFI have filled three posts which have Brexit related activities attached to their roles, as a result of the additional &euro;150,000 allocated to them in 2017.  These successful applicants commenced their positions in November and December (2017), and in January (2018). </p><p><b>Health and Safety Authority</b></p><p>My Department provided an additional &euro;150,000 to the HSA in 2017, in respect of the recruitment of three specific Brexit related posts. I understand from the HSA that the initial recruitment campaign did not result in the successful filling of the first two of these posts (Grade III inspector and a Socio-Economist). Consequently, a new recruitment campaign was launched in early December for the filling of both posts with a closing date of 10 January 2018.  Shortlisting of applicants is now complete and preliminary interviews are being held on 8 February in relation to the Grade III Inspector post.  As regards the Socio-Economic post, the response rate was very low and unfortunately no suitable candidates were identified from the shortlisting process.  The HSA will review its position over the coming weeks and consider how best to market this post so as to attract suitable candidates. </p><p>Recruitment planning is underway for a third post (Grade II Brexit related Accreditation Officer) that was sanction in December 2017. The HSA hope to advertise this post within the next fortnight.  <b></b></p><p><b>2018</b></p><p>A further &euro;3 million in respect of Pay has been secured for my Department in Budget 2018, for the purposes of recruiting additional staff resources to further respond to Brexit and help meet the Government plans to double Ireland's global footprint. </p></reply>

As you are aware, my colleague Michael Ring, Minister for Rural &amp;amp; Community Development has policy responsibility in relation to the Western Development Commission.</p>  <p>  Enterprise development and job creation in the regions of Ireland is a key policy priority of this Government and my Department has been actively engaged in the regional jobs agenda through the Regional Action Plan for Jobs (RAPJ) initiative for the past two years.</p>  <p>  In addition, in December last year I announced an allocation of &euro;30.5 million in funding to support enterprise capability in the regions, with 21 projects from all over the country receiving funding.  This Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) totalling &euro;60 million is being rolled out by Enterprise Ireland over the next 4 years to support the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level.  The Fund supports the ambition, goals and implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs.</p>  <p>  The Irish Manufacturing Research CLG project located in Mullingar was one of the significant funding recipients under Stream 1 of the REDF, which will be an important support to manufacturing activity in the Midlands region.  In addition, Longford is a partner in a  Stream 2 project to develop a network of three Digital and Innovation Hubs with Leitrim and Cavan.</p>  <p>  I look forward to launching a second competitive call under the REDF in March this year, which will make available the remainder of the &euro;60 million.</p>  <p>  The Regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative is a central pillar of the Government&rsquo;s ambition to create 200,000 new jobs by 2020, 135,000 of which are outside of Dublin.  The Midlands Regional Action Plan for Jobs was launched in June 2015, one of a series of eight Regional Plans, and is the key policy response for supporting employment growth in the region.  </p>  <p>  Some 9,500 more people are in employment in the Midlands region since Q1 2015 (baseline year) to Q2 2017, representing very good progress against the target of 14,000 jobs by 2020 as set out in the Midlands Plan.</p>  <p>  Live Register numbers have fallen in all four Midland counties in the past 12 months.  However, CSO figures show that the unemployment rate in the Midlands is currently at 9.3% (Q3 2017), which places the Midlands in a small group of those (including the South-East and Mid-West) whose unemployment rates are more than one percentage point higher than the State average.  This is too high, especially since the Q3 2017 State average is 6.9%, and underlines the importance of retaining a focus on regional enterprise development and job creation in the Midlands.</p>  <p>  Importantly, the Midlands Plan has been embraced within the region and the Enterprise Agencies are working hard to drive local job creation and contribute to the job creation targets set out in the Plan.  In 2017, both Enterprise Ireland and IDA reported job increases in the Midlands of 6% and 1% respectively. </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices operating under the auspices of the Local Authorities and Enterprise Ireland in Laois, Offaly, Longford and Westmeath continue to play a vital role in providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports to those wishing to start or grow their own businesses in the region.  In 2016 client companies of the four Midlands LEOs collectively added 327 new jobs, bringing total LEO supported employment in the region to 3,842.  Results for 2017 are expected to be published shortly.</p>  <p>  My priority is to continue to work with stakeholders collectively within the Midlands to build on the progress to date on implementation of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs over the period to 2020, and to focus on leveraging the key strengths of the region.  My Department is also working closely with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in relation to the National Planning Framework and development of Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies, and with the Department of Rural and Community Development on roll out of the Action Plan for Rural Development. </p>  <p>  Against that backdrop and the collaborative efforts continuing in the Midlands under the RAPJ, I have no plans to replicate the WDC model or establish a task force in the Midlands region, nor am I aware of any such plans.</p></reply>

The LEOs are the first port of call for anyone who wishes to start or expand a business, in terms of advice, training, sign posting to other support providers and, in certain circumstances, grant support.  The LEOs undertake a number of activities to encourage businesses to build their online presence and compete in the online market place.</p>  <p>  The LEOs nationwide actively promote the Trading Online Voucher Scheme (TOVS) on behalf of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The TOVS offers matched financial assistance of up to &euro;2,500, along with training and advice, to micro companies (10 or less employees) who want to establish an online presence for the first time, or who wish to expand a basic existing website to incorporate a more substantive online trading capacity.  Since the start of the scheme in July 2014 to date almost 3,000 micro companies have availed of the TOVS.</p>  <p>  The LEOs also offer a wide range of short training programmes to support their clients in building their online presence and to compete in the online marketplace.  These programmes are focused on different elements which aim at maximising outputs from investment in online trading such as :</p>  <p>  - Marketing, focused mainly on development of an online/mobile marketing strategy;</p>  <p>  - Social Media, with the majority of programmes focused on educating the client base on how to use the different social media platforms to support their business;</p>  <p>  - eCommerce Sales Strategy, including how to convert website visits into sales; and</p>  <p>  - Search Engine Optimisation, including web analytics and video optimisation for web.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) works with 5,000 manufacturing and internationally traded services companies, and building an online presence is part of the range of supports offered to those clients.  EI has supported projects focused on developing innovative products on new product platforms for international markets.  However, EI cannot support companies whose only function is in the area of sales/distribution.</p>  <p>  Working closely with the Irish Internet Association, EI delivers a range of funded and advisory eCommerce supports for its clients to develop their online marketing capabilities, for example:</p>  <p>  - &lsquo;Marketing Funding Support&rsquo;: under a Business Process Improvement Grant client companies can apply for grant support to plan and implement significant strategic e-marketing projects.</p>  <p>  - &lsquo;Measuring your Internet Marketing Maturity&rsquo;: to help clients develop an understanding of their web presence and activity.</p>  <p>  EI regularly organises events which can connect clients with leading experts and inform them on best practice.  Topics covered include Developing an Online Strategy; Online Localisation for International Markets; Search Engine Optimisation; Pay Per Click Marketing; Branding and Getting the Web Content Right.</p>  <p>  EI also offers an Excel @ Export Selling Workshop Series which includes creating a digital marketing strategy.  This workshop is aimed at senior management executives with responsibility for selling high value products and services into business-to-business markets.</p>  <p>  Finally, one of the key challenges identified by members of the Retail Consultation Forum which I chair is developing digital capacity across the retail sector.  As set out in the 2017 Action Plan for Jobs, a pilot scheme to support retailers to scale up their online trading activity and expand into international markets is currently being developed.  This initiative is being driven by DBEI, working with members of the Retail Consultation Forum.</p></reply>

A key objective of each of the 8 regional plans is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the unemployment rate of each region not more than one percentage point greater than the national average.</p>  <p>  The North-East/North-West Regional Action Plan for Jobs is the key policy response for supporting employment growth in the Border region.  It includes a series of practical actions to support enterprise growth and job creation in the region, with clear timelines for delivery.  The Action Plans seek to capitalise on the particular strengths and opportunities of the region and has been developed by my Department, with the support of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, in close consultation with regional stakeholders from the public and private sectors.  </p>  <p>  A central aim of the regional Action Plans for Jobs is to champion the concept of regional collaboration from the &lsquo;ground up&rsquo; to achieve sustainable competitive advantage in the region that grows jobs and enterprises.  The Local Authorities, enterprise agencies, and other key public and private sector stakeholders across counties Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth have been strongly involved in, and are key drivers of, the NE/NW Action Plan.</p>  <p>  The core objective of the NE/NW Action Plan is to have a further 28,000 at work in the region by 2020.  The Plan aims to stimulate job creation across the region, by facilitating collaborative initiatives between the public and private sector, and through the provision of new competitive funds, awarded through Enterprise Ireland to support regional enterprise projects. </p>  <p>  Sectors targeted as part of the Border plan include traditionally strong sectors for the region like agrifood, manufacturing/engineering and tourism. </p>  <p>  Implementation of the Plan&rsquo;s 194 actions continues and is overseen and monitored by two Implementation Committees covering the North-West and the North-East regions which are composed of key regional stakeholders from both the private and public sector, and chaired by a regional enterprise champion. </p>  <p>  Importantly, the Plan has been embraced within the regions and over 90% of the Plan&rsquo;s actions are on track to be delivered or have been completed.  The Progress reports are available at www.regionalapj.ie.</p>  <p>  In terms of impact, 12,000 more people are in employment in the Border region from Q1 2015 (baseline year) to Q2 2017, representing good progress towards the target of 28,000 jobs by 2020 as set out in the Regional Action Plan.</p>  <p>  In December last year I announced an allocation of &euro;30.5 million in funding to support enterprise capability in the regions, with 21 projects from all over the country receiving funding.

Leitrim); a new Digital Innovation Hub and enterprise capacity building programme in Co. Donegal; and a Regional Food Centre of Excellence in Co. Monaghan.  I look forward to launching a second competitive call for projects under the Enterprise Ireland Regional Enterprise Development Fund in March this year, which will make available the remainder of the &euro;60 million in funding to support enterprise capability in the regions following the initial allocation under Call 1. </p>  <p>  The enterprise agencies continue their work to contribute towards the ambitious targets set out in the Regional Action Plan.  Enterprise Ireland recently announced a 4% employment growth in its client companies for the Border region, which now employ almost 11,500 people.  On the FDI front, the number of IDA-backed jobs grew by 4% as a whole last year, with almost 12,500 people employed in IDA companies in the region. </p>  <p>  Through partnership between Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities, the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) supported 1,152 small and micro-businesses employing over 5,720 people in the Border region during 2016.

A key objective of each of the 8 regional plans is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the unemployment rate of each region not more than one percentage point greater than the national average.</p>  <p>  The South East Action Plan for Jobs is a key policy response for supporting employment growth in the South East, with public and private stakeholders currently engaged in driving the range of innovative and practical actions set out in the Plan.  It includes a series of practical actions to support enterprise growth and job creation in the region, with clear timelines for delivery.  The Action Plans seek to capitalise on the particular strengths and opportunities of the region and a central aim is to champion the concept of regional collaboration from the &lsquo;ground up&rsquo; to achieve sustainable competitive advantage in the region that grows jobs and enterprises.</p>  <p>  Progress on implementation of the Regional Action Plans is constantly under review and two Progress Reports on the implementation of the Plan&rsquo;s 194 actions have been published to date, with a third one currently being finalised that will cover the second half of 2017.  All reports show that good progress is being made, and over 90% of the Plan&rsquo;s actions are on track to be delivered, or have been completed.   </p>  <p>  Importantly, the South East Regional Plan for Jobs has been embraced within the region and the efforts by stakeholders and businesses in the region are paying off: 16,200 more people are in employment in the South East from Q1 2015 (baseline year) to Q2 2017, representing significant progress towards the 25,000 target for 2020 as set out in the plan.</p>  <p>  Also, over the 12 months to Q2 2017, there has been a slight improvement in the number of people employed in the region (+700). </p>  <p>  However, while Live Register numbers have fallen in all south-eastern counties in the past 12 months, CSO figures show that the unemployment rate in the South East is currently at 8% (Q3 2017), which places the region in a small group of those (including the Midlands and Mid-West) whose unemployment rates are more than one percentage point higher than the State average. </p>  <p>  This is too high, especially since the Q3 2017 State average is 6.9%, and underlines the importance of retaining a focus on regional enterprise development and job creation in the South East.</p>  <p>  In 2017, both Enterprise Ireland and IDA reported job increases in the South East of 4% and 9% respectively, the latter figure being the largest increase of all regions in the State in this period. </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) operating under the auspices of the Local Authorities and Enterprise Ireland continue to play a vital role in providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports to those wishing to start or grow their own businesses in the region.  The LEOs in the South East had 1,274 clients in 2016 employing 6,690 people.  Results for 2017 are expected to be published shortly.</p>  <p>  Building on the strong progress and the momentum of collaboration achieved to date in the South East through the Regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative is my priority and I and my Department look forward to further engagement with regional stakeholders in relation to prioritisation and focus of actions to achieve the employment targets set out to 2020. </p>  <p>  My Department is also working closely with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in relation to the National Planning Framework and development of Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies, and with the Department of Rural and Community Development on roll out of the Action Plan for Rural Development. </p></reply>

Subject to certain eligibility criteria, the LEOs can provide financial assistance within three main categories, i.e., Feasibility Grants (investigating the potential of a business idea) Priming Grants (to part-fund a start-up) and Business Development Grants for existing businesses that want to expand. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the LEOs do not provide direct grant-aid in areas such as retail, personal services, local professional services, construction/local building services, as this may give rise to duplication of services or the displacement of existing businesses. </p>  <p>  As well as promoting the full suite of Local Enterprise Office (LEO) Services to support enterprise and job creation in the north of the county, Fingal County Council is rolling out the following initiatives in North Fingal:</p>  <p>  - Fingal County Council is currently developing a new business park by servicing over 50 acres of land at Stephenstown in Balbriggan.  Fingal will work with IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to promote the new park as an investment location and the business case for the investment forecasts the creation of 900 jobs in the medium-term.</p>  <p>  - The Fingal Skills Strategy is being developed in response to priorities identified in the Fingal Local Economic and Community Plan (LECP) 2016 &ndash; 2021.  The strategy, which is nearing completion, provides clear evidence, based on extensive consultations with industry, on future skills needs to ensure Fingal and has the necessary talent pool to meet industry demands.  The strategy has particular implications for education and training providers, with whom Fingal are working closely.</p>  <p>  - Fingal County Council has actively engaged with national schemes such as the Town and Village Renewal Scheme to improve towns and villages throughout the County.  Fingal County Council has also developed bespoke town improvement schemes such as the Balbriggan Town Centre Shop Front Refurbishment Scheme which has assisted 36 businesses to a total amount of &euro;53,000 leading to clear public realm improvements in the town.</p>  <p>  - Fingal County Council has connected with the business community in the County to develop corporate social responsibility schemes that facilitate engagement with local schools to promote student engagement in STEM subjects.</p>  <p>  - Ardgillan and Bremore Castles and Newbridge House have been identified as strategic tourist attractions which have the ability to attract a large number of visitors to the area . A capital programme of approximately &euro;7 million has been assigned to develop these attractions . Building on the success of the Council&rsquo;s investment in Malahide Castle, this development will promote North Fingal as a major tourism hub in the Dublin Region and adjacent to Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East, significantly increasing visitor numbers.  This investment and development has the potential to create 700 direct and indirect jobs in the town of Balbriggan, which currently has an above average unemployment rate.</p>  <p>  - Fingal County Council continues to support the provision of workspace facilities for small businesses through the BEAT Enterprise Centre in Balbriggan, one of three very successful community-based Enterprise Centres in the County.</p></reply>

Brexit will drive companies to focus on increasing their competitiveness, on innovation and product differentiation in parallel with targeting new export markets.</p>  <p>  In January 2017, Enterprise Ireland launched a new strategy, Build Scale, Expand Reach 2017 &ndash; 2020.  At the centre of this strategy are strategic targets focused on:</p>  <p>  - Assisting clients to create 60,000 new jobs by 2020 while sustaining the existing record level of jobs;</p>  <p>  - Growing the annual exports of client companies by &euro;5bn to &euro;26bn per annum;</p>  <p>  - Increasing the level of spend made by client companies in the Irish economy by &euro;4bn to &euro;27bn per annum by 2020; and</p>  <p>  - Inspiring more Irish owned companies to have global ambition.</p>  <p>  In May 2017 Enterprise Ireland launched a new Eurozone Strategy to assist Irish exporters increase exports in Eurozone countries by 50% by 2020.  This strategy is accompanied by the &lsquo;Irish Advantage&rsquo; communications campaign which will target Eurozone buyers to buy Irish innovation in key Brexit impacted sectors, such as medtech and engineering. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland is constantly developing its offer and services to better react to client needs.  For example, Enterprise Ireland has made changes to its Research, Development and Innovation offer to enable &ldquo;Agile R&amp;D projects&rdquo; to meet immediate market and customer needs.   In addition, Enterprise Ireland organised 57 internationally focused trade events in 2017 including trade missions to Canada; Singapore and China; the UAE and Oman and a major trade programme as part of the State&rsquo;s visit to Australia.  Led by Irish Government Ministers these trade missions are a central element of Enterprise Ireland's strategy to support companies with global ambition.  </p>  <p>  In March 31, Enterprise Ireland launched its &lsquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rsquo;, a new interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars.  The Scorecard generates an immediate report which contains suggested actions and resources, and information on events for companies to attend, to prepare for Brexit. To date 1909 companies have engaged with the Brexit Scorecard.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has also launched a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; that supports the costs of SME clients in preparing a plan to mitigate risks and optimise opportunities arising from Brexit.  It can be used to help cover consultancy, travel and out of pocket expenses associated with researching the direction of their Brexit action plan.  To date, 80 companies have been approved for a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; by Enterprise Ireland.</p>  <p>  A lot can be done within the existing EU State Aid Framework.   In October 2017, the then T&aacute;naiste announced a Brexit Loan Guarantee scheme for SMEs.  The Scheme will provide affordable working capital loans of &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5 million to eligible Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit, or will be in the future.  </p>  <p>  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) recently issued an open call inviting finance providers to participate.  This closed on 8 December.  It is expected that the Scheme will be launched in the first quarter of 2018 and will run for two years.  </p>  <p>  My Department is also exploring the development of a Longer-Term Brexit Investment Loan Scheme, as well as a Business Advisory Hub.  The advisory hub will serve to ensure that SMEs are well informed of their funding and financing options and strengthen their financial planning skills.</p>  <p>  In November 2017, the EU Commission approved a Rescue and Restructuring scheme for Ireland which is now available to SMEs in difficulty.  Under the scheme an undertaking is considered to be in difficulty when, without intervention by the State, it will almost certainly be condemned to going out of business in the short or medium term.  This scheme has been put in place as it was considered prudent to have contingency measures in place so that we can respond swiftly to changing circumstances as necessary.   However, I do not expect that there will be a need for the State to provide rescue/restructuring aid to companies. </p>  <p>  All these schemes detailed above will operate within existing state aid rules.</p>  <p>  In addition, in November 2017, the then T&aacute;naiste, Francis Fitzgerald, met with the Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager.  An outcome from this meeting was the establishment of a Working Group comprising representatives from DG Comp, my Department, Enterprise Ireland and the Department of Agriculture.  The objective of the Group is to scope and design further schemes to support enterprises impacted by Brexit in line with current applicable State Aid rules.  The work of this Group has already commenced and will continue into 2018.  Should issues arise that require an approach that does not fit within the existing State Aid rules, this will be raised as part of the Working Group discussions.</p>  <p>  Supports for the farming sector comes within the remit of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine and I understand that Minister Creed has introduced a range of budgetary measures under competitiveness and market/product diversification pillars to help mitigate the more immediate impacts of Brexit on the agrifood sector.</p></reply>

This includes both research and the development of specific supports.  Officials of my Department have had discussions with senior officials from DG Competition on the potential and the real difficulties encountered by Irish businesses as a result of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU.  In November 2017, the then T&aacute;naiste met with Commissioner Vestager and the issue of State aid was discussed.  An outcome from this meeting was the establishment of a Working Group comprising representatives from DG Comp, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Enterprise Ireland and Department of Agriculture.  The objective of the Group is to scope and design schemes to support enterprises impacted by Brexit in line with current applicable State Aid rules.  Should issues arise that require an approach that does not fit within the existing State Aid rules, this will be raised as part of the Working Group discussions.</p>  <p>  The work of this Group has already commenced and it is due to have its third meeting in February 2018.  In between these meetings, there has been engagement on specific issues to continue to progress matters.   </p>  <p>  A Rescue &amp;amp; Restructuring (R&amp;R) Scheme was approved by the Commission in late November 2017.  This scheme has been put in place as it was considered prudent to have contingency measures in place so that we can respond swiftly to changing circumstances if necessary.    </p>  <p>  A Brexit Loan Scheme was announced in Budget 2018.  This will provide affordable working capital financing to eligible businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit, or will be in the future.  The recent signing of the counter guarantee means the &euro;23 million exchequer funding (&euro;14 million from my Department and &euro;9 million from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine) can be leveraged to provide a &euro;300 million fund from the European Commission and EIB Group through its InnovFin Loan Guarantee Scheme.  The Scheme will be open to businesses of less than 500 employees, which can  demonstrate that they are significantly exposed to the impact (or potential impact) of Brexit.  They must be a viable business, doing business in Ireland, and they must have a business development strategy demonstrating that they plan to innovate or adapt in response to Brexit.</p>  <p>  The agencies of my Department are also fully engaged in preparing for Brexit. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s (EI) #PrepareforBrexit communications campaign, featuring the &lsquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rsquo;, was launched last March.  The Scorecard is an interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit.  </p>  <p>  EI has introduced a &lsquo;Be Prepared Grant&rsquo; which offers up to &euro;5,000 for exporting client companies to conduct further research and  use external expertise to develop a Brexit Action Plan. </p>  <p>  The funding to the Local Enterprise Offices has been increased by 22% and they, with InterTrade Ireland are offering a range of Brexit focused supports to companies, including those engaged in cross-border trade with Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  This work, along with market developments as a result of Brexit, and ongoing engagement with the business community, will inform further discussions with the Commission.  I will be maintaining a strong focus on the SME sector and will consider the development of  further initiatives to support business as required.</p></reply>

The first call under this Fund concluded last August, with results announced on 11 December and 21 projects were successful, totalling &euro;30.5m in aggregate grant support.  The second call is expected to issue in Q1 2018.</p>  <p>  EI together with the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) play a critical role in driving and nurturing entrepreneurship all the way from an originating idea at local level, to taking-on global markets.  An extra &euro;4 million in funding for all the LEOs, including Sligo and Leitrim, in 2017 was allocated to fund a range of initiatives including Brexit supports across the country.  The supports include grants to assist LEO clients in diversifying their markets, targeted training and mentoring to address Brexit-related challenges and opportunities, as well as a Lean for Micro programme to help micro-enterprises to address competitive issues within their businesses by building the capability of their employees to identify problems and improve operations.  In addition, the six LEOs in the Border region are working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme.</p>  <p>  Economic shocks, such as Brexit, places companies in Sligo and Leitrim, whether exporting or not, in an area of uncertainty.  It will drive companies to focus on increasing their competitiveness, innovative capability and product differentiation in parallel with targeting new export markets. Activities currently being undertaken by EI to ensure that client companies are resilient include:</p>  <p>- EI is actively working with companies with global ambition to internationalise, and in doing so, diversify their global footprint.  To support this, on 1 February, EI launched a new Market Discovery Fund to incentivise companies to research viable and sustainable market entry strategies in new geographic markets.</p>  <p>  - EI is working with its clients in the Border Region to drive innovation activity via a number of supports that enable companies to diagnose their innovation readiness, provides financial support for in-house R&amp;D projects and fosters collaboration.</p>  <p>  - EI is working with companies to identify and measure competitiveness issues and support companies by providing access to a range of competitiveness building tools, including the Company Competitiveness Health Check, the Lean Offer and Green Offer. </p>  <p>  In addition, EI provides supports to assist companies, such as those located in Sligo and Leitrim, to be aware and to prepare for Brexit, for example:</p>  <p>  - Launched a &lsquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rsquo;, a new interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars.  Over 2,000 companies have utilised this Scorecard.</p>  <p>  - Launched a Be Prepared Grant that supports the costs of SME clients in preparing a plan to mitigate risks and optimise opportunities arising from Brexit.  This grant can be used to help cover consultancy, travel and out of pocket expenses associated with researching the direction of their Brexit action plan.</p>  <p>  - Ran a national Prepare for Brexit Breakfast Roadshows and is currently engaging with companies throughout the country on preparing for Brexit.</p>  <p>  - Launched the in-market Irish Advantage campaign promoting Irish companies to buyers in key markets and sectors.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious that further efforts are needed to ensure that companies in Sligo and Leitrim are resilient to economic shocks, such as Brexit.  To this end, I am committed to ensure that the agency will continue to work with companies from the region to drive their innovation, competitiveness, internationalisation and Brexit preparedness.</p></reply>

This work is also informed by ongoing stakeholder engagement. Separately, a new preparedness unit in the Commission is considering EU-level responses. </p>  <p>  All this work provides a baseline scenario for the policies and sectors impacted, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations.  In this regard, it is welcome that the direction of travel is now firmly towards achieving a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition period.  Agreement on a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition will provide certainty to individuals and businesses while also aiming to avoid any cliff edge effects between the UK leaving the EU and a future relationship agreement coming into force. The period will provide time for businesses and citizenship to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU based on the outcome of the negotiations on the framework for the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK.  In this respect, the expectation is that the European Council will adopt additional Guidelines at its meeting on 22-23 March 2018 on the framework for the future EU-UK relationship.  These guidelines &ndash; as well as further clarity on the UK position, which has been sought by the European Council &ndash; will provide a clearer picture of the direction of travel in the negotiations.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s contingency planning continues to be firmly grounded in the extensive work and outreach that has already been undertaken by individual Departments and agencies, as well as by stakeholder organisations, academics and others.  Much of this is in the public domain.</p>  <p>  While Brexit does not give rise to fundamental strategic issues for Defence Forces operations or Defence Policy, the UK has been an important interlocutor for Ireland and both countries have generally adopted similar policy positions in our engagement in the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).  Building a broader network of alliances at EU level has been an ongoing objective in recent years but has gained increased importance with the future departure of the UK.  The Department of Defence is currently conducting an internal review and analysis of issues where we have aligned with member States other than the UK.  We will cross reference this with peacekeeping partners on UN, CSDP and NATO/PfP operations and like-minded States more generally as part of an ongoing process of identifying and building new alliances on the Security and Defence Agenda at EU level.  The results of this analysis will help inform our bilateral engagement at Ministerial and Official level over the coming period.     </p>  <p>  As Defence operates in a support role to a range of other Departments, Defence will assist and support those Departments/Agencies in any analysis or research they are conducting which has implications for the level and nature of support offered by/required from Defence.  To this end, Defence is engaging with lead Departments and Agencies as appropriate and the Defence Forces are engaged in prudent planning.  </p>  <p>  Regarding resources, matters relating to Brexit are currently being absorbed and dealt with within existing Departmental structures and resources.  Accordingly there is currently no dedicated Brexit funding allocation required in the Department of Defence, nor are there any additional Brexit related roles envisaged at this time. </p>  <p>  The structures put in place in the Department of Defence to address the potential challenges arising from Brexit include the assignment of responsibility to a senior official at Assistant Secretary General level in relation to Brexit related matters.  The senior official is leading the Department&rsquo;s input to deliberations within the framework established across Government and is supported in their role by a number of Branches in the Department.  The senior official represents the Department on the Senior Officials Group chaired by the Department of An Taoiseach and the Interdepartmental Group on EU and Brexit which is chaired by the Department of the Foreign Affairs and Trade and is engaged with the identification of key strategic, operational and policy issues arising from Brexit.  In addition, the Management Board is acting as a clearing house for Brexit and maintains oversight on an on-going basis. </p></reply>

This will be a continuation of a discussion at the meeting of the Council on 22 January.  At that meeting, I reported to colleagues on my meetings in the region during my visit there in early January.  I also addressed what the EU could do to support any balanced peace initiative which might emerge, and also in terms of action on the ground to combat many negative trends, including the deteriorating situation in Gaza.</p>  <p>  I have given these issues a high priority in my work since assuming office, both at EU level and elsewhere, as I have reported to the House.

The Council also agreed that work should be taken forward through bilateral discussions within the NSMC at sectoral level, as well as through a high-level working group comprising senior officials from the Government and from the Northern Ireland Executive Office.</p>  <p>  The Government is most anxious that the NSMC be able to resume and progress this vital work.  Through the NSMC, the Government and Northern Ireland Executive can work together at an institutional level, as provided for under the Good Friday Agreement, to address the all-island implications of Brexit, where so many interests are shared, North and South.</p>  <p>  The work that the NSMC progressed in this respect in 2016 was very valuable and it has served as an important guide for the Government as we worked through Phase One of the EU-UK negotiations last year to secure the interests of Ireland, North and South.  The role of the NSMC in addressing the all-island implications of Brexit and enabling coordinated approaches by the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive has been clearly established.  In this context, there is no consideration being given to any changes to the North South Ministerial Council, which as an institution of the Good Friday Agreement has very important and clearly-established functions and responsibilities, which have been agreed to by all parties to the Peace Process founded on the Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Joint Report agreed by the EU and UK negotiators on 8 December acknowledged that cooperation between Ireland and Northern Ireland is a central part of the Good Friday Agreement, and that the UK departure from the Union gives rise to substantial challenges to the maintenance and development of North-South cooperation.  The UK has accordingly committed to protecting and supporting continued North-South cooperation across the full range of contexts and frameworks of cooperation, including the continued operation of the North-South implementation bodies.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to work with EU partners and the European Commission Task Force to ensure that the Phase One commitments are delivered in full and that our interests, and those of the island as a whole, are advanced in the EU position in Phase Two, including the protection of North/South co-operation.</p>  <p>  The Government wishes to see the NSMC urgently resume its work across all sectors, including the engagement on Brexit mandated last year, which can further inform the approach of Ireland, of the UK and of the European Union on the Ireland-specific issues, as Phase 2 of EU-UK negotiations progresses this year.</p>  <p>  I am intensively engaged at present, working with the Secretary for Northern Ireland, to support agreement between the political parties that will allow for the formation of a new Executive and the resumption of the North South Ministerial Council.  There remain challenges for the parties but I am convinced that an agreement can be reached between those parties, each of which wants to see the devolved institutions operating.</p>  <p>  A new Executive will be able to speak for Northern Ireland as the UK progresses its approach to the Article 50 negotiations, and the North South Ministerial Council will be able to resume its important work, including addressing the all-island issues and concerns that are raised by Brexit. </p></reply>

Clearly, a comprehensive, inclusive political solution to the conflict is urgently needed, both to end the suffering of the Syrian people and to prevent any further turmoil in the Middle East.</p>  <p>  For these reasons Ireland fully supports the UN-led political negotiations to end the conflict based on the 2012 Geneva Communique and UN Security Council resolution 2254, which calls for an end to violence; release of political prisoners; formation of a transitional governing body with executive powers and a constitutional reform process.  Ireland fully supports this process and the work of UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura.  The EU provides direct assistance to the UN-led Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground.</p>  <p>  At the December EU Foreign Affairs Council, we discussed the regional situation in the Middle East, including of course the urgent need for progress towards peace in Syria.  I joined colleagues in stressing the primacy of the UN-led Geneva process and the need for an inclusive political transition in Syria. </p>  <p>  Since 2012 Ireland has contributed over &euro;90 million to the international humanitarian response to the Syria crisis, including over &euro;15 million to the EU Facility for Refugees in Turkey.  Through our annual contributions to the EU institutions Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response to the crisis.  The EU and its Member States have together mobilised more than &euro;9.5 billion for humanitarian and resilience assistance to support Syrians inside the country and in neighbouring countries, making the EU the largest single donor to the effort.  The EU will host another donors&rsquo; conference for Syria in 2018.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department met with the Turkish Ambassador to Ireland earlier this week.  They conveyed Ireland&rsquo;s overarching concern for the protection of civilians, including in the context of this particular operation, and urged caution to avoid escalating the conflict any further. </p>  <p>  Ireland understands Turkey&rsquo;s concern about the conflict raging on its southern border.  Turkey has borne a heavy burden in terms of knock-on effects of the conflict, including in terms of migration and spill-over of violence.  However, our primary concern is for the safety and well-being of civilians on both sides of the border, especially displaced and vulnerable communities. </p>  <p>  I call on all parties to exercise restraint in order to avoid any further exacerbation of this already fragile situation and to cooperate in the effort to find a political solution under UN auspices which alone can bring lasting peace to Syria.</p></reply>

Pursuant to this recommendation, a protocol has been agreed between the Department and Insurance Ireland under which insurance companies have committed to accepting the driving experience of returning emigrants gained while abroad, when the driver has previous driving experience in Ireland.  The guiding principle of the protocol is to ensure that a returning emigrant is not treated any differently to any other driver subject to their ability to demonstrate, and the insurance company to verify, continuous driving experience and the normal acceptance criteria of the company.  What this means is that the returning emigrant will not be disadvantaged from spending time abroad.  Furthermore, under the protocol insurance companies will not distinguish between countries on the basis of which side of the road driving takes place therein.</p><p>In addition to the above, insurance companies have agreed to provide relevant and helpful information on their websites to make it easier for consumers to understand the implications of their move abroad from a motor insurance perspective.  As part of this exercise, they will outline what people need to do under a number of different circumstances depending on the length of time they intend being away from Ireland. </p><p>Insurance Ireland submitted a report on the implementation of this recommendation to the Department of Finance on 22 December 2017.  This report confirmed that Insurance Ireland members have agreed to publish the wording of the agreed protocol on their company websites and any other forms of social media, in addition to providing training for staff who can work through issues with emigrants before they leave, whilst they are out of the country and when they return to Ireland.  The stated intention is &ldquo;<i>to resolve any issues well before they arise and for the consumer to be aware of the considerations when moving abroad</i>&rdquo;.  The wording of the agreed protocol is also available on the Insurance Ireland website. </p><p>The report also outlines some sample cases which demonstrate how the rolling-out of the protocol has already led to disputed cases being resolved to the benefit of returning emigrants, and provides figures indicating that the number of such cases being processed under the Declined Cases Agreement is decreasing.</p><p>If, however, a returning emigrant is continuing to have difficulty in obtaining insurance, Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.  The relevant contact details are: <i>feedback@insuranceireland.eu or declined@insuranceireland.eu or 01-6761914.</i></p></reply>

This work is also informed by ongoing stakeholder engagement. Separately, a new preparedness unit in the Commission is considering EU-level responses. </p><p>All this work provides a baseline scenario for the policies and sectors impacted, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations.  In this regard, it is welcome that the direction of travel is now firmly towards achieving a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition period.  Agreement on a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition will provide certainty to individuals and businesses while also aiming to avoid any cliff edge effects between the UK leaving the EU and a future relationship agreement coming into force.  The period will provide time for businesses and citizenship to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU based on the outcome of the negotiations on the framework for the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK.  In this respect, the expectation is that the European Council will adopt additional Guidelines at its meeting on 22-23 March 2018 on the framework for the future EU-UK relationship.  These guidelines &ndash; as well as further clarity on the UK position, which has been sought by the European Council &ndash; will provide a clearer picture of the direction of travel in the negotiations.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s contingency planning continues to be firmly grounded in the extensive work and outreach that has already been undertaken by individual Departments and agencies, as well as by stakeholder organisations, academics and others.  Much of this is in the public domain.</p><p>Working through the cross-Departmental coordination structure, my Department has been to the fore in producing and funding a number of Brexit-related studies, both before and since the UK's referendum decision.  In addition, regular updates of my Department&rsquo;s Macro-Economic forecasts take account of the impact of Brexit. Published and commissioned Brexit-related studies by my Department and include:</p><p>- 'Scoping the Possible Economic Implications of Brexit on Ireland' &ndash; A scoping study of scenarios for the future relationship between the UK and the EU. Published under the Department of Finance-ESRI research programme in November 2015;</p><p>- &lsquo;An Exposure Analysis of Sectors of the Irish Economy&rsquo;.  An in-depth analysis of the possible sectoral and regional impacts of Brexit arising from Ireland's trade relationship with the UK, published by Department of Finance in October 2016 (Updated March 2017);</p><p>- 'Modelling the Medium to Long Term Potential Macroeconomic Impact of Brexit on Ireland' - Published under the Department of Finance-ESRI research programme in November 2016; and</p><p>- &lsquo;Trade Exposures of Sectors of the Irish Economy in a European Context&rsquo; &ndash; An analysis of trade exposure to the UK in comparison to other EU Member States, published by the Department of Finance in September 2017<b>.</b></p><p>All of these studies have been made public on the Department of Finance Brexit webpage:<i><i></i></i>.  Costs incurred for the 'Scoping the Possible Economic Implications of Brexit on Ireland'  paper and the 'Modelling the Medium to Long Term Potential Macroeconomic Impact of Brexit on Ireland' paper, formed part of the overall costs under my Department&rsquo;s research programme with the ESRI.</p><p>The results in these studies published by my Department and the ESRI, show that the potential impact of Brexit on the Irish economy will be significant.  In the joint paper my Department published with the ESRI, that assessed the medium to long term potential macroeconomic impact of Brexit on Ireland, the study shows that ten years after a UK exit from the EU, the level of Irish output, could reduce in a range from 2.3 per cent to 2.7 per cent and 3.8 per cent (i.e. under a EEA scenario, a FTA scenario and a WTO &ldquo;hard Brexit&rdquo; scenario, respectively), below a baseline of what it otherwise would have been.  These results are on a no policy change basis. However, with the future trade path between the UK and EU still unknown, it is crucially important that we prepare our economy for the challenges ahead. </p><p>In this context, the Government has already taken a number of important steps including in Budgets 2017 and 2018, the Action Plan for Jobs, Ireland Connected our Trade and Investment Strategy and the preparation of a new 10-year Capital Plan.  The best way to deal with the uncertainties arising from Brexit is to continue the Government&rsquo;s competitiveness oriented policies and prudent management of the public finances.</p></reply>

This work is carried out by a significant number of staff, currently estimated as 21 full-time equivalents, of whom 12 are dedicated to Brexit work full time, supported by additional staff throughout the organisation as required.  Preparations will intensify once the Article 50 negotiations progress and clarity has been provided as to the nature of the future trading relationship between the EU and the UK and the customs regime that will apply.  Additional resources will be allocated in line with these requirements.</p>  <p>  Many staff across the Central Bank are working on Brexit-related matters on a daily basis in the course of their duties.  Given the nature of this work and how it relates to their role, the Central Bank has indicated that it is not feasible to capture the total staff working on matters related to Brexit in the manner requested by the Deputy.  In 2017, the Central Bank allocated an additional 28 staff to address specific Brexit-related new business needs within existing divisions.  Of these 28 staff, 18 have been allocated to supervisory divisions to address specific Brexit-related new business needs within existing divisions.  In 2017, the Central Bank Commission also approved an additional 36 resources principally to support increases in Brexit-related authorisation/supervisory activity, as well as to support extensions to the post crisis regulatory framework.</p>  <p>  The National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) has indicated that it&rsquo;s direct exposure to the UK market is, at this stage, very limited, it continues to monitor any Brexit impact on the Irish assets securing its residual loan portfolio.</p>  <p>  The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) has not recruited or allocated staff to work exclusively on Brexit-related matters.  The NTMA is, however, continually monitoring Brexit developments and regards these as key considerations for 2018.  The NTMA has internal working groups relating to Brexit which have been staffed by existing employees.</p>  <p>  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) has not allocated staff to work exclusively on Brexit-related matters.  The only identifiable direct budget item is the 2018 budget allocation of &euro;600,000 towards the Brexit Loan Scheme 1.  However, Brexit-related solutions remain a key consideration and focus for the SBCI and it expect that the overall cost for 2018 (or possibly 2019) may be higher than the budget allocation as it is expected that a second Brexit related scheme will be developed and rolled out in late 2018/early 2019.</p></reply>

In accordance with international best practice, PPP contracts already typically include detailed provisions that apply in the event of the liquidation of a consortium member of the PPP company, or an entity under the contract, to protect the public interest and ensure that the project proceeds to completion.</p><p>Under the terms of such PPP contracts, in the case of liquidation of a consortium member, or an entity under the contract, the PPP consortium&rsquo;s funders and remaining shareholders are required to intervene and implement rectification measures to ensure that the project is completed to the satisfaction of the State.  Liquidation of a company involved in delivering a public infrastructure project is an unfortunate development but would impact on any project where a supplier became insolvent during the delivery process, regardless of whether the project was being procured by PPP or by traditional means.  The issue, therefore, is not PPP-specific, but where it arises in a PPP project, the provisions of the PPP contract ensure that the public interest is protected.  </p><p>It is worth bearing in mind that this is not the first time a PPP in Ireland has experienced issues with its construction contractor, which is not uncommon given the risks inherent in the construction market.  In all previous similar cases, the projects were completed successfully and are now fully operational.  These examples demonstrate the resilience of the PPP contractual structure and underline the importance of adhering to the contractual documentation in resolving issues - which has previously been raised as a negative feature associated with PPPs. </p><p>While Carillion&rsquo;s liquidation does give rise to a delay in completing the remaining construction works, payments under the PPP contract will not be made until the full works and services as set out under the project agreement are satisfactorily delivered for each school.</p><p>For these reasons, I do not see any need to pause PPPs currently in procurement or planning, as the contract terms of the PPP project will deal with the potential situation whereby a contractor or partner in the PPP company may become insolvent during the term of the contract.</p><p>However, as the Deputy may be aware, I established an Inter-Departmental / Inter-Agency Group last year to review Ireland's experience of using PPP and to make recommendations on the future role of PPPs, in the context of the new 10 year capital plan.

Having visited the area the following day I saw at first hand the extensive damage and disruption caused by this flood event, particularly to the community in the Inishowen Peninsula area. </p><p>Local flooding issues are a matter, in the first instance, for each Local Authority to investigate and address. Donegal County Council may carry out flood mitigation works using its own resources.  The Council may also apply to the Office of Public Works for funding of flood mitigation works under this Office's Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  The purpose of this scheme, introduced in 2009, is to provide funding to Local Authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas.  The OPW has approved 32 Minor Works schemes in Donegal at a cost of &euro;1.2m.  Details of these schemes are on the OPW website, <i>www.opw.ie</i></p><p>A national study to assess and propose measures to manage Ireland&rsquo;s flood risk is being undertaken by the Office of Public Works (OPW) through its Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.  The CFRAM Programme is focussing on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, designated in 2012 as being at potentially significant risk of flooding.  The flood risk for each of these areas has been assessed, through detailed engineering techniques to assess their risk and impact from flooding.  This risk and the proposed feasible measures, both structural and non-structural, identified to manage that risk are outlined in the Flood Risk Management Plans.  </p><p>Carndonagh and Clonmany are two communities that have been studied as part of the North Western &ndash; Neagh Bann CFRAM Programme.</p><p>In relation to Carndonagh, the Plans propose measures consisting of using storage areas along with a series of embankments and walls along the Donagh  River . Improved channel conveyance would protect properties impacted by flooding from the Carndonagh watercourse and hard defences would protect properties impacted by flooding from the Glennagannon  River.  </p><p>As the flood risk in Clonmany was assessed as relatively low no structural flood relief schemes are proposed, at this time.  The Plans set out those non-structural measures in place or proposed that can benefit all at risk communities and properties, including emergency response, national flood forecasting, individual property protection and community resilience. </p><p>The Plans are currently subject to an independent review of the strategic level environmental assessments by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Once this independent review of all Plans is completed and observations addressed, I would hope in the coming weeks to seek the approval from the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform for the Flood Risk Management Plans.</p></reply>

Temporary posts are filled by open competition which appropriately qualified teachers are eligible to apply for.  </p>  <p>  The redeployment arrangements are reviewed annually with the education partners.  Arrangements for the 2018/19 school year have been finalised and are available on the Department website in Circular 0010/2018.</p>  <p>  Circular 0063/2017, "Leadership and Management in Primary Schools", has introduced the phasing in of open competition for Deputy Principal posts.  From 2022, all primary schools will be able to fill Deputy Principal posts through open competition, where vacancies exist.

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. (SCPA).</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. </p>  <p>  I have made enquiries in relation to the child referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question and am informed that he was the subject of an educational psychological assessment as recently as last autumn.</p>  <p>  I would advise that if there are ongoing concerns in relation to the educational or social and emotional development of the child these should be raised by the parents, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school he is attending, with a view to Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist or local NEPS service.</p></reply>

This is known as Risk Assessment.  The aim of Risk Assessment is to reduce the risk of injury and illness associated with work.  The Risk Assessment(s) will form part of the employer's Safety Statement.</p>  <p>  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007 set out the First-Aid requirements for workplaces as follows: "Employers have a duty to provide first-aid equipment at all places at work where working conditions require it. Depending on the size or specific hazard (or both) of the place of work, trained occupational first-aiders must also be provided.  Apart from some exceptions, first-aid rooms must be provided where appropriate. Information must also be provided to employees as regards the first-aid facilities and arrangements in place."</p>  <p>  It is important that the school management authority requests parents to ensure that the school is made aware of any medical condition suffered by any student attending.  Where the school is aware of potential difficulties that may arise as a consequence of a medical condition suffered by one or more students, it may be possible for the management authorities, working in conjunction with parents, teachers and children to put preventative measures in place to lessen the possibility of any difficulties arising or to ensure that, if a student suffers from an illness requiring, for example, the administration of medication, that appropriate treatment is available.</p>  <p>  Where a child requires adult assistance to assist in the administration of medicine and where the extent of assistance required would overly disrupt normal teaching time, SNA support may be allocated for this purpose.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Board of Management to ensure that SNAs are in a position to effectively meet the care needs of students for whom SNA support has been allocated in the school when appointing an SNA. </p>  <p>  Where specific training is required, the Board of Management should liaise with the Health Service Executive (HSE) in order to ensure that the HSE provides guidance and training that enables the SNA to meet the care needs of the pupil in an appropriate manner. It is a matter for individual school authorities to make such arrangements locally. </p>  <p>  It is my Department's experience that once the matter has been discussed in detail with the Board of Management and staff of a school, and once all parties are clear as to the procedures to be followed, arrangements can normally be made to assist the administration of first aid or medicine.</p>  <p>  The NCSE are currently undertaking a Comprehensive Review of the SNA Scheme.  In response to a progress report from the NCSE on the comprehensive assessment, the NCSE were requested to establish a working group, comprising relevant stakeholders, to assist in proposing a better model for providing care supports so as to provide better outcomes for students with special educational needs who have additional care needs. </p>  <p>  This Working Group, which is chaired by Mr. Eamon Stack, Chairperson of the NCSE Council, has commenced its work and the work will run in tandem with the completion of the overall Comprehensive Review of the SNA Scheme.  It is intended that the reports of the Working Group and of the Review will be completed in Spring 2018. </p>  <p>  In tandem with this, a cross Departmental Working Group has been established to develop proposals in relation to the need for nursing supports in certain special schools for children with complex medical needs. </p>  <p>  In relation to insurance, the position is that the nature and terms of an individual school&rsquo;s insurance arrangements are a matter between the individual school and its insurers. </p></reply>

Many of the issues identified were complex and the Council commissioned the ESRI (Economic and Social Research Institute) to carry out research to inform its deliberation. </p>  <p>  The changes also had regard to the Department&rsquo;s policy &ldquo;Supporting a Better Transition from Second Level to Higher Education &ndash; Implementation and Next Steps&rdquo; (2015).</p>  <p>  In determining the revised entry requirements, care was taken not to disadvantage those students who have already commenced the senior cycle and who intend sitting the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2018.  Accordingly, I decided that the minimum entry grades for primary Initial Teacher Education programmes should be increased for 2019 rather than from 2018.  However, to have applied this criterion to undergraduate students who might wish to apply for the PME at some time in the future, it would mean deferring the changes for four years or more. In the case of graduates who do not meet the new Irish entry requirement, the Deputy might wish to note that there are a number of options available in this regard.</p>  <p>  The revision of entry criteria for primary initial teacher education is part of a wider range of actions being implemented or developed to achieve the objective of developing the continuum of teacher education to equip teachers with the right skills for 21st century teaching and learning, and the overall vision of making the Irish education and training system the best in Europe over the next decade.  The changes seek to ensure that primary teachers have the capacity to lead in significant and fundamental areas of student learning: English, Irish and Maths. </p>  <p>  Further changes to the minimum entry requirements from 2021 onwards will be considered in the light of experience, relevant policy developments and following consultation with relevant stakeholders. </p>  <p>  I do not plan to further adjust the minimum entry requirements or to allow exemptions to the requirements, in advance of this.</p></reply>

These changes include the reconfiguration of the course content and increased duration for both primary and post-primary ITE programmes.  </p>  <p>  Undergraduate ITE programmes must now be a minimum of four years duration and postgraduate programmes must be a minimum of two years duration.  The lengthened and reconfigured programmes include substantial periods of school placement as central to student teacher development, as well as foundational and professional studies, a Gaeltacht placement.  School placement is a critical part of ITE and is designed to give the student teacher an opportunity to experience teaching and learning in a real environment. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the requirements in the Criteria and Guidelines for Programme Providers, including the student placement requirements, do pose a challenge to the provision of a part-time ITE programme by HEIs.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-02-07a.254.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020700080#WRE02200"><p>It is the Department&rsquo;s intention that all our pupils receive a quality Physical Education, as part of a curriculum aimed at supporting their holistic development.  This involves appropriate instruction in a variety of movement forms that are designed to enhance the physical, cognitive, social and emotional development of all pupils.  Dance is one such movement form.  The Department encourages schools to make every effort to deliver the Dance strand, which is one component of a comprehensive Physical Education at both primary and post-primary level. </p>  <p>  As a study of human movement, Physical Education aims to support pupils in developing physical competence and understanding so they are able to move efficiently, effectively and safely.  It is also focused on supporting pupils to develop positive physical activity behaviours, and to enjoy the many social and emotional benefits, including the physical and cognitive benefits that result from being physically active.  All schools are expected to deliver a comprehensive Physical Education curriculum, as prescribed by the Department.  It is important that pupils are supported in developing a proficiency in, and understanding of, the fundamental and transferable movement patterns inherent across all of the physical activity strands of the curriculum.</p>  <p>  At Junior Cycle, promoting physical activity is reflected in the 24 'statements of learning' that are at the core of the Framework for Junior Cycle.  Dance could also feature as part of a short course which could be developed and offered by a school, or by using the Performing Arts short course developed by the NCCA.  Additionally, provision for PE forms part of the Junior Cycle Wellbeing Programme.  The Junior Cycle Wellbeing Programme began with 300 hours of timetabled engagement in 2017 and build up to 400 hours by 2020 as the new Junior Cycle is implemented fully in schools. PE, along with CSPE and SPHE form part of the Wellbeing Programme.</p>  <p>  A 100 hour short course in Physical Education was made available to all schools in 2015.  It builds on the Junior Cycle Physical Education Framework which physical education teachers currently use to plan their physical education programme in junior cycle.  </p>  <p>  The specification is structured around four strands: Physical activity for health and wellbeing;</p>  <p>  Games; Individual and team challenges; and Dance and gymnastics.</p>  <p>  Strand 4: Dance and gymnastics. This strand aims to build students&rsquo; competency in and understanding of artistic and aesthetic movement, as they create and perform in a group for an audience in either gymnastics or dance.  The process of creating the dance or gymnastic movement sequence is seen as being equally important as the final performance.  Each school will decide the order in which the strands are taught and, where appropriate, provide an equal time weighting for each strand to ensure a broad, balanced and developmentally appropriate programme covering all four strands of the course.</p>  <p>  The new Leaving Certificate Physical Education (examinable) subject will be introduced in September 2018 into a small cohort of schools.  Learners&rsquo; physically active participation is central to teaching and learning in Leaving Certificate Physical Education.  To enable this to happen, students learn about the different theoretical perspectives through their participation in three different physical activities.  These activities are selected from six distinct physical activity areas which reflect the activities more commonly included in school physical education programmes currently.  The Physical Activity area &lsquo;Artistic and aesthetic activities&rsquo; includes Gymnastics: artistic, rhythmic And Dance: contemporary, folk, modern, ballet, jazz, tap, ethnic, traditional.</p>  <p>  Leaving Certificate Physical Education is designed to be taught in approximately 180 hours.  It is recommended that of the five suggested class periods a week, a double period per week should be included to facilitate learners&rsquo; active participation in the three physical activities.</p></reply>

Sufficient demand emerged in 28 areas, and consultations followed with the main Catholic patrons in each of these areas to discuss divesting options.  </p>  <p>  In the majority of the 28 areas surveyed, the level of parental demand for a wider choice indicated a long-term projected size of up to half a single stream school (comprising of 4 classrooms) being required to accommodate such a level of demand and this is clearly outlined in the Reports on the Surveys regarding Parental Preferences on Primary School Patronage published by the Department in December 2012 and April 2013.  Based on the current pupil teacher ratio of 26:1, half a single stream equates to a junior infant intake of 13 pupils.</p>  <p>  The schools under the patronage divesting process are opened in areas of relatively stable populations and accordingly there is little prospect that new schools will be established there over the next number of years for demographic reasons.  Therefore, the only mechanism for alternative patrons to become involved in school provision in these areas was through the possible divestment of some existing school provision in the areas provided there was sufficient parental demand for wider choice of patronage.</p>  <p>  A number of schools opened under this process, including the school referred to by the Deputy, were contacted by the Department in the context of their enrolment numbers reflecting their school accommodation capacity. </p>  <p>  In the case of any school applying to expand its intake, the Department examines school size in order to preserve a balance among all schools in an area and to ensure that one school is not expanding at the expense of another.  In addition, schools which are located in temporary accommodation may need to restrict their intake in line with the temporary accommodation available.  While the situation may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice, the Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that the existing schools in the area can, between them, cater for the demand in that area.  The Department&rsquo;s principal priority in the allocation of scarce capital funding has to be in providing sufficient school places in areas of demographic growth. </p>  <p>  Should a school&rsquo;s patron wish to make a case for an increase in the school&rsquo;s intake level, a proposal can be submitted to the Department where it will be reviewed in conjunction with the current demographic data, available accommodation and capacity levels of all schools in the relevant area.  A case has been submitted to the Department in respect of a number of divested schools and this is currently under consideration.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently carrying out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to identify areas of demographic growth and determine where additional school accommodation is needed in order to plan for school provision.  It is anticipated that these exercises will be completed in the coming weeks.  In this context, the outcome of these nationwide demographic exercises will input into consideration of the case submitted in relation to the schools opened under the patronage divesting process.</p></reply>

This work is also informed by ongoing stakeholder engagement.  Separately, a new preparedness unit in the Commission is considering EU-level responses. </p><p>All this work provides a baseline scenario for the policies and sectors impacted, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations.  In this regard, it is welcome that the direction of travel is now firmly towards achieving a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition period.  Agreement on a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition will provide certainty to individuals and businesses while also aiming to avoid any cliff edge effects between the UK leaving the EU and a future relationship agreement coming into force.  The period will provide time for businesses and citizenship to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU based on the outcome of the negotiations on the framework for the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK.  In this respect, the expectation is that the European Council will adopt additional Guidelines at its meeting on 22-23 March 2018 on the framework for the future EU-UK relationship.  These guidelines &ndash; as well as further clarity on the UK position, which has been sought by the European Council &ndash; will provide a clearer picture of the direction of travel in the negotiations.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s contingency planning framework is firmly grounded in the extensive work and outreach that has already been undertaken by individual Departments and agencies, as well as by stakeholder organisations, academics and others.  My own Department contributed fully to the preparation of the education components of that framework. </p><p>Our work has been facilitated by the International Unit of my Department which, under the leadership of an Assistant Secretary General, has been given overall responsibility for co-ordinating our response to Brexit.  In discharging its Brexit-related functions, the International Unit participates in the Inter-Departmental Senior Officials Group which oversees the coordination of the Government&rsquo;s response to the outcome of the UK referendum, and supports the Cabinet Committee on the European Union including Brexit.This is further underpinned by the Unit's active engagement with other Departments in Brexit Workgroups on Brexit Coordination; the Economy and Sectoral Issues; the Common Travel Area; and the Island of Ireland Working Group.</p><p>The International Unit also chairs the Education and Research Subgroup under the Economy and Sectoral Issues strand of co-ordination. The Subgroup includes relevant areas within the Department and relevant Agencies of the Department and other Departments/Agencies.  Meetings of the Education and Research Subgroup of the Economy and Trade Group took place on 28 October 2016, 15 February; 24 May and 9 October 2017 and most recently focused on stakeholder consultations input and research collaboration.  A further meeting is planned for early 2018.</p><p>This Unit has been prioritising Brexit work to date and will keep staffing requirements under constant review.  At this stage, it is anticipated that any additional needs arising can be provided for from within existing Departmental resources.  No specific funding has been allocated to agencies and bodies within my Department&rsquo;s remit for the purposes of staffing dedicated to Brexit preparations, nor has my Department engage external bodies to carry out Brexit-related impact assessments.</p><p>However my Department has been working closely with a number of organisations, and in particular with the Higher Education Authority, in Brexit planning for the higher education sector.  The HEA has published a Brexit issues paper and has held meetings with the HEIs to discuss ongoing planning and issues with them as the process develops.  We will continue to engage in this important aspect of planning and research work, and during 2018 will maintain our extensive engagement with stakeholders across the sector, which has been fundamental to my Department&rsquo;s preparations for Brexit since late 2016.</p><p>While Brexit presents numerous challenges, it is likely to bring opportunities too.  Funding of &euro;1.5m was provided in Budget 2017 to attract researchers to Ireland, as part of our strategic response to Brexit.  This &euro;1.5m is again available in 2018.</p><p>Under the Action Plan for Education 2018 we will enhance our strategy to attract world-leading researchers to Ireland in the context of Brexit.  In partnership with enterprise/employers, and in line with Innovation 2020 targets, we will increase the enrolment of postgraduate researchers and grow the number of programmes to support postdoctoral researchers. In this way, we will<b></b>grow a vibrant research community and address economic demands.</p><p>We will continue to seek opportunities in existing and high potential markets to increase the numbers of international students and partnerships for our higher education sector as we implement the International Education Strategy.  We will also seek to maximise the opportunities from North-South cooperation and our continuing key relationship with the UK.</p></reply>

The CSO's involvement is key to the ongoing work to enhance the quality of crime statistics. </p>  <p>  Following the publication of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate report on Crime Investigation in November 2014, the then T&aacute;naiste, my predecessor as Minister for Justice and Equality Ms. Frances FitzGerald T.D., met with the Director General of the Central Statistics Office (CSO) to discuss the issues raised in that report.  One of the actions flowing from that discussion was the establishment of the Expert Group on Crime Statistics, chaired by the CSO, which was set up to consider six specific recommendations made by the Garda Inspectorate in their report which affect the recording of crime data by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the compilation of official crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office. </p>  <p>  The expert group's report found that, while the current principles with regard to the recording, counting, invalidation and classification of crime are fit for purpose, there is a clear need for a new, comprehensive and publicly available document explaining these principles in detail.  This issue is being taken forward by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in consultation with the CSO. </p>  <p>  I understand that CSO plans to recommence publication of crime statistics in the first half of this year.  However, in the meantime provisional statistics released by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na last month indicate a significant drop in burglary rates for the two month period of November / December 2017.  I would caution that all these figures are provisional until such time as the publication of the official crime statistics by the CSO has recommenced.  I am further informed that CSO are likely to note the statistics as &lsquo;under reservation&rsquo; which indicates that, while the statistics have been determined to be of sufficient quality to allow publication, the ongoing issues mean that the quality does not yet meet the higher standard required of official statistics.</p>  <p>  The CSO is engaging with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other crime statistics users, including my Department and the Policing Authority, in relation to the issues that need to be resolved by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in order for the data to reach the required standard.</p></reply>

These complaints were forwarded onto the contractor and the response has been received. </p>  <p>  It is worth noting that not all of the accommodation centre in question is used for accommodation and the unused section is blocked off to residents.  The contractor has confirmed that 12 of the 20 photographs that accompanied the complaint are from this unused part of the building and access to that part is strictly limited to authorised personnel.  Another picture is of a skip that has since been removed.  I am informed that the remaining photographs either required no action or if a defect was identified then all appropriate action to remedy the identified defect has been carried out. </p>  <p>  As stated in my earlier reply, all accommodation centres under contract to the Department are inspected by staff from the Reception and Integration Agency and by an independent inspector, QTS Health and Safety Limited. </p>  <p>  The accommodation centre in question has been inspected three times in 2017 - once by QTS Health and Safety Limited on 12 April and twice by two different staff members from the Reception and Integration Agency - on 29 June and as recently as 29 November. </p>  <p>  All accommodation centres are also subject to inspection by other State inspectors such as the environmental health service, the fire service and the Data Protection Commissioner. </p>  <p>  Each centre under contract to the Department is required to have a current and active fire certificate renewed on a yearly basis.

The only complaint raised by a resident during the inspections mentioned above was on 29 June 2017 and that was in relation to a transfer. </p>  <p>  In addition to the foregoing it is of course always open to any resident in the centre in question to make a complaint to the Ombudsman about any matter in relation to their accommodation at that centre.</p></reply>

In terms of providing upgraded court accommodation the refurbishment, extension and development of existing courthouses has always been the Courts Service's preference.  However, while this is an option for Tralee, the scope for refurbishing and developing the existing courthouse on Ashe Street to provide the envisaged accommodation is extremely limited due to the nature of the building and the constrained nature of the site.</p>  <p>  The Courts Service has also advised that it is currently considering a number of options for Tralee Courthouse, including the level of extension and refurbishment achievable within the confines of the existing courthouse site; whether it would be feasible to acquire an adjacent town centre site and the degree of extension and refurbishment this would allow.  Previous efforts to acquire adjacent sites on Ashe Street have not been successful as the sites could not be acquired at a price that represented value for money.  A further option is to build a new modern courthouse on a greenfield/brownfield site.  The Courts Service has informed me that a decision has not yet been made and that all options are under review.</p>  <p>  Tralee is one of a number of provincial city/county town venues nationwide still requiring new or upgraded courthouse accommodation and collectively these venues will be the next priority for investment in courthouse facilities outside the capital.</p></reply>

In this regard, it is welcome that the direction of travel is now firmly towards achieving a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition period.  Agreement on a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition will provide certainty to individuals and businesses while also aiming to avoid any cliff edge effects between the UK leaving the EU and a future relationship agreement coming into force.  The period will provide time for businesses and citizenship to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU based on the outcome of the negotiations on the framework for the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK. In this respect, the expectation is that the European Council will adopt additional Guidelines at its meeting on 22-23 March 2018 on the framework for the future EU-UK relationship.

We rely on external demand and access to international trade markets for sustainable and continued economic growth.  Trade constitutes an increasingly important means of creating more and better jobs and growing our economy.  The combination of export-led growth and foreign direct investment has transformed Ireland&rsquo;s economy over recent decades.</p><p>In view of the potential impacts of Brexit, promoting access to and deepening existing trade relationships across a diversified portfolio of export markets has taken on even greater importance for Ireland.  My Department&rsquo;s focus on trade diversification includes markets that are growing and have scale as well as markets where we are already well established but with potential for further growth.  Through the Government&rsquo;s Trade Strategy, <i>'Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World</i>&rsquo;, we aim by 2020 to increase indigenous exports by Enterprise Ireland supported companies, including food, to reach &euro;26 billion, achieve 80% of indigenous export growth outside of the UK market and secure 900 new foreign direct investments.  </p><p>Most recently, the EU&ndash;Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA) entered into force provisionally from 21 September 2017.  This means that Irish companies may now take advantage of the all important provisions of CETA including the elimination of tariffs on almost all key exports, access to the Canadian procurement market, the easing of regulatory barriers and more transparent rules for market access.  CETA will present new opportunities for Irish business and professionals to work and provide services in Canada.</p><p>The EU and Mexico hope to reach political agreement early this year on the modernisation of the EU-Mexico Global Agreement, to include provisions on regulatory cooperation, increased trade in agriculture and food, common sanitary (health) standards and sustainable development. Ireland supports comparable trade conditions for investors and businesses across the Americas, making it easier for Irish businesses to trade in and enter these markets.  Negotiations with the Mercosur countries continues and political agreement was reached last year with Japan on an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA).  The EU/Japan EPA has the potential to generate significant benefits for Ireland.  The agrifood sector, which is Ireland&rsquo;s largest indigenous industry, will see particular benefits, with improved access for beef and dairy products. The Agreement will also ensure tariff elimination on medical devices and pharmaceutical products which are manufactured in Ireland.</p><p>Moreover, in his September 2017 State of the Union Address to the European Parliament, Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the European Commission, proposed opening trade negotiations with Australia and New Zealand.  The draft negotiating mandates for Australia and New Zealand are currently being discussed by the Commission and Member States.</p><p>The EU&rsquo;s suite of Free Trade Agreements coupled with our programme of Minister led trade missions and bilateral visits overseas have provided a key foundation on which to further build our strong economic and trading links in export markets and this will continue.  Enterprise Ireland delivered an impressive programme of international trade events in 2017, giving Irish companies the opportunity to meet with potential buyers and network with key influencers in countries around the world.  In total, 57 internationally focused trade events were organised by Enterprise Ireland in 2017 including ministerial-led trade missions to Canada, Singapore and Japan, the UAE and Oman, and a major trade programme as part of the Presidential State visit to Australia.</p><p>Ireland will also continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements giving Irish firms expanded market access and a predictable trading environment in third countries.  To this end, my Department has commissioned a major examination of the economic opportunities and impacts for Ireland arising from EU Free Trade Agreements which we hope will be available later this year.</p></reply>

The programme awards funding on a competitive basis to Higher Education Institutions to build underpinning research infrastructure, develop postgraduate research education, and develop sustainable, long-term and broadly-based research capability in key strategic research areas. </p>  <p>  The PRTLI has involved &euro;1.2 billion of public and private investment to date in physical research facilities and support for human capital for research.  This has complemented the investments of Science Foundation Ireland and other research funders. </p>  <p>Up to 2010 the PRTLI was the responsibility of the Department of Education and Skills (DES), and was administered by the Higher Education Authority (HEA).  With effect from 1 May 2010 responsibility for the PRTLI transferred to my Department under the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order 2010.  The HEA was requested to continue administering PRTLI Cycle 5 on behalf of my Department. </p>  <p>  The transfer of functions was intended to bring together a streamlined and focused programme of funding of research and development and further strengthen the alignment of the programme with other R&amp;D programmes of my Department.  There are very significant synergies between the PRTLI and the Science Foundation Ireland human capital development activities which are in turn closely connected to industry and the work of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland. </p>  <p>  Innovation 2020 includes an action to scope out and develop a successor to PRTLI Cycle 5 to support new investment in research infrastructure.  It also contains an action to increase the enrolment of PhD and Research Masters students. While my Department is working closely with the Department of Education and Skills to develop a successor to achieve the aims of the PRTLI, there is no proposal to reallocate the programme back to the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  Pending a decision on a successor to PRTLI Cycle 5, and in the context of Budget 2018, the Government announced funding would be made available through my Department to address the need for increased enrolment of PhD and Research Masters students in disciplines aligned to enterprise needs.  This programme will be rolled out through Science Foundation Ireland and outline detail has been included in SFI's published work plan for 2018.</p>  <p>  My colleague the Minister for Education and Skills also announced a range of measures in Budget 2018 addressing physical infrastructure and human capital development in the higher education sector, including for research. </p>  <p>  While a decision has not yet been made regarding a new cycle of PRTLI, my Department will continue to work closely with the Department of Education and Skills and other Government Departments to ensure that all Government investment in research and innovation is well aligned and is focused on delivering on goals and targets as set out in Innovation 2020.</p></reply>

My Department has been working with the Department of Finance, Enterprise Ireland (EI) and Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and others to develop potential supports to respond to the needs of businesses impacted by Brexit.  The Brexit Loan Scheme, announced during Budget 2018, will provide affordable working capital financing to eligible Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit, or which will be in the future.  The Scheme will be delivered by the SBCI through commercial lenders to get much needed working capital into Irish businesses.  The Scheme aims to make up to &euro;300 million available to SMEs and Small Mid Caps Funds.  The Scheme will be open to businesses of up to 499 employees, which can also demonstrate that they are significantly exposed to the impact (or potential impact) of Brexit.  They must be a viable business, doing business in Ireland, and they must have a business development strategy.  The Scheme is expected to open for applications in late March 2018, and will run until 31 March 2020. </p>  <p>  EI offers a range of activities and supports to companies, including along the Border Region, to innovate and remain competitive in international markets.  Activities currently being undertaken by EI to ensure that client companies are resilient and agile include the following:</p>  <p>- EI is actively working with companies with global ambition to internationalise, and in doing so, diversify their global footprint.  To support this, on 1 February Enterprise Ireland launched a new Market Discovery Fund to incentivise companies to research viable and sustainable market entry strategies in new geographic markets.  This fund provides support towards internal and external costs incurred when researching new markets for products and services.</p>  <p>  - EI is working with its clients in the Border Region to drive innovation activity via supports that enable companies to diagnose their innovation readiness, provides financial support for in-house R&amp;D projects and fosters collaborations.</p>  <p>  - EI is working with companies to identify competitiveness issues and to support companies by providing access to a range of competitiveness building tools, including the Company Competitiveness Health Check, the Lean Offer and Green Offer. </p>  <p>  In addition, Enterprise Ireland provides supports to assist companies, such as those located in the Border Region, to be aware and to for prepare for Brexit, for example:</p>  <p>  - Launched a &lsquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rsquo;, a new interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars.</p>  <p> - Launched a Be Prepared Grant that supports the costs of SME clients in preparing a plan to mitigate risks and optimise opportunities arising from Brexit.

These supports are aimed at strengthening the capacity of micro and small businesses to cope with the changing external environment, especially the impacts arising from Brexit.  The supports include grants to assist LEO clients in diversifying their markets, targeted training and mentoring to address Brexit-related challenges and opportunities, as well as a Lean for Micro programme to help micro-enterprises to address competitive issues within their businesses by building the capability of their employees to identify problems and improve operations.  The six LEOs in the Border region are also working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme.  </p>  <p>  I am conscious that further efforts are needed to ensure that companies in the Border Region are resilient to economic shocks, such as Brexit.  To this end, I am committed to ensuring that Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs will continue to work with companies from the region to drive their innovation, competitiveness, internationalisation and Brexit preparedness.</p></reply>

In this regard, it is welcome that the direction of travel is now firmly towards achieving a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition period.  Agreement on a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition will provide certainty to individuals and businesses while also aiming to avoid any cliff edge effects between the UK leaving the EU and a future relationship agreement coming into force.  The period will provide time for businesses and citizenship to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU based on the outcome of the negotiations on the framework for the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK.  In this respect, the expectation is that the European Council will adopt additional Guidelines at its meeting on 22-23 March 2018 on the framework for the future EU-UK relationship.

The challenges will impact upon firms across a range of time horizons &ndash; from the immediate to the long-term. </p>  <p>  Work is underway across government to identify and address the issues arising as a result of Brexit.  Contingency planning at both a domestic and an EU level is focused on three areas: preparing for a no-deal scenario or so-called &ldquo;disorderly Brexit&rdquo;; preparing for a transition period based on the &ldquo;status quo&rdquo;; and preparing for the future EU-UK relationship.  DBEI is a significant contributor to this process, given the wide range of Brexit impacts across the Department&rsquo;s remit. </p>  <p>  While the outcome of the December European Council and the move on to Phase 2 has lessened the likelihood of a disorderly Brexit, very detailed work on a no-deal or worst-case-scenario is advancing intensively through the cross-Departmental coordination structures chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  This work is progressing and is focusing on possible mitigating measures.  This work is also informed by ongoing stakeholder engagement. </p>  <p>  My own Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (DBEI) plays a key role in implementing the Government&rsquo;s policies to stimulate the productive capacity of the economy and create an environment which supports job-creation and jobs maintenance. Brexit impacts upon all of these areas, and on many others within the Department&rsquo;s remit. </p>  <p>  My Department recently published &ldquo;Building Stronger Business&rdquo; which summarises the issues facing enterprise, the policy measures my Department has already taken, those we plan to take, our research programme designed to inform these policies, and the Departmental structural reforms put in place to ensure that we can work as efficiently and effectively as possible to support our companies.</p>  <p>  In relation to Brexit, our objective is to support firms to adapt to the challenges and opportunities Brexit presents by ensuring we have fit for purpose policies.  Our strategy is to minimise risks and maximise opportunities by ensuring the growth and resilience of Irish enterprise post-Brexit working across four pillars which are:</p>  <p>  - Helping Firms to Compete;</p>  <p>  - Enabling Firms to Innovate;</p>  <p>  - Supporting Firms to Trade;</p>  <p>  - Negotiating for the Best Possible Outcome;</p>  <p>  Several important steps have already been taken to prepare our economy, including through a range of measures announced in Budgets 2017 and 2018, the commitments included in APJ 2017, and the targets included in the Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy. </p>  <p>  From my Department&rsquo;s perspective, we are leveraging the expertise and enhancing the capacity of our Agencies to ensure that they are in the best possible position to address the needs of their clients in relation to competitiveness, innovation and trade diversification.  This is being achieved through the provision of information, advice, training and other supports. </p>  <p>  Specific DBEI actions to date include:</p>  <p>  - The roll-out of the Brexit Loan Scheme to provide affordable financing to Irish firms impacted by Brexit.  The scheme aims to make up to &euro;300 million available to business with less than 500 employees.</p>  <p>  - We are developing proposals for a Longer-Term Loan Scheme together with a new Business Advisory Hub service which would focus on business development to allow enterprises to position themselves for a post-Brexit environment. </p>  <p>  - The EU Commission has approved a &lsquo;rescue and restructuring&rsquo; scheme.  The scheme can be drawn on in exceptional circumstance for a company severely affected by Brexit. </p>  <p>  Looking forward, Action Plan for Jobs 2018 will continue to act as an effective lever for driving reforms that enhance the competitiveness of Irish firms, increase jobs and grow the resilience of our economy in the context of Brexit, while we are also finalising a review of Enterprise 2025 to take account of Brexit and other global challenges over the longer term. </p></reply>

The first year of the Enterprise Ireland (EI)  2017-2020 Strategy was a very strong year for job creation among EI clients with over 19,300 new jobs created in 2017, resulting in a net gain of 10,309 jobs across the country. In 2017 EI supported companies employed 209,338 people. 65 % of client employment is outside of Dublin.</p>  <p>  We are seeing growth in traditional industry sectors such as construction and manufacturing as well as in the Digital technology and LifeSciences sectors. </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices&rsquo; (LEOs) annual results for 2017 are expected to be available in early March.  The 31 LEOs are supporting their clients by providing information, training and mentoring on various issues as well as advice on other sources of support. Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur initiative rolled out by the LEOs has gone from strength to strength since 2014.  In 2017 we have had an amazing response nationally with almost 1,500 entries from young people up and down the country.  The national final will be held in March.  Start-ups and early stage entrepreneurs are a crucial part of a growing economy and the Government will continue to support and help them scale faster through the work of the LEOs and EI.</p>  <p>  The eight Regional Action Plans for Jobs are now embedded across the country and are good examples of local authorities, the Local Enterprise Offices and businesses working together to tackle regional issues.  To support the eight Regional Action Plans, and as part of the Government&rsquo;s strategic response to Brexit, additional funding of up to &euro;60m is being rolled out by EI over the next 4 years.  The Regional Enterprise Development Fund will support the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level.  This Funding will strengthen the enterprise capability and economic development potential within the regions.  Twenty-one successful applicants representing all regions of the country have secured up to &euro;30.5m for their projects in the first competitive call.  The second call is planned to be launched by EI in March 2018. </p>  <p>  A key priority of mine is to ensure that this Government remains true to our export led growth policies.  We will continue to support start-ups and ambitious companies across the country and help them scale faster through the work of the LEOs and EI.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-02-07a.370.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020700082#WRG02900"><p>My view is that competitiveness continues to be an important issue for business in Ireland, just as it is for all firms operating in a global marketplace.  Improving competitiveness is a multi-faceted process that involves efforts from both the private and public sector.  Firms must ensure that they are operating in the most efficient manner possible, adopting the newest approaches and technologies, training staff, reviewing processes, seeking out the competitive edge in their chosen market.  However, they must also ensure that their workplaces are safe, and provide an appropriate environment for staff.</p><p>In Ireland, as in all European Member States, regulation should be put in place in ways that achieve desired policy goals both efficiently and effectively.  The interaction between business and Government should be smooth and efficient, with clear communication from both sides.  Where this is not the case, we must strive to improve it.  Unnecessary burdens should always be avoided, but some costs are to be expected when we are aiming for the highest standards of protection for our workers and the environment, for example.</p><p>Ireland is already known to have a low burden of regulation, across the board, when benchmarked internationally.  Individual departments and agencies across the system seek the most efficient and effective ways to implement standards wherever they are necessary.  However, risks must be planned for, and the appropriate steps taken to ensure that workplaces remain safe for employees.</p><p>While there has been a welcome increase in economic activity and employment in Ireland, rising employment, can, however, bring with it an increase in the number and rate of workplace injuries unless businesses invest in appropriate occupational safety and health measures. </p><p>Poor safety and health workplace practices ultimately cost not just the individuals directly affected by a workplace accident but negatively impact on a business in terms of key staff absences, lost productivity, damage to stock and equipment and diversion of management time to coping with the outcome of the incident.  There is a cost too to the State.  The State Claims Agency estimates that the true costs of injuries to the State are approximately three times the claims cost.  According to CSO data, 1.72 million work days were lost due to work related injury and illness in 2016. </p><p>The Health and Safety Authority (HSA), which operates under the auspices of my Department, works to improve the management of safety, health and welfare in the workplace through a combination of promotional activity, workplace inspection activity and enforcement action.  The HSA enables employers and employees to improve safety and health in their workplaces with the provision of information and advice through helplines and the HSA website.  The HSA also provides specific tools to employers and employees to assist them in managing safety and health.  These tools include the BeSmart risk assessment tool and the e-learning portal HsaLearning.</p><p>BeSmart.ie<b></b>is the HSA&rsquo;s free online tool designed to help small business owners/managers to prepare risk assessments and safety statements for their own workplace.  The tool, now available to over 270 business types, aids compliance and saves time and money for businesses in meeting their legal obligations under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.</p><p>The e-learning portal, hsalearning.ie, provides free to access short online courses which serve to upskill those entering the workforce and those at work.  Online courses are provided for employers and employees to enhance workplace learning in sectors such as farming, construction, healthcare, education and small business.  Other courses are available on a range of topics and will assist employers to manage safety including: Preventing slips, trips and falls, Managing chemicals safely, Managing Bullying Complaints, and, Safety representatives.  The elearning portal also contains a group manager function which allows managers/supervisors to register groups of employees to take online courses and monitor their completion rates.  By downloading certificates of completion on passing the course assessment, employees can add to their training records. </p><p>In addition the HSA has a comprehensive programme of work planned for 2018 involving activities relating to farm safety, occupational health, vehicles and work at a height.  The HSA will also be carrying out in excess of 10,000 inspections across a range of sectors and will publish and disseminate information and advice on workplace safety and the safe use of chemicals.</p><p>Through this programme of work the HSA aims to prevent workplace injury and ill-health and so reduce the high costs of safety and health failures. Good workplace health and safety practices make good economic sense.</p></reply>

Improving competitiveness performance is a core focus of the work of the Government, and as part of this work my Department, its agencies and the National Competitiveness Council are continually engaged with relevant stakeholders on the particular policy needs required to support competitiveness.  The National Competitiveness Council, an independent advisory body, tasked with reporting through me to the Taoiseach and the Government on key competitiveness issues facing the Irish economy, is composed, amongst others, of business representatives&rsquo; bodies and companies from the  manufacturing and services sectors. </p>  <p>  In its 2017 Competitiveness Challenge Report, the Council has identified a range of threats to Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness, including the potential impact of Brexit, our cost base, the shortage and cost of residential property, the concentration of our export markets and the range of products and services exported.  I share the Council&rsquo;s view that Ireland must address barriers to investment and growth, drive productivity performance and be responsive to competitiveness challenges and opportunities that are emerging. </p>  <p>  A more diverse export base can reduce exposure to external demand shocks, exchange rate fluctuations and instability in export earnings and enhance growth and jobs. Irish-based exporters, particularly in exposed sectors such as traditional manufacturing and agrifood, must continue to be supported to scale and diversify sustainably and strategically to reduce the market exposure which Brexit has highlighted.  Enterprise Ireland is actively supporting firms develop new products, services for new and existing markets.  A range of supports and programmes for Product, Process or Services Development are available for established SMEs in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors. </p>  <p>  My Department is also working on developing markets beyond Ireland&rsquo;s traditional trading partners by doubling the number of trade missions and placing extra staff in overseas markets.  Consistent, sustained in-market presence by IDA Ireland is necessary to take advantage of emerging FDI growth opportunities across the globe.</p>  <p>   Following extensive engagement with Irish SMEs, we have developed the Brexit Loan Scheme which will be launched at the end of March 2018.  The scheme will provide short-term credit to businesses coping with working capital challenges.  Officials in my Department are exploring the development of a longer-term Development Loan Scheme which would assist firms in long-term investing for a post-Brexit environment and increase their competitiveness.</p>  <p>   To future proof the competitiveness of our economy, policy must support Ireland moving to the forefront of digital and innovative activity.  Irish business must therefore make greater use of the opportunities offered by online commerce, including cross-border trade. In this regard, the Trading Online Voucher Scheme administered by the Local Enterprise Offices assists small businesses to trade online by developing their e-commerce capability. </p></reply>

Nevertheless, multinational companies continue to invest and re-invest here with leading global firms from many sectors - including life sciences, ICT, engineering and digital media - all based in Ireland.  The contribution that these investments make to our wider economy remains highly significant. </p>  <p>  Ireland has many strengths when it comes to attracting FDI.  This includes, for example, our international competitiveness ranking, where we are rated as the 6th most competitive country by the Institute for Management Development (IMD).  Ireland also scores very highly in terms of key criteria for FDI including investment incentives, labour productivity and the adaptability and retention of talent.  As recognised by the IMD, many of Ireland&rsquo;s traditional assets including our education system, highly skilled workforce and pro-enterprise business environment add to our competitive advantage and are extremely attractive to inward investors. </p>  <p>  The IDA's 2017 Annual Results show that the Agency has performed very strongly over the last 12 months with total employment by overseas companies in Ireland now standing at a landmark 210,000 people.  This means that roughly one-in-five private sector jobs in our country result either directly or indirectly from FDI. </p>  <p>  The IDA&rsquo;s clients also created over 19,000 new jobs on the ground during 2017.  The net number of new jobs &ndash; meaning the total amount of positions created after allowing for job losses in other FDI firms &ndash; was roughly 10,500.  I am especially pleased as well that the benefit of all these jobs will be felt all across Ireland with every region posting net gains in jobs.</p></reply>

A key objective of each of the plans is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the unemployment rate of each region not more than one percentage point greater than the national average</p>  <p>  Data from the CSO (to Q2 2017) shows an increase of 53,500 people in employment across the State since Q2 2016: 84% of this increase is in numbers employed outside Dublin.  All regions have seen increases in numbers employed in the year to Q2 2017; all regions also saw a decrease in numbers unemployed.</p>  <p>  While overall results are strong, it is clear that not all regions are improving at the same rate, and there is no room for complacency.  The unemployment rate in three of the regions (Midlands: 9.3%, Mid West: 8.4% and South East: 8%) is at Q3 2017 at least 1 percentage point above the State average of 6.9%.  A continued focus on these regions is required to ensure they are being supported to achieve their economic potential</p>  <p>  In December last year I announced an allocation of &euro;30.5 million in funding to support enterprise capability in the regions, with 21 projects from all over the country receiving funding.  This Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) totalling &euro;60 million is being rolled out by Enterprise Ireland over the next 4 years to support the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level.  The Fund supports the ambition, goals and implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs.</p>  <p>  I look forward to supporting more regional initiatives through a second competitive call, which will be launched in March of this year.  I also look forward to working closely with the Regional Action Plan Implementation Committees, to continue to build on the excellent work they have carried out to date, with a focus on delivering on the employment targets set out for 2020.</p>  <p>  The Enterprise Agencies continue to work to contribute to employment and economic growth throughout all regions.  All regions saw increases in IDA employment over 2017, with 52% of new jobs supported by IDA Ireland located outside of Dublin.</p>  <p>  In addition, two-thirds (64%) of new Enterprise Ireland jobs created in 2017 were outside of Dublin.  The West, Mid-West and North West saw the largest level of increases at 7%.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for 2017-2020 aims to create a further 60,000 jobs, while sustaining existing ones, which will make an important contribution to jobs and economic growth across all regions.  IDA meanwhile will continue to target a minimum increase in investment of 30% to 40% in each region outside Dublin to 2019.  Additional funding of &euro;150m is being made available to the IDA to support its Regional Property Programme and drive job creation in the multi-national sector.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices operating under the auspices of the Local Authorities and Enterprise Ireland in every county continue to play a vital role in providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports to those wishing to start or grow their own businesses.  Results for 2017 are expected to be published shortly. The 2016 Local Enterprise Office (LEO) annual jobs survey results highlighted three consecutive years of local jobs growth in small and micro-businesses throughout the country: in 2016 there was a net increase of 3,679 jobs and total direct employment among LEO client companies stood at 34,634. </p>  <p>  I want to also draw your attention to the ongoing implementation of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Rural Development &ndash; &lsquo;Realising our Rural Potential&rsquo;. Launched in January 2017, the Plan contains over 270 actions to be delivered by a range of Government Departments, State agencies and other bodies to support the economic and social development of rural Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Action Plan includes commitments from a number of Departments and State agencies, including the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA, which will support employment and improve the quality of life for people living in rural areas.  A key component of the Plan is to support the creation of jobs throughout the regions to ensure that people who live in rural areas have increased opportunities for employment locally.  The Plan aims to deliver 135,000 extra jobs outside of Dublin by 2020.  </p>  <p>  The first 6 monthly progress support showed good progress in the implementation of the Action Plan; with delays to only 7 actions.  A second 6 monthly progress report for the Action Plan for Rural Development is currently in preparation and will be published in February 2018.</p>  <p>  Finally, my Department is also working closely with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in relation to the enterprise development aspect of the National Planning Framework and development of Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies, which will have a strong relevance for the future of rural Ireland. </p></reply>

Real progress has been made towards that target over the first three years of this strategy with half of all jobs created by IDA client companies since 2015 based outside Dublin.  Just under 30,000 jobs have been created in the regions in three years, a positive trend towards increasing the regional spread of FDI all over our country.</p><p>A key component of attracting potential multinational investors is the availability of IDA properties across all counties of Ireland.  The IDA is directly investing in such sites and facilities to increase the attractiveness of regional locations for FDI.  The Agency&rsquo;s Regional Property Programme (RPP), as announced in 2015, committed &euro;150 million in Exchequer funding over five years to drive the growth of regional FDI by providing property solutions outside Dublin.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland supports companies in urban and rural areas to start, innovate and remain competitive in international markets, now and into the future.  At the centre of the agency&rsquo;s strategy, <i>Build Scale, Expand Reach 2017 &ndash; 2020, </i>are strategic targets focused on:</p><p>- Assisting clients to create 60,000 new jobs by 2020 while sustaining the existing record level of jobs;</p><p>- Growing the annual exports of client companies by &euro;5bn to &euro;26bn per annum;</p><p>- Increasing the level of spend made by client companies in the Irish economy by &euro;4bn to &euro;27bn per annum by 2020; and</p><p>- Inspiring more Irish owned companies to have global ambition.</p><p>The 5,000 manufacturing and internationally traded services companies that Enterprise Ireland works with are a critical source of existing employment and job creation in every county in Ireland. In 2017 209,338 people were employed at Enterprise Ireland supported companies which includes the creation of 10,309 net new jobs.  In 2017 65% of employment in Enterprise Ireland supported companies was outside of Dublin. Employment growth was recorded across all counties. </p><p>In addition, Enterprise Ireland has invested in infrastructure to support building research and innovation capabilities within regions such as the national network of Technology located in Institutes of Technology through the country.  The Agency has also launched four accelerators outside of Dublin to enhance the high potential start-up ecosystem. Located in Galway, Clare and Waterford, these accelerators build on regional sectoral strengths.</p><p>The recently published Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) Jobs Results show that 3,700 new jobs were delivered in 2017 by start-ups and small businesses from across the country that have been supported by the LEOs.  This brings the total number of new jobs created by LEO-backed companies to 15,000 since the LEOs were set up in 2014.  The 31 LEOs located in every county in Ireland continue to play a vital role in providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports to those wishing to start or grow their own businesses.</p><p>I look forward to continuing to work closely with the Implementation Committees of the eight Regional Action Plans for Jobs, and the enterprise agencies to continue to build on the excellent work they have carried out to date, with a focus on delivering on the employment targets set out for 2020.</p></reply>

The previous regulations did not designate chiropractors as referrers or practitioners.   </p>  <p>  Ionising radiation has many beneficial applications however as the use of ionising radiation increases, so does the potential for health hazards if not properly used or contained.  The BSSD is an essential piece of legislation which protects the public, patients, workers and others from all forms of ionising radiation.  </p>  <p>  My Department conducted a general consultation on the BSSD in June 2017 and sought views on the provisions of the Directive where Member States had discretion.  The Chiropractic Association of Ireland (CAI) was included in my Department's notification of the consultation process and arrangements were made to contact all licence-holders of ionising radiation equipment advising them of the consultation.  Information on the consultation process was also posted on my Department&rsquo;s website.  No response was received from the CAI or any individual identifying as a chiropractor.  </p>  <p>  The statutory instrument transposing the BSSD will designate those who may refer for radiological tests, those who may carry them out and other functions and in this regard I propose to designate nurses, doctors, dentists and radiographers as appropriate.  The proposed designation of relevant professionals is based on patient safety and public health considerations reflected in the advice of the Chief Medical Officer.  </p>  <p>  The previous regulations lacked inspection or enforcement provisions, however, in the new regulations HIQA will have the inspection and enforcement powers to enforce compliance and contravention of the new regulations will be an offence.</p>  <p>  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has overall responsibility for the transposition of the BSSD.  My Department will finalise the medical provisions of the BSSD in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

This service plays a vital role in ensuring quality and continuity of care at the end of life stage, and enables people who wish to die at home to do so.  </p>  <p>  Night Nursing is accessed by referral through community-based specialist palliative care services and GPs.  A terminally ill person usually receives the service for between two and ten nights, depending on their need and how impending end of life is.  An external evaluation has shown that, broadly, families and healthcare professionals are happy with the service.</p>  <p>  Against the backdrop of an aging population in Ireland, coupled with increasing numbers of death from cancer, dementia, and neurodegenerative diseases, there is an associated increased palliative care need.  Because many people wish to die at home, there is an increased demand for the Night Nursing Service.  The Irish Hospice Foundation anticipates that the cost for services it provides will increase by up to 20% in the next few years.</p>  <p>  The HSE published its Palliative Care Services Three Year Development Framework in November 2017.  It acknowledges that, unfortunately, there are variations in the availability of specialist palliative care services, including out of hours care . The Framework seeks to identify the gaps which exist in the current level of adult palliative care service provision.  A national review of the need for access 24 hour / 7 day services has commenced.</p>  <p>  One of the Framework&rsquo;s actions points is that night nursing should be regarded to be a core generalist service, and that steps should be taken to progress, on a phased basis, towards the State providing 50% of the funding required for the current Night Nursing Service.  Discussions are already under way between the HSE, the Irish Cancer Society, and the Irish Hospice Foundation to determine a timeframe to achieve this. </p>  <p>  The Government respects the desire of people who wish to remain in their own home, especially in the final days of their lives.  My Department and the HSE are committed to ensuring that terminally ill people are treated with dignity and that their wishes are facilitated, as far as is practicable.</p></reply>

I am informed by the HPRA that the enzyme thiaminase is not added during the manufacture of Gardasil HPV vaccine and is not used as an ingredient in the final medicine.  Like all other medicines manufactured using cell technologies, trace amounts of residual proteins from these cells, which would include any residual thiaminase, may be present in the final Gardasil product.  Gardasil meets EU regulatory requirements by limiting these proteins to microgram amounts at which level they have no discernible effect.  Prior to each batch being placed on the market, testing is carried out to confirm that the level of residual proteins is less than the specified limit.</p>  <p>  Other medicinal products manufactured using such cells, including some insulin products, are used daily and over a long duration (often years), compared to Gardasil which is administered once or a maximum of three times.</p>  <p>  Gardasil is approved centrally by the European Commission, acting on the recommendation of the European Medicines Agency, for all EU Member States.</p>  <p>  Most instances of thiamine deficiency appear to be as a result of lack of dietary intake and/or in instances of intake of foods rich in thiaminase. Neither scenario applies to Gardasil or other medicines manufactured using similar cell technology.</p></reply>

The Framework identifies the activities that can be performed in smaller hospitals in a safe and sustainable manner.  These include extended day surgery, selected acute medicine, a local injuries service, a large range of diagnostic services, specialist rehabilitation medicine and palliative care.  In developing our smaller hospitals, as set out in the Smaller Hospitals Framework, the first and over-riding concern is the safety of patients. </p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made in the establishment and development of Hospital Groups over the last few years.  Our hospitals are now working together and supporting each other in Groups.  This new way of working provides a stronger role for smaller hospitals, like Monaghan Hospital, in delivering less complex care.  It also ensures that patients who require true emergency or complex planned care are managed safely in larger hospitals. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that the organisation of services between hospitals within a group is the responsibility and remit of the Hospital Group itself and is an area which is undergoing continuing development. </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific queries raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to you directly.</p></reply>

An estimated 55,000 people in Ireland have a form of dementia, and this figure is expected to nearly treble to 150,000 by 2046.  While the majority of people with dementia are aged over 65, it is important to remember that one in ten people diagnosed with dementia are under 65.</p><p>As a response to the increasing number of people with dementia, the Irish National Dementia Strategy was launched in December 2014.  The Strategy aims to improve dementia care to allow people with dementia to live well for as long as possible and have services and supports delivered as well as possible.  My Department and the HSE are working on a review of the implementation of the National Dementia Strategy which will be published in the first quarter of 2018 and will identify what has been achieved so far and set out the further work that is required to implement the Strategy.  The work on the review will feed into the estimates process for 2019 and subsequent years.</p><p>In parallel with the Strategy, the National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme (NDSIP) was set up by the Department of Health, the HSE and Atlantic Philanthropies.  &euro;27.5 million was committed to the Programme for a three year period across a number of initiatives, including dementia specific intensive home care packages, an education and training programme for GPs and Primary Care Teams, and an information and awareness campaign which seeks to challenge public misconceptions about dementia and the challenges facing people living with dementia.  My Department and the HSE have committed to maintaining the NDSIP structures and oversight arrangements for at least a period of 5 years up to the end of 2019.</p><p>In the medium term, the HSE plans to create compassionate, inclusive communities for people with dementia and their carers, by building a network of local and national partnerships under the Dementia Understand Together campaign.  Plans are progressing to further implement <i>The Irish National Dementia Strategy, 2014 </i>through the National Dementia Office and <i>The National Carers&rsquo; Strategy, 2012</i>. </p><p>In 2017, my Department secured &euro;1.23 million in Dormant Accounts funding to develop a number of projects which are designed to expand public awareness of dementia and to improve care for people with dementia.  These projects include a national post-diagnostic support pathway, a national dementia registry, and the staffing of assistive technology libraries in all CHOs. </p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring that people with dementia continue to live their lives as fully as possible, in their own homes and communities for as long as they can.  We are committed to supporting the work of the National Dementia Office in creating meaningful projects which will have a lasting positive effect on the lives of people with dementia, their carers and families.</p></reply>

In this capacity, the Department of Health is working closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to address the many challenges resulting from Brexit.  This co-operation also involves the relevant State Agencies. Contingency planning at both a domestic and an EU level is focused on three areas: preparing for a no-deal scenario or so-called &ldquo;disorderly Brexit&rdquo;; preparing for a transition period based on the &ldquo;status quo&rdquo;; and preparing for the future EU-UK relationship.</p>  <p>  While the outcome of the December European Council and the move on to Phase 2 has lessened the likelihood of a disorderly Brexit, very detailed work on a no-deal or worst-case-scenario is advancing intensively through the cross-Departmental coordination structures chaired by the Department for Foreign Affairs and Trade . This work is also informed by ongoing stakeholder engagement.  Separately, a new preparedness unit in the Commission is considering EU-level responses. </p>  <p>  All this work provides a baseline scenario for the policies and sectors impacted, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations.  In this regard, it is welcome that the direction of travel is now firmly towards achieving a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition period.  Agreement on a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition will provide certainty to individuals and businesses while also aiming to avoid any cliff edge effects between the UK leaving the EU and a future relationship agreement coming into force.  The period will provide time for businesses and citizenship to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU based on the outcome of the negotiations on the framework for the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK.  In this respect, the expectation is that the European Council will adopt additional Guidelines at its meeting on 22-23 March 2018 on the framework for the future EU-UK relationship.  These guidelines &ndash; as well as further clarity on the UK position, which has been sought by the European Council &ndash; will provide a clearer picture of the direction of travel in the negotiations.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health and its agencies have been conducting detailed analysis on the impacts of Brexit in the area of health.  A number of issues are being examined and contingency planning for a range of eventualities is under way.  A key issue will be to ensure that there is minimum disruption to health services and that essential services are maintained on a cross-Border, all-island and Ireland-UK basis.  The health sector has a highly mobile workforce and free movement issues and the mutual recognition and assurance of professional qualifications are being considered.  On regulatory issues, it is clear that having a single set of rules across the European Union is enormously helpful &ndash; to protect human health, to ensure consumer protection and to provide a level playing field for industry.  Ensuring continuity in the supply of medicines and medical devices following the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU is a priority.  The issue of customs is of relevance as it relates to additional food safety controls and medicines.  The implications of Brexit for networks and organisations such as the EU Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed, the European Reference Networks on rare diseases and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control are also under consideration. </p>  <p>  These issues are currently being examined by my Department and its agencies and this work will continue over the period ahead. The key priorities for my Department are to ensure continuity in the provision of health services and to avoid, or mitigate changes to the current situation that would have a negative impact on human health. These are also key factors in considering the prioritisation of risks. </p>  <p>  In terms of allocation of resources, the Deputy Secretary, Policy and Strategy Division, and the Assistant Secretary, R and D and Health Analytics Division are the lead officials in my Department for planning and coordination in respect of Brexit.  The Department of Health participates fully in the Senior Officials Group on EU Affairs, the Interdepartmental Group on EU and Brexit and its workgroups as appropriate.</p>  <p>  The Department established a Management Board subcommittee on Brexit in advance of the UK referendum, to examine the implications of a decision to leave the EU.  The Subcommittee is chaired at senior level and made up of representatives from across the Department, as well as from the HSE, which is represented at National Director level.  </p>  <p>  Brexit raises many issues across a wide range of areas that need to be addressed.  Work on each specific issue involves line Units with policy responsibility.  In this way, work on Brexit-related issues is being mainstreamed throughout the Department. </p>  <p>Within my Department, the International and Research Policy Unit provides a co-ordinating function in relation to Brexit just as it does for other international matters and North-South cooperation.  The Department has a full-time EU health attach&eacute; assigned to the Permanent Representation in Brussels, who is in regular contact with International and Research Policy Unit and other Units throughout the Department.  Staffing and resources allocated to Brexit in my Department are kept under ongoing review.   </p>  <p>  Brexit has been identified as a specific priority in the HSE National Service Plan.  The HSE has established a Steering Group to examine and assess the issues and risks associated with Brexit and the implications for the Executive.  The group consists of representatives from across Directorates and is examining a number of priority areas.  Other agencies including the HPRA are also prioritising actions on Brexit including engagement with the EMA and stakeholders in Ireland.</p></reply>

It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating.  Lyme disease is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection. These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  The standard laboratory approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and has been agreed by experts from the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and other Irish and international experts.  This testing is available in Ireland. </p><p>Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics by General Practitioners.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may be considered.  </p><p>The HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre website<i>(</i><i>)</i>gives extensive information on Lyme Disease diagnosis, treatment and how to avoid tick bites.  A Lyme Disease Subcommittee of the Scientific Advisory Committee of HPSC with professional clinical, entomological, scientific and environmental health expert representation (including a representative of the Lyme Support Group, Tick-Talk Ireland) has been established to explore all possible ways of raising awareness about Lyme disease.  This Subcommittee is expected to meet shortly with a view to finalising it report.  This report will cover a number of areas, including initiatives undertaken to date, summary advice relating to awareness, preventive advice for the general public, preventive advice and material for those responsible for sites or locations known to have or suspected as having higher densities of ticks, and summary advice relating to GP management of the condition.  Any person who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms. </p></reply>

The Review was tasked with outlining the potential effects of reform scenarios on the demand for health and social care services. It was not tasked with modelling the potential impact of the Sl&aacute;intecare proposals on future demand and capacity, although the reform scenarios outlined in the Review align with the principles underlying Sl&aacute;intecare.  Further, the Capacity Review recognised that Sl&aacute;intecare provides the direction of travel for reform of healthcare delivery.  My Department is developing an implementation plan for the Sl&aacute;intecare Report and I expect to bring proposals to Government shortly.</p>  <p>  The Review has established two extremes that define the indicative range and scale of potential capacity needs up to 2031 and the level of reforms involved.  The review recognised that further work would be needed to assess the optimum reform strategy that takes account of workforce, the whole life cost of services, eligibility arrangements and their impact on implementing reforms, the feasibility of delivering infrastructure and impact on operational services in the timeframe.  As the Deputy will appreciate, costing is an important and complex process in its own right.  For example, it is important to state that there is no one cost for a hospital bed.  The cost is dependent on the nature of the bed (such as Inpatient, Daycase, critical care), the specialty and where the bed will be delivered (for example, an existing hospital, an extension, or a new development).  Following from this, the findings of the report have been the subject of discussions with the Minister for Public Expenditure in the context of the forthcoming National Development Plan.</p>  <p>  As a final point, I would like to reiterate what I have stated previously, that adding additional capacity can't be the only answer.  In tandem, we need fundamental reform of our health system - with significant development of the primary and community care system, and Sl&aacute;intecare provides the blueprint for this.</p></reply>

The decision on when to clearfell is an important one, the right decision will  maximise potential returns to the owner. </p>  <p>  The Department have recently developed an online Felling Decision Tool, which aims to provide owners with information on estimated timber revenues and forest characteristics (wood volumes per hectare, tree top height, and mean tree size in cubic metres) at different stages in the forest cycle.  This tool may be used to assist in deciding when to clearfell, by providing financial information on the implication of felling earlier or later than when the financial returns are normally at their highest.  This may enable landowners to get a better return from their investment in forestry, as well as providing the revenue needed to cover reforestation costs to continue the forest cycle. </p>  <p>  The All Ireland Forecast shows that there is the potential to increase the private harvest by over 2.5 million cubic metres by the end of the next decade.  Based on this forecast, the value of timber harvested in 2017 by private forest owners in County Leitrim can be estimated at &euro;1.2 million.  However, it is the continuous cycle of activity that takes place within the entire forest estate that delivers benefits for the wider economy.  These activities begin in the forest nursery where the trees are grown, forests are then established which requires machines to prepare the site and people to plant and care for the trees.  Forest roads are needed prior to first thinning, which could be followed by up to three further thinnings before the final clearfell.  Haulage companies are then hired to transport the logs to processors.  Once the trees are felled the forest is replanted and the cycle restarts from the beginning. </p>  <p>  The network of companies established to service the forest industry within Leitrim and throughout the country is only possible because the national forest estate has achieved a scale that can support these businesses.  While it is the case that forest owners do not receive a forest premium on the second and subsequent rotations, forests will start to generate an income at first thinning.  However, when we look beyond the individual forests and look at the wide range of activities that take place throughout the 28,000 hectares of forestry in County Leitrim the wider benefits become apparent. </p></reply>

This work is also informed by ongoing stakeholder engagement. Separately, a new preparedness unit in the Commission is considering EU-level responses. </p>  <p>  All this work provides a baseline scenario for the policies and sectors impacted, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations.  In this regard, it is welcome that the direction of travel is now firmly towards achieving a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition period.  Agreement on a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition will provide certainty to individuals and businesses while also aiming to avoid any cliff edge effects between the UK leaving the EU and a future relationship agreement coming into force.  The period will provide time for businesses and citizenship to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU based on the outcome of the negotiations on the framework for the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK.  In this respect, the expectation is that the European Council will adopt additional Guidelines at its meeting on 22-23 March 2018 on the framework for the future EU-UK relationship.  These guidelines &ndash; as well as further clarity on the UK position, which has been sought by the European Council &ndash; will provide a clearer picture of the direction of travel in the negotiations.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s contingency planning continues to be firmly grounded in the extensive work and outreach that has already been undertaken by individual Departments and agencies, as well as by stakeholder organisations, academics and others.  Much of this is in the public domain. </p>  <p>  My Department has conducted a range of analysis and research activities in relation to Brexit.  This work is ongoing, and is primarily concerned with the implications of Brexit for agrifood trade with the UK across different sectors.</p>  <p>  For example, both internally and in consultation with the relevant stakeholders through the Brexit Stakeholder Consultative Committee and the All-Island Civic Dialogue process, my Department has established the extent of sectoral exposure to the UK market, the potential implications of Brexit for each sector and the possible responses to the challenges presented.  It has also been analysing the potential practical impact on the day-to-day functioning of trade flows, as well as potential tariffs that might be applied to Ireland's agrifood exports to the UK in the event of a 'hard' Brexit.</p>  <p>  The agencies reporting to my Department have also undertaken important research in relation to Brexit, with Teagasc publishing reports on, for example, the potential implications for the Irish agrifood sector in overall terms and on the implications for family farm incomes, and Bord Bia conducting important work through its Brexit Barometer. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is in ongoing contact with the relevant agencies and with other Departments in the context of reviewing research on the implications of Brexit for the agrifood industry, and with a view to identifying further potential areas of research.</p></reply>

Firstly, in cooperation with my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I established a new &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo; aimed at providing affordable, flexible financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or who will be in the future.  The Scheme aims to make up to &euro;300 million of working capital finance available to SMEs and mid-cap businesses (up to 499 employees), at least 40% of which will be available to food businesses.  </p>  <p>  Due to State Aid rules, this new Scheme will not be available to farmers and fishermen, so I am also introducing a separate loan scheme in 2018 similar to the 2017 low-cost scheme, based on &euro;25m funding from my Department to the Scheme.  These measures are aimed at enhancing competitiveness within the sector.</p>  <p>  I have also introduced supports for Bord Bia for investment in their market insight and market prioritisation initiatives which are aimed at identifying and developing potential diversification opportunities.  I have already increased funding to Bord Bia by &euro;10 million since the Brexit vote, and a further &euro;4.5 million is allocated in Budget 2018. </p>  <p>  To enhance product diversification, I have also allocated funding to support the development of the new National Food Innovation Hub, which will be located in Teagasc Fermoy, Co. Cork. </p>  <p>  On the issue of staffing, shortly after the Referendum I established a dedicated Brexit Co-ordination Unit within my Department&rsquo;s EU &amp;amp; International Trade Division. This Unit now forms part of a new Brexit and International Trade Division.  It comprises eight staff working full-time on the co-ordination of Brexit issues, plus a full-time Head of Division, who in turn reports to an Assistant Secretary General deeply engaged in Brexit issues, in addition to discharging other responsibilities. </p>  <p>  The Unit co-ordinates the ongoing analysis, consultation and engagement activities being undertaken by a large number of administrative, technical and veterinary staff, through an internal Brexit Response Committee comprised of 16 people drawn from the wide range of Divisions affected by Brexit (including, for example, Meat and Milk Policy, Animal Health and Welfare, Food Industry Development, Economics and Planning, and Seafood Policy and Development).  It also feeds into the whole-of-Government co-ordination being undertaken by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. </p>  <p>  While The Brexit Unit has its full complement of staff at present, I will continue to monitor the future workforce needs of both my Department, our Agencies and the Brexit Unit, and will be keeping resource requirements under close review as the negotiations proceed.</p>  <p>  The funding allocated to Bord Bia allows them to employ additional staff, some of whom will be based abroad, in line with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Global Footprint initiative to double the Team Ireland footprint on the international stage by 2025.  The number and deployment of these staff is an operational matter for Bord Bia and the Deputy may wish to contact Bord Bia directly at the agreed Oireachtas contact address : info@bordbia.ie</p></reply>

NAS are currently fitting their ambulances with digital mobile terminals (MDT) that allow responding crews to have the call details sent to their MDT screens together with the Eircode and a location map to assist with arrival at the correct location. </p>  <p>  Eircodes are being used by public sector bodies including, CSO, OSi, National Transport Authority, Student Universal Support Ireland, Local Authorities, Revenue, Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Health Service Executive.  Other state bodies and agencies that interact with the public have incorporated Eircodes into their operational systems. </p>  <p>  Google have integrated Eircodes into Google Maps and TomTom and other satnav providers are currently in the process of integrating Eircodes into their satnav apps for use by consumers and businesses.</p>  <p>  To date there are over 800 business organisations who licence and use Eircodes within their business operations across a wide spectrum of sectors.  A number of these organisations are both international and Irish SMEs that develop business solutions and apps utilising Eircodes for their customers.  One such Irish SME developed free Eircode mobile app based on Google Maps that is used extensively by courier/delivery drivers who deliver parcels every day with Eircodes.  This app was used c.100,000 times to give satnav directions in October and over 600,000 times since launch in 2016. </p></reply>

In addition, significant infrastructure investment is currently being undertaken by Gas Networks Ireland to twin a 50km stretch of pipeline of the Southwest Scotland onshore gas system between Cluden and Brighouse Bay, in investment by the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) has maximised its storage in all available storage facilities in Ireland, and further  investment will be undertaken by the State owned ESB  when decisions are made on the most appropriate successor to the Moneypoint generation facility. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2018 I secured over &euro;150 million for investment in  a range of energy policy interventions, including the introduction of a new Support Scheme for Renewable Energy, expanded energy efficiency programmes, the introduction of a new grant  to support heat pumps and  new supports for electric vehicles with the introduction of a new home charger  installation grant and support for enhanced charging infrastructure and demonstration projects. </p>  <p>  In relation to broadband, My Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy 2016-2019 outlines as an objective  &ldquo;To contribute to the on-going growth and development of Irish economy and society by continuing to develop a stable, innovative and secure digital communications and services infrastructure.&rdquo; </p>  <p>  The Government's National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to ensure high speed broadband access (minimum 30 megabits per second) to all premises in Ireland, regardless of location.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector.  Today, almost 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to a high speed broadband connection.  By the end of this year that number will rise to nearly 8 out of 10 premises and by 2020 will reach 9 out of 10 premises.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.</p>  <p>  My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area and that procurement process is nearing the final stages.  Delivering high speed broadband to citizens across Ireland remains a firm commitment for me and for this Government.</p></reply>

This work is also informed by ongoing stakeholder engagement.  Separately, a new preparedness unit in the European Commission is considering EU-level responses. </p><p>All this work provides a baseline scenario for the policies and sectors impacted, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations.  In this regard, it is welcome that the direction of travel is now firmly towards achieving a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition period.  Agreement on a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition will provide certainty to individuals and businesses while also aiming to avoid any cliff edge effects between the UK leaving the EU and a future relationship agreement coming into force.  The period will provide time for businesses and citizens to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU based on the outcome of the negotiations on the framework for the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK. In this respect, the expectation is that the European Council will adopt additional Guidelines at its meeting on 22-23 March 2018 on the framework for the future EU-UK relationship.  These guidelines &ndash; as well as further clarity on the UK position, which has been sought by the European Council &ndash; will provide a clearer picture of the direction of travel in the negotiations.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s contingency planning continues to be firmly grounded in the extensive work and outreach that has already been undertaken by individual Departments and agencies, as well as by stakeholder organisations, academics and others.  Much of this is in the public domain.</p><p>Brexit is a key strategic risk for my Department and in addition to the work on contingency planning as outlined above, there are ongoing consultations and meetings between my officials, other Government Departments and agencies, and other public and private key stakeholders in order to continue to plan for and mitigate the risks associated with Brexit. </p><p>As part of my Department's preparations for Brexit, I hosted an All-Island Transport and Logistics Sectorial Dialogue in Dundalk on 23 January 2017 as well as an All-Island Dialogue on tourism the same day.  The Dialogues were attended in total by over 200 transport and civic representatives from North and South.  Details of these events are published on the Department&rsquo;s website (at www.dttas.ie/publications).  My Department also held a stakeholder workshop in April of last year on the possible impacts of Brexit on maritime transport regulation and on the sectors on which this impacts. </p><p>The Department is represented at meetings of a sub-group of the National Civil Aviation Development Forum, at which Brexit is a standing agenda item.  The sub-group includes representatives from the airlines, airports, regulators and my Department and meets approximately every two months.  My Department also chairs a Tourism Brexit Working Group, which includes representatives of the main tourism agencies.  </p><p>My officials will continue to work with the road haulage, tourism, aviation and maritime sectors and stakeholders in order to further identify and plan for the implications of Brexit, including through a number of stakeholder meetings expected to take place during Q1 of 2018.</p><p>The Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) is undertaking a study for the Department into the use of the UK Land bridge by Irish importers and exporters.  The purpose of this research is to establish the volume of traffic using the UK Land bridge at present, the likely consequences that Brexit will have on Land bridge usage and the various alternative options that may be viable.  I expect this piece of research to be completed in Q1 of 2018.  This research is being carried out through existing research and analytical resources within the IMDO.  <b></b></p><p>In informing its position, the Department also avails of published analyses by other Government Departments and agencies, details of which are published on the Brexit page of www.merrionstreet.ie.</p></reply>

As part of these measures, 2 million euro was secured for digital investment in tourism marketing.  This is critical in the context of Brexit, the weakening of Sterling after the UK referendum, and the decline in visitors from Britain.  The 9% VAT rate on tourism services was also retained in Budget 2018 and this will also assist in mitigating the impact of this decline.</p>  <p>  Brexit has the potential to have serious adverse economic transport and tourism impacts and as a result has been identified as the main strategic risk facing the Department.  The Department in response has organised itself internally to prepare for Brexit.  While all relevant areas of the Department are actively engaged in Brexit-related work and consultation with stakeholders, overall responsibility for the preparation and coordination of the Department's response to Brexit has been assigned to the Head of Function in the Policy, Governance and EU Division.  This Division was created in mid-2017 with strengthened resources to allow a more strategic focus on a number of key issues, including Brexit.  Brexit issues relating to Tourism are managed by the Head of Function of the Tourism Marketing Policy and Impact Assessment Division. Both Heads of Function are Principal Officers. </p>  <p>  The oversight and support teams that deal with Brexit issues in addition to other duties are 3 staff in the Policy, Governance and EU Division and 3 staff on the tourism side. </p>  <p>  The Management Board has, and will continue, to keep under review the Department's internal organisation and structures for Brexit to ensure that they remain robust in addressing the evolving Brexit situation. </p>  <p>  The matter of additional staffing in the Department's agencies is a matter for those agencies and I have referred the Deputy's question to the agencies for direct reply to the Deputy.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-02-07a.643.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020700087#WRM01300"><p>In general terms, the increased premium costs of motor insurance for all drivers in recent years is certainly cause for concern. It is clear that this, particularly in the couple of years up to 2016, has also affected those working within the small public service vehicle industry.  I am informed that there some early signs that this trend is beginning to regress, with recent CSO figures showing that motor premiums generally were 14% lower in September 2017 compared with a year earlier.</p>  <p>  The pricing of insurance products is a commercial issue for insurance companies, based on an assessment of the risks that they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions on which insurance products are offered.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I am keenly aware of how insurance issues are affecting the taxi industry.  As you may be aware, the Department of Finance Working Group's Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.  Based on recommendations from this report, the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles (SPSVs) met with Insurance Ireland on 22 May to discuss cost of motor insurance issues relating to the taxi industry and a report on same was issued to me on 21 June 2017.  I have forwarded the report to Minister of State Michael D'Arcy, who is the chair of the aforementioned Working Group.  That Group is already pursuing many of the recommendations arising from the meeting, and I understand that the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles plans to have further meetings with Insurance Ireland.  It is my hope that the work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group, together with the good cooperation and engagement between the Advisory Committee on SPSVs and the insurance industry, will deliver better rates for all motorists including taxi drivers.</p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland operates a free insurance information service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.  All calls regarding refusal to quote, or quotations that are so excessive as to be in effect a refusal, should be directed to Insurance Ireland by phone at (01) 676 1820, by email at declined@insuranceireland.eu or by post at 5 Harbourmaster Place, IFSC, Dublin 1 quoting the Declined Cases Agreement.</p></reply>

Matters in relation to Brexit were also discussed by over 100 children and young people in April 2017 as part of the annual regional Comhairle na n&Oacute;g Networking event.  More recently, the Ombudsman for Children, together with the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People, hosted a meeting of children and young people from North and South on the impact of Brexit in Newry on Friday 10th November . This event was attended by the Secretary General of my Department. </p>  <p>  This engagement has enabled my Department to table those issues which may impact on children and young people, post-Brexit, and indeed identify those issues which resonate most strongly with our youngest citizens.  However, it is important to note that such matters are as a rule subsets of much larger items which will be considered in conjunction with colleagues in the Departments of Finance, Justice and Equality, Education, and Health as part of the wider negotiating process.  The direct impact of Brexit on my Department, and the agencies under its remit, is very limited, and there is at present no requirement for dedicated Brexit resources . No additional staff have been recruited to undertake work on Brexit matters in my Department and no additional funding has been provided to my Department or to the agencies under its aegis for the purpose of addressing issues relating to Brexit in 2018 or in other years. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to actively engage with the cross-Departmental Brexit coordination structures chaired by the Department for Foreign Affairs and Trade . I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to work closely with colleagues across Government to protect the rights of children and to address the many challenges resulting from Brexit.</p></reply>

The Control of Dogs Regulations 1998 set out further requirements that owners of 10 specific breeds of dogs, including the American Pit Bull Terrier, and every other strain or cross of these specific breeds, have to follow, namely that such dogs must be muzzled and led, on a sufficiently strong leash or chain not exceeding 2 metres in length, by a competent person over 16 years of age when in a public place.  </p>  <p>  These specific control requirements for restricted breeds provide a balanced and workable arrangement which recognises the rights of dog owners, respects animal welfare to the extent possible, while also taking account of the needs of society to be protected from dogs with a significant capability to inflict very serious injury, or cause death.</p></reply>

The scheme involves landholders as key participants in the provision of high quality walking trails, by contracting them to undertake maintenance work on sections of National Way Marked Ways and other priority walks that traverse their lands.  The landholders receive modest payments for maintenance work undertaken, in line with agreed work plans. </p>  <p>  The scheme currently covers 39 trails, with payments made to approximately 1,900 landholders to maintain those trails.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government and the Action Plan for Rural Development include a commitment to increase the number of trails covered by the Walks Scheme and my officials are working towards this objective.  I intend to initiate a comprehensive review of the scheme&rsquo;s operation this year in order to determine how best to expand the scheme and maximise the impact of the resources available to me.  This review will inform any decisions to be made regarding new walks to be included in the scheme.</p>  <p>  As significant consultation will be required with both landholders and other stakeholders, it is unlikely that any increase in the number of walks covered by the scheme will be implemented until late 2018 or early 2019.</p></reply>

The jobseeker will be advised at this meeting that a copy of their Exit Report will be forwarded to my Department for information and an Officer of my Department will be in contact with them to provide follow up activation support. </p>  <p>  Where a client does not attend this scheduled appointment for any reason, the Exit Report must still be completed and updated based on the information available and forwarded to the Department as set out above. </p>  <p>  JobPath providers are contractually required to register with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.

The current proposal in Section 5 of the Social Welfare Bill does <i>not</i>change this.  That protection will remain if the legislative proposal is adopted. </p><p>As the law currently stands, even if a card holder volunteers their PSC, a private sector organisation would be committing an offence by accepting it as they are not a &ldquo;specified body&rdquo;.  Customer feedback is that they should be allowed to volunteer the card to non-Specified Bodies if it suits them to do so, for the purposes of ID verification such as when signing up to a utility company contract or opening an account with a financial institution.  Customers often report that private companies insist on a State-issued photographic ID such as a Passport or Driver&rsquo;s License which they might not have and which are costly.  In contrast, the PSC is free of charge. </p><p>Therefore the legislative proposal is that non-specified bodies that accept a PSC that is offered to them voluntarily by the holder should not be prosecuted or at risk of prosecution.  At the same time, such non-specified organisations should not be able to request or force a person to use their PSC &ndash; that would remain an offence.  In other words, the volunteering of the card is the critical issue. </p><p>Furthermore, and for the sake of absolute clarity - this proposal in no way allows a private sector body to access the customer data on the card chip or on any government database - simply to view/accept the card as a form of identity and to stop it being an offence for them to accept it.</p><p>This measure will be beneficial to holders of the PSC, most especially those who do not hold a driving licence or a passport.  It is their identity and as such the holder should be allowed to volunteer it if they so choose, even in a commercial situation.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The person&rsquo;s Public Service Identity Dataset is verified as part of this process.  Adopted people are treated in the same way as other individuals in terms of verification of identity. Name, date of birth, place of birth and mother&rsquo;s birth surname are generally verified from the birth certificate or, in the case of an adopted person, from an adoption certificate. </p>  <p>  Generally, in the case of an adopted person, the details on the birth register will be different to those on the adoption register and not consistent with their current identity. </p>  <p>  As my Department has access to the Irish Birth Register the above details can be verified without the need for the individual to physically present a birth certificate, providing that the record can be located on the Register. </p>  <p>  However, in contrast, my Department does not have access to the Irish Adoption Register.  Accordingly, staff would not be aware of a customer&rsquo;s adoption status.  In such circumstances the individual is asked to bring a copy of their adoption certificate.

Adults in jobless households are not all unemployed; they include people who are not seeking work for reasons such as disability or caring responsibilities.  The plan therefore sets out to extend activation services to people who are not working but are not defined as unemployed by traditional measures.  It focuses in particular on improving employment rates of households with children &ndash; both the traditional &lsquo;nuclear&rsquo; family and the lone parent family.  A number of key policy actions to achieve that goal are currently underway, most notably:  </p><p>1.  <b>Extending active engagement</b>with the Intreo employment service to additional groups of economically inactive working age adults who could, with appropriate supports, take up employment.  In this regard, the process of increasing Intreo engagement with lone parents and with people with disabilities has been continuing since the publication of the Plan. </p><p>2.  <b>Progressing plans to pilot a new family focused case management approach</b>in five geographical areas (Limerick, Waterford, Cork, Dundalk and Tallaght) to improve employment rates and reduce joblessness in households across Ireland.  These pilots are being prepared and will commence in the first half of this year. </p><p>3.  <b>Improving the earnings of people with families when they transition from welfare to employment.</b>There are a number of social protection measures arising from Budget 2018 that strengthen this commitment: </p><p>- The National Minimum Wage has increased to &euro;9.55 per hour from January 2018.  This is an increase of 30 cent an hour and reflects this Government&rsquo;s commitment to make work pay.  This increase will directly benefit approximately 155,000 people and their families.</p><p>- The Qualified Child payment, which is paid to families with children, will increase from &euro;29.80 to &euro;31.80 for each child.  This is the first increase to this payment in over seven years and will benefit over 400,000 children.</p><p>- The Working Family Payment (formerly Family Income Supplement) thresholds increased by &euro;10 per week for families of 1, 2 or 3 children.  This scheme particularly benefits low-income working families and my Department will carry out a promotion and information campaign in the coming months to encourage families to see if they are eligible for this payment. </p><p>- The Back to Work Family Dividend, a payment for families with children who sign off their welfare payments and enter employment, was due to close to new entrants in March 2018.  I am keeping this scheme open, as it helps families make the transition from welfare to work.  Currently, over 8,000 families with 16,500 dependent children benefit from this payment. </p><p>- The income disregard for Jobseekers&rsquo; Transition recipients and lone parents returning to work increased by &euro;20 to &euro;130 per week.  This will benefit lone parents earning more than &euro;110 per week and is in addition to the &euro;5 increase in the weekly rate of payment and &euro;2 increase in the qualified child payment. </p><p>- In terms of services for children, funding has been increased for the School Meals programme to include the newly-designated DEIS schools.</p><p>- Finally, with regard to supports for families with children, I can confirm that we have retained funding to ensure that the increase of 25% to the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance announced in 2017 will be continued this year.</p><p>In order to drive action on household joblessness, progress against each of the reform actions and milestones will be monitored and reported on quarterly to the Cabinet Committee on the Economy and Jobs.  The plan also sets <b>two new headline targets</b>for 2020:</p><p>- Reducing the proportion of households that are jobless to 13% or less (from 18% in 2015), and</p><p>- Reducing the share of the 18-59 population resident in such households to less than 8% (from 12 &amp;amp; in 2015).  Performance against these targets will be published on an annual basis.</p><p>Implementation of the above policy measures should see the level of joblessness fall more rapidly than is already anticipated over the next few years.  These targets are in addition to the existing <i>Pathways to Work</i>targets 2020 &ndash; bringing unemployment down to between 5% and 6%, bringing long-term unemployment below 2.5%, and bringing youth unemployment below 12%.</p><p>The <i>Action Plan for Jobless Households</i>is about employment activation and removing barriers that are currently preventing people from getting a fair chance, and for some a second chance, which is at the core of building a Republic of Opportunity for all.</p></reply>

Participation on CE is intended to be for a temporary fixed term.  The participation limits aim to ensure the benefit of participation on a work scheme is available to the widest possible number of jobseekers.  In addition, it is generally recognised that shorter duration schemes are more beneficial for individuals in getting people back into mainstream employment.

This work is also informed by ongoing stakeholder engagement. Separately, a new preparedness unit in the Commission is considering EU-level responses. </p>  <p>  All this work provides a baseline scenario for the policies and sectors impacted, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations.  In this regard, it is welcome that the direction of travel is now firmly towards achieving a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition period.  Agreement on a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition will provide certainty to individuals and businesses while also aiming to avoid any cliff edge effects between the UK leaving the EU and a future relationship agreement coming into force.  The period will provide time for businesses and citizenship to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU based on the outcome of the negotiations on the framework for the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK.  In this respect, the expectation is that the European Council will adopt additional Guidelines at its meeting on 22-23 March 2018 on the framework for the future EU-UK relationship. These guidelines &ndash; as well as further clarity on the UK position, which has been sought by the European Council &ndash; will provide a clearer picture of the direction of travel in the negotiations.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s contingency planning continues to be firmly grounded in the extensive work and outreach that has already been undertaken by individual Departments and agencies, as well as by stakeholder organisations, academics and others.  Much of this is in the public domain.</p>  <p>  In relation to the areas under my remit, the key area of concern is the impact of Brexit on the current reciprocal arrangements for social insurance (which includes pensions) and social assistance (means tested schemes linked to residency rights) and child benefit between Ireland and the UK, including Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Department is continuing its assessment of the implications of Brexit on these areas on a scheme-by-scheme and client basis.

The Commissioner of Valuation has responsibility for valuation matters.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.</p>  <p>  Commercial rates form an important element of the funding of all local authorities.  However, the legislative basis for the levying of rates is spread over a number of enactments, some dating back to the 19th century.  Many of the provisions are outdated and not suitable for business trends in the modern era.  My Department has developed legislative proposals to modernise and consolidate the legislation governing commercial rates.  Among the measures included in the General Scheme of the Bill are provisions to allow a local authority to introduce rates alleviation schemes, which would include schemes to support the implementation of Realising Our Rural Potential: The Action Plan for Rural Development.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the Government last year approved the drafting of a Rates Bill.

It should be noted that the matter referred to is an operational matter for Waterford City and County Council, in the first instance.</p>  <p>  Official rough sleeper counts were conducted in a number of major urban centres on Census night April 2016 and no individuals were recorded sleeping on the streets of Waterford.  Given that the problem of rough sleeping is limited in most urban centres, including Waterford, official counts are not collected on an ongoing basis.  Nevertheless, I understand that Waterford City and County Council is aware of a small number of individuals that may engage in rough sleeping despite the availability of services including emergency accommodation.  Outreach teams continue to work to try and provide solutions for this group and to encourage these persons to avail of accommodation. </p></reply>

It is important to note that while my Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters.</p>  <p>  In relation to remedial works, under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014, primary responsibility for compliance of works with the requirements of the Building Regulations, including Part B (Fire Safety), rests with the owners, designers and builders of buildings.  Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts. </p>  <p>  In addition, local authorities also have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Fire Services Act 1981, the Housing Acts and the Planning and Development Acts, all of which may be relevant where fire safety concerns arise in residential developments. </p>  <p>  In August 2017, I published a Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings where concerns arise.  The Framework is intended to be used as a guide by the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern.  The Framework will also be of assistance to professional advisors both in developing strategies to improve fire safety and in developing strategies to enable continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations.</p>  <p>  In addition, in response to the Grenfell Tower tragedy and in recognition of fears expressed for fire safety, I tasked the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management in my Department, in June 2017, with co-ordinating a high-level Task Force to lead a re-appraisal of fire safety in Ireland.  I expect to be provided with their full and final report shortly.  </p>  <p>  In response to the many building failures that have emerged over the past decade, my Department introduced the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 (S.I. No. 9 of 2014), which require greater accountability in relation to compliance with Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction by registered construction professionals and builders, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates.</p>  <p>  A Certificate of Compliance on Completion is jointly signed by the builder and the assigned certifier.  This must be accompanied by plans and documentation to show how the constructed building complies with the building regulations and also the inspection plan, as implemented.</p>  <p>  At the end of May 2017, the Government approved the draft heads of a Bill to place the Construction Industry Register Ireland (CIRI) on a statutory footing and the Bill was referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning, and Local Government for pre-legislative scrutiny.  I received the Committee&rsquo;s report on 14 December 2017 and I am considering its recommendations, with a view to progressing the drafting as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Once it is enacted, the Bill will provide consumers who engage a registered builder with the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator and will complement the reforms which have been made through the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations and contribute to the development of a culture of competence and compliance in the construction sector.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Building Regulations, work has been on-going in my Department to review Part B/Technical Guidance Document (TGD) B &ndash; Fire (2006). A new Part B/TGD B Volume 2 (2017) came into force on 1 July 2017, in relation to dwellings.  Important revisions in the TGD B Volume 2 include enhanced provision for fire detection and alarm systems in dwelling houses, guidance on fire safety in community dwelling houses, guidance on timber frame construction, including new provisions in respect of timber frame party walls, enhanced provisions in respect of loft conversions, new provisions for galleries in dwelling houses and other general updates.  Work is currently underway on a revision to Part B/TGD B Volume 1, which will deal with all other buildings.</p></reply>

The new loan will enable credit worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties.  The low rate of fixed interest associated with the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan provides first time buyers with access to mortgage finance that they may not otherwise have been able to afford at a higher interest rate.</p>  <p>  To support prudential lending and consistency of treatment for borrowers, a  Loan to Value ratio of 90% as per the Central Bank's prudential lending guidelines applies to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.</p>  <p>  Therefore, to avail of the loan, applicants must have a deposit equivalent to 10% of the market value of the property.  The applicant(s) must provide bank or similar statements (post office, credit union, etc.) for a 12-month period immediately prior to making an application clearly showing a credible and consistent track record of savings.  The cash savings should be no less than 3% of the market value of the property.  Gifts are permissible up to 7% of the market value of the property where their source is verified.   </p>  <p>  The availability of the Help To Buy Scheme for first-time-buyers offers additional assistance to purchasers of newly built properties.  Up to 5% of the purchase price of properties below &euro;400,000 could be available, which represents a significant contribution towards these deposit requirements.  This should alleviate some of the challenges faced by first-time buyers in accessing the 10% deposit of the market value of the property.  The initiative has been designed to provide immediate and targeted support for first-time buyers in meeting their deposit requirements and encouraging the construction of new housing units. </p></reply>

This will, as was the case in the original LIHAF call,  be subject to matching funding  by local authorities, where the Department will provide 75% Exchequer funding, with the Local Authorities themselves providing 25% matching funding.  This will bring overall LIHAF funding to &euro;266 million.</p>  <p>  Following the first phase of submissions under LIHAF in late 2016, 29 projects have now proceeded to full approval and are at varying stages of design, procurement and construction of the infrastructure concerned, with most on track to complete the infrastructure in 2019 and with housing expected to be in place either in tandem with the infrastructure where possible or otherwise quickly thereafter.</p>  <p>  There will be a further call for proposals under phase 2 of LIHAF towards the end of Quarter 1 2018.  It will be open to all local authorities to submit new projects or resubmit previous projects for consideration at that time.  Following assessment and selection of successful projects, it is expected that these LIHAF 2 projects would commence towards the end of 2018.</p></reply>

This work is also informed by ongoing stakeholder engagement.  Separately, a new preparedness unit in the European Commission is considering EU-level responses. </p>  <p>  All this work provides a baseline scenario for the policies and sectors impacted, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations.  In this regard, it is welcome that the direction of travel is now firmly towards achieving a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition period.  Agreement on a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition will provide certainty to individuals and businesses while also aiming to avoid any cliff edge effects between the UK leaving the EU and a future relationship agreement coming into force.  The period will provide time for businesses and citizenship to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU based on the outcome of the negotiations on the framework for the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK.  In this respect, the expectation is that the European Council will adopt additional Guidelines at its meeting on 22-23 March 2018 on the framework for the future EU-UK relationship.  These guidelines &ndash; as well as further clarity on the UK position, which has been sought by the European Council &ndash; will provide a clearer picture of the direction of travel in the negotiations.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s contingency planning continues to be firmly grounded in the extensive work and outreach that has already been undertaken by individual Departments and agencies, as well as by stakeholder organisations, academics and others.  Much of this is in the public domain.</p>  <p>  In so far as my Department is concerned, the National Planning Framework for Ireland 2040 is due to be finalised shortly and, along with the Capital Plan and other long-term Government strategies, will play an important role in preparing for the consequences of Brexit.</p>  <p>  In May 2017, my Department and the Economic and Social Research Institute commenced a three-year programme of collaborative research.  The output of the research programme will be a series of published papers concerning housing economics and related topics.  Part of this programme will include work on estimating housing demand, including examining the implications for the housing market of changes in population levels which might arise over the medium term.  Net migration, whether due to Brexit or other factors, will be one of the variables considered.  The first outputs from the programme in relation to estimating medium to long-term housing demand are expected in mid-2018.</p></reply>

This work is also informed by ongoing stakeholder engagement. Separately, a new preparedness unit in the Commission is considering EU-level responses. </p>  <p>  All this work provides a baseline scenario for the policies and sectors impacted, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations.  In this regard, it is welcome that the direction of travel is now firmly towards achieving a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition period.  Agreement on a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition will provide certainty to individuals and businesses while also aiming to avoid any cliff edge effects between the UK leaving the EU and a future relationship agreement coming into force.  The period will provide time for businesses and citizenship to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU based on the outcome of the negotiations on the framework for the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK.  In this respect, the expectation is that the European Council will adopt additional Guidelines at its meeting on 22-23 March 2018 on the framework for the future EU-UK relationship. These guidelines &ndash; as well as further clarity on the UK position, which has been sought by the European Council &ndash; will provide a clearer picture of the direction of travel in the negotiations. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s contingency planning continues to be firmly grounded in the extensive work and outreach that has already been undertaken by individual Departments and agencies, as well as by stakeholder organisations, academics and others.  Much of this is in the public domain.</p>  <p>  In relation to the work undertaken by my Department with regard to Brexit, I would refer the Deputy to the replies given to Parliamentary Questions No. 923 of 20 June, No. 257 of 12 July, No. 741 of 11 September No. 586 of 7 November and No. 756 of 13 December.  </p>  <p>  The main forum for advancing North South cooperation is the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC), which was established under Strand Two of the Good Friday Agreement.  In the Council, the Government works with the Northern Ireland Executive to advance areas of practical co-operation which are to our mutual benefit, and the Council oversees co-operation in the agreed twelve Areas or Sectors.  The power-sharing Executive and the Assembly are responsible for representing the interests of all of the people of Northern Ireland, including in relation to how the issues arising with the UK exit from the EU should be addressed.  It is imperative that the devolved institutions can urgently operate again so that the North South Ministerial Council can resume its work and bring together the Government and the Executive to oversee and develop North/South cooperation, including that commenced last year to coordinate engagement by the Government and the Executive on dealing with the challenges raised on an all-island basis by the UK exit.  </p>  <p>  In six of these Sectors provided for under the Good Friday Agreement, co-operation is taken forward by means of the North South Implementation Bodies:  Waterways Ireland, Food Safety Promotion Board, InterTradeIreland, Special EU Programmes Body, North/South Language Body, and the Loughs Agency, all of which operate on an all-island basis.  </p>  <p>  My Department co-sponsors two of the six North-South Implementation Bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement, Waterways Ireland and An Foras Teanga / the Language Body.   </p>  <p>  My Department continues to participate in inter-Departmental preparations for Brexit and has established an internal Working Group to address all Brexit related issues affecting the Department and the State Bodies it funds, including the two North South bodies referred to above.</p>  <p>  The arrangements which I have outlined are kept under constant review and will be enhanced as required in light of the ongoing preparations for Brexit.</p></reply>
