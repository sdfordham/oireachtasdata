    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-02-13a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018021300058#WRA00800"><p>After an intensive two days of negotiations, I managed to secure a total package of fish quotas worth &euro;266 million for Irish fisherman for 2018.  This included an 8% increase in the value of whitefish quotas leading to a new total of &euro;152 million for the quota.  Ireland&rsquo;s quota for prawns also increased by 15% in 2018, which is the biggest single increase in over a decade and shows the very healthy state of this stock.</p>  <p>  The rebuilding of many other stocks was also demonstrated by a 34% increase in our whitefish quotas off the North-West coast and a 64% increase in the Irish Sea.  These are both areas that were severely depleted just five years ago.  This shows that the many years of intensive, industry led conservation measures are paying off.  The work done to rebuild these stocks has led to significant increases for quotas for our fleets.</p>  <p>  While we did have cuts in stocks including haddock and whiting in the Celtic Sea, these cuts followed the scientific advice to ensure a sustainable fishery.  In terms of the herring stock in the Celtic Sea, the reduction applied was in accordance with  the provisions of the industry led management plan for the stock.  This  management plan provides that reductions are applied to give time to allow the stock to rebuild thus supporting the fishery in the longer term.</p>  <p>  A very difficult aspect of the proposal concerned our recreational sea bass fishery.  The Commission had originally sought a complete ban on angling for 6 months of 2018.  After long discussions I argued successfully for a year round &lsquo;catch and release&rsquo; fishery instead that would not endanger the stock while protecting an important tourism resource.</p>  <p>  While there was a number of difficult issues, I am satisfied that this was a sustainable and balanced result overall.  Last December&rsquo;s Council was another important step towards the objective of having all stocks fished at maximum sustainable yield levels by 2020.  The steps taken this year will continue our progress to rebuild our fish stocks which underpin the future of our industry and our coastal communities.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-02-13a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018021300058#WRA01700"><p>The pursuit and development of new markets for Irish agri-food exports is of course an ongoing and central component of the strategic development of the agri-food sector, as evidenced by its placement right at the centre of Food Wise 2025, the industry&rsquo;s strategy for development over the coming decade. </p>  <p>  Indeed, this is all the more relevant after the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU, which may present significant new challenges for the agri-food sector. </p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa and the Gulf region.  Our efforts will be focused in these areas foreseeable future, but we will also be working hard to maintain our position and deepen market penetration in traditional markets such as those in the EU, including the UK, and the US.  </p>  <p>  In keeping with the priorities outlined in Food Wise 2025 I led a very successful Trade Mission to the Gulf Region in February 2017, visiting the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.  This was followed by an extensive Trade Mission to the US and Mexico in June.  These  markets offer significant potential for Irish exporters.  The US is the largest food and beverage market in the world and has a population of 324 million people.  Furthermore, some 35 million Americans claim Irish ancestry.  Mexico has a population of 127 million, making it the eleventh-largest country in the world in population terms and the fifteenth-largest economy in the world, with projections that it will move into the top five by 2050.</p>  <p>  I also led a trade mission, to Japan and South Korea in November 2017, accompanied by 40 representatives of the Irish food sector, as well as by experts from my Department, the Chief Executive of Bord Bia and senior representatives from Enterprise Ireland and Teagasc. </p>  <p>  This was a very opportune time to bring a delegation of Ireland&rsquo;s food leaders to this part of the world, given that the EU has concluded a Free Trade Agreement with South Korea as well as agreeing an Economic Partnership Agreement with Japan.  These are markets of high potential for beef, pigmeat and sheepmeat exports, and so it is important that we raise the profile of Irish agri-food enterprises that already have access to these markets, and make progress in negotiating access for others. </p>  <p>  I have also returned from Turkey recently, where live exports were the primary focus. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently making arrangements with Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland for a trade mission to the US and Canada at the end of the February.  This will include participants from across the agri-food sector and will feature extensive trade contacts as well as relevant  level political engagements. </p>  <p>  These and the other trade missions in 2018 will raise the profile of Ireland as a producer of high quality food, provide commercial opportunities for Irish business operators and improve  market access in these destinations. </p>  <p>  This work will be informed by market prioritisation exercise commissioned by my Department, and undertaken by Bord Bia.  This exercise identified opportunities in both new and more mature markets, and provides valuable market intelligence both for industry operators and policy makers.</p>  <p>  I have already overseen an intensification of my Department's efforts to develop a globally focussed agri-food sector, and since October 2016 I have provided more than &euro;14 million in additional funding to assist Bord Bia in its marketing and promotion efforts.  In addition, my Department will participate fully in the Government's plan to double Ireland's global footprint by 2025. </p>  <p>  Against the background of this work the value of Irish agri food exports has continued to grow and in 2017 exceeded &euro;13 billion.  I can assure the deputy that my Department and its agencies will continue to work closely with industry to identify new market opportunities for the Irish agri food sector. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-02-13a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018021300058#WRA02000"><p>I am aware that DEFRA have begun a consultation process on proposals to introduce a ban  on commercial third party sales of puppies and kittens in England, the outcome of which is not expected until later in the year.  The UK proposals are a matter of consultation so it is too early to speculate as to what their detailed impact on the sector in Ireland might be other than to note that the focus of the consultation document appears to be on methods of sale and not the issue of breeding or rearing.</p>  <p>  The Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 has general powers in relation to animals which places a duty of care upon all animal owners and handlers.  However the activity in question is  directly legislated for by the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010 which also has welfare as a central focus.  This Act is the responsibility of the Minister for Rural and Community Development and the individual Local Authorities in whose functional area any establishment is located.</p>  <p>  The need to safeguard animal welfare is one of the main reasons for which local Authorities have the power to refuse authorisation or to issue Improvement Notices of Closure Notices.  Such notices carry a right of appeal to the court system, which in some cases has been successfully used by establishment proprietors.</p>  <p>  The information available to me is that in the great majority of cases, such establishments operate without giving rise to serious animal welfare concerns.  Where serious deficiencies are found and the relevant local authority takes action it is also then the remit of the court system to deal with specific cases.</p></reply>

No. 605/2017.</p>  <p>  The new Action Programme places a particular emphasis on disrupting pollution pathways in order to prevent agricultural run-off affecting the water environment.  It addresses soil fertility problems and emphasises the importance of knowledge transfer.  </p>  <p>  The previous Nitrates Action Programme, effective from 2014 to 2017, contained a transitional provision whereby farmers importing pig or poultry manure or spent mushroom compost were allowed to exceed crop maximum phosphorus rates by 3 kg/ hectare in 2015 and 2016; this provision ended on 31 December 2016. </p>  <p>  Both Departments were aware of the immediate difficulties created for pig farmers as a result of the ending of this transitional provision as regards locating adequate spreadlands for the disposal of pig manure.  Ireland successfully negotiated and agreed with the Commission on an extension of these provisions under the new Action Programme.  In 2018 farmers importing pig manure are allowed to exceed the crop phosphorus limit by 3kg/ha, reducing to 2 kg/ha in 2019, 1 kg/ha in 2020 and 0 kg in 2021.  Furthermore the Commission also agreed to a retrospective extension of the transitional provisions for pig manure for 2017.</p>  <p>  The extension of these transitional provisions for the coming years will facilitate pig farmers in locating adequate spreadlands.  My Department and Teagasc continue to actively promote pig manure as a valuable and cost effective source of nutrients, replacing chemical fertiliser.</p></reply>

During 2017, 53 herds in these areas were restricted with a total of 302 reactors removed, 32 of the restrictions followed reactor disclosure at a contiguous herd test.   </p>  <p>  The first breakdown in the area took place in Autumn 2016 and since then outbreaks have been investigated and managed by my Department in conjunction with the local herdowners and veterinary practitioners.</p>  <p>  The TB Eradication Programme incorporates a wildlife strategy since 2004 which includes the removal of badgers from areas where there has been a TB outbreak with evidence of an epidemiological link to badgers.  This strategy is informed by considerable scientific evidence of a link between badgers and cattle in the context of the spread of bovine TB.  In line with this policy, where badgers are identified as a likely source in County Kerry a survey is carried out and badgers are captured and removed under licence issued by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  This is currently on-going in the South Kerry area.</p>  <p>  My Department has recently commenced the vaccination of badgers against tuberculosis as an integral part of the bovine TB eradication programme.  This marks a major step forward in the bovine TB eradication programme and follows years of scientific research.  The most recent research findings confirm that vaccination of badgers can play a role in reducing the level of infection in cattle whilst protecting the badger population.</p>  <p>  The vaccination programme has commenced in the areas which have already been part of the field trials demonstrating the effectiveness of badger vaccination over time, with vaccination gradually replacing the need to continue to remove badgers.  It is not recommended that vaccination be used whilst there is an active disease outbreak. </p>  <p>  I would also point out that there are other factors that contribute to the spread of tuberculosis which may be contributing to the problem in this area.  A significant number of animals are traded locally within the area and the clustering of outbreaks indicates that the contiguous spread between herds is also likely a factor.  Farmers in the area are to be congratulated for their efforts to increase biosecurity which will further reduce the risk of future outbreaks.</p>  <p>  Finally, while it is too early to formulate any definitive conclusions, early indications are that the situation in South Kerry is showing signs of improvement.  The rate of reactor disclosure and herd restrictions has abated.  A significant number of herds have recently had one clear test and a smaller number have had their second clear test and are no longer restricted. </p></reply>

The development of a plan to implement EID will require consultation with stakeholders, including farm organisations, mart organisations, Meat Industry Ireland and approved tag suppliers.

This body is one of the six North South Implementation Bodies created under the Agreement.  The Loughs Agency, as part of the FCILC, has been given responsibility for fisheries related matters in respect of both Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough and the legislation envisages that the Agency will enter into a management agreement with the relevant authorities in both jurisdictions with a view to assuming responsibility for aquaculture licensing within the loughs.  Discussions in respect of this management agreement are ongoing.</p>  <p>  In relation to the placement of aquaculture products on the market, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) controls all live bivalve mollusc production areas, including Lough Foyle, to ensure compliance by Ireland with its official control obligations, and compliance by operators with their food safety obligations.</p>  <p>  The classification of mollusc production areas is an explicit obligation of the EU food safety regulatory framework. Regulation 854/2004 requires Competent Authorities to classify and subsequently monitor mollusc production areas, while Regulation EC No 853/2004 requires Food Business Operators (FBOs) to only harvest molluscs for human consumption from areas which have been classified by the Competent Authority.</p>  <p>  In the case of Lough Foyle, the SFPA has classified two production areas for the production of both molluscs and oysters.  In approximate terms, taken together, the two classified areas include all waters to the Donegal Shore of a line from Magilligan Head to Inishowen Head.</p>  <p>  The official sampling of molluscs for both microbiological and biotoxin monitoring purposes is performed by the Loughs Agency under a Memorandum of Understanding with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.</p>  <p>  Under EU Food Safety Regulations Food Business Operators may only harvest Live Bivalve Molluscs for human consumption from production areas which have been classified by the Competent Authority, and which have not been closed for health reasons by the Competent Authority.</p>  <p>  Operators are required to ensure that any consignments of molluscs harvested are accompanied by a document indicating various pieces of information, referred to as the &lsquo;Gatherers Document&rsquo; or more correctly the Shellfish Registration Document.</p>  <p>  In relation to fish health, the Marine Institute is focused on the assessment of biotoxins in shellfish product and harmful algal bloom monitoring in Lough Foyle, as part of the National Biotoxin Monitoring Program.  Only when the Lough is in open status can shellfish product be harvested and placed on the market for human consumption.  In the event of an area in the Lough showing a positive result for biotoxin, or harmful algal bloom, the Loughs Agency is responsible for coordinating between Ireland and the United Kingdom over this shared waterbody to ensure that product would not be allowed to be harvested from the Lough when a biotoxin regulatory limit is exceeded.   </p>  <p>  As will be seen, therefore, the management of aquaculture and associated foreshore licensing functions in Lough Foyle gives rise to legal and jurisdictional complexities.  Negotiations regarding the jurisdiction of the Lough Foyle area are, in the first instance, a matter for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p>  <p>  My Department organises and participates in an inter-departmental working group which is pursuing a way forward in terms of the future management of aquaculture and associated foreshore activities on Lough Foyle, in parallel with a workable resolution of the complex jurisdictional issues involved.</p>  <p>  In view of the multi dimensional and cross jurisdictional nature of the issues involved it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this time. </p></reply>

Indeed analysis of Teagasc National Farm Survey data shows that current direct payments to suckler farmers provide support equivalent to approximately &euro;500 per suckler cow.</p>  <p>  The BDGP is the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, and provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current Rural Development Programme (RDP) period.  So far under this programme approximately &euro;125 million has been paid out to farmers, and I will continue to support this programme through the lifetime of the current RDP.  In addition to improving the environmental footprint of the national suckler herd, the programme will, through increasing the genetic merit of the national suckler herd, make a positive contribution to productivity and efficiency at farm level.</p>  <p>  Ireland strongly supported the greater market orientation of the CAP over recent reforms, including by decoupling of payments from production, because allowing farmers freedom to respond to market signals is vital for the sustainable development of the sector, as set out in the Food Wise 2025 strategy.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, any proposal for a coupled payment for suckler cows under Pillar I of the CAP would necessitate a linear cut across the Basic Payment Scheme for all farmers.</p>  <p>  In terms of providing additional supports under Pillar II, which provides for Ireland&rsquo;s RDP, there is no surplus funding above and beyond the funding already allocated to the RDP, which has been committed to existing schemes within the current programme.</p>  <p>  In the context of the post-2020 CAP, we have to examine the most effective way of supporting the sector, while at the same time being aware of the future direction of the CAP in terms of both public good and environmental benefits.  We need to explore further ways in which we can improve both economic and environmental efficiency, while at the same time respecting the constraints of WTO and State Aid rules in terms of farm supports.</p>  <p>  The future CAP will play a key role in the sustainable development of the sector, and I would urge people to participate in the public consultative meetings on the CAP post 2020 currently taking place around the country.</p></reply>

Difficulties in harvesting fodder in some of these areas were compounded by the need to house livestock earlier than usual, resulting in additional pressure on fodder supplies over the course of the winter. </p>  <p>  To immediately address this issue I prioritised the payment of farm supports to assist farmers with cash flow.  The European Commission agreed to his request, informed in part by the poor weather conditions of last autumn, for an advance payment of the 2017 Basic Payment Measure and Agri-environment measures.  These payments commenced after the earliest date possible which was 15th October 2017, and balancing payments issued in early December 2017.  These payments together with those issued under the Areas of Natural Constraints Measure, injected over &euro;1.4 billion into the Irish rural economy by the end of last year and are providing a very welcome boost for Irish farm families and will help to finance additional fodder purchase where necessary.</p>  <p>  At this time I also requested Teagasc, through its farm advisory service, to identify farmers who would be most at risk of running out of fodder and provide them with support to carry out fodder budgeting on their farms and explore all viable options to ensure that they had sufficient feed for the coming winter.</p>  <p>  In order to provide additional assistance to those livestock farmers severely affected by ongoing fodder shortages, mainly in parts of the West and North West, I introduced a targeted Fodder Transport Support measure, operated through the Co-operative structure, to partly offset the cost of transporting fodder between those areas where it is available and those where it is scarce.  This measure applies only to fodder purchased in the period from 29 January 2018 until 20 April 2018.</p>  <p>  While the areas identified by Teagasc as being the most affected are predominantly located in parts of the West and North-West, the measure is not county specific within the region.  As with all measures, certain criteria apply.  Farmers, in a locality within the region, identified by Teagasc as having a significant fodder shortage, having completed a fodder budgeting exercise with their FAS agricultural advisor, will be eligible to receive a financial contribution towards the costs of transport of fodder, sourced through the Co-operative system.  Only the shortfall in fodder will be eligible to receive support under the measure.</p>  <p>  Teagasc assessments of whether there are significant forage shortages in specific areas is ongoing.  It is important to emphasise that this is a targeted and locally focused measure, centering on areas of fodder scarcity that normal local trading in fodder cannot service. </p>  <p>  This measure will provide a financial contribution of &euro;8 per standard bale of hay or straw for feeding and &euro;12 per standard bale of silage or haylage towards the additional cost of transporting the fodder from the East and South of the country to the affected areas of the West and North West.  Farmers will still pay the cost of the fodder in the normal way.  To ensure that normal local trade in fodder is not disrupted, a minimum transport distance of 100 km will apply.</p>  <p>  Financial assistance under the Fodder Transport Support Measure is payable in accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) No 1408/2013 on de minimis aid in the agricultural production sector.  No applications for support under this measure were received up to last Friday, 9 February.  Processing and verification of applications for support will be carried out in a timely fashion.</p>  <p>  Full details on the operation of the measure, including application forms and Department contact details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s key asks in this regard will be maintenance of current access to fishing grounds in the UK zone in the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and north of Donegal and protection of Ireland&rsquo;s existing quota shares.</p>  <p>  I am glad to say that the Commission has concurred with our viewpoint that fisheries arrangements must be an integral part of the overall future relationship agreement.  They also accept the key point that fisheries is a zero sum game and that any gain for the UK would mean a loss for Ireland and the rest of the EU.</p>  <p>  I am also working closely with key stakeholders in the Irish fishing industry and am pleased at the level of unity on these key issues.  </p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputy that, working together with the Barnier Task Force, I aim to ensure that fisheries are inextricably linked to overall future relationship negotiations and that all of our existing access rights and quota entitlements are fully protected.</p></reply>

Coillte is party to a number of farm partnership agreements that have been signed with c. 630 individual farm partners.

My colleague, Minister of State Andrew Doyle, TD, who has special responsibility for forestry met with Coillte on Tuesday, 6th February 2018, at which Coillte provided a comprehensive update. </p><p>Coillte has also informed the Department that they wrote to all its farm partners in December last informing them that it had put in place a dedicated phone lin<b>e</b>to provide support for its farm partners.  My understanding is that the number of partnerships which have outstanding issues are less than ten which is very small relative to the overall number in the schemes.  I also understand that Coillte is satisfied that there are no cases where farmers have not been paid what they are due and is also satisfied that it is fulfilling all of its contractual obligations.  Coillte is engaging with each partner to resolve any other issues on a case by case basis.  I am satisfied that these will be resolved in due course and that it should be left now to both partners in the agreements to resolve them together. </p></reply>

The original target of 50,000 participants was surpassed well ahead of the targeted date - such is the popularity of the scheme.  Given that the first approvals under the scheme run from 1 October 2015 it is a remarkable achievement to have exceeded this target within a period of 15 months. </p>  <p>  GLAS 2017 advance payments have now issued to just under 44,000 applicants, representing over 93% of all participants that are eligible for payment.

The NIFF is representative of sea-fishing boats of less than 12m overall length in the fishing fleet.  The focus on the NIFF work programme is on fisheries management in the coastal waters within 6 nautical miles.  The NIFF is taking the lead in setting priorities for the inshore sector including ongoing work in developing a dedicated strategy.  </p>  <p>  To date, the twelve NIFF meetings have led to very constructive two-way conversations on issues of mutual concern, industry priorities, emerging policies &amp;amp; initiatives.  NIFF members are now included on a number of fisheries consultative structures including the Quota Management Advisory Committee, the Industry Science Fisheries Partnership, the SFPA Consultative Committee, the EMFF Operational Programme Monitoring Committee and BIM/Bord Bia Market Advisory Group.  This gives the inshore sector a role in making recommendations on a range of fisheries policy matters including on allocation of Ireland&rsquo;s quotas, on data collection and scientific research.  Perhaps most important of these is that the NIFF now has an input into how funding is utilised including through the Inshore Fisheries Conservation Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Sub-Committee&rsquo;s 2014 report refers to managing the lobster and shrimp fisheries.  Changes came into effect in 2014 regarding the management of these fisheries, following on from an extensive consultation process.  In more recent times lobster in particular has been a feature of the agenda of the meetings which I have had with the NIFF and I look forward to a discussion with NIFF on the review of the effectiveness of the current conservation measures in 2018.  The current V-notching conservation measures have been extended through 2018 to facilitate these discussions.</p>  <p>  With regard to the mackerel quota, there has been a change to the way this is allocated.  For 2017 and future years, the 87% to 13% share out of the quota between the Refrigerated Sea Water (RSW) pelagic fleet and polyvalent segment of the fleet will remain unchanged.  Where Ireland&rsquo;s quota exceeds 90,000 tonnes, the quota shall be shared on a 80% to 20% basis between the pelagic and polyvalent fleet.  A minimum of 2% of the mackerel quota, or 1,000 tonnes, whichever is the greater will be deducted annually for demersal swaps before any share out between segments is undertaken.</p>  <p>  There is an open mackerel fishery for vessels under 18 metres in length.  An amount of 2.5% of the overall polyvalent Mackerel Quota has been set aside for this fishery and a monthly catch limit is used.  This catch limit is recommended each month by the Whitefish Quota Management Advisory Committee which consists of fishing industry representatives.  For 2017, under 18m Boats had a catch limit of 5 tonnes per month.  In the last number of years much of this quota has remained under-utilised.</p>  <p>  Quotas for other species which can be targeted by the inshore fishing sector have set-a-side allocations for smaller sea-fishing boats.  Key inshore stocks are not limited by quota arrangements, for instance lobster and crab species which are the mainstay for many small boats.  </p>  <p>  The sub-committee made a recommendation with regard to &ldquo;minor fishing infractions&rdquo;.  In November 2014, my Department published a public consultation document in the form of a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA)  of a proposal for a Bill to amend the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 to provide for, inter alia, a system of fixed penalty notices (&ldquo;on the spot&rdquo; fines) for minor fisheries offences.  This provided the possibility of creating a subset of minor offences which are legally suitable to be dealt with by way of fixed penalty notices.  </p>  <p>  In summary, the process suggested in the RIA involved giving a person who was alleged to have committed a minor offence an option to pay a fixed payment which would mean that a prosecution would not be taken in the Courts.  If the payment was not received within 28 days, the prosecution would be initiated in the courts and on conviction it was expected that a higher fine would be applied.</p>  <p>  A number of industry submissions received under the RIA on the implementation of fixed penalty notices raised concerns that these would be used in place of verbal or written warnings.  Other comments raised concerns regarding potential inequalities in the application of the system between different Sea Fisheries Protection Authority Port Officers and Naval Service personnel.  There were also comments regarding the constitutionality of applying sanctions in the absence of a Court decision and others seeking a fully administrative system.  In light of the comments submitted in respect of the above proposal on a fixed penalty system, it was decided not to proceed with the introduction of such a system.</p>  <p>  With regard to fishing infrastructure, it is important to say that my Department owns, maintains and directly manages six Fishery Harbour Centres at Killybegs, Ros an Mh&iacute;l , An Daingean, Castletownbere, Dunmore East and Howth, under Statute. </p>  <p>  In 2018, I have allocated &euro;27.9m to the Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Capital Programme.  &euro;2m of this is allocated to the Local Authority element of the programme targeting piers, harbours and slipways under their ownership across the 17 Coastal Local Authorities.  On 31 January 2018 Local Authorities were invited to submit prioritised lists of projects for consideration.  Ultimately, the infrastructure supported will be of great benefit to many rural coastal and island communities.</p>  <p>  The remainder of the 2018 Capital programme, &euro;25.9m will be invested in the ongoing development, maintenance and upgrade of the Fishery Harbour Centres.  This investment will build on the &euro;92m invested in the Fishery Harbour Centres since 2010 and the &euro;25m invested in the Local Authority infrastructure over the same period.</p>  <p>  In December 2016 I commissioned an Independent Review of Aquaculture Licensing.  The Report of the Review Group was submitted to me at the end of May 2017.  The Review Group carried out a detailed examination of the existing aquaculture licensing process, undertook comprehensive stakeholder consultation and looked at comparative national and international consent systems to determine best practice for managing a complex licensing process in a transparent, environmentally appropriate and legally robust manner. </p>  <p>  The Group&rsquo;s Report is published and available to view on my Department&rsquo;s website.  A total of 30 separate recommendations are contained in the Report.</p>  <p>  In that regard I can confirm that my Department is committed to and actively working towards the achievement of 300 licence determinations for 2018 with a further 300 targeted for 2019.  This will meet a core objective of the Aquaculture Licensing Review Group.  The achievement of 600 determinations over the next two years will effectively eliminate the backlog as an issue.</p>  <p>  My Department's &euro;240 million European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme is the vehicle for financial supports to the seafood sector up to 2021.  The Programme delivers a wide range of supports for aquaculture, fisheries and seafood processing through a suite of 15 Individual schemes which are administered by BIM. </p>  <p>  In summary, there are a number of recommendations not relevant to the remit of my Department and I have endeavoured to give the Deputy an update on relevant matters, including policy developments, which have occurred since the report was published.  I would like to assure the Deputy that this Government is fully commitment to the seafood sector and the coastal communities who are dependent on fisheries and aquaculture.</p></reply>

Regarding slurry management, under the Good Agriculture Practice (Nitrates) Regulations, farmers are required to have adequate manure storage for all their animals.  With respect to water, the Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters Regulations obliges farmers to ensure precautions are taken when spreading organic and inorganic fertilisers.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises that indigenous renewable energy plays a vital role in our domestic fuel mix and there is an opportunity to encourage the utilisation of agricultural waste as an alternative source of energy.  My Department is committed to working closely with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment which is the lead Department in the renewable energy area. </p>  <p>  My Department recognises the valuable role that a resource-efficient agriculture sector can play in this regard.  In particular, given the interest from industry in mobilising biomethane, my Department is collaborating closely with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment to consider the potential for anaerobic digestion to contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s significant renewable energy and GHG targets, and promotes the development of Ireland&rsquo;s bioeconomy.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the agriculture sector has been focused on the supply of bioenergy feedstock, whether from biomass in the form of wood products such as forest thinnings and wood fuel, animal by-products or other agri-food by-products such as straw, slurries and processing waste.  Crops can also be grown specifically as biomass. </p>  <p>  The agriculture and forest sector has a critical role to play in contributing to our national climate change ambitions and bioenergy represents a key component of that contribution.</p></reply>

This work is all the more relevant after the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU. </p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 outlines the potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa and the Gulf region, and  our efforts will be focused on developing new opportunities in these markets, as well consolidating our position and deepening our penetration of well established markets in the European Union, including the UK,  and the United States.</p>  <p>  In the meat sector, the focus is on obtaining access to new markets or improving the terms of access to others.  In 2015 we gained access to the US market for Irish beef.  In the same year we also got access to the Canadian market for Irish beef and to the Omani market for Irish beef and sheepmeat. </p>  <p>  In 2016 we gained access to the Maldives for beef, sheepmeat, pigmeat and poultrymeat.  We also gained access to the Iranian market for sheepmeat and we regained access to the Israeli market for beef. </p>  <p>  In 2017, the market in Egypt was re-opened to exports of beef from Ireland and we got access to the Chilean market for Irish pork. </p>  <p>  On the dairy front, Ireland exported in the region of &euro;4bn in dairy products to nearly 130 countries in 2016.  Against the backdrop of EU-agreed trade deals such as those completed with Canada and Japan, my Department continues to prioritise efforts to gain access to new 3rd country markets and, equally importantly, to deepen existing markets for Irish dairy products.  In many instances such efforts are on foot of trade missions at Ministerial level.  </p>  <p>  CSO data for the year to end November 2017 showed that Irish dairy exports were approaching 20% ahead of the same period in 2016, on foot of factors such as improving global prices (which was particularly evident in sectors such as butter), but also as a result of increases in volumes exported across a range of product categories.  This demonstrates that our efforts are contributing positively to Irish dairy sector exports.</p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that the value of exports to emerging markets in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Central/South America stood at almost &euro;2.2 billion in 2016.  The value of trade to these markets increased by 52% in the period 2012 to 2016.  Exports to these markets now account for 19% of total food and drink exports, compared to 16% in 2012.  This growth in the share of exports occurred during a period when total food and drink exports jumped by more than 23%.</p>  <p>  Growth to emerging markets has been led by Asia, with trade growing by more than 150% to &euro;1.2bn.  This in turn has been led by China, which recorded a more than three-fold increase (total &euro;880m v &euro;283m in 2012).  Exports to other Asian markets grew by 73% in the same period, to &euro;318 million.</p>  <p>  Trade to Africa has held steady around the &euro;500m mark during this period, notwithstanding the challenges faced by those West African countries whose economies are so reliant on a strong international oil price.  Encouragingly, exports to North African countries grew by just under 50% in 5 years, helping to counterbalance this impact.</p>  <p>  Exports to the Middle East grew by 21%, to &euro;370 million. </p>  <p>  The role of trade missions also cannot be underestimated in gaining further market penetration for Irish Agri food products to new and existing markets. </p>  <p>  I led a series of very successful Trade Missions in 2017, during which destinations included the Gulf States, the US and Mexico.  I also led an extensive trade mission to Japan and South Korea.  This was a very opportune time to bring a delegation of Ireland&rsquo;s food leaders to this part of the world, given that the EU has concluded a Free Trade Agreement with South Korea as well as agreeing an Economic Partnership Agreement with Japan.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently making arrangements with Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland for a trade mission at the end of the February to the US and Canada.  This will include participants from across the agri-food sector and will feature extensive trade contacts as well as relevant political engagement.  Both of these markets had been identified by my Department as offering huge potential to the Irish agri-food sector.</p>  <p>  Such missions help to increase the profile of Ireland as a producer of high quality, safe, and sustainably produced  food and beverages.  </p>  <p>  This and future work will be informed by a market profiling exercise completed by Bord Bia at my request.  This exercise identified opportunities in new and more mature markets, and will provide valuable market intelligence both for industry operators and policy makers.</p></reply>

My colleague, Minister of State Andrew Doyle, TD, who has special responsibility for forestry met with Coillte last week, at which Coillte provided a comprehensive update. </p>  <p>  As mentioned, the Coillte Farm Partnership Scheme is an operational matter for the company.  Coillte has advised, however, that, as a result of issues that have been raised by a small number of partners, Coillte has been conducting a thorough review.  Coillte advise that, while this process is still ongoing, it can confirm that having reviewed its contracts with farm partners, it is satisfied that there are no cases where farmers have not been paid what they are due and it is satisfied that it is fulfilling all of its contractual obligations.  I am also advised that Coillte has engaged the services of KPMG to carry out an independent review and to help improve the quality and level of information provided to partners, particularly in relation to payments and how they are calculated.  Coillte also advise that, from 2018 onwards, partners who are due to receive annuities in the coming years will receive an annual statement that includes payment information. </p>  <p>  As regards plans to meet annual afforestation targets, my Department is currently undertaking a midterm review of the Forestry Programme 2014 - 2020 under which there will be proposals to make further improvements to the forestry schemes.  These improvements are aimed at encouraging farmers to see forestry as part of the farming enterprise as opposed to being an alternative to farming.  I expect to be making a further announcement on this Review and its recommendations in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

Wexford.</p>  <p>  The agri-food sector is of critical importance to the Irish economy.  Its regional spread means it underpins the socio-economic development of rural Ireland in particular. Farming is an essential part of the social, cultural and economic fabric of the country and it is also part of a wider EU dispensation that values a Common Agriculture Policy built on family farming, food security, high standards of food safety and environmental sustainability.  These are values that we hold dear, and so it is critically important when we consider the impact of Brexit that the positive contribution of agriculture to the rural and national economy, and to society in Ireland, and indeed elsewhere in the European Union, is to the forefront in our deliberations. </p>  <p>  Since the UK referendum in June 2016, the Government has introduced a range of measures to help the agri-food sector navigate the short-term impacts of Brexit.  In Budget 2017, I introduced measures to help reduce farm gate business costs, including a &euro;150 million low-cost loan scheme, new agri-taxation measures and increased funding under the Rural Development and Seafood Development Programmes. </p>  <p>  In the 2018 Budget I also announced a &euro;50m Brexit support package, which will be comprised of a number of initiatives.  Firstly, in cooperation with my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I am establishing a new Brexit Loan Scheme aimed at providing affordable, flexible financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or who will be in the future.  The Scheme aims to make up to &euro;300 million of working capital finance available to SMEs and mid-cap businesses (up to 499 employees), at least 40% of which will be available to food businesses.  </p>  <p>  Due to State Aid rules, this new Scheme will not be available to farmers and fishermen, so I am considering the development of a separate loan scheme in 2018 similar to the 2017 low-cost scheme, based on &euro;25m funding from my Department to the Scheme.  These measures are aimed at enhancing competitiveness within the sector.</p>  <p>  I have also introduced supports for Bord Bia for investment in their market insight and market prioritisation initiatives which are aimed at identifying and developing potential diversification opportunities.  I have already increased funding to Bord Bia by &euro;10 million since the Brexit vote, and a further &euro;4.5 million is allocated in Budget 2018. </p>  <p>  To enhance product diversification, I have also allocated funding to support the development of the new National Food Innovation Hub, which will be located in Teagasc Fermoy, Co. Cork. </p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that Government remains very focused on supporting farmers and the agri-food industry through the challenges ahead, whether they are based in Wexford or in any other part of the country.  The Government will be firm in arguing that any agreement reached between the EU and the UK must take account of the very serious challenges presented by Brexit for the sector, particularly given the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland and the importance of our economic relationship with the UK.  And of course ultimately Ireland's objective  in the negotiations is to have a trading relationship  with the UK which is as close as possible to the current arrangement.</p></reply>

Of course we remain extremely vigilant in monitoring the current market and emerging trends, particularly as we approach the peak period for Irish milk production . </p>  <p>  Whilst the overall dairy sector is now in a much better place, particularly at the farm gate, the issue of intervention stocks overhanging that particular market remains a cause for concern, arising from the significant recourse to this market measure for skimmed milk powder (SMP) across the EU since September 2015.</p>  <p>  There are now approximately 376,000 tonnes of SMP in public intervention stocks, effectively overhanging the EU SMP market.  My Department and I engaged at Council of Ministers meetings and directly with the Commission on recent measures to limit further stock piling of SMP in 2018 without due justification, including the Commission's proposal, to which the Deputy refers, to reduce the fixed price ceiling to zero. </p>  <p>  I strongly argued that this measure should be specified as for 2018 only, to avoid setting a precedent for the longer term.  This point was accepted and agreed in the final version of the measure, as adopted by the Council per COUNCIL REGULATION (EU) 2018/147 of 29th January 2018, which came into effect the following day, 30th January.</p>  <p>  I have clearly stated previously, at Council of ministers meetings and elsewhere, that it is imperative for the Commission to remain vigilant in monitoring the market situation, and to have contingencies in place in the event of market volatility re-emerging, particularly in relevant markets, namely raw milk, butter and SMP in particular.</p>  <p>  In common with the vast majority of EU Member States where dairy production is of significance, I recognised that the current situation in respect of existing stocks could not be allowed to persist indefinitely and that there is general acceptance that doing nothing is not an option. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that this measure does not represent a change to the fundamental provisions of the intervention mechanism, nor to the necessary supports that intervention provides during periods of market volatility.  Ireland has welcomed and made use of intervention during such periods of instability.  This measure responds and is framed around a very specific set of circumstances, namely; very significant intervention stocks of SMP; a significant divergence between SMP and butter prices in negative and positive directions respectively, and; a generally more favourable market context in the EU dairy sector, including the farm gate in respect of more recent raw milk returns. </p>  <p>  I have clearly stated that the system, as it evolves, will need to display flexibility in respect of adapting to market contingencies, including flexibility around proposed SMP buying-in prices at tendering rounds, to react to the broader market situation at any given point in time. </p>  <p>  However, the issue of current stocks cannot be disentangled from the issue of managing SMP intervention in 2018 and beyond.  The issues involved, with respect to both market management and sentiment in the sector, are complex and require ongoing careful management.</p>  <p>  Given the Commission&rsquo;s effective status as among the world&rsquo;s biggest players on the SMP market, and as such their capacity to affect market sentiment, it would be appropriate that they continue to act prudently and responsibility in the disposal of stocks.  I am satisfied to date that the Commission has managed these stocks in a prudent manner. </p>  <p>  My Department has and will continue to engage with the Commission, with other Member States, and with national stakeholders on these important issues.</p></reply>

The Review Group carried out a detailed examination of the existing aquaculture licensing process, undertook comprehensive stakeholder consultation and looked at comparative national and international consent systems to determine best practice for managing a complex licensing process in a transparent, environmentally appropriate and legally robust manner.</p><p>The Group&rsquo;s Report is published and available to view on my Department&rsquo;s website.  A total of 30 separate recommendations are contained in the Report.</p><p>The core concern of aquaculture farmers that gave rise to the Review was the licensing backlog.  Accordingly it is the elimination of this backlog that is the highest priority and I can confirm that my Department is committed to and actively working towards the achievement of 300 licence determinations for 2018 with a further 300 targeted for 2019.  This will meet a core objective of the Aquaculture Licensing Review Group.  The achievement of 600 determinations over the next two years will effectively eliminate the backlog as an issue.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s draft Implementation Plan for the recommendations of the Review Group takes account of legislative, environmental, technical and public interest issues that have a bearing on the sustainable development of the industry.  The Implementation Plan is very much a working document and will be subject to ongoing change as progress is made in addressing the various recommendations.  My Department will of course consult closely with industry in the implementation of certain areas and I can confirm that my Department&rsquo;s officials have already met with industry representatives on both the shellfish and finfish sides of the industry regarding the Implementation Strategy.  This close engagement will continue.</p><p>In relation to Legislative change, as the Deputy will know, the Report of the Review Group acknowledges that the preparation and enactment of legislation is a lengthy process.  In this regard, the Group also recommended that pragmatic practical measures should be adopted immediately and at the same time the policy and legislative review should be commenced.  </p><p>All procedures in relation to aquaculture licensing are grounded in the applicable national and EU legislation including but not limited to:</p><p>- Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997</p><p>- Foreshore Act 1933</p><p>- EU Habitats Directive of 92/43/EEC</p><p>- EU Birds Directive 79/409/EEC</p><p>- Consolidated Environmental Impact Assessment Directives 2011/92/EU</p><p>- Public Participation Directive (Aarhus Convention)</p><p>Industry Representatives all agree that the elimination of the Licensing backlog is the most important pragmatic measure that needs to be addressed and it is therefore entirely correct that this be given the highest immediate priority by my Department.</p><p>My Department is fully committed to the implementation of the Report and is actively examining the optimum means of progressing all Recommendations in an efficient and effective manner having regard to all the complexities involved.</p></reply>

I am conscious of the vital role they play in stimulating price competition, and providing an alternative market outlet for farmers<i>.  </i>The ongoing search for new third-country markets is a priority for my Department, particularly in the context of the challenges posed by the upcoming UK exit from the EU.</p><p>In 2017, live cattle exports recovered from the decline of the previous year, with a 30% increase to nearly 190, 000 head.  Last year my Department reduced the veterinary inspection fee payable on live exports of calves under three months of age to &euro;1.20 per animal.  This gave an important boost to the trade, and brought greater equity in the fees payable for calves, weanlings and adult cattle.  Exports of calves rose by 20%, to just over 100, 000, in 2017.</p><p>Live exports will continue to inform the destinations selected for trade missions in 2018 as it did in 2017.</p><p>Earlier this month I led a trade mission to Turkey, focussing on live exports.  Ireland exported 30,000 cattle to Turkey last year, around 6% of their total import requirement.  The trade delegation included officials from my Department and Bord Bia, as well as representatives from the Irish live cattle export companies.  I met key stakeholders involved in the Turkish livestock sector, including Minister Fakibaba.<i></i>Whilst we had a broad ranging discussion, live cattle exports were central to our discussion. </p><p>I am happy to confirm that as of the end of May, buyers in the Turkish private sector will be permitted to import cattle for production.  Currently this trade is through the State body only.  Being able to sell production cattle through this channel will open up valuable new opportunities for trade.</p><p>Last year I outlined a seven-point plan aimed at increasing international market access for Irish food and drink exports in 2017.  The plan included the allocation of dedicated veterinary and other expertise to target current markets of interest to Irish food exporters, and to ensure that exporters meet the conditions laid down by third countries.  The new Division will provide continued support for the live export trade, following on from the success in opening the Turkish and Egyptian markets.</p><p>My Department, in cooperation with our EU partners, works closely with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).  The OIE is the global standard setting body relating to animal health and animal welfare.  Ireland has demonstrated its ongoing commitment to animal welfare by approving additional multiannual financial assistance to the OIE to support its efforts in two particular areas - the slaughter of animals and long distance transport. </p><p>My Department will continue to promote and maintain an environment in which live exports can continue in both an economic and sustainable manner, and with regard to welfare.</p></reply>

Indeed, this is all the more relevant after the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU, which presents significant new challenges for the agri-food sector in particular. </p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa and the Gulf region.  This is where our efforts will be focused for the foreseeable future, particularly given the need to diversify our markets and to reduce our reliance on traditional destinations such as the UK.  </p>  <p>  In keeping with the priorities outlined in Food Wise 2025 I led a very successful Trade Mission in February 2017 to the Gulf Region, visiting the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.  This was followed by an extensive Trade Mission to the US and Mexico in June - markets that offer many potential opportunities for Irish exporters.  The US is the largest food and beverage market in the world and has a population of 324 million people.  Around 35 million Americans also claim Irish ancestry.  Mexico has a population of 127 million, making it the eleventh-largest country in the world in population terms and the fifteenth-largest economy in the world, with projections that it will move into the top five by 2050.</p>  <p>  During the trade mission in November 2017 to Japan and South Korea, I was accompanied by 40 representatives of the Irish food sector, as well as by experts from my Department, the Chief Executive of Bord Bia and senior representatives from Enterprise Ireland and Teagasc. </p>  <p>  This was a very opportune time to bring a delegation of Ireland&rsquo;s food leaders to this part of the world, given that the EU has concluded a Free Trade Agreement with South Korea as well as agreeing an Economic Partnership Agreement with Japan.  These are markets of high potential for beef, pigmeat and sheepmeat exports, and so it is important that we raise the profile of Irish agri-food enterprises that already have access to these markets, and make progress in negotiating access for others. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently making arrangements with Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland for an upcoming trade mission at the end of February to the US and Canada.  Again this will include participants from across the agri-food sector and will feature extensive trade contacts as well as high- level political discussions.  This will already be my second trade mission of 2018 with the most recent to Turkey earlier this month, concentrating primarily on live exports.  </p>  <p>  These and the other missions that my Department are planning for 2018 will serve to enhance and improve our existing levels of market access in these destinations.  They will also promote Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a producer of high quality, safe and sustainably produced meat and dairy products. </p>  <p>  The destinations are also in keeping with the recent market prioritisation exercise that was undertaken by Bord Bia at my request.  This exercise identified opportunities in new and more mature markets, and provides valuable market intelligence both for industry operators and policy makers.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to seek out and identify new markets and I am ready to respond as appropriate to other opportunities as they arise.</p></reply>

Difficulties in harvesting fodder in some of these areas were compounded by the need to house livestock earlier than usual, resulting in additional pressure on fodder supplies over the course of the winter.</p>  <p>  To immediately address this issue I prioritised the payment of farm supports to assist farmers with cash flow.  The European Commission agreed to his request, informed in part by the poor weather conditions of last autumn, for an advance payment of the 2017 Basic Payment Measure and Agri-environment measures.  These payments commenced after the earliest date possible which was 15th October 2017, and balancing payments issued in early December 2017.  These payments together with those issued under the Areas of Natural Constraints Measure, injected over &euro;1.4 billion into the Irish rural economy by the end of last year and are providing a very welcome boost for Irish farm families and will help to finance additional fodder purchase where necessary.</p>  <p>  At this time I also requested Teagasc, through its farm advisory service, to identify farmers who would be most at risk of running out of fodder and provide them with support to carry out fodder budgeting on their farms and explore all viable options to ensure that they had sufficient feed for the coming winter.</p>  <p>  In order to provide additional assistance to those livestock farmers severely affected by ongoing fodder shortages, mainly in parts of the West and North West, I introduced a targeted Fodder Transport Support measure, operated through the Co-operative structure, to partly offset the cost of transporting fodder between those areas where it is available and those where it is scarce. This measure applies only to fodder purchased in the period from 29 January 2018 until 20 April 2018.</p>  <p>  While the areas identified by Teagasc as being the most affected are predominantly located in parts of the West and North-West, the measure is not county specific within the region.  As with all measures, certain criteria apply.  Farmers, in a locality within the region, identified by Teagasc as having a significant fodder shortage, having completed a fodder budgeting exercise with their FAS agricultural advisor, will be eligible to receive a financial contribution towards the costs of transport of fodder, sourced through the Co-operative system.  Only the shortfall in fodder will be eligible to receive support under the measure.</p>  <p>  Teagasc assessments of whether there are significant forage shortages in specific areas is ongoing.  It is important to emphasise that this is a targeted and locally focused measure, centering on areas of fodder scarcity that normal local trading in fodder cannot service.</p>  <p>  This measure will provide a financial contribution of &euro;8 per standard bale of hay or straw for feeding and &euro;12 per standard bale of silage or haylage towards the additional cost of transporting the fodder from the East and South of the country to the affected areas of the West and North West.  Farmers will still pay the cost of the fodder in the normal way.  To ensure that normal local trade in fodder is not disrupted, a minimum transport distance of 100 km will apply.</p>  <p>  Financial assistance under the Fodder Transport Support Measure is payable in accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) No 1408/2013 on de minimis aid in the agricultural production sector.  No applications for support under this measure were received up to last Friday, 9 February.  Processing and verification of applications for support will be carried out in a timely fashion.</p>  <p>  Full details on the operation of the measure, including application forms and Department contact details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

That function is exercised by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. </p>  <p>  However, as part of our current Rural Development Plan, my Department seeks to address a wide range of environmental objectives, involving farmers in different ways and paying for additional actions undertaken and income foregone.  This includes supporting farmers with lands which have been designated for conservation of the Hen Harrier, and this is an ambition fully supported by the EU. </p>  <p>  GLAS is the main mechanism for addressing these challenges, and conservation of the Hen Harrier is a priority action under that Scheme.  Farmers with Hen Harrier habitat qualified automatically for GLAS under Tier One, with some of the highest per hectare payments as well - &euro;370 per hectare up to the standard ceiling of &euro;5,000 per annum, with automatic qualification for GLAS Plus as well, should they manage sufficient habitat.  GLAS Plus brings potential payment for managing Hen Harrier habitat up to &euro;7,000 a year.  I am delighted to say that there are currently 2,674 farmers in GLAS taking the Hen Harrier action and this represents nearly 70% of all farmers with Hen Harrier land.  By any standards, this is a remarkable achievement and the scale of this level of co-ordinated intervention could have real impact on the survival of the bird. </p>  <p>  However, in developing the current RDP, my Department also wanted to build in the possibility for testing different ways of approaching agri-environmental issues on the ground &ndash; and this included how we might try to help both the Hen Harrier and farmers in Hen Harrier areas.  We wanted to experiment with a more agile &lsquo;locally-led&rsquo; model which could be used to test new ways of doing things and, perhaps most importantly, new ways of engaging farmers and involving them much more directly in developing ideas and solutions.  </p>  <p>  This is the process out of which the new Hen Harrier Programme has grown.  While funded and supported by the Department, it is not a Department scheme as such &ndash; it is a partnership involving many different players and is active in all six SPAs.  As well as seeking to protect the future of the bird, it explicitly seeks to create a stronger socio-economic outlook for the agricultural communities in those areas and to promote positive relations with those communities, who have managed these sensitive landscapes for generations.  The new Hen Harrier Programme has been designed by a locally-led Project Team working in close collaboration with the farmers on the ground in those areas.  I am delighted to say that interest in the scheme is exceptionally high with over 1,200 applications already received.  Worked examples show that a farmer with 15 hectares could earn up to &euro;3,000-&euro;4,000 a year, while a farmer with 40 hectares could actually get up to &euro;6,000-&euro;7,000 a year.  This could be in addition to what is paid under GLAS, depending on the circumstances and actions taken. </p>  <p>  I have allocated &euro;25m to the new Locally-Led programme and taken in combination with payments under GLAS to Hen Harrier farmers, we anticipate that total payments to farmers in these areas will be close to &euro;90m over the course of the current Rural Development Programme.  These payments are fully co-funded by the EU and testify to the ongoing commitment of both the Irish Government and the EU to support farmers in Hen Harrier areas.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that, in February 2017, I reduced the veterinary inspection fee that is payable on the live exports of calves less than three months of age to &euro;1.20 per animal from &euro;4.80, in order to bring greater equity in the fees payable per consignment in respect of calves, weanlings and adult cattle.</p>  <p>  In relation to the years specified by the deputy, in 2015, total cattle exports stood at just under 180,000 head, mainly to traditional markets such as The Netherlands, Northern Ireland Spain.  2016 saw a decline of 21% to just over 140,000 head.  However, the live cattle export trade in 2017 was very positive.  At year&rsquo;s end, exports of live cattle had increased by over 43,000 head, or 30%, in comparison to 2016 to reach just under 190,000 head.  Whilst exports to Turkey have dominated headlines and understandably so given it is now our 3rd biggest market for live exports, the surge in exports to the Netherlands, Spain and to a lesser extent Belgium last year were a major contributor to the performance in this area in 2017.  2017 saw the export of calves account for approximately 55% of live exports.</p>  <p>  In relation to the live export trade in 2018, I have just returned from Turkey where I had very positive engagement with both the Minister for Agriculture and other significant figures in the Turkish beef industry.  I am glad to report that from the end of May this year private buyers, in addition to the State body ESK will be permitted to buy cattle for fattening directly themselves from exporting countries.  I am hopeful this will give a further boost to this trade as it allows our own live exporters to deal directly with Turkish buyers.</p>  <p>  In addition I have agreed with my Turkish counterpart to establish an official Contact Group involving officials from both this Department and the Turkish Ministry of Agriculture.  This will allow for better engagement between both Departments on technical issues as they arise and on better understanding of the systems in both countries.</p>  <p>  One of the key elements in ensuring a viable return for primary producers include increasing the number of outlets for their produce and ensuring competition for their produce, both of which increase the price received by farmers for their produce.  Live exports play a vital role in this and it is an area I, and my officials, have invested significant time and effort in progressing.</p></reply>

Over 19,000 farmer participants are currently registered to Knowledge Transfer (KT) Groups in six sectors.  Farmers are required to attend a number of group KT meetings and/or KT Events and also complete an individual Farm Improvement Plan (FIP) following one to one discussion with their Group Facilitator. </p>  <p>  The Programme launched in summer 2016, with the first year of the three year cycles running to end May 2017 &ndash; this was subsequently extended to end July 2017.  In order for payments to be made to both facilitators and farmers, the FIP must be completed and key data points uploaded onto the KT online system and the requirement to attend the required number of meetings must also be met. </p>  <p>  Farmer participants are due &euro;750 for completion of commitments under the KT Programme each year.  The associated KT Facilitator is paid &euro;500 per participant where s/he meets all the requirements of the programme.  In the case of a farmer participating in a KT Group in a second sector, the associated reimbursement is &euro;375 with &euro;250 paid to the KT Facilitator.  Farmers are permitted to participate in a maximum of two KT Groups in different sectors.</p>  <p>  Under EU Regulations, no payment can be made directly to farmers for training.  Thus, the payment must be structured as a reimbursement for costs and must be paid to the farmer by the KT facilitator.  </p>  <p>  Under the Farmer&rsquo;s Charter, my Department committed to  commencing payments on the KT Programme in the three months following the end of year one.  In line with this commitment, payments commenced in October 2017.  To date, 13,740 farmer payments in the amount of circa &euro;10.1 million have issued across all 6 KT Sectors.  Payments of circa &euro;6.7 million have issued to KT facilitators.  Further pay runs are in place to pay cases as they become clear.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are currently addressing a payment issue which has arisen in relation to KT payments for partnership farmers.  The issue arises from the requirement to match data in their Farm Improvement Plan to the individual farmer participant in the Registered Farm Partnerships for payment purposes.  This issue is being addressed as a matter of priority, with a view to issuing payment to affected farmers as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Industrial hemp has been selectively bred for several decades in order to lower, to almost negligible amounts, the narcotic compound THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol).  In the European Union, the cultivation of hemp is restricted to varieties having a content of THC lower than 0.2 %.  Varieties of non-psychoactive hemp are also grown for seed production.  The seeds have mainly been used for bird feed, but increasingly are used to produce hemp oil and as a cooking ingredient. </p>  <p>  The growing of hemp, of any category, requires a licence from the Health Products Regulatory Authority.</p>  <p>  Hemp has been the subject of research by Teagasc, the Agriculture and Food Development Authority.  Findings have noted that yields can vary between seasons but that the crop is responsive to low level inputs. </p>  <p>  However, it is important to point out that subject to the licensing requirements outlined above, potential growers or processors wishing to cultivate hemp commercially should be satisfied that such an activity is economically viable.  Any assessment would usefully include an analysis of the costs of establishing hemp processing facilities on a sound, commercial footing without recourse to State funding </p></reply>

The FSAI is the body responsible for enforcement of regulations governing traceability, labelling and provision of food information to customers.</p>  <p>  Primary responsibility under EU law for the safety and traceability of food placed on the market lies with food business operators.  The role of National Competent Agencies is to verify compliance with this requirement.  This is done via a combination of inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place.  These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain.  Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied.  In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have what is referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system.  There are additional requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224/2009 and Implementing Regulation 404/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail.   </p>  <p>  My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all of its approved slaughter plants.  Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency based on an annual risk assessment.  An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department-approved plant, including checks on physical identity, labelling and documentary checks.</p>  <p>  Extra veterinary checks are carried out on selected consignments of foods imported into DAFM-approved establishments from other EU Member States or from Third Countries outside the EU.  These checks include, physical checks of product condition, checks of accompanying documentation and checks of labelling and health markings.</p>  <p>  The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (formally the FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards.  The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States.  Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department.  Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the Directorate to ensure compliance.  Inspection reports are published on the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the controls and checks in place and enforced by my Department which included 183 annual meat labelling audits in 2017, ensure that Irish consumers are protected and correctly informed when they purchase and consume food products.</p>  <p>  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) has service contracts in place with the official agencies performing official controls, to verify compliance with the extensive requirements of food labelling legislation, in these establishments.  The FSAI reports in detail on the number of inspections and checks carried out, and non-compliance findings.</p></reply>

These efforts have been reinforced at official level through similar contacts with Member States and the Commission, particularly through the Special Committee on Agriculture and the Trade Policy Committee. </p>  <p>  Working with Member States has been very effective, for example in ensuring that no beef tariff rate quota offer was made by the EU to Mercosur in 2016.  Initially, a draft offer circulated by the Commission to Member States in April 2016 contained a significant tariff rate quota (TRQ) for beef.  Ireland worked very closely with other Member States in both Agriculture and Trade committees of the EU, and at Council of Ministers level, seeking to have this TRQ removed and to have a comprehensive assessment of the cumulative impact of all FTAs on the agriculture sector carried out by the Commission before any substantial offer would be made.  Following this intense lobbying, the Commission decided to exclude a TRQ for beef when it exchanged offers with Mercosur on 11 May 2016. </p>  <p>  I also worked very closely with a number of other Member States, most notably France, in the production of a joint paper that was submitted to the European Commission on 26 September 2017 outlining our shared concerns.  </p>  <p>  I was therefore deeply disappointed that the Commission decided to submit a beef tariff rate quota offer during the October round of negotiations with the Mercosur bloc, as I believe that this could not be coming at a worse time for the EU beef sector.  I have been very consistent in urging caution in the approach to these negotiations, and have expressed Ireland's very grave concerns about the offer of a beef tariff rate quota of 70,000.  Our views have been expressed clearly and consistently in EU discussions at political and official level, and by the Taoiseach in recent engagements with French President Emmanuel Macron and with Commission President Jean Claude Juncker.  </p>  <p>  Most recently, Ireland made the latest in a series of very strong interventions on this matter at the Trade Policy Committee in Brussels on 2 February, and my colleague, Minister of State Andrew Doyle, also made a very strong intervention at the January Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting in Brussels, and spoke to Commissioner Hogan on the matter. Ireland also consulted closely with French and other Member State colleagues in the margins of the WTO Ministerial meeting in Buenos Aires in December in an effort to ensure that no further concessions would be made in relation to beef.</p>  <p>  I believe there is a need for continued vigilance in relation to the conduct of these trade negotiations, and I will continue to insist that they are handled appropriately, and in a manner that safeguards the interests of the Irish and European beef sector.  I will continue to work with other member states to protect the interests of the Irish beef sector.</p></reply>

My Department is committed to working closely with the Department for Communications, Climate Action and Environment which is the lead Department in this area. </p>  <p>  In that context, my Department recognises that there is an opportunity to encourage the utilisation of agricultural waste as an alternative source of energy. </p>  <p>  While it is possible to produce and utilise methane through AD of stored manure and academic and industry research suggests that there is the potential for a significant role in the heat and transport sectors for biogas produced by anaerobic digestion, analysis to date would suggest that costs are a significant factor.</p>  <p>  Given renewed interest in this technology and an interest from industry in mobilising biomethane, my Department is collaborating closely with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment to consider the potential for anaerobic digestion to contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s significant renewable energy and GHG targets, and promotes the development of Ireland&rsquo;s bioeconomy.</p>  <p>  My Department, in collaboration with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment (DCCAE) and the Environmental Protection Agency, has sought to encourage the use of animal by-products (ABPs) as &ldquo;valuable by-products not waste&rdquo;.  The sustainable use of ABPs can result in wider environmental and economic benefits.  </p>  <p>  The agriculture and forest sector has a critical role to play in contributing to our national climate change ambitions, and bioenergy represents a key component of that contribution.</p></reply>

Up until then, public service occupational pensions, including Defence Forces pensions, were generally adjusted in line with, and from the same operative date as, relevant pay increases applied to other corresponding public servants.  In the intervening years since end-2008, the Deputy will be aware that the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Acts 2009 &ndash; 2013 reduced public service pay and pension rates.</p>  <p>  The pre-existing non-statutory linkage of pension adjustments to movements in the pay of serving public servants &ndash; sometimes referred to as "pay parity" &ndash; lapsed in 2010, when the values of pensions in payment were left unchanged notwithstanding pay cuts at the beginning of 2010 that affected all public servants under the FEMPI legislation.</p>  <p>  Moreover, due to a &lsquo;grace period&rsquo; associated with the 2010 pay cuts, public servants who retired in the period up to end-February 2012 had their pensions based on the higher &lsquo;pre-cut&rsquo; salary levels.  This has led to the current situation whereby post-February 2012 retirees, on a like-for-like basis, mostly receive lower pensions than their counterparts who retired before them.  In addition, from the beginning of 2011, a progressively structured "Public Service Pension Reduction" (PSPR) had reduced the rates of public service pensions above specified thresholds.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in his reply to Questions Nos. 373 and 378 of 20th June 2017 indicated that the pension differential arising between pre and post-2012 retirees and the lapsing of pay parity have created the conditions under which &ndash; as we move beyond "FEMPI" legislation and the progressive removal of the PSPR towards more normal pay and pension setting conditions in the public service &ndash; the issue of how to adjust the post-award value of public service pensions through appropriate pay or other linkages has required consideration.</p>  <p>  In this context, the Public Service Stability Agreement (PSSA) 2018-2020 sets out the policy on pension increases as now adopted by Government for the duration of that agreement, that is, to end-2020.  Section 6.2 of the PSSA states that policy on public service pensions in payment will be guided by the following three elements:</p>  <p>  First, the need to adopt an equitable approach to the various public service pensioner cohorts differentiated by date of retirement (in particular pre and post end-February 2012) is affirmed.  Second, for those who retired or will retire after end-February 2012, to the extent that they retired on reduced salaries for pension award purposes, they will receive pension increases in line with pay increases received by their peers currently in employment, in accordance with the terms of the collective Agreement.  Third, when alignment is achieved between pre and post end-February 2012 pensioners, as will happen progressively for salary ranges up to &euro;70,000 in 2020 under the proposed collective agreement, pay increases will continue to benefit pensions in payment for the duration of this Agreement.</p>  <p>  Under the Lansdowne Road Agreement, certain public servants including relevant Defence Forces members received pay increases from 1 January 2016 (where basic salary was less than &euro;31,000) and from 1 April 2017 (a &euro;1,000 pay increase for all public servants with basic salaries below &euro;65,000).  In December 2017, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform authorised the application of those 2016-2017 pay increases to certain public service pensions.  Backdated to 1 September 2017, this pension increase is essentially confined to post-February 2012 retirees who retired on basic salaries of not more than &euro;65,000 &ndash; in line with current pension increase policy as adopted by Government.  In January, 2018 the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform authorised that the basic pay increases provided for in 2018-2020 during the period of the Public Service Stability Agreement also be passed on to the pensions of relevant public servants who retired post-February 2012.</p>  <p>  I am advised that, in line with the current public service pension increase policy, my Department has commenced the detailed work of implementing these pension increases in the case of relevant military pensioners who retired since March 2012.  I am also advised that this will be a significant undertaking for my Department and its payroll provider, as each pensioner rate will have to be examined at individual level on an ongoing basis as the various pension increases are worked through.</p>  <p>  Finally, the progressive removal of the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) from pensions in payment has been happening in three stages over the period 2016 to 2018.  As of 1 January 2018, it means that most public service pensioners, including about 95% of military pensioners, are not affected by PSPR at all.</p></reply>

Niamh deployed on 6 October 2017 to join Operation Sophia and returned to Ireland on 20 December 2017.</p><p>Operation Pontus was a humanitarian search and rescue mission undertaken as part of a bilateral arrangement with the Italian authorities.  The sole focus of the mission was the rescue of migrants in the Mediterranean.</p><p>Operation Sophia is primarily a security operation which specifically seeks to counter human trafficking and smuggling in the Southern Central Mediterranean by taking action against the criminal networks and disrupting the smugglers' business model.  By improving maritime security, Operation Sophia is actively contributing to EU and international efforts for the return of stability in Libya.  In addition, Operation Sophia plays an important role in training the Libyan Coastguard.  So far, 201 Libyans have been trained by EU Member States and this work is ongoing.</p><p>The specific tasks assigned to naval vessels by the Operation Sophia Force Commander depend on the operational requirements in the Mediterranean area at any given time.  In the course of its deployment, the crew of L.&Eacute;. Niamh were engaged both in security tasks and in responding to Safety of Life at Sea events (search and rescue) in the area of operation.</p><p>The UN migration agency (IOM) has reported that the number of migrants arriving in Europe by sea in 2017 was the lowest figure since the crisis began in the Mediterranean.  The number of migrants and refugees entering Europe by sea during 2017 was 171,635, which is less than half (47%) of the 2016 arrivals of 363,504.  This reduction is reflected in the amount of Search and Rescue activity conducted by the Naval Service in 2017.  In advance of joining the EU naval mission in October 2017, the Irish Naval vessel, L.&Eacute;. William Butler Yeats, on its 3 month deployment on Operation Pontus, rescued 701 persons.  In the following three month period from October to December 2017, 613 migrants were rescued by an Irish Naval vessel, L.&Eacute;. Niamh, operating as part of Operation Sophia.</p><p>In addition to this international commitment, the Naval Service in 2017 continued to meet national operational requirements which included fishery protection duties, maritime security operations and maritime search and rescue.</p></reply>

It is hoped these can start in the spring, depending on the provision by the UK of greater clarity on its objectives, including in regard to customs.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the EU has intensified its preparatory work with a view to the adoption by the European Council in March of additional Guidelines on the framework for the future EU-UK relationship.</p>  <p>  I have been consistently clear that the optimal outcome would be for the UK to, in effect, remain in the Single Market and Customs Union.  This is ultimately a decision for the UK and its current position is that it wishes to leave the Single Market and the Customs Union.  The EU remains open to all options, but its approach will be calibrated, in line with the principles agreed by the European Council, in response to what the British are putting on or taking off the table.  This is a position that Michel Barnier has expressed on a number of occasions, including on 5 February.</p>  <p>  In the 8 December Joint Report from the EU and UK negotiators on progress in phase one of the Brexit negotiations, the UK undertook that, in the event that it is not possible to resolve the border issue as part of a wider EU-UK future relationship agreement, or through specific solutions proposed by the British Government, it will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Customs Union and Single Market which support North South cooperation, the all-island economy and protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.  Ireland and the Commission are agreed on the need for the legally binding Withdrawal Agreement under Article 50 TEU to include satisfactory arrangements achieving this objective.</p>  <p>  I and my officials continue to set forward Ireland&rsquo;s position on these issues at EU level through the General Affairs Council (Art. 50) and the relevant preparatory bodies as well as through bilateral contacts with Michel Barnier and the EU Taskforce and EU27 counterparts.  This includes my meeting this morning with Foreign Minister Linas Linkevi&egrave;ius of Lithuania.</p>  <p>  While stressing that Ireland is a member of the EU27 and that the issues involved can only be substantively negotiated with the European Commission, Brexit also naturally arises during the frequent bilateral contacts which I have with UK Ministers, including in the last fortnight with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, Chancellor Philip Hammond, Minister Alan Duncan and Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington.  I most recently met Mr Lidington on Friday last, 9 February, the day when the most recent EU-UK negotiating round finished.  In addition to making clear the Government&rsquo;s position on island of Ireland issues, I strongly impressed upon him the need for the UK to come forward with more concrete proposals, including on a customs partnership if that is what they choose to seek.</p></reply>

This is a service which my Department provides so that the media can easily and freely avail of photography where their own staff photographers cannot be fully accommodated.  Events such as the visit of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall in May 2017 and those by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada in July 2017 and UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in November 2017 resulted in positive overseas media coverage of Ireland.</p><p>Through the Office of Government Procurement an updated Multi-Supplier Framework Agreement for the provision of Professional Photography and Videography is now in operation.  My Department procures the services of external photographic agencies via this Framework where necessary.</p><p>In addition, my Department continues to avail of in-house resources for photography whenever possible.</p><p>The cost of photography to my Department for events which took place in 2018, 2017 and 2016 are listed in Tables 1, 2 and 3.  In the time available, it has not proved possible to compile a breakdown of photography costs associated with events organized by Ireland&rsquo;s network of 80 diplomatic missions abroad.</p><p><b>Public Relations and Communications Advice - 2016 to date</b></p><p>My Department has not incurred expenditure on external public relations or communications advice since 1 January 2016.  My Department has from time to time commissioned companies with a public relations and communications background to provide other professional services such as project management, logistics and event management, particularly in relation to Irish Aid public outreach activities.  A table containing this information is set out.</p><p>DHR Communications has been contracted to manage and administer grants to journalists reporting on international development issues under the Simon Cumbers Media Fund (SCMF) and to manage and administer annual Africa Day-related events.</p><p>The SCMF involves managing three funding rounds each year, including the annual SCMF student competition.  This typically involves the following activities:</p><p>- Convening national and regional information workshops;</p><p>- Managing and administering the application process;</p><p>- Organising the judging process;</p><p>- Providing detailed feedback to all applicants;</p><p>- Processing grant payments and keeping detailed administrative and financial records;</p><p>- Maintaining and updating the SCMF website.</p><p>It should be noted that expenses paid to third parties account for approximately 30% of the total paid to DHR for managing and administering the Simon Cumbers Media Fund.  This includes costs associated with maintaining and updating the SCMF website, facilitating the judging process and raising awareness of the Fund among journalists.</p><p>Following a competitive tendering process, DHR was also engaged to plan, manage and execute a national Africa Day flagship event as hosted by my Department at the Farmleigh Estate in 2016 and 2017 and also to support other Africa Day regional events held outside Dublin.  This included the administration of a small grants scheme for the regional events which DHR managed on behalf of the Department in partnership with a number of local authorities.  DHR also worked to raise public awareness of the Africa Day events, including through the use of social media and the Africa Day website.  This public awareness work represented a very minor element of the overall project and was conducted in close cooperation with my Department&rsquo;s communications office.</p><p>In relation to the expenditure on Africa Day, expenses paid to third parties accounted for between 70% and 80% of the total costs listed.  This included expenditure on security, sanitation, venue set-up, health and safety issues and small grants to facilitate the participation of community groups.</p><p>Table 4 sets out the payments for

Recent events attended by the Passport Service include the National Ploughing Championships in September 2017, and the Holiday World Show and the &lsquo;Bride to Be&rsquo; show in January 2018 in the RDS.</p><p>In addition to these methods, from time to time interviews with the Director or staff of the Passport Service have been conducted with regional radio stations, which provides another opportunity to get the key passport messages to the public.</p><p>An extensive media campaign was also commissioned in early 2017, in connection with launch of the award-winning Online Passport Renewal Service, to encourage adults renewing their passports to use this fast, secure and convenient method of applying for a passport.  This media campaign included posters at airports and on various forms of public transport.  Short promotional video clips were also developed in this regard and have been adapted for different audiences and shared extensively by the Deaprtment on all social media platforms.</p><p>Finally, the Passport Service offers a free reminder service.  Citizens registering for the reminder service receive an email prior to expiry of their passport to ensure they are aware that they need to apply for a new passport.  All passport holders are encouraged to sign up to this free service at .</p><p>My Department will continue to work hard to promote these important messages relating to passports.  I am satisfied that these promotional strategies are the most cost-effective way to reach a wide audience.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-02-13a.223.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018021300061#WRD05800"><p>The Government welcomed the decision of the European Council on 15 December 2017 that sufficient progress had been made in phase one of the Article 50 negotiations.  In phase one<font color="#004080">,</font>we secured concrete commitments on the protection of North South Cooperation, the All-Island economy, the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process.  We have also secured clear and strong commitments on avoiding a hard border and the UK has set out, for the first time, how this will be achieved.</p><p>In the event that it is not possible to resolve the border issue as part of a wider EU-UK future relationship agreement, which has always been the Irish Government&rsquo;s preference, or through specific solutions, the UK has committed that &ldquo;in the absence of agreed solutions, the United Kingdom will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all-island economy, and the protection of the 1998 agreement.&rdquo;</p><p>The North South cooperation we enjoy today brings tangible benefits to the daily lives of people in the border region and contributes to economic opportunity and development.  It is also a very practical outworking of the peace process which allows for the normalisation of relationships between people across the island, to mutual benefit.  The Government is therefore firmly focused on protecting the full range of areas in which North South cooperation exists today.</p><p>The Guidelines agreed by the European Council in December underline that negotiations in phase two can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken regarding citizens&rsquo; rights, the financial settlement and the Irish-specific issues during the first phase are respected in full and translated faithfully into legal terms as quickly as possible.  A key focus in the current phase of the negotiations is therefore on completing work on the withdrawal issues and on the drafting of the binding Withdrawal Agreement, where we and our EU partners expect to see the commitments made by the UK in phase one on all exit issues, including those involving Ireland, to be translated faithfully into legal terms as quickly as possible.</p><p>In this regard, we are working closely with the Commission Task Force and our EU partners in the coming weeks to advance the legal and technical work needed.  This work is building on work carried out at the request of the EU and UK Coordinators for the High Level Dialogue on Ireland/Northern Ireland, where officials carried out detailed work over October and November last year to map out areas of cooperation that operate on a North South basis on the island of Ireland and which rely on EU law and policies.</p><p>This included looking at the six North South implementation bodies, the areas of cooperation under the North South Ministerial Council, which cover agriculture, environment, health, education, transport and tourism, as well as other areas where there is practical cooperation between North and South, including justice and security, energy, broadcasting and communications, inland fisheries, sport and culture.</p><p>The exercise highlighted how the maintenance and future development of meaningful North South cooperation rely on the EU legal and policy frameworks to give direction to th<font color="#004080">is</font>cooperation and to facilitate its operation.  The EU frameworks are both overarching and the foundation to North South cooperation in many instances.  Much of the cooperation is interconnected, mutually supporting and complementary; it is not easily quantifiable.</p><p>All areas of cooperation, to varying extents, rely on or are supported by EU acquis.  Much of what happens involves the implementation of EU law and policies in a coherent and coordinated way that benefits the island of Ireland as a whole, particularly for reasons of size, economies of scale and geographic location.</p><p>The exercise underlined the need to avoid risks presented by any regulatory divergence from the rules of the EU Single Market and Customs Union.  We want to ensure that this cooperation can continue in a meaningful way.</p><p>Like the UK, we have consistently said that it is our preference to resolve the Irish-specific issues through the wider future relationship agreement between the EU and the UK.  However, in case this is not possible, we must at the same time ensure legal certainty in the Withdrawal Agreement that reflects the commitments made by the UK in phase one of the negotiations.</p><p>We will continue to work closely with the Commission Task Force and our EU partners in the coming weeks to advance the legal and technical work needed.</p></reply>

Despite repeatedly stating its commitment to improving its human rights record, the Bahraini Government appears to be targeting those who express disagreement with or criticism of the Government.  A number of worrying developments suggest an increasingly restrictive attitude to those opposing or challenging the Government in any way.  Statements from the Bahraini Government on its commitment to safeguarding human rights enshrined in the Bahraini Constitution are undermined by the many examples of violations of the most fundamental freedoms which we have seen, including violations of freedom of opinion and expression.</p>  <p>  Ireland attaches great importance to safeguarding the human rights of all prisoners.  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about human rights issues and restrictions of civil liberties in Bahrain are regularly conveyed to the Bahraini authorities, including through the Bahraini Embassy in London and through Ireland&rsquo;s (non-resident) Ambassador to Bahrain.  Most recently, in December, officials from my Department met with officials from the Embassy of Bahrain in London, and raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the human rights situation in Bahrain.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department also raised ongoing human rights concerns with Bahrain in the context of its Universal Periodic Review, which took place in Geneva in May 2017.  In advance of this review, the Irish Mission to the UN in Geneva supported an event by the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, where human rights concerns in the Kingdom were discussed.

The Programme for a Partnership Government highlights this priority, with specific reference to implementation of the All-Party D&aacute;il motions relating to the Dublin Monaghan bombings.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge also those across the House who work on a cross-party basis with the Government on this issue and the tireless efforts of Justice for the Forgotten.</p>  <p>  The All-Party motion on the 1974 Dublin Monaghan bombings that was adopted by the D&aacute;il on 25 May 2016 has, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011, been conveyed to the British Government.  These motions call on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, as well as the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk and the murder of Seamus Ludlow.  </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of these all-Party D&aacute;il motions, and has consistently raised the issue with the British Government.</p>  <p>  I am actively engaged with the British Government on an ongoing basis on this issue, as are officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I discussed the matter on a number of occasions with the former Secretary of State, James Brokenshire, and I will continue to pursue the issue directly with the current Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley.</p>  <p>  As part of this engagement, the Government underlines that the D&aacute;il motions represent the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin Monaghan atrocities.  I have also advised that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government and indeed this House, and I have emphasised the urgent need for such a response.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with the British Government on the request in relation to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, and pursue all possible avenues that could achieve progress on this issue, consistent with the request made by this House.</p></reply>

The tax wedge is defined as the ratio between the amount of taxes paid by an average single worker without children (i.e. a worker on 100% of average earnings) and the corresponding total labour costs for the employer including employer social insurance costs. </p><p>Ireland historically has one the lowest tax wedge levels both within the EU and the OECD at average wages.  In 2016 (the latest year of data available), Ireland&rsquo;s average tax wedge was 27.1% of labour costs.  This compares very favourably to the OECD-average of 36.0%, and has been the lowest of the EU28 member states since 2000. </p><p>However, this comparative difference in tax wedge is eroded as incomes increase. Analysis published in the Income Tax Reform Plan in 2016, available online at<i>,</i>shows that in 2015 the Irish tax wedge for a single person was comparatively low at income of up to 125% of average earnings.  It then surpassed the UK and USA at c.125% and 150% respectively and surpassed the comparative French tax burden at c.210% of average earnings, while still remaining below Denmark and Germany.</p><p>In Budget 2015, the Department of Finance undertook an Economic Impact Assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Policy available online at<i>.</i>As part of this work, ESRI researchers estimated that the corporate tax rate has a negative effect on the location decision of multinational companies.  In other words, the higher the corporation tax rate in a country, the lower the probability of FDI locating there.  Although not the main focus of this research, they also examined the relationship between labour costs and FDI.  The researchers found that the higher the labour costs in a country, the lower the probability of FDI locating there.  This negative relationship between labour costs and FDI is borne out in other international studies such as:</p><p>- Johansson et al. (2008) &ldquo;TAX AND ECONOMIC GROWTH&rdquo;, OECD, <i></i></p><p>- Hajkova et al. (2006) &ldquo;TAXATION, BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND FDI LOCATION IN OECD COUNTRIES&rdquo;, OECD, <i></i></p><p>All else equal, it implies that countries with higher tax wedges than other countries are more likely to deter FDI.</p><p>I would also note that it is important to look at the effects of budgetary measures over time and not ignore their broader impacts.  The contribution of budgetary policy to employment growth over the past number of years is a case in point.  Employment is the best route out of poverty and is crucial to ensuring the sustainability of Ireland&rsquo;s prosperity.  Therefore the importance of the role of budget measures in creating an environment conducive to employment creation should not be understated.  As such, it remains a key Government priority to maintain competitiveness and support employment growth.  The Department of Finance will continue to monitor developments in this evidence base closely.</p></reply>

The Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base has been discussed for a number of years and was first formally proposed in 2011.

Ireland has supported the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives, which standardise anti-avoidance measures across the EU in line with the OECD BEPS recommendations. </p>  <p>  However, taxation remains within the competence of individual Member States and unanimity is needed before any tax changes can be agreed at EU level.</p>  <p>  Ireland's position has always been clear - we do not support tax harmonisation that undermines a Member State's ability to set its own tax rate and to determine its own tax base.  We have however shown we are willing to agree EU tax Directives that seek to implement agreed international best practice in a consistent manner across the EU.  This remains Ireland's position.</p>  <p>  Ireland are by no means alone in having concerns about tax harmonisation.  These views are shared by many other Member States across the EU.  </p></reply>

This assessment will in many cases include insurers own presumptions based on their private modelling and research. Consequently, neither the Government nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.</p>  <p>  Government policy in relation to flooding is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems.  This in turn should lead to the increased availability of flood insurance.  To achieve this aim, there is a focus on:</p>  <p>  - prioritising spending on flood relief measures by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and relevant local authorities,</p>  <p>  - development and implementation of plans by the OPW to implement flood relief schemes, and</p>  <p>  - improving channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry, in order to reach a better understanding about the provision of flood cover in marginal areas.  </p>  <p>  The above approach is complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland, which provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes which should provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in areas where works have been completed.  In this regard, the Insurance Ireland/OPW working group, which the Department of Finance attends, now meets on a quarterly basis to support the information flow and improve the understanding of issues between both parties.  </p>  <p>  Finally, you should be aware that a consumer can make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated. In addition, individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance or believe that they are being treated unfairly may contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance.</p></reply>

Although the sale of the product prior to 2002 is not a bar in itself to the investigation by the FSPO of conduct which occurred after 2002, it is important to note that the legislative provisions governing the power of the FSPO to investigate such complaints are complex.  </p><p>Section 51 of the Act prescribes a period of 6 years for the making of a complaint to the FSPO that does not relate to a &ldquo;long-term financial service&rdquo;. </p><p>Complaints about long-term financial services can be made to the FSPO within whichever of the following periods is the last to expire:</p><p>1. 6 years from the date of the conduct giving rise to the complaint;</p><p>2. 3 years from the earlier of the date on which the person making the complaint became aware, or ought reasonably to have become aware, of the conduct giving rise to the complaint;</p><p>3. such longer period as the Ombudsman may allow where it appears to him or her that there are reasonable grounds for requiring a longer period and that it would be just and equitable, in all the circumstances, to so extend the period.</p><p>It should be noted that the long-term financial service should not have expired or otherwise been terminated more than 6 years before the date the complaint is made.</p><p>The FSPO is precluded by Section 50 of the Act from investigating complaints where:</p><p>(a) the internal dispute resolution procedures required under Section 54 have not been complied with,</p><p>(b) there are or have been proceedings (other than where the proceedings have been stayed under Section 49) before any court in respect of the matter that is the subject of the investigation,</p><p>(c) the complaint relates to a matter that is within the jurisdiction of the Workplace Relations Commission or Pensions Authority or an alternative suitable forum or tribunal, or</p><p>(d) the complaint, or any matter arising in connection with the complaint, is excluded from the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman by regulations made under Section 4.</p><p>The Ombudsman must also be cognisant of the provisions of Section 52 of the Act which prescribe that he may decline to investigate a complaint where, in his opinion:</p><p>(a) the complaint is frivolous or vexatious or was not made in good faith,</p><p>(b) the subject matter of the complaint is trivial,</p><p>(c) the conduct complained of occurred at too remote a time to justify investigation,</p><p>(d) there is or was available to the complainant an alternative and satisfactory means of redress in relation to the conduct complained of,</p><p>(e) the complainant has no interest or an insufficient interest in the conduct complained of, or</p><p>(f) the subject matter of the complaint is of such a degree of complexity that the courts are a more appropriate forum.</p><p>Each complaint is dealt with on its own merits and there may be any number of aspects to a complaint which require consideration, in order to determine whether the Ombudsman can investigate a complaint about conduct which has occurred after 2002.</p></reply>

Accordingly, Recommendation 6 of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance aims to address the problems faced by this category of drivers.  Pursuant to this recommendation, a protocol has been agreed between the Department and Insurance Ireland under which insurance companies have committed to accepting the driving experience returning emigrants gained while abroad, when the driver has had previous driving experience in Ireland.  The guiding principle of the protocol is to ensure that a returning emigrant is not treated any differently to any other driver subject to their ability to demonstrate, and the insurance company to verify, continuous driving experience and the normal acceptance criteria of the company.  What this means is that the returning emigrant will not be disadvantaged from spending time abroad.  Furthermore, under the protocol insurance companies will not distinguish between countries on the basis of which side of the road driving takes place therein or, indeed, whether the country is a member of the EU or not.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above, insurance companies have agreed to provide relevant and helpful information on their websites to make it easier for consumers to understand the implications of their move abroad from a motor insurance perspective.  As part of this exercise, they will outline what people need to do under a number of different circumstances depending on the length of time they intend being away from Ireland. </p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland submitted a report on the implementation of this recommendation to the Department of Finance on 22 December 2017.  This report confirmed that Insurance Ireland members have agreed to publish the wording of the agreed protocol on their company websites and any other forms of social media, in addition to providing training for staff who can work through issues with emigrants before they leave, whilst they are out of the country and when they return to Ireland.  The stated intention is &ldquo;to resolve any issues well before they arise and for the consumer to be aware of the considerations when moving abroad&rdquo;.  The wording of the agreed protocol is also available on the Insurance Ireland website. </p>  <p>  The report also outlines some sample cases which demonstrate how the rolling-out of the protocol has already led to disputed cases being resolved to the benefit of returning emigrants, and provides figures indicating that the number of such cases being processed under the Declined Cases Agreement is decreasing.</p>  <p>  If, however, a returning emigrant is unable to secure a motor insurance quotation on the open market, they may be in a position to avail of the Declined Cases Agreement process, and the relevant contact details are: declined@insuranceireland.eu or 01-6761914.  More generally, Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance, which can be accessed at feedback@insuranceireland.eu or 01-6761820.</p></reply>

The review will be informed by the desirability of achieving relative stability, both over the short and longer terms, in LPT payments of liable persons.

VAT on these services is now chargeable where the consumer is located instead of where the supplier is located.  </p><p>As a result of the change, EU and non-EU businesses are required to register and account for VAT in every Member State in which they supply TBE services to consumers or, alternatively, to avail of the optional special scheme known as the Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS).</p><p>MOSS is a simplification scheme that allows a business engaged in TBE supplies to register in a single Member State, to file a single quarterly return and pay its VAT liability for all Member States through a web portal in the Member State of registration. This enables suppliers to avoid having to register and account for VAT in all the Member States to which they make TBE supplies. </p><p>Transitional rules for the period 2015-2018 provide that the Member State of registration may retain a percentage of the VAT collected for other Member States, with the retention percentage being 30% in 2015 and 2016 and 15% for 2017 and 2018. Therefore the final retention fee payment in respect to VAT retained by Ireland from VAT revenues collected in respect of supplies to other Member States through the MOSS system for 2018 will be received in Quarter 1 2019.</p><p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the following table provides an overview of the VAT collected, amount retained and the VAT remitted to each Member State from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017. Information for January 2018 is not yet available as these returns are not due until April 2018.</p><p>Small variations may be observed between the actual sums collected, retained and remitted due to rounding. Some of these values are provisional and may be subject to future revision.<table><tr><th>EU Member State</th><th>Gross VAT Received</th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th>Amount

to Question 7037-18, regarding the potential growth in cloud computing services as highlighted by the Deputy, MOSS accounts for VAT that is chargeable on business to consumer supplies. VAT on intra-community business to business supplies are accounted for though the normal reverse charging mechanism within each EU Member State. The information furnished by traders on MOSS returns does not require the yield from a particular TBE service to be separately identified. It is therefore not possible to determine the potential additional yield from the supply of cloud computing services to consumers in other EU Member States.</p></reply>

As Minister for Finance, my role has been primarily in relation to the use of tax policy to incentivise pension savings.  </p>  <p>  My colleague, Deputy Regina Doherty, as Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection has responsibility for State pension policy and for policy in relation to voluntary, supplementary pension provision.</p>  <p>  In that context, officials from my department have been in contact with officials from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection who advised that Section 59 of the Pensions Act 1990 requires trustees to make arrangements for the payment of benefits, as provided for under the rules of a pension scheme, as they become due, whether in the State or in any other Member State.  Trustees must also ensure that proper membership and financial records are kept.  Members of pension schemes should receive annual statements from any pension schemes they have paid into.  They further indicated that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has arrangements in place to assist with scheme member tracing, where pension schemes are having difficulty locating scheme members. Where the administrator of a pension scheme or of a life company is unable to trace a member using their own resources they can avail of that Department&rsquo;s host mailing service for assistance in this process.  </p>  <p>  There is currently no single platform or infrastructure in place in Ireland allowing deferred scheme members to access information on their pensions savings and to trace their pension entitlements.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has had a number of meetings with industry where it was indicated that in many cases the pension funds can find owners of pension benefits using their own searches or by utilising that Department&rsquo;s host mailing system.</p>  <p>  Unclaimed benefits within occupational pension schemes can remain in the scheme indefinitely.  Such funds remain there in trust for the member.  Unclaimed personal pension funds and PRSAs established with an insurance undertaking are subject to the Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Act 2003.  Where the policy owner cannot be traced, those funds are transferred to the Dormant Accounts Fund.  The Dormant Accounts Fund is part of a framework for the administration of unclaimed accounts.  Statutory functions related to the Fund are held by the Minister for Rural and Community Development.</p>  <p>  Under the Dormant Accounts Acts 2001-2012 and the Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Act 2003, balances on dormant accounts with banks, building societies and An Post and the net encashment value of certain life assurance policies are remitted to the State annually.

Although it was not a function of the Pensions Ombudsman, his Office would endeavor to use the extensive experience that had been gained over the years to provide whatever assistance it could in response to such enquiries.  The Ombudsman has confirmed that he will continue in the same vein.  </p></reply>

For example, the Government has reformed personal insolvency, introduced the Abhaile Scheme which provides support via the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI), the Legal Aid Board and the Citizens Information Board (CIB).  </p><p>It should be noted that the recent improvements in the economy have significantly reduced the numbers in negative equity and the most recent Central Bank Macro Financial Review indicates that as at Quarter 3 2017, only 8.7% of Primary Dwelling Homes (PDH) remain in negative equity, down from 36.2% at the end of 2012.  A link to the Review is below <i>.</i></p><p>Also, it should be noted that negative equity borrowers who wish to move home are exempted from the deposit requirements which generally apply to second and subsequent buyers in the Central Bank mortgage lending measures.  </p></reply>

Our Risk Evaluation Analysis and Profiling (REAP) and Social Network Analysis (SNA) systems each use data from multiple sources which can be used in the risk- profiling of online traders.  </p><p>Data sources include, for example, information provided by other EU Member States and Irish third-party data sources, as well as publicly-available online information.  This data is then matched against Revenue&rsquo;s taxpayer records in order to identify cases which potentially do not meet their Irish VAT obligations.  </p><p>Since 2009, Revenue has registered over 2,100 online and distance-sellers for the purpose of charging and remitting Irish VAT.  The VAT remitted to the Irish exchequer by these sellers has increased from &euro;9.4m in 2009 to an estimated &euro;78m in 2017, with a further projected increase to just under &euro;100m by end-2018.  </p><p>The majority of these traders are based in the UK, however other EU and non-EU traders comprise an increasing proportion of these sellers.</p></reply>

Since 2007, considerable conservation work has been undertaken to save the bridge from collapse.  The project has been phased to ensure that the work proceeds in a logical fashion recognising the need to address elements sequentially and to ensure that the necessary resources are in place to complete each individual task.  The project has been technically very challenging and hampered by the extremely fragile nature of the structure.  Over a number of seasons, high water levels in the river has made conditions for workers hazardous.  </p>  <p>  There is a serious historic collapse of the bridge on the downstream side and this is where attention is focussed currently.  The OPW is at present working on a design solution for this collapse and it is intended that this part of the project will continue for much of the year.  Once complete, this proposal will have to be submitted for the Consent of the Minister for Culture, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs under the National Monuments Acts.  It is not expected that works will be on site until next year.</p></reply>

This is reflected in primary EU Law where the EU Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union promotes the fundamental principles of non-discrimination, free movement of goods and services and freedom of establishment. These principles are reinforced in secondary EU law where the EU Directives on public procurement set out precise rules and procedures designed to ensure equal treatment, mutual recognition, proportionality and transparency in the awarding of public contracts.</p>  <p>  EU rules require tenderers to be compliant with relevant labour law in order to participate in a public procurement process. The Directives make it clear that non-compliance with the relevant obligations may lead to exclusion of a tenderer from the procedure for the awarding of a public contract. The obligations on suppliers in relation to compliance with labour law are reflected in the template request for tender and contract documents for goods and services developed by the Office of Government Procurement in conjunction with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific issue of the living wage, there is, however, no legal basis in Irish law to make it a requirement on suppliers who wish to engage in public tendering.  In addition, at EU level, any attempt to set wage rates through public procurement is also likely be viewed as protectionist and/or discriminatory and in breach of the EU Treaty principles enshrined in EU procurement directives.  The National minimum wage, of course, applies to all contracts, public and private.</p></reply>

The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of Flood Risk Management Plans. </p>  <p>  The CFRAM Programme focussed on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, identified as being at potentially significant risk of flooding. The proposed feasible measures, both structural and non-structural, identified for AFAs are outlined in the Flood Risk Management Plans.  </p>  <p>  The area referred to by the Deputy is within an AFA and is being assessed by the South Western CFRAM Programme.  The proposed viable flood relief measures for that AFA, would protect the properties at risk in that location.</p>  <p>  The Draft Flood Risk Management Plans were published for public consultation in 2016 and a significant volume of submissions were received for consideration.  In Summer 2017, the OPW finalised all Plans and each Plan was submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for an independent review of the environmental assessments. This independent review is nearing completion, after which the Final Plans will be formally submitted to the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform for approval, in accordance with the statutory requirements. </p>  <p>  I would hope in the coming weeks to seek the approval from the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform for the Flood Risk Management Plans developed under the CFRAM process.</p></reply>

The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.</p>  <p>  As a result of the changes I negotiated together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the current starting salary of a new teacher is &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511, at a cost of over &euro;200 million across the public service.</p>  <p>  Differential pay scales were introduced by the then Government in 2010. It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;130 million. Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.</p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated for 2018 would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs in 2018, and over 1,000 extra teachers in 2018. </p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. </p>  <p>  A commitment is included in the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 to consider the issue of newly qualified pay within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement. That process has now commenced with a first meeting on 12 October 2017.  The three teacher unions attended that first meeting.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that within 3 months of the passing of the Act, my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service. </p></reply>

In both 2018 and 2019 it is estimated that the number of graduates will be in the region of 1,850 primary and 1,500 post primary teachers.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that in November 2017 I launched a STEM Policy Statement and Implementation Plan, which aims to make Ireland the best in Europe in STEM by 2026. This Policy Statement focusses on the many strengths in STEM education in Ireland while providing a roadmap to address the areas for development.</p>  <p>  Late last year I also launched the Strategy for Foreign Languages in Education and Implementation Plan, which set out a roadmap to put Ireland in the top ten countries in Europe for the teaching and learning of foreign languages, through a number of measures targeted at improving proficiency, diversity and immersion. </p>  <p>  In order to deliver on the ambitions we have set for STEM and foreign languages, we will need to increase teacher supply in key priority areas. At post primary level, we are considering the introduction of subject quotas in ITE programmes. We are also considering the introduction of &ldquo;top up&rdquo; or conversion courses to upskill teachers. I have also announced that I want to double the number of places on undergraduate course to train second level teachers, particularly in areas like STEM. Many of these courses are already offered in STEM subjects.</p>  <p>  I intend shortly to establish a Teacher Supply Steering Group to develop a strategy for teacher supply.  As part of its remit, the Group will consult with key stakeholders and will consider all options to increase teacher supply in priority areas.</p>  <p>  I will also ask the Teaching Council to review subject criteria and processes for assessing out of state qualifications and to engage more with graduate fairs, and final year students.</p></reply>

The intention was that the philanthropic contributions would fund 50% of the initiative in the early years of development with local Music Education Partners (VECs (now ETBs) and local authorities) providing the other 50%, and that programmes would be continued into the future with Exchequer funding when the philanthropic donations cease.</p><p>Philanthropic funding for Phase 1 of Music Generation was phased out and the Department of Education and Skills has taken over 50% funding of Music Generation between 2014 and 2016, with the balance provided by partners in the local MEPs. In 2016 all funding for established Phase 1 Music Education Partnerships came from the DES and the local partnerships, without philanthropic support.</p><p>Agreement was given for Phase 2 of Music Generation to proceed by the Department in 2016.  Funded initially by philanthropic donations (U2 and The Ireland Funds) it involves the launch of up to 9 new Music Education Partnerships.  These are initially being funded by philanthropic funding, including from U2, but will move, as for Phase 1, towards exchequer funding. </p><p>The application process for Phase 2 closed in May 2017 and in September 2017, Music Generation announced 9 new areas of Ireland that will receive philanthropic funding from U2 and the Ireland Funds to create increased access to non-mainstream music education for children and young people in their local areas. </p><p>On 7 December 2017, at the launch of the Creative Youth programme, An Taoiseach announced that Phase 3 of Music Generation would proceed in the coming years, funded entirely with exchequer funding.  </p><p>Music Generation currently reaches over 41,000 children and young people annually.

At post-primary level nationally, enrolments are expected to continue to increase until the 2025/2026 academic year, at which point, enrolments at second level are expected to be in excess of 416,800 pupils for the first time in the history of the State. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the national demographic trends and projections of enrolments are not evenly spread and can include significant local and regional variations.  Some areas will decline faster than the national trend and some will continue to need additional accommodation even after the national demand figure falls. </p>  <p>  In order to account for such local variations and plan accordingly, the division of the country into 314 school planning areas is necessary to monitor this in greater detail.

The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.</p>  <p>  As a result of the changes I negotiated together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the current starting salary of a new teacher is &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.  If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511, at a cost of over &euro;200 million across the public service.</p>  <p>  Differential pay scales were introduced by the then Government in 2010.  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;130 million.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.</p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated for 2018 would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs in 2018, and over 1,000 extra teachers in 2018. </p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. </p>  <p>  A commitment is included in the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 to consider the issue of newly qualified pay within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement.  That process has now commenced with a first meeting on 12 October 2017.  The three teacher unions attended that first meeting.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that within three months of the passing of the Act, my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-02-13a.575.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018021300067#WRK01900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 233 to 236, inclusive, together.</p><p>The annual expenditure of the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI), since it was established, is set out in the following tables:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>ISI Annual Expenditure &euro;,000</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>5,597</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>8,367</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>7,914</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>6,527</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>5,621</td></tr></table></p><p>The following table shows the number of cases the ISI has helped since its launch through to the end of 2017:<table><tr><th>Type of Insolvency Solution</th><th>Total Number of Cases (to the end of 2017)</th></tr><tr><td>Personal Insolvency Arrangement (secured and unsecured debt)</td><td>2,175</td></tr><tr><td>Debt Relief Notice (for debts below &euro;35K)</td><td>1,177</td></tr><tr><td>Debt Settlement Arrangement (unsecured debt only)</td><td>678</td></tr><tr><td>Bankruptcy (secured and unsecured debt over &euro;20K)</td><td>1,926</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>5,956 </td></tr></table></p><p>The ISI was established in 2013 and is a central element of the personal insolvency regime. The ISI&rsquo;s objective is to restore people who are insolvent to solvency in a fair, transparent and equitable way.</p><p>International experience demonstrates that it takes several years for a new insolvency regime to really gain traction. However, to date, the ISI has returned over 6,000 debtors to solvency with over 2,000 of those cases being Personal Insolvency Arrangements (PIAs) which deal with mortgage debt.</p><p>In over 90% of these PIA cases, debtors have been able to stay in their homes. This is a significant achievement given that many cases involved arrears exceeding 720 days and is an important indicator that the system is achieving positive results for indebted borrowers.</p><p>The solutions introduced in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 have also had an indirect impact on the number and quality of over 120,000 informal agreements between debtors and creditors, as reported by the Central Bank of Ireland. Because arrangements agreed under the Act are public and court approved, they set precedents for the terms of agreements that will be acceptable to a court. Debtors now have realistic alternative options available to them through the ISI if negotiations break down. </p><p>To date the value of debt involved in applications to the ISI, including bankruptcies, has exceeded &euro;9.6 billion.</p><p>Insofar as the overall effectiveness of personal insolvency arrangements are concerned, the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 modernised the regime for personal insolvency and brought Ireland in line with international best practice by providing for a range of debt resolution options within a statutory framework which balances the rights of creditors and debtors. The Personal Insolvency Arrangement, in particular, is an innovative solution that seeks to restructure or settle secured debt. Other important elements of this framework include the minimum statutory protection laid down regarding the debtor's reasonable living expenses and their home.</p><p>The Government has introduced a number of amendments and supports, since 2012, to ensure the success of the solutions provided by the Personal Insolvency legislation. These include the section 115A Court review process and the Abhaile Mortage Arrears Resolution Service. </p><p>The section 115A Court review process, introduced with effect from November 2015, permits a debtor to ask the Court to review and assess the reasonableness of a PIA proposal which has been refused by creditors and which includes mortgage arrears on the debtor's home. The Court considers the reasonableness of the refusal using a balanced range of criteria and has power, if satisfied, to impose the proposed personal insolvency arrangement on the dissenting creditor(s). This removes the so called &quot;Bank Veto&quot;.</p><p>The High Court has published a number of important detailed judgements on the criteria that will be applied by the courts in section 115A review cases, and the types of mortgage arrears resolutions that may be imposed. Those precedents involved the following issues:</p><p>- Separated Spouses -a case involving a separated spouse who restructured her mortgage. The Court rejected a claim by the bank that, before any restructure, the bank needed the cooperation of the other joint borrower.  </p><p>- Rejection of unsustainable warehousing proposal and approval for negative equity write-off - acase where the mortgage lender wanted to warehouse part of a mortgage. The Court ruled that this could not be done unless there is a reasonable prospect of the couple paying back the warehoused amount. The PIA wrote off most of the negative equity.</p><p>- Fixing interest rate for the long term -a case concerning a mortgage rate fixed for 27 years. In assessing if this unfairly prejudiced the financial institution (a fund rather than a bank), the court looked at market investment returns rather than the rates and terms that are available to a bank to raise capital and decided that the PIA proposal was fair and reasonable in this context.</p><p>A further significant High Court judgement, dealing with technical challenges made to the Section 115A process, was also issued at the beginning of February. This ruling has been positively received by both the ISI and Personal Insolvency Practitioners. Subject to any possible appeal, it is expected to lead to increased activity in Personal Insolvency Arrangements.</p><p>Another important enhancement is Abhaile, the Government's national Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service, which ensures that people who are in danger of losing their home have access to free professional advice, including advice from a Personal Insolvency Practitioner. Abhaile was introduced in 2016 to allow further enhanced access to the personal insolvency regime. Abhaile offers detailed financial and legal advice to homeowners in mortgage arrears with the aim of allowing them to find a solution to their arrears and to stay in their homes where possible. Take up of the Abhaile scheme has been high, with over 10,000 vouchers for these consultations issued since the start of the scheme in July 2016. A borrower may also apply for legal aid through Abhaile to seek a court review under section 115A. Abhaile is also raising awareness of the scheme through a targeted Abhaile public information campaign.</p><p>Finally, my Department is also finalising a review of the operation of the Personal Insolvency Acts. Submissions made by stakeholders via a public consultation have made a range of recommendations to enhance the process and to support increased engagement with the system. I look forward to bringing proposals to Government in the coming months to address the conclusions of the review.</p></reply>

It should be noted that accommodating persons in EROCs for a period of time is considered to be good practice as it allows for a period of acclimatisation, de-stressing and on-site processing.  It is also a process that is supported by the UNHCR as best practice.</p>  <p>  Since Ballaghaderreen EROC opened in early last year nearly 300 people have resided there, with the current occupancy at 181. </p>  <p>  The IRPP will relocate a further 204 people from Greece in the coming weeks and Government have also pledged to take a 600 refugees from Lebanon in 2018. Some of these refugees will be housed in Ballaghaderreen EROC.  The exact numbers being housed there will be dependent on the movement of existing residents to their new homes in communities across the country.</p></reply>

It does not currently apply to the Defence Forces, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or prison officers of a prison. However it is intended that Part 5 of the Act will be amended to apply to the civilian staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and provisions to this effect will be included in the Disability (Miscellaneous) Provisions Bill 2016. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that these provisions do not mean that persons with disabilities are precluded from employment within the relevant services. It does mean, however, that the physical nature of certain roles requires those holding those posts to possess certain physical capabilities in connection with the specific requirements of the role.  Minimum physical standards apply for specific positions and the obligations imposed by part 5 of the Act do not apply in that context.</p>  <p>  Government departments are implementing a range of measures to improve employment prospects for persons with disabilities. The Report of the Make Work Pay Group was published earlier this year and already action has been taken on its recommendations.  We have a Comprehensive Employment Strategy in place to ensure a coordinated approach to support persons with disabilities to progress into employment.  The Strategy sets out a ten-year approach to ensuring that people with disabilities, who could and want to work, are supported and enabled to do so. A strategy implementation group meets regularly to monitor the implementation of actions across the public service. </p>  <p>  The Government has already taken a number of key decisions as recommended in the Strategy:</p>  <p>  - the public service employment target of people with disabilities will be increased on a phased basis as set out in the Strategy from 3% to 6% </p>  <p>  - special public service competitions for people with disabilities will be arranged and we will open up alternative recruitment channels for people with disabilities</p>  <p>  - an employer helpline will be provided with the assistance of the National Disability Authority, to provide expert guidance and peer support to employers in relation to the employment of staff with disabilities.</p></reply>

The Authority is also in the process of preparing its first three-year Strategic Plan for submission under section 20 of the 2015 Act which will, I understand, give enhanced focus to the issue of delivery timelines.</p>  <p>  The Authority is, therefore, continuing its work to progress the identification and elaboration, in conjunction with my Department, of the specific delivery dates concerned.  I expect these will be made known as soon as they have been aligned, to the satisfaction of the Authority, with its anticipated staffing and other working resources as an independent regulator.</p></reply>

In addition, in the context of the coming into force on 25 May 2018 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the DPC has launched a broad based communications campaign to raise awareness of the new law. These communications activities are focused on building awareness of the very significant additional obligations the GDPR will place on organisations, as well as the greatly strengthened rights it extends to individuals to have their personal data protected and safeguarded.</p><p>The spend in relation to the Insolvency Service of Ireland relates to the 'Back on Track' campaign. The 'Back on Track' campaign promotes the ISI's range of debt solutions at every opportunity in a range of ways including through the backontrack.ie website, targeted advertising campaigns (including TV, video on demand, outdoor, press, radio, and online), information booklets which are distributed nationwide, and presentations and meetings with relevant groups. Research has found that the campaign has greatly increased awareness of the ISI's services. Those who availed of an ISI solution have also spoken of the immense sense of relief once they took the first step to address their debt problems.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that the State Boards process is designed to enable any person to apply to a position on a State Board.  The Guidelines for Appointments to State Boards, which have been operational for over three years now, can be found at www.stateboards.ie. </p>  <p>  I am advised that the Public Appointments Service undertook a selection process for appointments to the seven vacancies arising in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission in line with its Guidelines and on an independent basis so to conform to best practice for appointments to a National Human Rights Institution.  A large number of applications were received from highly qualified persons for the Commissioner positions, reflecting the high level of interest that exists in the Commission.  This resulted in a highly competitive selection process as there were many more qualified candidates than available positions on the Commission.</p>  <p>  It is important that the Commission has a full complement of Commissioners so that it can get on with its important work.</p></reply>

Revised pension arrangements were also introduced which included provision for an employee pension contribution from pensionable pay and allowances in respect of personal pension benefits.  When these changes were introduced rates of Garda pay and pensionable allowances for members appointed after 6 April 1995 were grossed up in order to compensate for the increase in their pension contribution.  However the grossing up only included a small number of pensionable allowances.  The arrangements regarding the payment of superannuation contributions payable on the allowances that were not grossed up, including the Gaeltacht allowance, are currently under review by my Department.  It is, therefore, not possible at this stage to give a definitive figure in relation to superannuation contributions that would be due on retirement in the circumstances outlined.</p></reply>

The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient.  </p>  <p>  The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice was also developed by a steering committee of the Judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Committee website which was a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  The website can be accessed by members of the Judiciary and the public and is a valuable tool not only for members of the judiciary but also for lawyers, researchers and those concerned with the needs of victims and their families as well as members of the public.</p>  <p>  The report of the Working Group on the Strategic Review of Penal Policy, published in July 2014, considered the issue of developing sentencing guidelines.  However, the majority of the Review Group took the view that the primary role of developing sentencing guidelines is the responsibility of the judiciary and does not lie in bringing forward detailed statutory based guidelines.  It might also be noted that a Sentencing Council was not advocated by the Law Reform Commission in its Report on Mandatory Sentencing which was published in June 2013.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that, in 2014, the Court of Criminal Appeal issued a number of judgments which addressed the question of sentencing and which acknowledged the many factors that can be considered in individual cases which undermine the usefulness of direct comparisons between one case and another.  Nonetheless, every effort to promote consistency should be made and in this respect it is appropriate for the courts to provide guidance on sentencing matters.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Judicial Council Bill was published in June 2017 and is currently awaiting Committee Stage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  The Bill provides for the establishment of a Judicial Council, the function of which will be to promote and maintain excellence in the exercise by judges of their judicial functions. The Council is specifically tasked with promoting an understanding of sentencing principles and practices among judges and persons other than judges. In this context, it will be assisted by a Sentencing Information Committee which will be responsible for the collation of sentencing information and the dissemination of that information.  The costs for the operation of that Committee have yet to be determined but were provisionally estimated at &euro;400,000 for startup (including IT) costs and &euro;200,000 for  annual running costs.</p></reply>

The intention is to establish a dedicated Family Court within the existing court structures.  As the Deputy will appreciate, it is essential that there is proper planning and consultation with relevant stakeholders in order to ensure that the development of a new family court structure can be implemented smoothly and efficiently. </p>  <p>  My Department has established a working group, comprising officials from my Department, the Courts Service and the Legal Aid Board, to examine the operational aspects relating to the Family Court.  The intention is that the working group will develop an overall architecture for the new family court structure.  The working group is consulting with other relevant stakeholders. Key issues arising in consultations include family court venues and facilities, resources and capital investment in family courts and integration of relevant family and child services to provide the best possible family law outcomes.  In this context, in so far as additional resources and capital investment are required this will be fully scoped out in the context of the necessary regulatory impact assessment that is needed to support the legislative reforms.  </p>  <p>  I hope to secure Government approval in the coming months for the General Scheme of a Family Court Bill and in that context to have a regulatory impact assessment incorporating an estimate of the necessary investment settled.  Once the General Scheme has been approved by Government, it will be referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting and to the relevant Oireachtas Committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Coolock Garda Station forms part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (D.M.R.) North Division.  The Garda strength of the D.M.R. North Division on 31 December 2017 was 670, 103 of whom were assigned to Coolock Garda Station.  Of those assigned to Coolock Garda Station 7 are community Garda&iacute;. There are also 45 Garda Reserves and 39 Garda civilian staff attached to the Division. </p>  <p>  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p>  <p>  Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It provides a means of recognising that every community - both urban and rural - has its own concerns and expectations. I am assured by the Commissioner that the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.  Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies. In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community Relations Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network.  It is of course the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties, not solely those assigned full-time as community Garda&iacute;. </p>  <p>  I have previously stated that I welcome the strong emphasis that the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams and Community Policing Fora in every District.  </p>  <p>  In terms of progress on this important initiative, I am informed that a draft Community Policing Framework which outlines the manner in which Community Policing Teams and Community Safety Fora will be established has been completed and is subject to internal review before being approved by the Garda Executive for implementation.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all the Government has in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 including 15,000 Garda members. </p>  <p>  Real, tangible progress has been made towards this goal.  Since reopening the Garda College in September 2014, nearly 1,600 new recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 23 have been allocated to Coolock Garda Station.  Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College.  Also, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, which will see Garda numbers reach more than 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p>  <p>  In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018.</p>  <p>  Undoubtedly, the on-going recruitment process will support all Garda activities and will enhance Garda visibility within our communities and the provision of effective community policing across all Garda Divisions including the DMR North Division. </p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  At the request of the Commissioner in 2016, the Government moved decisively to strengthen Garda resources to deal with gang-related crime in the Dublin area.  Funding was approved for the establishment of a dedicated Armed Support Unit (ASU) for the Dublin Metropolitan Region in order to enhance armed support capability in Dublin and to free up the resources of the Emergency Response Unit.  Following a selection and training process, the ASU for the DMR became fully operational in December 2016 and is providing armed cover in the DMR on a 24 hour basis.</p>  <p>  Members of the ASU are highly trained and equipped with a variety of non-lethal and lethal weapons and perform high visibility armed checkpoints and patrols throughout the DMR.</p>  <p>  I am informed that the detail of the number of Garda&iacute; and resources allocated to the ASU is deemed to be operationally sensitive and cannot be disclosed for security reasons.</p>  <p>  However, I am assured by the Commissioner that the training, equipment and personnel capacities of the Regional Armed Support Units including the Dublin Armed Support Unit and the Emergency Response Unit are kept under constant review with a view to ensuring that their functional capacity is kept at the optimum level.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country including on the streets of the capital in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.

The Capital Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021 provides for an investment of &euro;46 million the Garda fleet to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit for purpose fleet.  This is in addition to the investment of almost &euro;30 million in the period 2013 to 2015. </p>  <p>  In the period 2013 to end of 2017 almost &euro;44 million will have been invested in the fleet with some 2,000 vehicles coming on stream in that period.</p>  <p>  Undoubtedly, this investment in resources and the on-going recruitment process will support all Garda activities and enhance visibility within our communities and will enable the Commissioner to provide additional resources to tackle the scourge of organised crime in our communities.</p></reply>

Multi-disciplinary approaches are also utilised to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in criminal enterprise are effectively targeted, including through the use of proceeds of crime legislation, money-laundering legislation, the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 relating to organised crime and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau. </p>  <p>  While we should not underestimate the difficulties which the Garda authorities face in tackling organised crime activity, we continue to see the significant results of their efforts in the arrests made and persons being brought before the Courts, as well as the ongoing drugs and firearms seizures made.  </p>  <p>  The question of providing for an offence of membership of a criminal gang, in a manner similar to the approach taken in the Offences Against the State Acts with regard to membership of a proscribed organisation, has arisen from time to time.  In this regard, it is important to understand the issues which arise in seeking to simply outlaw membership of a criminal gang in such a manner. Most significant here is the fact that a criminal gang is not likely to have the permanency of organisation and structure that a subversive organisation or other more fixed group would have.  Relationships in criminal gangs tend to be more fluid with shifting memberships, alliances and a membership which may depend on circumstance.  </p>  <p>  However, criminal legislation has been updated in recent years, with a view to ensuring that it provides a comprehensive range of provisions for the prosecution and punishment of crime, in particular the activities of those involved in organised crime.  Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 (as amended by the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009) establishes a number of offences targeting the activities of those involved in organised crime.  These offences include participation in a criminal organisation and directing a criminal organisation.  The latter offence specifically targets those in criminal organisations who give the orders without requiring their direct participation in the commission of criminal offences.  On conviction, this offence carries a penalty of up to life imprisonment. </p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice Act 2006 also makes it an offence to conspire with one or more persons to do an act that constitutes a serious offence, irrespective of whether such act actually takes place or not. Evidential provisions as to the existence of a criminal organisation were also introduced aiding prosecution of the offences provided for under the Act.  The Act also provides that where a serious offence is committed as part of, or in furtherance of a criminal organisation, it shall be treated as an aggravating factor for the purpose of determining sentence.</p>  <p>  I am advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to utilise all available legislation, including the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 referred to above, in their ongoing efforts to tackle organised crime activity.  </p></reply>

The expert oversight by the CSO of crime statistics is welcome in order to ensure that we can have confidence in the official crime statistics and can tailor our policies accordingly.  </p>  <p>  I want to clarify that the issue about the classification of homicide statistics is not new.  It was identified some time ago by the Garda&iacute; themselves and I am assured that intensive work has been ongoing to resolve the issue by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with oversight from the Policing Authority, the CSO and my own Department. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that this issue was already in the public domain at the time of my appointment as Minister for Justice and Equality.  Since my appointment as Minister I have been briefed regularly on the issues relating to crime statistics.  On 5 February, in the course of a wide ranging meeting with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on policing issues, I was briefed on the issue by Acting Commissioner O Cual&aacute;in and his wider team.  On 7 February I met the Chair and CEO of the Policing Authority with the Acting Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner to discuss the progress made to date in resolving this issue and progress yet to be made.  I strongly underlined the need to have matters addressed on an urgent priority basis, while acknowledging the labour intensive complex work involved in cases stretching back over many years.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na outlined the process of the peer review currently being undertaken and other aspects of the ongoing process on which they will report to the Authority at their next scheduled public meeting on 22 February. </p>  <p>  I support the Authority&rsquo;s important work in relation to this matter and I understand that this issue will continue to be examined both in public meetings and in the ongoing work that takes place in between such meetings until the Authority is fully satisfied.  This oversight is appropriate and welcome, as the Policing Authority was established by the Government as an independent body to oversee the performance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to policing services in Ireland.  Its key objective is to promote trust and confidence in policing and to help shape policing services for Ireland in the future.  The Minister has full confidence in the ability of the Authority to do the work with which they are tasked. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na initiated a review of homicide classifications, initially for the period 2013-2015 but later extended the review to cover the period from 2003-2017.  This is obviously a time consuming and complex process but it is important that both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the CSO are confident that their data is robust and accurate.  While the review is underway, the CSO has suspended the publication of quarterly crime statistics, with the most recent published figures being for Q4 2016.  The review by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has not been published as it is not yet complete, however the details will be made public on completion. </p>  <p>  I am extremely concerned about reports that unlawful deaths were not properly investigated.  Any substantiated allegations of this kind would be very serious and a cause of grave public concern.  The issue that has arisen in respect of homicide classification is complex and it is essential to clearly establish the facts.</p>  <p>  While I note that a figure of 41 deaths requiring reclassification has been mentioned in public discourse, this is incorrect.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has advised that their examination of 524 cases for the period 2013-2015 identified 41 cases which required further examination and, out of those 41 cases, 12 deaths were identified which required reclassifications on PULSE.  In addition, a further &lsquo;peer review&rsquo; verification process is underway in relation to these figures, as requested by the Policing Authority. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that, in the review of the 41 cases, it was identified by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that each death was fully investigated by them and this has been stated both orally and in writing.  I have received assurances from the Garda Commissioner that he is confident that all 41 cases which were identified by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as requiring further examination have been properly investigated in accordance with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

This effectively means that all applicants in the protection process may now apply for an employment permit from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  This is an existing scheme and the same conditions for eligibility are now being applied to international protection applicants as for all other non-EEA nationals.  Full details can be found on the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation's website at www.dbei.gov.ie </p>  <p>  In addition to the employment permits regime, the Government decided to set up an administrative scheme to provide eligible international protection applicants with access to self employment from 9 February.  In this regard, I used my executive power to provide an avenue for qualified applicants to engage in self-employment.  International Protection applicants who have not received a first instance decision within 9 months of the date of their application, if the delay is not through their own actions, who have made reasonable efforts to establish their identity, who have cooperated with the protection process and who have registered with the Revenue Commissioners are qualified to apply for a permission to access self employment.  </p>  <p>  In the situation outlined by the Deputy, the applicant can apply for an employment permit from the Department of Enterprise, Business and Innovation.

In this regard the Bureau continues its policy of working with Garda Divisional Drug Units nationwide in tackling supply reduction at local level. </p><p>This work is further supported by other national units, including the Criminal Assets Bureau, in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs.  This approach allows for the co-ordinated use of Garda resources in tackling all forms of organised crime, including illicit drug activity nationwide.  Multi-disciplinary approaches are also utilised to ensure that those involved in illicit activity are effectively targeted including through the use of the proceeds of crime legislation, money laundering legislation and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  I am informed that this approach adopts good practice in implementing a co-ordinated use of Garda resources and in utilising available criminal law to its fullest extent in tackling all forms of organised crime, including drug trafficking.</p><p>We have also seen unprecedented international cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and policing services in other jurisdictions leading to important arrests and drug seizures. </p><p>Underpinning all these measures is this Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It provides a means of recognising that every community - both urban and rural - has its own concerns and expectations.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.  Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies.  In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community Relations Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network.  It is of course the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties, not solely those assigned full-time as community Garda&iacute;. </p>  <p>  I have previously stated that I welcome the strong emphasis that the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams and Community Policing Fora in every District.  </p>  <p>  In terms of progress on this important initiative, I am informed that a draft Community Policing Framework which outlines the manner in which Community Policing Teams and Community Safety Fora will be established has been completed and is subject to internal review before being approved by the Garda Executive for implementation.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all the Government has in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 including 15,000 Garda members. </p>  <p>  In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018.</p>  <p>  Real, tangible progress has been made towards this goal.  Since reopening the Garda College in September 2014, nearly 1,600 new recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.  I am advised that there were 691 Garda assigned to community policing duties as of 31 December 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. Also, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, which will see Garda numbers reach more than 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p>  <p>  Undoubtedly, the on-going recruitment process will support all Garda activities and will enhance Garda visibility within our communities and the provision of effective community policing across all Garda Divisions.</p>  <p>  I have requested the information sought from the Garda Commissioner and will communicate directly with the Deputy in due course.</p></reply>

Section 37 of the 1998 Employment Act: </p>  <p>  &ldquo;It is an occupational requirement for employment in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Irish Prison Service or any emergency service that persons employed therein are fully competent and available to undertake, and fully capable of undertaking, the range of functions that they may be called upon to perform so that the operational capacity of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the service concerned may be preserved.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service is committed to the provision of workplace rehabilitation that supports and enables injured or sick employees to remain at work or return to the workplace at as early a time as possible.  Re-familiarisation with the workplace, or &lsquo;easing back in&rsquo;, can be very important where a staff member has been absent with illness for a lengthy period.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure these posts are kept available for as many staff as possible to aid in their recuperation and return to duty, the Irish Prison Service introduced the Policy for Accommodations (Rehabilitative/Restricted Duties) in July 2014.</p>  <p>  This Policy allows for staff to return from sick leave on &lsquo;lighter duties&rsquo; where the CMO has confirmed that they are likely to be in a position to return to full duties within 3 months.  The Irish Prison Service does not have capacity to accommodate staff on longer periods of these duties as there are very limited posts available.  In addition to the Policy these posts are required for pregnant staff.</p>  <p>  Extensions to a period of recuperative/restricted duties can only be considered in exceptional circumstances where the serving prison officer has the potential to return to full time duties.  There are currently 6 staff who have had their period of recuperative/restricted duties extended, on the advice of the CMO, to over 6 months.  Their cases have been referred again to the CMO with a view to them returning to full duties in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  In response to the Deputy&rsquo;s second query, there are 5 staff who are on long term restricted duties.  Their cases predate the introduction of the Irish Prison Service Accommodations(Rehabilitative/Restricted Duties) Policy.</p></reply>

The legislation is designed to promote equality and prohibit discrimination (direct, indirect and by association) and victimisation; it also allows for positive measures to ensure equality across the ten grounds.</p><p>The Equal Status Acts 2000-2015 outlaw discrimination outside the workplace, in particular in the provision of goods and services, selling, renting or leasing property and certain aspects of education.  Equality legislation also provides for remedies for those who have suffered discrimination.</p><p>There have been successfully negotiated changes to existing practices under the Equal Status Acts.  As a result, car hire firms agreed to the following changes to the pre-2009 terms and conditions:</p><p>1.a blanket ban on drivers over 75 years of age was removed;</p><p>2.the automatic daily surcharge for drivers over 70 years of age was abolished;</p><p>3.a safety assessment form was introduced.  This form takes due and proper account of individual drivers&rsquo; health, driving experience and existing motor insurance policy, as well as a requirement that a doctor's letter be provided, certifying that the person is in good health.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware the regulation of motor insurance and road traffic matters are complex.  There is, for example, a minimum age set before one can hold a driving licence and if a person is over the age of 70, they will need certification of fitness to drive by their doctor in order to apply for a driving licence.</p><p>The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) is Ireland&rsquo;s national equality body and deals with a range of EU anti-discrimination measures and it is also Ireland's human rights institution.  The IHREC is independent in the discharge of its functions, which include: the protection and promotion of human rights and equality and the provision of information to the public in relation to the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015 and the Equal Status Acts 2000-2015.  It has powers of investigation and can provide advice and assistance to persons who consider that they have experienced discrimination.  It is open to any person to make contact with the Commission to inquire as to what advice and assistance may be available in their particular circumstance.  IHREC can refer a case of perceived discrimination to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) for investigation and adjudication. </p><p>The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) (formerly the Equality Tribunal) would be the appropriate avenue to adjudicate or mediate claims of unlawful discrimination under equality legislation.</p><p>It is open to a person who wishes to challenge practices which are perceived as unlawful discrimination to take a case to the WRC: </p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  I have been informed that the strength of the Garda Traffic Corps on the 31 December 2017, stood at 623.  In addition, there is one Chief Superintendent and two Superintendents attached to the DMR Traffic Corps, a Superintendent and Traffic Inspector attached to each of the five Regions, and one Superintendent attached to the Policing Road Traffic Bureau.  It is important to note, that road traffic legislation is enforced as part of the day-to-day duties of all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as through specific enforcement operations.</p>  <p>  There is no room for complacency when it comes to road safety and the intensive efforts being made to promote road safety have contributed to last year representing the lowest number of road traffic fatalities on record at 159.  It is imperative that the positive momentum across road traffic enforcement and road safety initiatives is harnessed towards further annual reductions in fatalities.</p>  <p>  By working together with the RSA and other agencies, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to confront dangerous road-user behaviour thorough public presence, legislative enforcement, education and partnership.  The Government is committed to further supporting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard including by reversing the effects of the legacy of the moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 which resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na across the whole organisation including the Traffic Corps. </p>  <p>  The Government implementation of the plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 is well underway and there is real tangible progress on reaching this goal.  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment.  This year a further 800 Garda trainees will enter the College with 800 also scheduled to attest. This will see Garda numbers reach more than 14,000 by the end of 2018. </p>  <p>  This increase in Garda numbers will facilitate the Commissioner in meeting his commitment to strengthen the numbers assigned to roads policing by 10% year on year using the strength of the Traffic Corps of 671 on 31 December 2016 as a baseline.  It is not all about numbers, the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places a strong emphasis on the role of the Traffic Corps being expanded to include crime prevention and detection on the roads through the establishment of Divisional Roads Policing Units.

Previous to this, the lease had passed through number of State agencies since a 65-year lease was first taken out by An Chomhairle Oili&uacute;na in 1969.</p>  <p>  Carrisbrook House was 85% vacant for a number of years, despite having been actively marketed by Forf&aacute;s and the IDA.  The building was difficult to sublet, partly on account of the high cost of refurbishment.  The IDA also did not have vacant possession of the entire property due to an existing lease with a tenant which runs until 2025, thereby limiting its marketability further.</p>  <p>  After carefully considering the best course forward, the IDA decided to exit the lease with effect from December 2015 as it was the least costly option for the State.  The alternative was continuing to meet contractual obligations to pay rent over the remaining lifetime of the lease until 2034, together with meeting additional liabilities that arise in the context of the full repairing and insuring lease.  While the payment of &euro;9.4 million to exit the lease was a significant amount, it represents a saving to the State of an estimated &euro;13.65 million in comparison to maintaining the lease until completion.</p>  <p>  I am informed that IDA Ireland paid legal fees in the sum of &euro;11,830.52 in respect of its exit from the lease.</p></reply>

It is also the case that site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as at least 70% of all new FDI comes from existing IDA Ireland client companies.  </p><p>Site visits nevertheless do represent an important tool through which investors can be encouraged to invest in regional areas and the IDA always does its utmost to ensure that investors consider all potential locations when visiting Ireland. </p><p>The following table outlines IDA Ireland site visits by county from 2013 to 2017.<table><tr><th>County</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>180</td><td>205</td><td>242</td><td>284</td><td>327</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td>9</td><td>12</td><td>28</td><td>36</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>5</td><td>9</td><td>12</td><td>18</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>23</td><td>22</td><td>40</td><td>49</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>12</td><td>8</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>4</td><td>10</td><td>20</td><td>24</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim </td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo </td><td>10</td><td>7</td><td>15</td><td>20</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>9</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>14</td><td>11</td><td>31</td><td>17</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>7</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Cork </td><td>31</td><td>30</td><td>48</td><td>49</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Galway </td><td>15</td><td>19</td><td>41</td><td>42</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>326</td><td>359</td><td>565</td><td>638</td><td>682</td></tr></table></p></reply>

To support the eight Regional Action Plans, and as part of the Government&rsquo;s strategic response to Brexit, additional funding of up to &euro;60m is being rolled out by EI over the next 4 years.  The Regional Enterprise Development Fund, funded by my Department and administered by Enterprise Ireland, will support the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level.  This Funding will strengthen the enterprise capability and economic development potential within the regions.  Twenty-one successful applicants representing all regions of the country have secured up to &euro;30.5m for their projects in the first competitive call.</p>  <p>  Due to the high demand for the Fund, I will be announcing a second competitive call for proposals in March this year.  This new call will be open to those that may have been unsuccessful under the first call and to new applicants.  Enterprise Ireland will work with all applicants that apply for funding under the second call for proposals.  Any organisation with a requirement for start-up funding should engage with Enterprise Ireland regarding any proposals that they might have for Loughrea.</p></reply>

This is aligned with the goal under the 2016 Programme for a Partnership Government to deliver an extra 200,000 jobs by 2020, of which 135,000 will be outside of Dublin.  These targets are on course to be met and exceeded with employment in the State having increased by 91,000 since the end of Quarter 1 2016.</p><p>With a strong focus on job creation and retention, the annual Action Plan for Jobs provides a framework for collaboration between Government Departments and Agencies to achieve this objective. </p><p>Between June 2015 and January 2016, my Department published eight Regional Action Plans for Jobs, aimed at raising employment levels in the regions and facilitating them to achieve their economic potential.  Each plan contains a series of actions with timelines for delivery between 2015-2017, through improved collaboration between enterprise agencies and other stakeholders supporting enterprise development in the regions.  A key objective of each of the plans is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the unemployment rate of each region within one percentage point of the national average.  The attached table shows our progress towards these employment targets up to Quarter 2 2017.</p><p>On 16 January 2018, the Central Statistics Office released the Labour Force Survey for Quarter 3 2018, which has replaced the Quarterly National Household Survey as the official source of data for employment and unemployment in Ireland.  The data presented in the report incorporates adjustments to previous releases to take account of revisions to population estimates arising from the 2016 Census of Population.  Due to the break in the time-series of regional employment data, comparisons that span Quarter 2 to Quarter 3 2017 cannot be reliably made.

However, as the State approaches full employment, labour as well as skills needs are beginning to manifest and my Department is being pressed to open up the employment permit regime to lower skilled workers in certain sectors and occupations. </p>  <p>  However, economic migration alone is not a sustainable long-term solution to skills and labour shortages and indeed can, in some circumstances, help to perpetuate those shortages in the economy.  The development of particular skills in the resident labour force can depend upon a judicious deployment of economic migration as a supplementary rather than a primary source of those skills, and adjustments must be made with this in mind.</p>  <p>  While there is some anecdotal evidence of a tightening labour market in some sectors, the fact remains that there are 238,000 on the live register, and with a potential pool of 18.5 million unemployed in the EU 28.  Thus my Department needs to be prudent in considering whether to open up the labour market to unskilled non-EEA workers on wage levels at or just above the national minimum wage. </p>  <p>  In this context, I have decided that my Department undertake a review of the economic migration policies underpinning the current employment permits system, to ensure it is fully supportive of Ireland&rsquo;s emerging labour market needs, be they skills or labour shortages in certain sectors.</p>  <p>  The principle objective of this review process is to consider the policy rationale for the employment permit system where the economy is improving and the labour market is tightening.  An Inter-Departmental Group has been established to inform the review and it is made up of relevant State Departments, including Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform; Justice and Equality; Housing Planning and Local Government; Agriculture, Food and the Marine; Transport, Tourism and Sport; Education and Skills; Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The IDG met for the first time on 9 February last. </p>  <p>  The review process will also include a public consultation, with feedback sought from relevant stakeholders and interest groups. </p>  <p>  I have requested that a report be submitted to me before the end of June.</p></reply>

The Council has set out specific requirements for doctors regarding prescribing of drugs at section 42 of its Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners (2016).  While the Guide is not a legal code, it sets out the principles of professional practice and conduct that all doctors registered with the Medical Council are expected to follow.  The Guide advises that doctors must be aware of the dangers of drug dependency when prescribing benzodiazepines, opiates and other drugs with addictive potential.</p>  <p>  In June 2016 the Early Warning Emerging Trends (EWET) subcommittee of the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol, with the agreement of my Department, wrote to health care professionals highlighting the need for vigilance when prescribing and dispensing pregabalin and gabapentin, as these drugs present a risk of addiction and a potential for illegal diversion and misuse.  Prescribers were advised to always undertake a risk benefit assessment prior to prescribing either of these medicines for patients under their care.</p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s multi-disciplinary Medicines Management Programme (MMP) works with the National Medicines Information Centre (NMIC) and the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE), in collaboration with the HSE-Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS), to provide sustained national leadership relating to issues such as the quality of the medicines management process, access to medicines and overall expenditure on medicines.  It aims to promote safe, effective and cost effective prescribing.</p>  <p>  The MMP work plan includes monitoring the utilisation of all medicines with a high prescribing frequency and/or high expenditure based on data from the PCRS.</p>  <p>  The MMP has previously identified the high number of prescriptions for certain benzodiazepines and &lsquo;z-drug&rsquo; sedatives and, coupled with the safety concerns associated with these medicines and their addictive potential, now monitors the total number of patients on these drugs and the total number of prescriptions issued on an on-going basis.</p>  <p>  As a result of increasing trends around their use the MMP has published a toolkit to support the appropriate prescribing of benzodiazepine and z-drugs in the treatment of anxiety and insomnia.  The guidance document contains information on initiation, review and deprescribing of these drugs and it is anticipated that the adoption of this guidance by prescribers will lead to a reduction in the long-term inappropriate prescribing of these drugs.</p>  <p>  The MMP, in collaboration with the PCRS, has written to all GPs outlining their levels of benzodiazepine and other hypnotics prescribing on the GMS scheme in an initiative to encourage better quality prescribing of these drugs.  The reports allow GPs to see exactly how many times they have prescribed these drugs in the preceding months.  This is another useful tool for prescribers to monitor prescribing in their practice compared to national rates and also to track changes in their prescribing over time.  The next HSE-PCRS prescribing report is planned for circulation in the coming weeks and information from the recently published toolkit will be disseminated to GPs alongside those reports.</p>  <p>  Additionally, in October 2017 the Medical Council of Ireland and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland launched joint guidance on the Safe Prescribing and Dispensing of Controlled Drugs aimed at registered medical practitioner and pharmacists.</p></reply>

Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the 4,133 people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Programme for a Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs. The Health (Transport Support) Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the Spring/Summer session 2018. I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage.  The proposals seek to ensure that: there is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation; there is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme; resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and the Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>   It is hoped to bring a General Scheme and Heads of Bill to Government shortly, seeking Government approval to the drafting of the Bill for the new Transport Support Payment.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Motorised Transport Grant, this scheme operated as a means-tested grant to assist persons with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment.  The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three-year period, was &euro;5,020.  Following closure of the scheme in February 2013,  no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.  Specifically adapted vehicles driven by disabled persons are also exempt from payment of tolls on national toll roads and toll bridges.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular Scheme.</p></reply>

The report also concluded  that it is neither feasible nor desirable to list conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. Therefore, medical card provision is solely based on financial assessment. Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card. </p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. It should be noted, in certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses. </p></reply>

October's Budget announced a total 2018 allocation of &euro;55m for the NTPF for 2018. This significant increase in funding more than doubles the 2017 total allocation of &euro;20m. The NTPF and HSE are in the process of finalising Waiting List Action Plans and Initiatives for 2018. This will include ambitious targets for both the HSE and NTPF to reduce the overall number of patients waiting for treatment, including those patients awaiting Ophthalmology procedures.</p>  <p>  I hope to publish the 2018 Inpatient Day Case Waiting List Action Plan at the end of February.</p>  <p>  In response to this particular query, data from the NTPF indicates that there was a total of 9,260 patients awaiting a cataract procedure in December 2016. Of these, 44% patients (4,085) were waiting less than 6 months for a cataracts procedure and 77% patients (7,133) were waiting less than 12 months. </p>  <p>  NTPF data also indicates there was a total of 8,027 patients awaiting a cataract procedure in December 2017. Of these, 53% patients (4,274) were waiting less than 6 months for a cataracts procedure and 88% patients (7,043) were waiting less than 12 months. </p>  <p>  The NTPF publishes the Inpatient/Daycase and Outpatient waiting list figures by specialty for each hospital on its website each month.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-02-13a.913.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018021300072#WRP05100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 356, 364, 396 and 405 together.</p><p>Medicines play a vital role in improving the health of Irish patients. Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service. However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner. The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; was approximately &euro;1.8 billion in 2017. </p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively. This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults. It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010. The projected budget impact on introduction was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure trebled between 2012 and 2016, from &euro;9.4 million to over &euro;30 million, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles. </p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data, and its value is uncertain for other types of pain. The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, only 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN. </p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017. This process supports its appropriate use, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment. The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce annual expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.</p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster. No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.</p><p>However, since 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer receive this item under the community drugs schemes. In August 2017 the HSE advised GPs of the changes and of treatment alternatives. </p><p>It is possible for non-shingles patients to be approved for the patch through the community drug schemes. The patient's GP should apply to the Medicines Management Programme through the online system, and the MMP will review the application and inform the GP of its decision. </p><p>I am advised that the MMP has received over 4,500 applications from GPs, of which some 10% have been approved.  For many of the conditions applied for, prescribing of the patch was inappropriate, for example for conditions such as deep venous thrombosis, angina, gout and endometriosis.</p><p>Where a GP&rsquo;s application is rejected, it may be appealed.  Of some 200 appeals to date, the HSE advises that over 50% have been accepted on clinical grounds.</p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at .</p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card. Notwithstanding this, I am aware that in recent times some GPs have begun to charge GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances. </p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position, under successive Governments, that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients.

In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE.  The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis.  Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis.  Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded. </p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  It should be noted, in certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the health service.  However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner.  The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; was approximately &euro;1.8 billion in 2017. </p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively.  This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.  The projected budget impact on introduction was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure trebled between 2012 and 2016, from &euro;9.4 million to over &euro;30 million, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles. </p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data, and its value is uncertain for other types of pain.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, only 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN. </p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017.  This process supports its appropriate use, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment.  The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce annual expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.</p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster.  No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.</p><p>However, since 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer receive this item under the community drugs schemes.  In August 2017 the HSE advised GPs of the changes and of treatment alternatives. </p><p>It is possible for non-shingles patients to be approved for the patch through the community drug schemes.  The patient's GP should apply to the Medicines Management Programme through the online system, and the MMP will review the application and inform the GP of its decision. </p><p>I am advised that the MMP has received over 4,500 applications from GPs, of which some 10% have been approved.  For many of the conditions applied for, prescribing of the patch was inappropriate, for example for conditions such as deep venous thrombosis, angina, gout and endometriosis.</p><p>Where a GP&rsquo;s application is rejected, it may be appealed.  Of some 200 appeals to date, the HSE advises that over 50% have been accepted on clinical grounds.</p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at<i>.</i></p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE.  However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

The manufacturer, CSL Behring were notified in August 2017 that the HSE was unable to recommend reimbursement as they concluded that there was not enough evidence to suggest that patients would derive a clinically meaningful benefit from this treatment and that the current price was not a cost effective use of resources. </p>  <p>  A number of patients were on a Respreeza access scheme, operated by the manufacturer CSL Behring for the treatment of Alpha-1 deficiency.  This scheme was being run independently by CSL Behring and without reference to the HSE, when the Company decided that the scheme would end on 30 September 2017.  This decision left approximately 20 patients without access to medication.</p>  <p>  Subsequently the company modified its decision and agreed to continue to supply the medication free of charge for the patients on the access scheme for a further period of six months, or until the next clinical trial commences in 2018, but not to cover the cost of administering the medicine from the end of October 2017.</p>  <p>  Due to the critical and exceptional circumstances, the HSE decided to facilitate a transitional arrangement under which it would fund the provision of the necessary nursing service to ensure that patients could continue to receive the medicine until a new clinical trial commences in 2018.</p>  <p>  The Company anticipates that approximately half of the current access group of patients will be recruited into the next clinical trial in 2018.</p>  <p>  The terms of this transitional arrangement, under which the HSE has agreed to fund the administration of the drug, includes a requirement that the lead clinician concerned ensures that appropriate alternative treatment regimes are put in place in good time for those patients not proceeding onto the next trial. </p>  <p>  This transitional arrangement does not alter the reimbursement decision of the HSE in relation to Respreeza.</p>  <p>  The company is welcome to submit a new reimbursement application which would then be assessed in line with the 2013 Act.</p></reply>

Their current role is to prepare and oversee the implementation of Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery<i></i>'A health-led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017 - 2025' at a local level by encouraging co-ordination and co-operation between services and by consulting with local communities to design and deliver services.  The Task Force membership comprises elected representatives, representatives from the community and voluntary sector and relevant local statutory agencies including the Health Service Executive (HSE), Department of Social Protection, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Probation services, Education and Training Boards and the Local Authorities.  Members meet on a regular basis. </p><p>The overall allocation to Regional Drug and Alcohol Task Forces for community-based drugs initiatives this year is &euro;8.7 million.

It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating.  Lyme disease is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  The standard laboratory approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and has been agreed by experts from the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and other Irish and international experts.  This testing is available in Ireland. </p><p>Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics by General Practitioners.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may be considered.  </p><p>The HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre website () gives extensive information on Lyme Disease diagnosis, treatment and how to avoid tick bites.  A Lyme Disease Subcommittee of the Scientific Advisory Committee of HPSC with professional clinical, entomological, scientific and environmental health expert representation (including a representative of the Lyme Support Group, Tick-Talk Ireland) has been established to explore all possible ways of raising awareness about Lyme disease.  This Subcommittee is expected to meet shortly with a view to finalising its report.  This report will cover a number of areas, including initiatives undertaken to date, summary advice relating to awareness, preventive advice for the general public, preventive advice and material for those responsible for sites or locations known to have or suspected as having higher densities of ticks, and summary advice relating to GP management of the condition.  Any person who is suffering ill-health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms. </p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the health service.  However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner.  The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; was approximately &euro;1.8 billion in 2017. </p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively.  This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.  The projected budget impact on introduction was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure trebled between 2012 and 2016, from &euro;9.4 million to over &euro;30 million, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles. </p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data, and its value is uncertain for other types of pain.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, only 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN. </p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017.  This process supports its appropriate use, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment.  The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce annual expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.</p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster.  No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.</p><p>However, since 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer receive this item under the community drugs schemes.  In August 2017 the HSE advised GPs of the changes and of treatment alternatives. </p><p>It is possible for non-shingles patients to be approved for the patch through the community drug schemes.  The patient's GP should apply to the Medicines Management Programme through the online system, and the MMP will review the application and inform the GP of its decision. </p><p>I am advised that the MMP has received over 4,500 applications from GPs, of which some 10% have been approved.  For many of the conditions applied for, prescribing of the patch was inappropriate, for example for conditions such as deep venous thrombosis, angina, gout and endometriosis.</p><p>Where a GP&rsquo;s application is rejected, it may be appealed.  Of some 200 appeals to date, the HSE advises that over 50% have been accepted on clinical grounds.</p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at:<i>.</i></p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE.  However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 90 die from the disease.  All cervical cancers are linked to high risk Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types.  In 2009 the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) recommended HPV vaccination for all 12 year old girls to reduce their risk of cervical cancer and in September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools. </p><p>I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  An illness that occurs around the time a vaccine is given and is already known to be common in adolescence does not imply the vaccine caused the problem.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  However, these claims have led to a significant drop in uptake rates of the HPV vaccine from 87% in 2014/15 to 72% in 2015/16 and 51% in 2016/17.  Provisional figures from the HSE indicate that HPV vaccine uptake rates increased in September/October 2017 to 62% due to a comprehensive communications campaign for parents with support from a large number of key stakeholders.</p><p>One of the most important things we can do is to provide accurate and credible information to enable parents to take a fully informed decision concerning HPV vaccination.  We know that HPV vaccine works and that many countries have seen significant decreases of pre-cancer of the cervix as a result of vaccination.  The safety and effectiveness of the vaccine is endorsed by Irish and international scientific and medical institutions.  The HSE launched their information campaign for HPV vaccination as part of the 2017/18 Schools Immunisation Programme on 30 August 2017.  The Information campaign supports the HPV vaccination programme and provides information packs for parents which are scientifically accurate and endorsed by Irish and international bodies.  In addition information is available for primary care facilities and pharmacies.</p><p>I would urge any parent who has doubts or questions about vaccination to engage with your family doctor, or alternatively to visit the HPV website &ndash; .  These sources of information are clear and accurate and will answer any queries you may have.  Parents of all eligible girls are strongly encouraged to access this information and ensure that their daughters receive this important cancer preventing vaccine.</p><p>As Minister for Health I fully support the HPV immunisation programme and its aim to increase uptake rates of this important lifesaving vaccine.</p></reply>

Following closure of the scheme in February 2013, no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.  </p><p>It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.  Specifically adapted vehicles driven by disabled persons are also exempt from payment of tolls on national toll roads and toll bridges.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular Scheme.</p><p>The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Programme for a Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs.  The Health (Transport Support) Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the Spring/Summer session 2018.  I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage.  </p><p>The proposals seek to ensure that:</p><p>- There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;</p><p>- There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme; </p><p>- Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and</p><p>- The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

My Department has, accordingly, developed a clean livestock policy which has been agreed with farmer, haulier and Food Business Operator stakeholders.

This policy is a public health measure, intended to reduce the potential risk to consumers that may arise if meat is contaminated by dirty fleeces. </p><p>My Department currently applies a 3-category system for both the bovine and the sheep CLP, requiring food business operators at slaughtering establishments to categorise as follows: </p><p>Category (A) Satisfactory &ndash; </p><p>Sheep that can be slaughtered, without an unacceptable risk of contaminating the meat during the slaughter process, by using the standard hygienic dressing procedures routinely employed by the plant.</p><p>Category (B) Acceptable &ndash; </p><p>Sheep that can only be slaughtered, without an unacceptable risk of contamination of the meat during the slaughter process, by putting in place additional interventions including extra defined dressing controls.</p><p>Category (C) Unacceptable &ndash; </p><p>Sheep unfit for slaughter because of fleece condition.

During 2017, 53 herds in these areas were restricted with a total of 302 reactors removed.  32 of the restrictions followed reactor disclosure at a contiguous herd test.   </p>  <p>  Since the first breakdown in the area in Autumn 2016, the outbreaks have been investigated and managed by my Department&rsquo;s Veterinary Inspectorate (in cooperation with local herd-owners and veterinary practitioners).  They have conducted epidemiological investigation of all herds with more than 2 reactors, blood sampling of all reactors for quality control purposes, diagnostic blood testing of high risk groups within the herd, identification of contiguous holdings and additional testing as required, as well as subjecting the herd to further diagnostic tests where it is considered that the infection is of a more chronic nature.  </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s TB Eradication Programme incorporates a wildlife strategy since 2004 which includes the removal of badgers from areas where there has been a TB outbreak with evidence of an epidemiological link to badgers.  Badgers are protected by national legislation and are captured under licence, issued by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  This strategy is informed by considerable scientific evidence of a link between badgers and cattle in the context of the spread of bovine TB.  In line with this policy, where badgers are identified as a likely source in the Iveragh Peninsula a survey is carried out and badgers are captured and removed.  </p>  <p>  My Department has recently introduced the vaccination of badgers against tuberculosis as an integral part of the bovine TB eradication programme.  This marks a major step forward in the bovine TB eradication programme and follows years of scientific research.  The most recent research findings confirm that vaccination of badgers can play a role in reducing the level of infection in cattle.  It will enable Ireland move forward towards eradication of bovine TB in a controlled holistic way, which will serve to protect the badger population whilst also protecting cattle and the livelihoods of farmers.  The vaccination programme has commenced in the areas which have already been part of the field trials demonstrating the effectiveness of badger vaccination.  It will roll out incrementally to other parts of the country over time, with vaccination gradually replacing the need to remove badgers.  It is not appropriate to initiate a vaccination programme in an area where there is an active outbreak of disease.</p>  <p>  I would also point out that there are other factors that contribute to the spread of tuberculosis which may be contributing to the problem in this area.  For example, there are a significant number of animals traded locally within the area and the clustering of outbreaks indicates that the contiguous spread between herds is likely a factor.  Farmers in the area are to be congratulated for their efforts to increase biosecurity which will further reduce the risk of future outbreaks.</p>  <p>  Finally, while it is too early to formulate any definitive conclusions, early indications are that the situation in South Kerry is showing signs of improvement.  The rate of reactor disclosure and herd restrictions has abated.  A significant number of herds have recently had one clear test and a smaller number have had their second clear test and are no longer restricted. </p></reply>

This policy is a public health measure, intended to reduce the potential risk to consumers that may arise if meat is contaminated by dirty fleeces.  </p><p>My Department currently applies a 3-category system for both the bovine and the sheep CLP, requiring food business operators at slaughtering establishments to categorise as follows:</p><p>Category (A) Satisfactory &ndash; </p><p>Sheep that can be slaughtered, without an unacceptable risk of contaminating the meat during the slaughter process, by using the standard hygienic dressing procedures routinely employed by the plant.</p><p>Category (B) Acceptable &ndash; </p><p>Sheep that can only be slaughtered, without an unacceptable risk of contamination of the meat during the slaughter process, by putting in place additional interventions including extra defined dressing controls.  </p><p>Category (C) Unacceptable &ndash; </p><p>Sheep unfit for slaughter because of fleece condition.

In the judgment, the Supreme Court found that fishing by Northern Ireland boats within the 0 to 6 nautical mile zone of the territorial waters of the State under the Voisinage arrangements is not permitted by law.  The Voisinage arrangements are long-standing reciprocal arrangements which have allowed fishing boats from Northern Ireland access to fish within the 0 to 6 nautical mile zone of the territorial waters of the State and vice versa.   </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Supreme Court upheld the High Court finding that the Voisinage arrangements are not invalid but that, as it stands, there is insufficient provision for them in domestic law.  The Supreme Court in fact noted that the arrangements were a sensible recognition at official level of practice and tradition, where fishing boats traditionally fished neighbouring waters. </p>  <p>  The application of the judgment is to all fishing by Northern Irish fishing boats in the 0 to 6 nautical mile zone, measured from the baselines, relying on the Voisinage arrangements.  Foreign fishing vessels are not permitted to fish inside the baselines.  Fishing activities that have a legal basis are not affected, such as those reliant on the access arrangements to Ireland's 6 to 12 nautical mile zone set out in Regulation (EU) No. 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council.</p>  <p>  The Government approved the publication of the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill to address issues raised by the Supreme Court judgment, in so far as it relates to access for Northern Irish vessels.  If enacted and commenced, the Bill will give the Voisinage arrangements a proper legal footing.  The Bill was published in February 2017 and is available on the Oireachtas website.  The Bill has commenced debate in the Seanad. </p>  <p>  In July 2017, the UK Government formally announced that it is leaving the 1964 London Fisheries Convention.  The Convention deals primarily with access rights to countries 6 to 12 nautical mile zones and much of these are also included in Common Fisheries Policy.  Article 2 of the Convention precludes countries from fishing in another country&rsquo;s 0 to 6 nautical mile zone.  However, Article 9 of the Convention gave countries the option to come to arrangements with their neighbours to allow access inside the 0 to 6 nautical mile zone if so desired.  This was the basis for the Voisinage arrangements.</p>  <p>  The UK has intimated it would like to retain the Voisinage arrangements element of the London Fisheries Convention.  Ireland will continue to reflect on all relevant issues in the context of Brexit negotiations and the progress ofthe Bill.</p>  <p>  Under EU Regulation, every commercial sea-fishing boat needs to have a licence, held by the owner of the boat, and in accordance with the Common Fisheries Policy, every Member State must manage the size and scale (capacity) of its fishing fleet.  Fishing capacity in Ireland, in theform of gross tonnage and engine power, is a privately owned, tradable asset that, with certain exceptions, may be sold, traded or realised as a financial asset on the tonnage market.  To licence a sea-fishing boat, capacity must be provided by the applicant as part of the licensing process.  Currently the licensing process for a sea-fishing boat does not incur a charge.  I do not consider that the proposal set out meets the terms of EU Regulation and accordingly I do not see scope to explore this option. </p></reply>

Upon summary conviction these are &euro;5,000 and/or up to six months in jail.  For major cases taken on indictment, the maximum penalty was increased from &euro;100,000 to &euro;250,000, with a maximum custodial sentence of five years imprisonment.  These penalties are in keeping with Irish jurisprudence and therefore I do not envisage further changes at this time.</p>  <p>  Penalties imposed upon successful conviction vary at the discretion of the court, with the Act containing provisions that an individual convicted of serious animal welfare offences may be banned by the courts from keeping animals, or have the numbers of animals they may keep restricted. </p>  <p>  The Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 however has importantly changed the basis upon which animal owners must treat their animals and is specifically designed to allow early intervention in a much wider range of cases than the previous legislation allowed for.  Thus minor cases can be tackled before they escalate and the Act is a vehicle to encourage and educate animal keepers.  This new approach means that Authorised officers are addressing problems while they are relatively minor, reducing the risk of escalation.</p>  <p>  Enforcement is a complex issue, so a progressive aspect of the Act is that it does not just focus on prosecution, which is only appropriate in cases where there have been serious welfare issues that can be clearly demonstrated to the courts.  The new enforcement approach reflects the need to intervene as early as possible in animal welfare situations.  This approach is aided by The Early Warning/Intervention System (EWS) initiative introduced by the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council involving, amongst others, my Department, the Irish Farmers' Association and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals which provides a framework within which farm animal welfare problems can be identified before they become critical or overwhelming.</p>  <p>  The Act provides for Animal Health &amp;amp; Welfare Notices to be issued by Authorised Officers.  This means that minor situations can be addressed at an early stage and that encouragement, guidance and best practice are introduced rather than just punishment.  It also provides for Fixed Penalty Notices to be issued in minor cases.  These alternatives to prosecution mean greater efficiency in terms of enforcement of the Act.</p>  <p>  The provisions of the Act are enforced by Authorised officers of my Department, An Garda Siochana, officers of Customs &amp;amp; Excise and authorised officers of ISPCA and DSPCA, along with individual officers of the Turf Club.  This approach provides a large cross section of experienced officials who are aware of welfare issues and can flag them up as and when they arise.</p></reply>

Difficulties in harvesting fodder in some of these areas were compounded by the need to house livestock earlier than usual, resulting in additional pressure on fodder supplies over the course of the winter.   </p>  <p>  To immediately address this issue I prioritised the payment of farm supports to assist farmers with cash flow.  The European Commission agreed to his request, informed in part by the poor weather conditions of last autumn, for an advance payment of the 2017 Basic Payment Measure and Agri-environment measures.  These payments commenced after the earliest date possible which was 15th October 2017, and balancing payments issued in early December 2017.  These payments together with those issued under the Areas of Natural Constraints Measure, injected over &euro;1.3 billion into the Irish rural economy by the end of last year and are providing a very welcome boost for Irish farm families and will help to finance additional fodder purchase where necessary.   </p>  <p>  At this time I also requested Teagasc, through its farm advisory service, to identify farmers who would be most at risk of running out of fodder and provide them with support to carry out fodder budgeting on their farms and explore all viable options to ensure that they had sufficient feed for the coming winter.   </p>  <p>  As indicated earlier, the main reason that farmers may be short of fodder in some cases is that poor weather last autumn particularly, prevented harvesting of the normal requirement for hay or silage on those farms.  Therefore, in order to provide additional assistance to those livestock farmers severely affected, mainly in parts of the West and North West, I introduced a targeted Fodder Transport Support measure, operated through the Co-operative structure, to partly offset the cost of transporting fodder between those areas where it is available and those where it is scarce.  This measure applies only to fodder purchased in the period from 29 January 2018 until 20 April 2018.   </p>  <p>  While the areas identified by Teagasc as being the most affected are predominantly located in parts of the West and North-West, the measure is not county specific within the region.  As with all measures, certain criteria apply.  Farmers, in a locality within the region, identified by Teagasc as having a significant fodder shortage, having completed a fodder budgeting exercise with their FAS agricultural advisor, will be eligible to receive a financial contribution towards the costs of transport of fodder, sourced through the Co-operative system.  Only the shortfall in fodder will be eligible to receive support under the measure.  </p>  <p>  Teagasc assessments of whether there are significant forage shortages in specific areas is ongoing.  It is important to emphasise that this is a targeted and locally focused measure, centreing on areas of fodder scarcity that normal local trading in fodder cannot service.   </p>  <p>  This measure will provide a financial contribution of &euro;8 per standard bale of hay or straw for feeding and &euro;12 per standard bale of silage or haylage towards the additional cost of transporting the fodder from the East and South of the country to the affected areas of the West and North West. Farmers will still pay the cost of the fodder in the normal way.  To ensure that normal local trade in fodder is not disrupted, a minimum transport distance of 100 km will apply.   </p>  <p>  Financial assistance under the Fodder Transport Support Measure is payable in accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) No 1408/2013 on de minimis aid in the agricultural production sector.  No applications for support under this measure were received up to last Friday, 9 February.  Processing and verification of applications for support will be carried out in a timely fashion.</p>  <p>  Full details on the operation of the measure, including application forms and Department contact details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  </p></reply>

The Chinese Certification and Accreditation Administration (CNCA) carried out a comprehensive audit of plants in August/September of last year; this represented a significant milestone in the process towards gaining beef market access.  </p>  <p>  In late December CNCA provided us with a draft report on their visit which was then considered by staff in my Department as a matter of priority.  My Department worked closely with industry to respond fully to this report and provide relevant documentation to Chinese officials.  </p>  <p>  My officials continue to liaise closely with their Chinese counterparts to provide every assurance in relation to the quality and safety of Irish beef.  </p>  <p>  We understand that Ireland is now in the final stages of the market access process with China.

Only these two types of food can be called free range and only where they meet the requirements set out for use of this term in the relevant legislation which include rules around access to open-air runs, vegetation, stocking density and housing.  Poultry and eggs that carry a free range label must have been produced in registered establishments complying with these legislative requirements.  </p>  <p>  However, there may be foods on the market labelled as free range which conform with voluntary standards albeit without a legal basis for doing so.  Bord Bia&rsquo;s Pigmeat Quality Assurance Scheme (QAS) which sets out the requirements for best practice of pig production at farm level contains an additional requirement for free range farmed pigs.  The scheme ensures, for both consumers and retailers, that Irish pigmeat is produced to the highest standards at primary production level.  The scheme is open to all producers who have a valid National Pig Identification and Tracing Scheme herd number.</p></reply>

These include supports for artisan food businesses, a pipeline for new entrants to the Artisan Food Market at Bloom, promoting meet the buyer opportunities, delivery of small business specific consumer and market insights, and programmes to assist producers to extend business reach and festival markets.  </p>  <p>  Supports for the artisan food sector are available from the development agencies.  Many artisan businesses have participated in the Food Academy programme developed by Bord Bia, Local Enterprise Offices and Musgraves/Supervalu; the Food Works programme (developed by Bord Bia, Teagasc and Enterprise Ireland for start-up food entrepreneurs) and from technical assistance from Teagasc.  </p>  <p>  In terms of small food businesses in general, close to 500 food companies with a turnover of &euro;100,000 to &euro;3.5m are registered with Bord Bia for supports and services.  These owner managed businesses produce high-end products with a strong focus on the domestic market.  </p>  <p>  The farmhouse cheese sector alone includes over 50 cheese-makers producing more than 150 types of cheese valued at over &euro;12 million per annum at farm gate level.  The sector is innovative with over 17 new farmhouse cheeses developed in the past year.  My Department has supported a three year Bord Bia farmhouse cheese programme under the EU Promotion regime.  </p>  <p>  Farmers markets remain a valuable entry point for many potential food entrepreneurs and those building a local and visitor customer base.  In the past year Bord Bia ran workshops for market managers to support the development of this important local route to market.  Feedback was highly positive.  </p>  <p>  My Department provides bursaries for the UCC Diploma in Speciality Food Production, a food science and business course for food producers, potential start-ups and those interested in developing businesses and /or promoting the artisan sector.  Bord Bia, Teagasc and the FSAI contribute to the work of the Diploma. Over 180 students have graduated; many are successfully running small artisan and speciality food businesses.  </p>  <p>  Growth prospects for the sector are positive overall, driven by increased consumer interest in the provenance of food, environmental concerns, health and a desire to support the local economy.  </p>  <p>  There is also provision in the Rural Development Plan (RDP), for schemes to support new and existing artisan, micro and small food producers to address emerging challenges through investment in areas such as market development, competitiveness and innovation.  My Department is in discussion with the Commission regarding the details of these proposals.  </p></reply>

In all I have provided an additional &euro;14.5 million to Bord Bia since then.  </p>  <p>  This funding is intended to support food and drink companies facing Brexit challenges through market diversification measures, including the provision of access to local expertise in international markets, the promotion of quality assured products in UK and Continental markets and funding for Marketplace Ireland 2018.  It will also support market insight research and projects to be carried out by the Bord Bia Thinking House.  My Department has also provided the funding for Bord Bia's Brexit barometer, which provide food companies with the opportunity to assess their own readiness for Brexit.  </p>  <p>  My Department is also working with the Department of An Taoiseach and other Government Departments on the expansion of the State&rsquo;s Global footprint, in order to ensure that the future development of the Irish agri-food sector is incorporated into this strategy.  </p>  <p>  In addition, and against the background of Brexit, I asked Bord Bia to conduct a market prioritisation exercise in order to identify opportunities in new and more mature markets.  The initial results of this exercise, which were published in early December 2017, have already provided valuable market intelligence both for industry operators and policy makers, and I look forward to further exciting developments as the next stages of this project unfold.  </p>  <p>  The pursuit and development of new markets for Irish agri-food exports is of course an ongoing and central component of the strategic development of the agri-food sector, as evidenced by its placement right at the centre of Food Wise 2025, the industry&rsquo;s strategy for development over the coming decade.  Indeed, this is all the more relevant after the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU, which presents significant new challenges for the agri-food sector in particular.  </p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, including in Asia, Africa and the Gulf region.  </p>  <p>  In keeping with the priorities outlined in Food Wise 2025 I led a series of very successful Trade Missions during in 2017, to the Gulf States, the US, Mexico, Japan and South Korea.  </p>  <p>  My Department is currently making arrangements with Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland for a trade mission at the end of the February to the US and Canada.  Again this will include participants from across the agri-food sector and will feature extensive trade contacts as well as relevant political engagements.  Both of these markets had been identified as offering significant potential to the Irish agri-food sector.  </p>  <p>  My Department and its agencies will continue to work with industry in a dynamic way as the negotiations on Brexit progress.  </p></reply>

In light of the importance of the scheme, the Programme for Government included a commitment to provide an additional &euro;25m for the Scheme in 2018.  I am pleased to confirm that this commitment was delivered in Budget 2018 and that, subject to the EU Commission&rsquo;s approval of an amendment to Ireland's Rural Development Programme, this new funding will be available for payment under the 2018 ANC Scheme.  This additional funding brings the overall budget allocation for the 2018 ANC scheme to &euro;227m.  </p>  <p>  A number of different options were available in deciding how this additional funding was to be divided.  I was conscious of the need for money to be targeted at those farmers on lands with higher levels of constraint.  </p>  <p>  With this in mind and having considered the views of stakeholders, I have decided to distribute the additional &euro;25 million as follows - </p>  <p>  - &euro;13m will be allocated to the 'mountain type land' category </p>  <p>  - &euro;9m will be allocated to the 'more severely handicapped' category' and  </p>  <p>  - &euro;3m will be allocated to the 'less severely handicapped' category.  </p>  <p>  These allocations will have the effect of increasing the current payment per hectare rates across all land categories.  Those farming on what is called "mountain type land" will see their payment increase from &euro;109.71 to &euro;135 on their first 10 hectares, and from &euro;95.99 to &euro;112 on remaining hectares up to a maximum of 34 hectares.  Farmers with land categorised as "more severely handicapped lowland" will see an increase from &euro;95.99 to &euro;104 per hectare up to a maximum of 30 hectares.  Finally, those with "less severely handicapped lowland" will see an increase from &euro;82.27 to &euro;88.25 per hectare up to a maximum of 30 hectares.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that these increased payment rates are consistent with the underlying logic of the Scheme, where the highest level of support is targeted at those who are faced with the highest level of constraint on their land.  These changes must now be formally agreed with the EU Commission, by way of an amendment to our Rural Development Programme.  My officials have initiated this process, with a view to introducing these new rates for payment in 2018.</p></reply>

The payment system involves the use of a base price agreed between processors and suppliers for cattle with a carcass confirmation of R= and R- and a fat class of 2+, 3 and 4.  Cattle grading better than these base criteria will receive a premium above the base price and cattle grading below these base criteria will receive a price less than the base price.  </p>  <p>  The QPS or beef grid as referred to in this question, is a payment mechanism whereby a price is determined and paid by processors to farmer suppliers.  As this is a commercial matter between processors and farmers I cannot interfere with this and it would be inappropriate for me or my Department to take a role in a review of any pricing mechanism.  </p>  <p>  It is therefore the responsibility of the beef processing industry and farming organisations to discuss the QPS and formulate the methodology of any review.  It is their agreement and therefore it must be their review and I have stated this position several times.

There have been eleven meetings of the Roundtable, the most recent being on 6 February.  No decision has been made to widen representation at the Roundtable beyond the original participants.  </p>  <p>  While the agenda of the most recent meeting did not include a specific item on live exports, the issue was discussed during the Roundtable.  The Deputy will be aware that in the last year I have undertaken several trade missions to facilitate access to new markets and develop existing markets for Irish exports.  In the last week of January I, along with officials from my Department and Bord Bia, and representatives of Irish live cattle export companies, visited Turkey, which last year was our third largest market for the export of live cattle.  I had a successful meeting with my Turkish counterpart, Minister Fakibaba, and we agreed to set up an official contact group to facilitate detailed discussions on certification issues.  Minister Fakibaba also confirmed that, from the end of May, private sector buyers will be permitted to import cattle for fattening.  Currently this trade is through State body ESK only.  </p>  <p>  My Department and I will continue to place a great importance on the cattle export trade as a means of providing an alternative market outlet for Irish cattle farmers.  This is very much reflected in the increase in live exports in 2017 with an increase of approximately 45,000 head of cattle or 30% compared to 2016.  In addition, in 2017 I reduced the veterinary inspection fee that is payable on live exports of calves less than three months of age to &euro;1.20 per animal from &euro;4.80, in order to bring greater equity in the fees payable per consignment in respect of calves, weanlings and adult cattle.  </p></reply>

In addition, EU exports of beef performed strongly for 2017 and Irish exporters also had a good year, with beef exports growing by 5% to reach a value of &euro;2.5 billion, and live exports rising by approximately 30%, giving beef farmers a vital alternative market outlet. These are positive developments for a beef exporter country such as Ireland, which remains the fifth largest net exporter of beef in the world, and should provide ongoing opportunities for the development of the sector domestically and for growth in Irish exports both within the EU and to third countries. </p>  <p>  Securing new market access and enhancing existing Irish beef access was a priority for trade missions in 2017 and I will also be leading a further series Government of Ireland agri-food trade missions in 2018, commencing with the Us and Canada at the end of this month. Improved beef access to Saudi Arabia was secured during the Trade Mission to the Gulf States in February 2017. In June of last year I led a trade mission to Mexico and the USA; the mission was a welcome opportunity to promote Irish beef in the USA, particularly now that Ireland has access for Beef Intended for Grinding (BIFG). As part of this mission, I also announced Ireland&rsquo;s intention to apply for beef market access in Mexico. In addition, beef market access was a central focus of the trade mission to Japan and South Korea in November. During this visit I met with South Korean Minister&rsquo;s to expedite the process of gaining market access. I also had very fruitful discussions with the Japanese authorities about the potential for increasing the age restrictions on beef and this is under consideration at present. </p>  <p>  Ireland is also entering the final stages in gaining beef market access to China. A comprehensive audit was carried out in Ireland by the Chinese authorities in August and September of last year and a draft report has recently been published which my Department has responded to. My officials continue to liaise closely with their Chinese counterparts to provide every assurance in relation to the quality and safety of Irish beef. </p>  <p>  My Department currently provides a range of supports to the beef sector and the suckler herd. A number of direct payment and grant schemes provide vital income and investment support to the suckler sector, including BPS, ANC, GLAS and TAMS. The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current Rural Development Programme period. Responding to significant demand, last year I reopened the BDGP programme for new entrants, reflecting the success of this programme, which targets both the environmental footprint and the profitability of the suckler herd through improving the genetic merit in participating herds. </p>  <p>  Whilst the Irish beef sector has been challenged by Brexit uncertainty, meeting this challenge is assisted by  having in place a long term strategy for agri food sector in Food Wise 2025, which includes actions to enhance the competitiveness of the beef sector at both farmer and processor level. </p></reply>

Alongside this increase in production, exports have risen by 14 percent in volume terms to 57,000 tonnes and by 12 percent in value terms to &euro;275 million. In 2017 Ireland exported sheepmeat to 39 countries. </p>  <p>  Within the EU, France and the UK remain the top markets for Irish sheepmeat. France represents one third of the market, growing at 4 percent to &euro;95 million; this strong market will be a significant asset to Ireland&rsquo;s sheepmeat industry against the backdrop of Brexit. The UK market grew at 11 percent, yielding &euro;51 million. Across the EU, Sweden recorded growth of 14 percent for 2017, making it Ireland&rsquo;s third largest export market for sheepmeat. The German market is in fourth position, with a 9 per cent growth rate and exports of &euro;26m. </p>  <p>  Bord Bia have identified Germany as an EU country with strong growth potential; Germany has a large meat-eating population base, and low consumption of sheepmeat. Industry trends indicate that lamb is growing in popularity amongst gourmet restaurants and premium retailers, and the Bord Bia strategy will target this section of the market. Among other EU markets targeted for development in the Bord Bia report are the Nordic countries, where Irish sheepmeat already accounts for over one in every five tonnes of sheep meat imported; and Belgium and Luxembourg, where Irish premium exports are growing in a competitive market. </p>  <p>  Outside of the EU, Bord Bia&rsquo;s recent market prioritisation exercise has identified Iran and the United Arab Emirates as markets with high potential for growth. The Iranian population is expected to increase significantly, and sheepmeat is popular amongst consumers. Ireland gained sheepmeat market access to Iran in 2016. The United Arab Emirates imports large quantities of meat, with imports making up 70% of all requirements. </p>  <p>  In terms of sheepmeat market access, I announced Ireland&rsquo;s intention to seek sheepmeat access to both South Korea and Japan during the Trade Mission last November and positive progress is already being made in relation to access to Japan. Nonetheless, it is important to keep seeking out new opportunities for our sheepmeat industry. </p>  <p>  Sheepmeat access to the USA is a high priority for the sheepmeat industry, although this will be dependent on the USA lifting their TSE ban. The timing of this is uncertain and is a matter for the US authorities but it is intended to raise this as part of the upcoming Trade Mission to the USA and Canada.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-02-13a.1332.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018021300079#WRW02800"><p>Firstly I wish to emphasise that I am very much committed to this very important sector which plays a key role in the development of the wider agri-food industry. Tillage is a key source of seed production, grain for the milling and malting industry and feeding stuffs for the livestock sector and as a consequence is a significant stakeholder in our agri-food industry from a supply/food safety and sustainability viewpoint. </p>  <p>  Cereal production has experienced a few difficult years both in terms of grain price and weather conditions. Because Ireland accounts for only around 1% of EU production, grain prices here are very much affected by European and world market price shifts and tend to experience volatility. The current situation globally for the cereal sector is that it has experienced another consecutive year of high grain supplies which have again outstripped demand. These years of oversupply continue to exert a downward pressure on the market and this of course has had a negative effect on price to the grower here. Partly as a consequence, the annual cereal area has reduced in recent years. For example, in 2017 the national cereals area reduced by about 10,000 ha to 270,000. </p>  <p>  However, I want to highlight the actions my Department is undertaking to assist this vital sector. In 2017 I introduced the &euro;150m Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme and extended it through provision of national funding to cover the tillage and horticulture sectors. There was a very positive reaction by farmers, including tillage farmers, to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance.  The &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Loan Scheme&rdquo; has provided a template for access to finance schemes, including the recently announced &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo; for SMEs. </p>  <p>  I am also examining a potential Brexit response loan schemes for farmers, fishermen and for longer-term capital financing for food businesses; for which my Department has secured &euro;25 million of funding in 2018.</p>  <p>  As a further support to tillage farmers I introduced the Tillage Capital Investment Scheme under TAMS II which opened for online applications on the 8 March 2017. The specific areas of investment include Minimum Disturbance Tillage Equipment, Sprayers, Rain Water Harvesting, Grain Storage and Grain dryers.  </p>  <p>  There has been a significant level of interest in investments by the tillage sector, with a total number of 775 applications  received so far and 637 approvals. Over &euro;1.38m has now issued in respect of 120 payment claims. Payments will continue on an ongoing basis. This is the latest of the Targeted Modernisation Schemes (TAMS II) to be launched under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020. The Scheme is co-funded by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).</p>  <p>  Last year in response to the exceptionally challenging harvest conditions of September 2016 I introduced a Weather Related Crop Loss Support measure to assist farmers who experienced significant yield losses in spring cereal crops. This measure provides for a financial contribution of up to &euro;200 per hectare up to a maximum of 35 hectares per eligible applicant towards the cost of uninsured spring cereals crop losses in excess of 30% by yield.  Particularly hard hit growers who experienced cereal crop losses in excess of 50%  benefit from an additional &euro;100 per hectare, on the same area. A total of 167 applications for support were received in the Department by the closing date of August 26 and are currently being processed. To date payments totalling &euro;314,032 have issued to 68 applicants.</p>  <p>  While the challenges facing the sector at this point in time are real, in Ireland we can grow  cereals with the highest yields in the world and this is an advantage we must press home and also look to exploit other areas under our own control. For example, my own Department provides a high quality  official crop seed certification scheme to the industry in addition to an extensive national crop variety evaluation programme.  I would also encourage tillage growers to fully implement the advice and research provided by Teagasc in relation to efficient and sustainable production of crops.

Notwithstanding challenges on the horizon, amongst which Brexit is paramount, stakeholders in the Irish dairy sector are well placed to benefit from expanding global demand.</p>  <p>  Analysis from Bord Bia and my Department, both based on CSO data, demonstrate the resilience of the Irish food and drink export sector, and the dairy export sector in particular. Whilst full year CSO data becomes available towards the middle of this month estimates made by Bord Bia for their Annual Performance and Prospects publication provides a positive assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s performance in 2017 as well as our prospects for 2018 in both the food and drink sector, and the dairy sector in particular.</p>  <p>  2017 was the eighth consecutive year of export growth for the food and drink sector as a whole, with the dairy sector, which comprises more than a third of the total, having the strongest performers in terms of export growth for the year. Bord Bia analysis indicated that for the year as a whole the value of food and drink exports is estimated to have increased by 13%, (&euro;1.5bn) to &euro;12.6bn representing growth of almost 60% or &euro;4.7bn since 2010.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, driven by increased production and higher dairy market returns, the analysis found that Irish dairy exports increased by 19 percent in 2017 to &euro;4.02 billion, an increase of &euro;655 million. It should be noted that this figure as used by Bord Bia excludes dairy based Prepared Consumer foods as well as enriched dairy based powders which, if included, increases this export figure in respect of dairy related products by a further &euro;900 million approximately.</p>  <p>  In terms of prospects for 2018, as a small, open economy, Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with trading partners around the world is a key driver of our success in this global food business. Based on this we can say that the prospects for dairy exports in 2018 look positive. The rates of growth recorded in 2017 for key product areas and the ongoing demand levels in Europe and international markets for powder based products, butter and cheese bode well, as does the fact that wholesale prices remain very high reflecting international demand. </p>  <p>  Ireland exports more than 85% of our milk and dairy produce to markets all around the world. In the context of the Food Wise strategy, and as a key part of our Brexit response I, with my Department and Bord Bia, will continue efforts to widen our access to third country markets, as well as deepen existing trading relationships, including through inward and outward trade missions.</p></reply>

However, during this period the Irish Government&rsquo;s position will continue to be to minimise the impact of Brexit on existing trade for all our food exports including mushrooms. My Department and its State Agencies are currently providing supports on a number of fronts. </p>  <p>  Budget 2018 provided for a new &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo; which will provide affordable, flexible finance to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or who will be in the future. The new Brexit Loan Scheme will make up to &euro;300 million of working capital finance available to SMEs and mid-cap businesses (up to 499 employees). This will give Brexit-impacted businesses, including potentially a number of mushroom exporters, time and space to adapt and to grow into the future. I am also considering the development of a potential Brexit response loan schemes for farmers, fishermen and for longer-term capital financing for food businesses; for which my Department has secured &euro;25 million of funding in 2018.</p>  <p>  The EU Producer Organisation (PO) scheme is also a vital support, with around 80% of Irish mushroom growers in a producer organisation at present. This scheme provides an important mechanism for growers to achieve greater bargaining power in the marketplace by becoming part of a larger supply base. This scheme is funding a number of initiatives to improve competitiveness, including Lean Training for mushroom growers. In addition, the National Strategy for Sustainable Operational Programmes 2017-2022 for Producer Organisations in the Fruit and Vegetables sector provides aid for crisis Prevention and management measures to assist with market volatility, including training and exchange of best practice measures.</p>  <p>  For the wider horticultural sector the Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector continues to be the main support for individual growers in the horticulture industry who wish to make capital investments in specialised equipment or buildings. Budget 2018 allocated &euro;5m in funding again for the Scheme in 2018, further reflecting this Government's commitment to ongoing support for the sector. The competitive nature of this scheme combined with its flexibility and ability to react to evolving situations are two key strengths in supporting this highly dynamic sector. </p>  <p>  I can also confirm that An Bord Bia has commenced a 3-year mushroom promotion campaign on the Irish and UK markets. This campaign is co-funded by the industry and the European Commission. It is important to emphasise that the overall market for mushrooms in the UK and Ireland remains strong, showing good potential for further growth. This new promotion campaign will build on the success of previous similar initiatives and develop that growth in potential to increase exports.</p></reply>

Some 51% of Irish beef exports are to the UK. </p>  <p>  We also know that beef consumption in the EU is relatively static. Gross production in 2016 was approximately 7.88 million tonnes with consumption reaching 7.941 million tonnes.  The most acute concern however, relates to the high value cuts market of between 600,000 and 700,000 tonnes, which is likely to be targeted by Mercosur importers. These represent approx 8% of carcase weight but up to 30% of carcase value. </p>  <p>  As a small open economy, Ireland supports trade liberalisation and recognises the benefits of trade agreements with third countries,  which can potentially give rise to increased exports and job creation. However, such agreements must be balanced and must serve both our offensive and defensive interests. I will continue to protect the interests of Irish farmers in negotiations on such matters in the future. </p></reply>

It does not provide any upside for Irish agriculture, and it is for this reason that I will continue to be firm in arguing that any agreement reached between the EU and the UK must allow for continued free access to the UK market, without tariffs, with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures, as well as a minimisation of the risk from UK trade agreements with third countries.  </p>  <p>  The agri-food sector is of critical importance to the Irish economy in that its regional spread means it underpins the socio-economic development of rural Ireland in particular. </p>  <p>  While the most immediate impact of Brexit has been the difficulties caused by the significant drop in the value of sterling against the euro, the anticipated longer-term challenges will arise in relation to regulations and standards (in the event that there is no agreement on transition arrangements or the finalisation of a framework for the future relationship), export certification (including animal and plant health certification) and tariffs (in a hard Brexit scenario food exports could in theory face very high WTO tariffs, for example of over 50% for dairy and over 60% for beef. Tariffs for exports in certain poultry products could exceed these levels).</p>  <p>  The overall value of Irish poultry exports have increased by around 3 percent for 2017 to &euro;295 million in value, with volumes only rising by 1 percent during the same period. The number of poultry birds processed in Ireland reached record levels at 96m birds. During the same period Irish imports decreased by 7 percent reflecting increased preference for Irish product in the food service channel. The great majority of Irish poultry exports continue to go to the UK which records almost 80 percent market share for 2017 or some &euro;240m. The share of Irish poultry exports going to other EU markets has edged upwards to 10 percent, with France maintaining its position as the most important market especially for leg meat that is not consumed on the home market. Increasing market access is a key priority for the sector and will support further export reach. Some recent developments to open trade could lead to new opportunities, such as the EU-Japan free trade agreement.</p></reply>

The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) provides the framework for the long term conservation and sustainability of fish stocks around our shores and is designed to ensure the long term sustainability of fishing in Ireland and throughout EU waters. The CFP utilises the best scientific advice as a key determinant in setting annual fishing quotas. Key features of this policy include setting Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and quotas to deliver maximum sustainable yield (MSY) by 2015, where possible, and in all cases by 2020 as well as a discards ban (Landing Obligation) to be phased in over the period 2015 to 2019.</p>  <p>  Setting fishing levels on the basis of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) is an essential aspect of the policy. Fishing opportunities are agreed on an annual basis at the EU Fisheries Council of Ministers on the basis of a proposal produced by the European Commission that is informed by the best available scientific advice. The Common Fisheries Policy specifically calls for the progressive restoration and maintenance of populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing MSY.  To achieve this, the FMSY exploitation rate shall be achieved for all stocks by 2020 at the latest. This should ultimately lead to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and lead to more sustainable fishing patterns.</p>  <p>  There has been a marked improvement in the state of many stocks in the waters around Ireland. For example, there has been a 34% increase in our whitefish quotas off the North-West coast and a 64% increase in the Irish Sea. These are both areas that were severely depleted just five years ago. This shows that the many years of intensive, industry led conservation measures are paying off. The work done to rebuild these stocks has led to significant increases for quotas for our fleets.</p>  <p>  The objective of the landing obligation is to eliminate the wasteful and unsustainable practice of discarding. The first part of the landing obligation, the ban on discarding pelagic stocks such as herring and mackerel, came into effect on the 1st of January 2015.  The landing obligation was extended to certain demersal stocks (whitefish and prawns) from the 1st of January 2016 and will be fully phased in by the 1st January 2019.</p>  <p>  Scientific information on the state of the fisheries exploited by the Irish fleet is compiled by the Marine Institute and is published in the Stock Book each year. The most recent Stock Book, 2017, contains 74 stocks that are subject to the scientific advice of the Marine Institute. Of those 74 stocks, 29 were assessed as being sustainably fished in 2017. This number has grown every year since 2013. This in turn leads to the number of stocks being overfished declining from 22 in 2014 to 17 in 2017.  The biomass of stocks, the quantity of mature fish in the sea, has also increased. In 2017 there were 27 stocks in a positive state above biomass trigger points. This is an increase over the preceding year of 22.</p>  <p>  The EU Commission has also noted that the state of fish stocks continues to improve which indicates that we are seeing the benefits of prudent and responsible fisheries management practices. </p>  <p>  I am confident that we will continue to make significant progress that will ensure the continued economic viability of our fishing fleet and fish processors while supporting the communities that depend on a vibrant fishing industry.</p></reply>

In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have what is referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system.</p>  <p>  The role of National Competent Authorities is to verify compliance with these requirements. This is done by inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which food business operators have in place. Verification can also include the taking of official controls samples for verification of food business operators compliance with food law.</p>  <p>  Since 1999, responsibility for the enforcement of food legislation is vested in the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  The Authority co-ordinates the work of its official agencies through service contracts which specify the food sectors to be supervised, the types of controls to be provided including inspections and laboratory analysis.  The main official agencies under contract to the FSAI are the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Health Service Executive, the Local Authorities and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority. The contracts are published on the Authority&rsquo;s website and their performance is subject to regular checks and audits.</p>  <p>  The collective work of the FSAI and the official agencies is set down within a comprehensive Multi Annual National Control Plan for Ireland 2012-2017, which is submitted to the European Commission and against which the FSAI and the official agencies are audited by the Commission on its implementation. </p>  <p>  The system of official controls covers all foods produced or marketed in the State, including imports.   </p>  <p>  My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants. Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency based on an annual risk assessment. An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department-approved plant, including checks on physical identity, labelling and documentary checks for product originating in EU Member States and third countries. Labelling and documentary checks are routinely conducted by the Department in accordance with the relevant EU regulations.</p>  <p>   The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (formerly the FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards. The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States. Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department. Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the Directorate to ensure compliance. Inspection reports are published on the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety&rsquo;s website</p>  <p>  Imports of food of animal origin are the subject of specific authorisations before they can be placed on the market in Ireland or the EU. Imports of foods non- animal origin are subject to compliance with all relevant EU rules. These are subject to market checks during the course of routine inspections and/or are tested as part of the annual extensive microbiological and chemical monitoring programmes.  The FSAI also receives information on foods which may pose a danger to health from the European Commission through the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed.</p></reply>

This increase in the value of exports has been realised notwithstanding the challenges the different sectors have encountered in recent years, the most recent of which is of course Brexit.</p>  <p>  The numbers of livestock in the different sectors over the last ten years have fluctuated from enterprise to enterprise. Within the last ten years dairy cow numbers based on the CSO June livestock surveys increased from a total of 1,087,000 in the June 2007 survey to 1,432,700 in the June 2017 livestock survey, which itself was an increase of 2.5% from June 2016. This increase has been driven to a large extent by the abolition of milk quotas in 2015.</p>  <p>  In relation to the size of the national beef herd, the number of non-dairy cows recorded by the CSO June livestock survey shows a decrease of 2.1% from 1,103,700 in June 2016 to 1,081, 000 in June 2017. The CSO Livestock survey for June 2007 showed the number of non-dairy cows as 1,180,000 head. The total size of the national beef herd will of course comprise both the progeny of the national suckler herd as well as non-replacement stock from the dairy herd.</p>  <p>  The size of the national sheep flock based on census returns over the last ten years has risen from a low of 3.07 million sheep in 2009 to a high of 3.91 million recorded in the 2016 census.</p>  <p>  With regards to the size of the national pig herd, the method of data collected was changed in 2011 and since then numbers according to the pig census have risen from a low of approximately 1.35 million pigs in 2012 to a high of approximately 1.6 million pigs in 2016.</p></reply>

IFI is supported in its management role by scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) and by Ireland&rsquo;s independent Standing Scientific Committee (SSC), comprising scientists from a range of organisations.

This management is carried out by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI), the State Agency with statutory responsibility for inland fisheries.  The management policy is based on the fact that each of Ireland&rsquo;s 147 salmon rivers, river sections, estuaries, etc., has its own genetically unique stock of salmon, which migrates to sea as juveniles and returns to the same river in adulthood to spawn and create the next generation of fish exclusive to that river.</p>  <p>  IFI is supported in its management role by Ireland&rsquo;s Standing Scientific Committee. IFI also draws on international advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES).</p>  <p>  The Atlantic salmon is a protected species under the EU Habitats Directive with which Ireland&rsquo;s current salmon management regime complies.  In order to align fully with the Directive and the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) principles and in view of a sharp decline in salmon stocks, the Irish Government closed mixed stock fisheries in 2007 including coastal and offshore fishing for salmon.  Harvest fisheries are now only allowed on individual river stocks which are shown to have a surplus and in estuaries where the stocks from individual rivers entering the estuary are each meeting their individual conservation limits.</p>  <p>  A Salmon Hardship Scheme was introduced in 2007 under which fishermen active in the commercial salmon fishery could opt to permanently cease fishing.  In excess of &euro;25 million was allocated to the scheme to facilitate payments to fishermen, with a further &euro;5 million provided for community development projects.  It is considered that river stocks would be in a far more perilous state if the closure of mixed stock fisheries had not been implemented.</p>  <p>  The number of public commercial licences available for sustainable harvesting of fisheries in 2018 is 105 while it is anticipated that some 18,000 recreational licences will issue.  Recreational angling now comprises close to 70% of total catches.  Catch and release continues to be a feature of recreational angling with approximately 10,000 salmon released by anglers annually.</p>  <p>  During migration from rivers to marine feeding grounds, salmon from both rivers in Ireland and rivers in other countries travel through Ireland&rsquo;s coastal waters.  These "mixed stocks" pose particular difficulties for management as they contain individual fish often from a wide range of rivers some of which are below sustainable reproductive capacity.  Any deviation from current policy would be contrary to the international independent scientific advice as the &ldquo;home river&rdquo; of off-shore salmon cannot be identified and it is not possible to disaggregate the individuals or stock groups at sea.</p>  <p>  The conservation imperative demands that current salmon stocks are not further eroded by mismanagement or inappropriate exploitation, whether via angling, commercial fisheries in rivers inland or through the operation of indiscriminate mixed stock fisheries at sea or in estuaries.</p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to international agreements entered into at EU level and at NASCO and the prohibition of mixed stock fisheries is a key element of international best practice in salmon conservation and management.</p></reply>

The design of the new scheme has included an extensive independent economic appraisal.  This appraisal compared the cost of supporting a range of commercial renewable technologies, including Anaerobic Digestion and rooftop solar PV, at various scales, to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply.  The assessment included analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines.</p>  <p>  Micro generation was also appraised as part of the RESS economic assessment and the analysis identified a number of challenges that may need to be addressed before a support scheme for micro generation can be developed. The reality is that bringing microgen onto a system designed for large generators is complicated. It impacts how we pay for the network, how we manage regulation and how we technically manage the system.  My Department will continue to work closely with the micro generation sector and the SEAI to better understand how to validate and further develop micro generation policies in a fair and cost effective manner. </p>  <p>  Following on from the recent RESS public consultation and review, a final design proposal will be brought to Government for approval in the coming months, including the overall costs, the number of categories and the technologies to be supported. A formal application for State Aid clearance from the European Commission will then commence.</p>  <p>  At this stage no final decisions have been made as regards which technologies will be supported under the new RESS. </p></reply>

The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector.  Today 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband.  By the end of this year that number will rise to nearly 8 out of 10 premises and by 2020, 9 out of 10 premises or 90% of premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. </p><p>In April 2017 I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>.  This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan (NBP). </p><p>The Map is colour coded and searchable by address/eircode:  </p><p>- The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process.  </p><p>- The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services. </p><p>- The LIGHT BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises by the end of this year as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with me in April 2017. </p><p>The areas referred to by the Deputy, Raheenmore Road, in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath and an area known as the Back of the Hill , Ardagh, Co. Longford both fall within AMBER areas on the map and will get access to high speed broadband through the State led intervention.</p><p>With regards to the Deputy&rsquo;s query regarding the extension of the eir 300,000 rural rollout to these areas, the decisions made by private telecommunication operators relating to the rollout and siting of infrastructure to provide high speed broadband services throughout Ireland are undertaken on a commercial basis by competing service providers operating in a liberalised market.  I have no statutory role or function to intervene in the commercial decisions of private operators, and therefore cannot direct operators regarding infrastructure installation or delivery of services. </p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area.  The process is at an advanced stage.  When the procurement process reaches a satisfactory conclusion for Government, a contract will be awarded and the network rollout will commence.</p><p>Delivering high speed broadband to citizens across Ireland remains a firm commitment of mine and this Government.</p><p>In the interim, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website</p></reply>

Following a public consultation process, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities published its independent regulatory decision in relation to the ownership of this infrastructure in October 2017. A key outcome of the decision is that the charging network should not form part of the regulated asset base and therefore expansions of the network should not be funded from network charges. This is in keeping with the proposals set out by the European Commission in the Clean Energy for All Europeans package which was published in 2016. The decision also set out the need for the electric vehicle charging infrastructure to operate on a commercial basis. In the absence of State-led support, this is unlikely to happen in the near term.  </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  In order to support the provision of public charging, funding has been allocated in my Department's budget for the first time this year, with a particular focus on increasing the number of rapid chargers on key national routes.

The design of the new scheme has included an extensive independent economic appraisal which compared the cost of supporting a range of commercial renewable technologies including Solar PV at various scales including Utility (farm scale) to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply.  The assessment included analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines. </p>  <p>  The new scheme will be defined by a series of renewable electricity auctions, where the most cost effective projects within an auction structure will receive financial support in a form of a premium, in addition to the price they receive from the market.  The scheme will be flexible enough to respond to auction results and deliver key policy objectives as the scheme matures.</p>  <p>  It is widely recognised that solar photovoltaic (PV) technology has become more cost competitive for electricity generation over the last few years, not only compared with other renewables but also compared with conventional forms of generation. Furthermore, a recent report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA 2017) forecasts that solar PV costs will continue to fall by a further 50% out to 2020. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the level of solar applicants seeking connection to the grid and acknowledging that solar PV does have a role to play in Ireland&rsquo;s energy future, the cost effectiveness of the new scheme is a key policy objective. I cannot stand over a scenario whereby electricity customers are locked into higher prices now for renewable energy as renewable technology costs fall.  While increasing renewable technology diversity is one of several policy objectives the new RESS is trying to deliver, falling technology costs by themselves may lead to increased diversity of the renewable portfolio over the medium term.</p>  <p>  Following on from the recent RESS public consultation and review, a final design proposal will be brought to Government for approval in the coming months, including the overall costs, the number of categories and the technologies to be supported. A formal application for State Aid clearance from the European Commission will then commence.</p>  <p>  At this stage no final decisions have been made as regards which technologies will be supported under the new RESS. </p></reply>

While data centres currently account for less than 2% of Ireland&rsquo;s total electricity demand, EirGrid have modelled a range of scenarios in their 2017 &lsquo;Tomorrow's Energy Scenarios&rsquo; report including one scenario which provides for this to increase to as much as 36% by 2030.  Given the quantum of electricity required to power data centres, and the clear preference of project promoters that data centres should be powered by electricity from renewable energy sources, there are clear policy choices to be made in order to meet the demand for additional renewable electricity generation. These choices include the need to align with climate obligations, population projections and energy policy objectives.</p>  <p>  Data centres consume very large amounts of energy and have a flat, predictable demand profile meaning that they use the same amount of electricity throughout the day and night and therefore require a range of generation technologies to meet their demand.  </p>  <p>  Regarding renewable generation capacity, my Department is developing a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) which is being designed to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contribution to EU-wide targets out to 2030. Following on from the RESS public consultation and review, a final design proposal will be brought to Government for approval in the coming months with the new scheme expected to open in 2019.  At this stage no final decisions have been made as regards which technologies will be supported under the new RESS. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the economic benefits that data centres can bring to Ireland the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation in conjunction with other relevant Ministers is leading a cross-government effort to develop a national policy statement on the strategic importance of data centres as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Enterprise Strategy, taking account of wider energy policy developments including growth in renewable electricity capacity. </p>  <p>  While intensified data centre activity will likely play a key role in stimulating demand for increased renewable electricity generation, the impact on the Public Service Obligation levies for consumers must also be considered. It is imperative therefore that Government considers an approach to cost allocation that does not impose disproportionate additional charges on ordinary consumers.</p></reply>

It sets out the ambition that all new cars and vans sold in Ireland from 2030 will be zero emission (or zero emission-capable).  A range of policy measures aimed at supporting the transition to low emission vehicles are set out in the <i>National Policy Framework </i>.</p><p>Furthermore, the National Mitigation Plan published in July 2017 reiterates the ambition and also includes supporting actions towards this objective <i></i>.  While remaining technology neutral in the context of promoting greater uptake of zero emission capable vehicles, the full electrification of the car fleet represents a feasible option in Ireland, where supporting grid infrastructure is developed.  Advances in battery technology, increasing competition in the market and falling vehicle costs would suggest that electrification will be the predominant low emission choice for private car, taxis and commercial vans in the short to medium term.  In this regard, under a <i>Programme for a Partnership Government </i>commitment &ndash; that Ireland will become a leader in the take-up of electric vehicles (EVs) &ndash; a dedicated <i>Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce </i>was established to consider the range of measures and options available to Government to accelerate this aim. </p><p>The work of the <i>Taskforce </i>has been divided into three work streams focusing on: Market Growth Stimuli and Visibility; Infrastructure, Energy Regulation and Pricing; and Planning Legislation, Building Regulations and Public Leadership. Preliminary recommendations from the <i>Taskforce</i>were considered in the 2018 budgetary process and a suite of continued and new EV supports were announced as part of Budget 2018 (please see the current incentives to promote EVs listed below &ndash;additional information is available at: <i></i>).  In 2018 the <i>Taskforce </i>will also broaden its scope to consider measures to promote fuels such as natural gas, liquid petroleum gas and hydrogen.  Currently, there is a Government commitment to maintain duty levels of natural gas at the minimum level for a period of eight years and an action in the <i>National Policy Framework </i>to develop the accelerated capital allowance type scheme to include gas refuelling infrastructure and vehicles. </p><p>The 2030 ambition will be met through: implementing the measures outlined in the above publications; realising the outcomes from the LEV Taskforce deliberations; and developing new and innovative policy interventions in the years ahead accounting for technological and market developments.<table><tr><th><b>Electric Vehicle Incentives</b></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>VRT Relief</td><td>Continuation of VRT relief in Budget 2018: <br /><br />Up to &euro;5,000 for new EVs until end 2021<br /><br />Up to &euro;2,500 for new PHEVs until end 2018</td></tr><tr><td>SEAI Grant Scheme</td><td>Continuation of SEAI Purchase Grant :<br /><br />Up to &euro;5,000 towards the purchase of a new EV or PHEV</td></tr><tr><td>Accelerated Capital Allowance (ACA)</td><td>EVs and charging infrastructure are qualifying equipment under the ACA scheme</td></tr><tr><td>Charging Supports</td><td>A new grant to support installation of home charger points for buyers of new and second-hand EVs from January 1st</td></tr><tr><td>SPSV Grant Scheme</td><td>A new grant and supporting measures to stimulate take-up of EVs in the taxi /hackney/limousine sector</td></tr><tr><td>0% Benefit-in-Kind (BIK)</td><td>A new BIK 0% rate to incentivise EVs without mileage conditions for at least three years</td></tr><tr><td>Public Body Procurement</td><td>National Procurement Service to introduce a new public procurement framework contract for EVs in 2018 to allow public bodies to buy EVs with reduced administrative burden</td></tr><tr><td>Public Engagement Programme</td><td>National awareness campaign<br /><br />Driver experience roadshow<br /><br />Public sector and commercial fleet trials<br /><br />Support for EV use in car sharing trials</td></tr><tr><td>Toll Incentive Regime</td><td>Funding to support a reduction in tolls for EVs </td></tr></table></p></reply>

However, as I explained in the D&aacute;il before Christmas, when this approach was subject to final legal review it was found to be difficult in light of emerging EU case law.  These legal advices forced a re-examination of options for the full implementation of the EU Regulation, which involved discussions between my Department and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Communications, Climate Change and Environment.  Having examined the requirements of the EU Regulation it was considered, on balance, that Fingal County Council, with An Bord Plean&aacute;la as an independent appeals body, offered the best way forward.</p>  <p>  The Government has endorsed that proposed course of action, and I now intend to get on with implementing it.  </p>  <p>  As regards the standards, the EU Regulation - which came into effect in 2016 - provides Member States with a common framework for applying internationally agreed best practices in the area of aviation noise management.  With reference to methodology agreed at the UN&rsquo;s International Civil Aviation Organisation, the Regulation seeks to ensure that airport capacity is developed in a measured and balanced way, with due regard to economic growth, jobs, prosperity and the mitigation of environmental impacts.  </p>  <p>  The Regulation will now be implemented by way of primary legislation, which will set out how airport noise is to be measured, managed and monitored at Dublin Airport into the future.</p></reply>

Subsequently, this deadline was extended seven times as a further concession to the industry to move to more road friendly articulated vehicle combinations, such as the 6-axle articulated (3+3) combination.</p>  <p>  Given the ongoing challenges in maintaining our critical roads infrastructure with constrained resources, the derogation was ended on 30 June 2016.  This was necessary to permit a decrease in road and bridge infrastructure damage caused by such vehicles and to thereby reduce the costs to the public finances in terms of maintaining and repairing vital road and bridge infrastructure.</p>  <p>  While I understand the concerns raised by the road haulage industry, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I must have regard to the overarching need to maintain national transport infrastructure in as cost effective manner as possible.  It is primarily for this reason, as well as the extensive 13 year period given to the industry to adjust, that the previously existing derogation has not been renewed.  While my Department and I obviously review our legislation on a regular basis, I do not believe that the position today has changed materially so as to cause me to reconsider this necessary measure to protect our roads.</p></reply>

Addressing urban congestion on both the strategic road network and locally in certain locations is an important theme in the Strategy. The measures proposed are linked to an analysis of current and projected levels of travel demand across the region.</p>  <p>  In 2015, Dublin City Council and the NTA jointly published the Dublin City Centre Transport Study which sets out the various measures proposed for Dublin's city centre to ensure the efficient functioning of transport within the city centre. Those two bodies, in collaboration with Dublin Bus and TII, are progressively implementing the measures set out in that document to enable the continued development and growth of the city. Over the last six months, changes have been made throughout the city centre to accommodate the introduction of new Luas services. The most significant changes were the introduction of the additional bus lanes along the North and South Quays last August.  In addition, a host of other junction and traffic signal changes has been implemented.  In the case of College Green - and in advance of a determination of a proposal for a civic plaza at College Green developed by City Council - the NTA, in collaboration with Dublin Bus and Dublin City Council, have proceeded to reduce bus vehicle volumes passing through the area, which would allow the junctions and signals to function more effectively. These parties continue to keep the situation under review.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport I have secured increased funding for both public transport services and infrastructure in Budget 2018 which will allow us to address congestion and emerging capacity constraints on our public transport system across our cities including Dublin. This includes an 8% increase in funding for PSO services across the bus and rail networks in 2018 to support the delivery of these socially necessary but financially unviable public transport services. </p>  <p>  Following the mid-term review of the Capital Plan, Budget 2018 provides for an increase in the multi-annual capital investment for Ireland's public transport with a four-year capital envelope of &euro;2.7 billion over the period 2018-2021. This substantial multi-annual envelope will allow investment in a number of key programmes to ease congestion and increase capacity on our public transport network. This includes funding of over &euro;770 million for the BusConnects programme to fundamentally transform Dublin&rsquo;s bus system, so that journeys for bus passengers will be fast, reliable, punctual, convenient and affordable. Over &euro;685 million capital investment will also be provided for additional rail infrastructure between now and 2021 to provide additional Luas capacity, improve mainline rail infrastructure and progress DART expansion and new Metro North.</p></reply>

It sets out the ambition that all new cars and vans sold in Ireland from 2030 will be zero emission (or zero emission-capable).  A range of policy measures aimed at supporting the transition to low emission vehicles are set out in the National Policy Framework (<i>)</i>.  Furthermore, the National Mitigation Plan published in July 2017 reiterates the ambition and also includes supporting actions towards this objective <i>(</i><i>).</i></p><p>While remaining technology neutral in the context of promoting greater uptake of zero emission capable vehicles, the full electrification of the car fleet represents a feasible option in Ireland, where supporting grid infrastructure is developed.  Advances in battery technology, increasing competition in the market and falling vehicle costs would suggest that electrification will be the predominant low emission choice for private car, taxis and commercial vans in the short to medium term.  In this regard, under a Programme for a Partnership Government commitment &ndash; that Ireland will become a leader in the take-up of electric vehicles (EVs) - a dedicated Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce was established to consider the range of measures and options available to Government to accelerate this aim.</p><p>The work of the Taskforce has been divided into three work streams focusing on: Market Growth Stimuli and Visibility; Infrastructure, Energy Regulation and Pricing; and Planning Legislation, Building Regulations and Public Leadership.  Preliminary recommendations from the Taskforce were considered in the 2018 budgetary process and a suite of continued and new EV supports were announced as part of Budget 2018.  A list of current incentives to promote EVs is presented in the table below &ndash;additional information is available at:<i>.</i></p><p>In 2018 the Taskforce will also broaden its scope to consider measures to promote fuels such as natural gas, liquid petroleum gas and hydrogen.  Currently, there is a Government commitment to maintain duty levels of natural gas at the minimum level for a period of eight years and an action in the National Policy Framework to develop the accelerated capital allowance type scheme to include gas refuelling infrastructure and vehicles.</p><p>The 2030 ambition will be achieved through implementing the measures outlined in the above publications, realising the outcomes of the LEV Taskforce deliberations, and developing new and innovative policy interventions in the years ahead in light of technological and market developments.</p><p><b>Electric Vehicle Incentives</b><table><tr><th>VRT Relief</th><th>Continuation of VRT relief in Budget 2018 - <br /><br />Up to &euro;5,000 for new EVs until end 2021<br /><br />Up to &euro;2,500 for new PHEVs until end 2018</th></tr><tr><td>SEAI Grant Scheme</td><td>Continuation of SEAI Purchase Grant -<br /><br />Up to &euro;5,000 towards the purchase of a new EV or PHEV</td></tr><tr><td>Accelerated Capital Allowance (ACA)</td><td>EVs and charging infrastructure are qualifying equipment under the ACA scheme</td></tr><tr><td>Charging Supports</td><td>A new grant to support installation of home charger points  for buyers of new and second-hand EVs from January 1st</td></tr><tr><td>SPSV Grant Scheme</td><td>A new grant and supporting measures to stimulate take-up of EVs in the taxi /hackney/limousine sector</td></tr><tr><td>0% Benefit-in-Kind (BIK)</td><td>A new BIK 0% rate to incentivise EVs without mileage conditions for at least three years</td></tr><tr><td>Public Body Procurement</td><td>National Procurement Service to introduce a new public procurement framework contract for EVs in 2018 to allow public bodies to buy EVs with reduced administrative burden</td></tr><tr><td>Public Engagement Programme</td><td>National awareness campaign<br /><br />Driver experience roadshow<br /><br />Public sector and commercial fleet trials<br /><br />Support for EV use in car sharing trials</td></tr><tr><td>Toll Incentive Regime</td><td>Funding to support a reduction in tolls for EVs </td></tr></table></p></reply>

In 2017, additional funding of &euro;1.5m was allocated to Tusla to support the development of services.  I was pleased to secure a further increase of &euro;1.7m for 2018, bringing the total level of funding for DSGBV services to &euro;23.8m.  This includes funding for some 60 services throughout the country, including emergency refuge and support services.</p><p>The development of services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence nationally is guided by the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence (Istanbul Convention), as well as the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence (2016-2021).  Additional funding in 2018 will support the development of enhanced DSGBV services.</p><p>Tusla does not have access to live data on refuge use.  Information provided by funded domestic violence services indicates that refuges consistently operate at full or near full-capacity.  Any vacancies are generally attributed to the turnover between the discharge and admission of clients.</p><p>Services for victims of domestic abuse in the North East region, namely counties Louth, Meath, Cavan, and Monaghan, received approximately &euro;1.4m in funding from Tusla in 2017.  Services to victims of domestic violence in counties Cavan and Monaghan are provided by Tearmann Domestic Violence Services, which received funding of approximately &euro;192,000 from Tusla in 2017 for the provision of support and advocacy services to victims.  Individuals based in West Cavan can also avail of the services of the Domestic Violence Advocacy Service for Sligo, Leitrim and West Cavan, which also provides support and advocacy services.  This service received approximately &euro;317,000 in funding in 2017.</p><p>Tusla has no immediate plans to provide a refuge in the Cavan/Monaghan area.  There are three refuges situated in Drogheda, Co. Louth; Dundalk, Co. Louth; and Navan, Co. Meath, which provide emergency domestic violence accommodation to women based in the North East region.  This includes 21 family units of emergency refuge accommodation.</p><p>As part of its commissioning approach to developing services, Tusla carried out a number of needs analyses projects in 2017 to identify gaps in service provision and to prioritise service developments.  All future service developments, whether based in the North East region or elsewhere, will be informed by Tusla&rsquo;s commissioning approach.  In 2017, Tearmann Domestic Violence Services completed a Strategic Plan as a means of improving and developing services in counties Cavan and Monaghan.  Tusla will meet Tearmann Domestic Violence Services and other partners shortly with a view to supporting these developments.</p><p>The following table provides information from Tusla on the geographical spread of 147 emergency refuge family units.<table><tr><th></th><th>County </th><th>Number of Emergency Refuge Family Units </th></tr><tr><td>1 </td><td>Clare </td><td>6 </td></tr><tr><td>2 </td><td>Cork </td><td>6 </td></tr><tr><td>3 </td><td>Donegal </td><td>4 </td></tr><tr><td>4 </td><td>Dublin </td><td>37 </td></tr><tr><td>5 </td><td>Galway </td><td>6 </td></tr><tr><td>6 </td><td>Kerry </td><td>6 </td></tr><tr><td>7 </td><td>Kilkenny </td><td>7 </td></tr><tr><td>8 </td><td>Kildare </td><td>4 </td></tr><tr><td>9 </td><td>Limerick </td><td>14 </td></tr><tr><td>10 </td><td>Louth </td><td>13 </td></tr><tr><td>11 </td><td>Mayo </td><td>5 </td></tr><tr><td>12 </td><td>Meath </td><td>5 </td></tr><tr><td>13 </td><td>Tipperary </td><td>4 </td></tr><tr><td>14 </td><td>Waterford </td><td>16 </td></tr><tr><td>15 </td><td>Westmeath </td><td>4 </td></tr><tr><td>16 </td><td>Wexford </td><td>4 </td></tr><tr><td>17 </td><td>Wicklow </td><td>6 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total </td><td>147 </td></tr></table></p><p>At all times, Tusla&rsquo;s key priority is to ensure that the needs of victims and survivors of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence are met in the best way possible, with due attention to the quality, accessibility, and outcome of services.</p></reply>

Limiting the diversity in age ranges in primary school is considered to be generally in the best interest of children, in relation to peer interaction in junior infants, as well as other educational considerations.</p>  <p>  Parents may request an exemption from ECCE eligibility criteria under limited circumstances from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA); specifically where a child is assessed as having a special/additional need.  In this regard, it is a requirement of the DCYA that a letter must be provided by a medical specialist (not a GP/Public Health Nurse) specifying the child's special/additional need, and diagnosis, and that they (the medical specialist) specifically recommend an extra year of pre-school for the child.  This requirement is not intended to undermine the view of a parent or teacher in relation to a child's needs but, rather, to maintain a clear and standard basis for applying for exemptions.</p>  <p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs does its best to ensure, in so far as is possible, the equitable treatment of all children and families who apply for childcare funding under the ECCE Programme.  In order to ensure objectivity and fairness it is essential that clear rules exist for the scheme and that they are applied in a fair manner.  The rules for all the Department&rsquo;s childcare schemes are clearly published to ensure transparency and consistent application.</p></reply>

Assisting those most centrally involved to understand the options now open to us was one of the reasons for commissioning the technical report which I published last December.</p>  <p>  Galway County Council recently announced details of a structured consultation process with a strong focus around Tuam.  I know the Council wants to support all interested parties to have their say as part of this process.  To this end the Council sought professional support in the design and approach to the consultation process.</p>  <p>  I have been contacted by a number of people in relation to this consultation process and my officials have relayed the feedback received directly to the Council.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the process has been developed to facilitate various parties to submit their views on the five courses of action identified by the Expert Technical Group.  The process is designed to facilitate maximum participation by all parties while ensuring that there is certainty in relation to the preferred course of action of each respondent.</p>  <p>  The guidance for submissions while requesting each respondent to clearly indicate their preferred course of action, importantly also provides an opportunity for the respondent to provide their own comments.  The process also allows respondents to indicate their connection to the former Mother &amp;amp; Baby Home, Tuam.  In addition to the collation of written submissions, consultation events will be held in Tuam and Dublin.  These events, which will be led by Restorative Dialogue Facilitators, will be designed to afford participants the opportunity to provide further input to the consultation process.</p>  <p>  The report on the consultation process to be submitted to the Inter-Departmental Group will be prepared by the Restorative Dialogue Facilitators based on the submissions received and the outcomes of the consultation events.  This report will be a factual account of the consultation process and will not contain any recommendations.  It will be a matter for the Inter-Departmental Group to consider the report and make appropriate recommendations for consideration by Government.</p>  <p>  I strongly encourage all interested parties to contribute their views to the process.  It is essential that all voices can be heard.</p></reply>

Following a competitive process, in October 2017 I announced the allocation of &euro;21.6 million to 281 projects in towns and villages across rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  A total of 15 projects were submitted to my Department by Galway Co. Council for consideration, and I awarded funding of over &euro;1 million to 13 of those projects.  No application in respect of Dunmore appears to have been submitted to my Department under the 2017 Town and Village Renewal scheme.</p>  <p>  However, I plan to launch another round of the Town and Village Renewal Scheme in 2018, with a continued focus on projects that will have a strong impact on supporting rural economies and improving the quality of life for people who live in rural towns and villages.  Full details of the scheme will be made available to all Local Authorities when the scheme is launched.</p></reply>

The scheme involves landholders as key participants in the provision of high quality walking trails, by contracting them to undertake maintenance work on sections of National Way Marked Ways and other priority walks that traverse their lands. The landholders receive modest payments for maintenance work undertaken, in line with agreed work plans.</p>  <p>  The scheme currently covers 39 trails, with payments made to approximately 1,900 landholders to maintain those trails.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government and the Action Plan for Rural Development include a commitment to increase the number of trails covered by the Walks Scheme and my officials are working towards this objective. I intend to initiate a comprehensive review of the scheme&rsquo;s operation this year in order to determine how best to expand the scheme and maximise the impact of the resources available to me.  This review will inform any decisions to be made regarding new walks to be included in the scheme.</p>  <p>  As significant consultation will be required with both landholders and other stakeholders, it is unlikely that any increase in the number of walks covered by the scheme will be implemented until late 2018 or early 2019.</p></reply>

The Programme Implementers in each area work with the elderly in their locality, once they fall within one of the SICAP target groups.  There are currently two Lot areas in which older people have been selected as an 'emerging needs group', that require a particular focus under the programme.</p>  <p>  The Revitalising Areas by Planning, Investment and Development (RAPID) programme provides funding for capital projects to improve the lives of residents in disadvantaged urban areas.  Projects funded under this programme specifically aimed at elderly in 2017 included providing meeting spaces and providing IT equipment for training.</p>  <p>  The Communities Facilities Scheme is targeted at both urban and rural areas and funds projects that seek to enhance communities, address disadvantage and improve social cohesion at a local level. Projects funded under this scheme specifically aimed at elderly in 2017 included purchasing equipment and furniture for use by painting and yoga groups and purchasing sports equipment like table tennis tables, basketball and bowling equipment.</p>  <p>  The SICAP, RAPID and CFS schemes are administered on my Department's behalf by Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) under the remit of the Local Authorities.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides core funding to national organisations in the community and voluntary sector through the Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO), including organisations that provide services to older people.  Additionally, through the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme, my Department provides funding for the development and improvement of recreational infrastructure all over Ireland - projects that support better access to recreational amenities for all citizens including elderly persons are welcome to apply for funding under the Scheme.  I expect to announce funding under the 2018 round of this scheme in the coming months.</p></reply>

Funding is available under the scheme towards the purchase by a registered community-based organisation of equipment i.e., a personal alarm and/or pendant, which is provided to the elderly person participating. The scheme is operated on my Department's behalf by Pobal.</p>  <p>  Following a review, a new version of the scheme was launched on 1st November 2017. A number of important new changes were introduced, including an extension of the eligibility criteria to include elderly people who live on their own for long periods during the day and the introduction of free monitoring for the first year, following which a small charge will apply. The amount of this charge will depend on the service provider and the type of alarm or pendant provided, but it is anticipated that it will be in the region of &euro;60 per annum.</p>  <p>  In tandem with the new scheme, a nationwide public awareness campaign is being rolled out, in partnership with Pobal, to encourage a greater level of awareness, interest and participation in the scheme.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to report a very high uptake of the new scheme which I have facilitated through the provision of additional funding. By end December 2017, over 21,000 applications had been approved and some 18,000 installations were made.

During the first phase, of 12 months duration, the PA provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work.  During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months.  In addition to these two phases jobseekers may also undertake training while with the service and this may extend the period the jobseeker is supported through the service for up to a further 6 months.</p>  <p>  As of the end of January 2018 some 4,298 clients in Donegal were engaged with the service, the total number of clients engaged on the same date in 2017 was 3,381.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Both schemes provide significant support to individuals so that they can work up to 3 days a week and still retain access to a reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  The 2018 Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes of &euro;2.17 billion.</p>  <p>  An Taoiseach, in his previous role as Minister for Social Protection, gave a commitment at D&aacute;il report stage of the Social Welfare Bill 2016 that he would ask officials to examine the issue of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the treatment of part-time and seasonal workers, including those categorised as having subsidiary employment.  It is important in the interests of equity and fairness that the conditions for receipt of a jobseekers payment apply to all recipients, including those who could be categorised as seasonal and part-time workers.</p>  <p>  My Department does operate a fast-tracking system for customers including seasonal workers who sign-off their jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit claim to take up work or a training course for a period of up to 12 weeks.  In these cases, the claim is not closed.  Rather, payment is suspended temporarily for the duration of the work or training course.  When the person signs on again after the period of work or training, the claim can be reactivated without delay and payment restored.</p>  <p>  My officials have recently completed a report on these issues which I will consider in detail.  My Department is also currently collating data in relation to those who qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and who are in subsidiary employment.  We will have 12 months of data gathered by May 2018 at which point I will be in a better position to make an informed decision on this issue.</p></reply>

The current proposal in Section 5 of the Social Welfare Bill does not change this.  That protection will remain if the legislative proposal is adopted.</p>  <p>  As the law currently stands, even if a card holder volunteers their PSC, a private sector organisation would be committing an offence by accepting it as they are not a &ldquo;specified body&rdquo;.  Customer feedback is that they should be allowed to volunteer the card to non-Specified Bodies if it suits them to do so, for the purposes of ID verification such as when signing up to a utility company contract or opening an account with a financial institution.  Customers often report that private companies insist on a State-issued photographic ID such as a Passport or Driver&rsquo;s License which they might not have and which are costly.  In contrast, the PSC is free of charge.</p>  <p>  Therefore the legislative proposal is that non-specified bodies that accept a PSC that is offered to them voluntarily by the holder should not be prosecuted or at risk of prosecution.  At the same time, such non-specified organisations should not be able to request or force a person to use their PSC &ndash; that would remain an offence.  In other words, the volunteering of the card is the critical issue.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, and for the sake of absolute clarity - this proposal in no way allows a private sector body to access the customer data on the card chip or on any government database - simply to view/accept the card as a form of identity and to stop it being an offence for them to accept it.</p>  <p>  This measure will be beneficial to holders of the PSC, most especially those who do not hold a driving licence or a passport.  It is their identity and as such the holder should be allowed to volunteer it if they so choose, even in a commercial situation.  Accordingly, I do not intend to review this piece of proposed legislation at this time.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Administration of the BTEA by my Department is aligned with the student support schemes under the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  The Allowance enables social welfare customers in receipt of certain payments to pursue full-time education courses and to continue to receive income support in the form of the BTEA, subject to the customer remaining eligible for a DSP payment.  In general, most customers will also have certain registration and related college fees paid by Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI).  Students participating in a multi-year course do not have to reapply for BTEA on commencing a subsequent academic year.  They are required to re-establish their entitlement to a qualifying payment at the beginning of each academic year and satisfy the Department that they remain in full time education.</p>  <p>  The operation of the BTEA has been comprehensively revised over the past two years, including the introduction of the cost of education allowance for participants with dependent children and the abolition of age-related payments for all participants.

The MIS is defined by the VPSJ as &ldquo;the gross income a household needs in order to reach their minimum essential standard of living&rdquo;.</p><p>The VPSJ&rsquo;s Minimum Essential Standard of Living 2017 (MESL) is derived from a negotiated consensus, based on focus groups with representative households, and discussions with policy-makers and experts.  According to the VPSJ, it is a standard of living which meets an individual's / household's physical, psychological and social needs, calculated by identifying the goods and services required by different household types in order to meet these minimum needs.  The costs incorporate factors such as food, clothing, personal care, health, household goods, household services, communications, social inclusion, education, fuel, transport, personal costs, insurance, savings and contingencies.</p><p>The model developed by the VPSJ produces a minimum income standard which is dependent on whether the household is, among other factors: (i) in a rural or urban location; (ii) composed of a single working age person, a couple, a single- or two-parent family, a single pensioner or a pensioner couple; and (iii) living in private rented accommodation, social housing or is an owner-occupier.</p><p>It should be noted that the MESL for welfare households assumes that households are eligible for a medical card, and as such, health and insurance costs are reduced accordingly, although the cost of over-the-counter medicines and prescription charges remain.  While the model assumes that pensioners have the Free Travel pass and the Household Benefits package, it does not assume this for working age people.  It should be noted that certain working age recipients of welfare payments do qualify for Free Travel &ndash; all recipients of Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, for example.</p><p>The costing outlined below is based on the following assumptions: (i) The minimum income standards used for the costings are those for urban locations; (ii) Housing costs are not taken into account as these are provided for separately in the model and vary significantly depending on a household&rsquo;s circumstances.  It should be noted that weekly welfare payments do not vary depending on housing types or costs.  A range of schemes, such as Rent Supplement, the Housing Assistance Payment, Rental Accommodation Scheme and the differential rent scheme are available to assist with certain types of housing costs.</p><p>The Minimum Income figures used in this costing are from the Minimum Essential Standard of Living 2017<i></i>(the latest publication available) and its Appendices.  The costs are based on 2018 estimated recipient numbers.</p><p>Children</p><p>The cost of a child in 2017 varies depending on the child&rsquo;s age, according to VPSJ research (Appendix 3A).  The VPSJ research places the weekly cost of an infant at &euro;81.09, a pre-school child at &euro;49.19, a child in primary school at &euro;81.77 and a child in secondary school at &euro;129.27.  These costs comprise of food, clothing, household goods, health, social inclusion, transport, education, etc.  The costs do not include childcare.</p><p>For the purposes of this costing exercise, a weighted average increase was calculated (based on the CSO&rsquo;s 2017 estimated population distribution by age, which is the most recent available).  Taking into account the value of the qualified child increase (&euro;31.80 per week from March 2018), child benefit (&euro;140 per month) and Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance where appropriate (&euro;125 or &euro;250 per annum, depending on the age of the child), an average increase of &euro;21.22 (rounded up to &euro;21.30 per week) is required to the qualified child increase to bring the payment in line with the VSPJ&rsquo;s direct cost of a child.</p><p>The cost of increasing the qualified child increase by &euro;21.30 per week is &euro;393.57 million in a full year.  This includes the cost of increasing the Back to Work Family Dividend which is linked to the rate of the qualified child increase (&euro;15.18 million).</p><p>Working Age</p><p>The VPSJ research finds that the minimum income standard (MIS) for a single working age adult with no children is &euro;214.69 per week (Appendix 4A).  For the costing, all weekly working age personal rates were increased to &euro;214.70 per week.  The monetary increase varies depending on the current weekly personal rate. It should be noted that the value of increases such as the Living Alone Allowance and supplementary payments, where relevant, such as the Household Benefits Package, Fuel Allowance, and Free Travel, have not been taken into account in this costing.</p><p>The MIS for a working age couple with no children is &euro;327.96 (Appendix 4A), which is an increase of &euro;113.27 from the single person&rsquo;s rate.  From March 2018, the general increase for a working age qualified adult is &euro;131.40 per week.  Accordingly, the qualified adult rate was not changed in this costing.</p><p>The cost of increasing all working age personal payments to &euro;214.70 per week is &euro;590.74 million in a full year.  It should be noted that this cost also includes increasing the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance age-related reduced rates to &euro;214.70 per week, at a total cost of &euro;113.37 million in a full year.</p><p>Pensioners</p><p>The MIS for a single pensioner is &euro;216.38 and for a pensioner couple is &euro;261.73 (Appendix 6A).  Accordingly, there are no welfare increases required to reach the MIS for pensioners as current welfare payments are in excess of the MIS for this group.</p></reply>

It provides part-time temporary work in local communities, as a stepping-stone back to employment.  However, it is important to note that these placements are not full-time sustainable jobs and are designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the labour market or getting a job for the first time.  The Deputy will appreciate that the welcome reduction in the unemployment rate is a factor in recruitment to all programmes.

The valuable work carried out by employees and volunteers working in CIS services and employees of MABS services will continue as heretofore.  The staff and boards throughout the CIS and MABS networks have been assured by CIB that there will be no change to the terms and conditions of staff, no diminution of services for those who use them and no closure of service delivery points.</p>  <p>  I am aware that there has been opposition to the Board&rsquo;s decision by a small number of objectors as these have been raised in the D&aacute;il and at meetings of the Joint Oireachtas Committee (JOC) on Employment Affairs and Social Protection in the wake of the decision.  I am also aware of the Cost Benefit Analysis on the new regional company model which was provided by CIB to the JOC on 21 September 2017 and which indicates strong support for the decision of the Board to proceed to implement the new governance arrangements.</p>  <p>  The governance structure of the CIS and MABS network is a matter for the Board of CIB.  As a statutory body, the Board has the sole right to make decisions on its day to day operations as it sees fit.  The Board is clear that this change is necessary so that CIB, and the delivery services it funds, adequately meet the requirements of the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies and the compliance requirements of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, given the significant level of taxpayers money involved.  </p>  <p>  The aim of this change by the Board of CIB is to improve the effectiveness of the control environment, financial management and governance of CIS and MABS networks, which are 100% State-funded.  It is also about consolidating managerial and administrative efforts, focussing on front line service delivery to citizens, improving the consistency and quality of service delivery and, where possible, extending services for those who rely on them.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

One of the PRSI conditions is that a person must have a minimum of 39 reckonable contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year.  Claims made in 2017 are governed by the 2015 tax year and only PRSI Classes A, E, H, and P are reckonable for IB purposes.</p>  <p>  The person concerned made a claim for IB and this claim was registered in my Department on 13 November 2017.  The person concerned was written to on 8 February 2018 requesting further details with regard to permission to take up employment in this country.  On receipt of this information, the claim can be considered further.</p>  <p>  However, the Deputy should note that according to my Departments records, the person concerned has no reckonable PRSI contributions and just 2 credits for the 2015 year.  If the person concerned feels that they should have more contributions in 2015 they should submit information on their employment and the matter will be investigated further.  It is possible that the person concerned may qualify for IB in 2018, based on their contributions in 2016, once the question of permission to take up employment has been satisfied.</p>  <p>  If the person concerned is unable to meet their needs or the needs of their household, they may be entitled to Supplementary Welfare Allowance which is a means-tested payment.  They should contact their local Intreo Centre in this regard. </p>  <p>  The PRSI contribution conditions governing entitlement to IB are statutory and cannot be either waived or modified in any particular case.   </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Community Employment (CE) schemes, provides part-time employment and training opportunities in local communities for people in receipt of a Social Welfare payment, including long-term unemployment payments as a stepping stone back to employment.  It is important to note that Community Employment, does not, nor is it intended to, provide full-time sustainable employment.</p>  <p>  Jobseekers can only participate with one activation scheme or service at a time; this is to allow the scheme and service providers time to work with the participants and also to ensure that the best use is made of the available places.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the Rural Social Scheme (RSS), it provides opportunities for low income farmers and fishermen who are currently in receipt of specified social welfare payments and actively engaged with the farming or fishing industry to work to provide certain services of benefit to rural communities.  </p>  <p>  The current selection process for the JobPath service excludes those jobseekers categorised as self-employed including those actively farming or fishing, with the result that most jobseekers eligible for RSS are not referred to the JobPath service.  However in a small number of cases where self-employment had not been identified jobseekers were referred.  If self-employment is subsequently verified by the Department, it is then open to the person to opt to leave the JobPath service. </p>  <p>  Customers on the Jobpath service receive intensive individual support and assistance to help them to overcome barriers to employment.  A Jobseeker who is currently engaged with the JobPath service is eligible to apply for a placement with RSS once the relevant qualifying conditions are satisfied and a suitable opportunity is available to the client.    </p>  <p>  At the end of the 52 weeks with the JobPath service, if a client has not been successful in finding suitable employment, they will have the facility available to them, subject to assessment and suitability, to apply for and access Community Employment and other activations supports provided by my Department. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

One of the purposes of the proposed new section 18 is to prohibit zero hour contracts in most circumstances. </p>  <p>  The University of Limerick (UL) in its study on the prevalence of zero hour contracts and low hour contracts among Irish employers found that zero hour contracts as defined within current Irish employment rights legislation are not extensively used in Ireland.  It found low working hours can arise in different forms in employment contracts, such as regular part-time contracts with fixed hours or a contract with &ldquo;If and when&rdquo; hours only or a hybrid of the two.</p>  <p>  While I am not in a position to estimate the number of existing workers that would see a change in their contracts as a result of the new section 18, I am confident that this and the other measures proposed in the Bill will significantly improve the employment protections for employees on less secure employment arrangements.  The Bill is scheduled for Second Stage in the D&aacute;il this week and I look forward to working with colleagues on all sides of both Houses of the Oireachtas in progressing the Bill as expeditiously as possible. </p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by almost 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approximately 902,000 customers with direct eligibility to free travel with an annual allocation of &euro;90 million.  The scheme is available to all people aged over 66 living permanently in the State.  To qualify for the scheme, applicants who are under age 66 must be in receipt of a qualifying payment.  These are invalidity pension, blind pension, disability allowance, carer&rsquo;s allowance or an equivalent social security payment from a country covered by EC Regulations or one with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement.</p>  <p>  Domiciliary care allowance is a monthly payment of &euro;309.50 to the carer of a child with a disability.  The allowance may be used for the additional costs involved in caring for the child and this may include additional transport costs.  </p>  <p>  There are currently 35,759 recipients of domiciliary care allowance.  Of that number, 17,938 are also in receipt of carers allowance and therefore would already have a free travel pass.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-02-13a.1750.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018021300085#WRCC05600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 647 to 650, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  A policy to introduce the Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to pensions calculation was adopted by Government in the National Pensions Framework in 2010, as was the decision to base the entitlements of all new pensioners on this approach from around 2020.  The move to such a system has been signalled, therefore, for a significant period of time.</p>  <p>  As was understood at that time, and as underlined in the sentence the Deputy refers to from the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, some people are paid a higher rate under the Yearly Average system, and some will be paid a higher rate under the Total Contributions Approach.  If everyone was paid the same amount under the new system as they were under the old one, there would be little point in such a reform, and if everyone was paid either the same or more, it would add to the sustainability challenges already faced by the State pension system.  However, past and future trends show that these challenges are going to place ever-increasing burdens in the coming years on workers who fund State pensions through the PRSI system.  The proposed new TCA system strikes a balance between recognising periods outside the paid workforce while emphasising the need to maximise the paid element in the contribution conditions for pensions.</p>  <p>  In 1997, expenditure on state pensions was IR&pound;1.35 billion.  However, by 2017 the cost of state pensions had increased to &euro;7.27 billion.  After adjusting for inflation, the cost had nearly trebled in real terms over a period of just 20 years, despite reforms made in that time.  As the Actuarial Review the Deputy refers to pointed out, despite increases in the State pension age legislated for in 2021 and 2028, the ratio of workers to pensioners is projected to decline from 4.9 in 2015, to 2.9 in 2035, and to 2.0 by 2055.  </p>  <p>  While 2055 may seem far away to some, most of today&rsquo;s workers will be in receipt of the State pension at that point, and I would hope that some current pensioners may still be in payment, and so we all have a stake in ensuring the system is sustainable to that date and beyond.</p>  <p>  The TCA model proposed for post-2020 pensioners has yet to be decided upon, as the Government proposal will not be finalised until after a public consultation later this year.  There are a number of factors, not just the number of years required for a full pension, which influence outcomes, and I will consider very carefully the priorities identified by stakeholders in that consultation process.  Again, although the model and associated legislation hasn&rsquo;t been finalised, it is my intention that it will be possible for Home-Caring credits to be allocated in the same year as paid contributions, where appropriate.  </p>  <p>  The TCA model being made available for post-2012 pensioners (up to 2019) is based on 40 years, but has very significant Home-caring provisions, much more beneficial than those in the 2010 proposals, that make it more advantageous for most of those disadvantaged by the Yearly Average approach.  Take, for example, a pensioner with 18 years PRSI contributions, and who also spent 18 years in the home raising their children before 1994.  Under the Yearly Average system, that person might have received a 75% pension before 2012, or a 65% pension if they retired post-2012.  Under the 30-year model proposed under the National Pensions Framework and announced in 2010, they would qualify for a 60% pension.  However, under the TCA model being made available to post-2012 pensioners, despite it being based on a 40-year model, they could qualify for a 90% pension, as a result of the recognition given to her home-caring periods.</p>  <p>  There are others who would not benefit, and who would attract a higher payment under the current approach.  For example, under the Yearly Average approach, someone who has already built up substantial state and private pensions in another country before moving to Ireland in their mid-50s, can built up a maximum rate pension in Ireland also, with just 10 years of contributions.  This is clearly inequitable compared to the previous example, and while such people will continue to have access to the means-tested State pension (non-contributory) if they need it, which can be paid at up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate, their SPC entitlement will be lower under TCA than it would be at present.  </p>  <p>  It is through making savings from elimination of such anomalies that it is possible to improve benefits for those who, to date, have had insufficient recognition of their contributions in and out of the home.</p>  <p>  I want to clarify, in response to one of the Deputies specific questions that there has not been any change to the State pension (contributory) in terms of means testing.  As before, where someone has a SPC entitlement, they will be entitled to at least that amount, regardless of their means.  They will also continue to have access to the alternative of the State pension (non-contributory), which is means tested, if that SPC entitlement is lower, and they will be paid whichever is the higher amount.  This is not a change. </p>  <p>  The importance of this safety net is crucial, and the level it is set at clearly informs policy regarding other schemes such as contributory pensions.  However I have seen it misleadingly claimed in recent months that some pensioners are expected to live on &euro;155 weekly, or less, even where they have no other means aside from the State pension.  Such claims cause anxiety for many approaching pension age, and it is important for those with very few contributions, and with minimum additional means, to be assured that they will have an adequate pension in old age.  Data from CSO and Eurostat show that the state pension system has been very successful in this regard, and demonstrate that a person of pension age in Ireland is considerably less likely to be in poverty than those of working age, who currently fund the system through their PRSI contributions and their taxes.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) which has statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.  </p>  <p>  In relation to pre-connection applications for sewerage and water services, the position is that these are operational matters for Irish Water, subject to independent oversight by the CRU as appropriate.  </p>  <p>  An important aspect of the CRU&rsquo;s work is ensuring that Irish Water&rsquo;s revenue is spent appropriately to improve services for customers.  To facilitate this, in November 2016 the CRU (formerly known as the Commission for Energy Regulation) outlined a framework of 19 key performance metrics against which it would monitor Irish Water&rsquo;s performance and progress over time.  The metrics cover customer service, environmental performance, quality of service for water supply, security of water supply and sewerage service.  Monitoring Irish Water&rsquo;s performance relative to these metrics will facilitate an evaluation by the CRU of the utility&rsquo;s performance.  It also ensures that transparent data becomes available to customers through the publication of performance data. </p>  <p>  If Deputies have any queries on specific issues in relation to water services Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

Proposals for individual solar farm developments are subject to the statutory requirements of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, in the same manner as other proposed developments.  Planning applications are made to the relevant local planning authority with a right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p>  <p>  Under the Planning and Development Act, each planning authority's development plan must set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned.  Section 10 of the Act requires a development plan to include, inter alia, objectives for the provision or facilitation of the provision of infrastructure, including energy facilities, and many local authorities have developed renewable energy strategies for their areas in this context.</p>  <p>  In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities and the Board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the local development plan, any submissions or observations received and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any relevant guidelines issued by my Department.  Planning authorities must then make their own decisions based on the specific merits or otherwise of individual planning applications.  </p>  <p>  Under section 30 of the Act, I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any case with which a planning authority or the Board is or may be involved. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the planning code is sufficiently robust to facilitate the assessment of individual planning permission applications for solar farm developments.  However, the matter is being kept under review, in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, and his Department - which leads on renewable energy policy - in the context of the Government's White Paper on Energy Policy, published in December 2015, the development of a Renewable Electricity Policy and Development Framework, as well as the finalisation of a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS).  Where further specific planning advice or guidance is warranted, I will work with Minister Naughten and his Department in developing such guidance.</p>  <p>  Matters relating to the proposed new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) are the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment.</p></reply>

For certain projects, including Transport Infrastructure Ireland projects, housing capital projects, local enterprise initiatives and landfill remediation work, central funding can be availed of to fund the costs of additional staff.</p>  <p>  The funding system for local authorities is a complex one, as authorities derive their income from a variety of sources including commercial rates, charges for goods and services, Local Property Tax (LPT) as well as funding from Government Departments and other bodies.  The purpose for which discretionary income is used is a matter for the elected members of the local authority. Elected members have direct responsibility in law for all reserved functions of the authority, which includes adopting the annual budget.  Accordingly, it is a matter for each local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources. </p>  <p>  Local retention of LPT began in 2015 and is now established as an important source of funding for the local government sector, thereby reducing reliance on central funding. In accordance with decisions taken by Government regarding the distribution of LPT, every local authority has a minimum level of funding available to it, known as the baseline.  There are variances across the country in terms of LPT levels but it is important that all local authorities receive at least this baseline level of funding to ensure they can deliver services.  For 2017 onwards, an upward adjustment was made to the LPT baseline of each local authority, to include an additional amount equivalent to the Pension Related Deduction (PRD) income retained by local authorities in 2014. The inclusion of PRD in increased LPT funding baselines helps protect local authority income in the future.  It means that, from 2017 onwards, local authorities do not retain PRD locally, thus reversing the previous approach.  This was designed to negate the effects of declining PRD income being retained by local authorities from 2016 onwards as a consequence of the implementation of National pay agreements.</p>  <p>  Commercial rates account for over a third of local authority income.  The Government has decided to proceed with legislation to improve the administration of commercial rates, which will enable local authorities to achieve higher rates of collection and lower levels of arrears and debt, leading to increases in locally generated revenue.</p>  <p>  My Department works with all local authorities to ensure the local government sector can meet existing and emerging challenges.  Matters relating to LPT allocation methods and baselines for future years will be reviewed as necessary and appropriate. All such funding issues have to be considered within the parameters of the national fiscal and budgetary situation and the competing priorities presenting themselves at wider Governmental level.</p></reply>

The Act provides that a licence may be granted to remove beach material, including seaweed.  Any licence granted would be temporary in nature.  The Foreshore Act does not include any mechanism under which harvesting rights may be sold to any third party.</p>  <p>  In my reply to the Deputy in September last I advised that the named company has applied for a licence to harvest wild seaweed.  During the course of assessing this and a number of other similar applications, it became clear that certain rights to harvest seaweed exist.  My Department is in the process of ascertaining, with the assistance of the Attorney General, the legal interface and relationship between these traditional harvesting rights and the current applications. </p>  <p>  These applications, most of which are by companies, are effectively on hold until such time as my Department is in a position to bring clarity to the regulatory regime applying to the harvesting of wild seaweed.  At that point the applications on hand will come before me for determination.  Work on this complex legal issue is continuing and I hope to have made substantial progress on the matter by April this year. </p></reply>

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act.  In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income.  A number of income sources, including certain social welfare payments, are disregarded for the purposes of determining reckonable income.  The list of income disregards includes carer&rsquo;s allowance, as it is deemed not to be long-term in nature (when compared to the term over which the property is bought).</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment given in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, a review of the first 12 months of the Tenant Purchase Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken.

Since the enactment of the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act 1989, underpinned by subsequent legislation, each fire authority, as an employer, has a statutory duty to avoid placing employees at risk.</p>  <p>  A full time firefighter is statutorily required to retire at age 55 under the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004.  This retirement age is set at 55 due to the physically demanding nature of the fire-fighter role. </p>  <p>  The retirement age for retained fire fighters is 55 with an extended period to age 58 subject to a formal application process including a compulsory medical assessment. </p>  <p>  A collective agreement was reached between the Local Government Management Services Board and the trade unions involved (SIPTU and ATGWU) in November 2002.  This collective agreement provided, inter alia, for the appointment of an Expert Group which in turn would advise as to the retirement age for retained firefighters. The Expert Group's Report on Retirement Age recommended that the retirement age for retained firefighters remain at 55, with provision for an annual extension, subject to medical assessment, up to 58 years of age. Following the report of the Expert Group published in April 2003, a circular was issued by my Department in November 2003 setting out the age requirements in relation to retained firefighters in line with the Expert Report.</p>  <p>  In general, any changes proposed by either management or unions are negotiated using the established Industrial Relations processes.  In this regard, the matter of increasing the retirement age for firefighters was included as part of recent discussions on a wide range of issues at the Workplace Relations Commission, between the Local Government Management Agency (representing the employers) and SIPTU.</p>  <p>  I understand that these discussions are at a preliminary stage and therefore I am unable to give an indication as to when these discussions will be completed or the likely outcome.</p></reply>

A similar service began operating in Cork City in 2017.</p>  <p>  In order to further assist homeless households in exiting emergency accommodation the Homeless HAP Place Finder Service is now available in each of the 31 local authorities.  All local authorities are now being provided with the options to pay deposits and advance rental payments for any households in emergency homeless accommodation, in order to secure accommodation via the HAP scheme. </p>  <p>  From available data, at the end of Q4 2017, approximately 22% of the total number of households being supported by HAP were benefitting from the additional flexibility that was provided to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limits. When the additional discretion available to homeless households in the Dublin Region is removed, 16.7% of households nationally were benefitting from the additional flexibility. In those cases, the average rate of discretionary payment being applied was 15.7% above rent limits provided. In the case of Cork City Council, at the end of Q4, 2017, 34.3% of households had benefitted from additional discretion with the average rate being 14% above the rent limits provided.</p>  <p>  My Department and I are constantly monitoring HAP data, as well as other key information relating to the private rental market. Indications are that the current HAP rent limits and the flexibility to exceed those rent limits provide local authorities with sufficient capacity to assist households in securing rented accommodation that meets their needs. Increasing the HAP rent limits in particular local authority areas could have further inflationary effects on the private rented sector, which could have a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support.</p>  <p>  In cases where a tenant, currently on a local authority waiting list, wishes to access rented accommodation with HAP support in another local authority area, I have directed local authorities to provide that HAP tenants continue to be dealt with by their originating local authority. However, the rent limits will be those that apply in the local authority where the property is situated. The originating local authority will engage with the relevant new local authority to facilitate eligible requests for inter-authority movement. Where homeless households have sourced or been assisted by the Place Finder Service in sourcing accommodation outside the Dublin area, the relevant rate of support is based on the rent limits that apply in the local authority where the property is situated. The DRHE have been advised to consult with the new local authority in relation to the appropriate level of support that should be provided. However, the Place Finder Service can still pay a deposit and rent in advance on behalf of the tenant.</p>  <p>  In order to maintain the equitable treatment of all housing applicants, inter-authority movement for HAP applicants is based on the current social housing eligibility income bands, i.e. movement will only be facilitated across local authorities with income bands that are equal or higher; or where shared areas of choice are already operated.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied with how the HAP scheme is currently operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under Rebuilding Ireland. My Department will, of course, continue to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

The RLS was established on a pilot basis in Waterford and Carlow local authorities in October 2016 and expanded nationwide from 23 February 2017. </p>  <p>  The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant dwellings who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their dwellings up to the required standard for rental property. Subject to the suitability of the dwelling for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met upfront by the local authority or an approved housing body (AHB). </p>  <p>  Provisional 2017 outputs, across the range of delivery methods available to local authorities and approved housing bodies, were published on 15 January 2018 and are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p>  <p>  www.housing.gov.ie/housing/rebuilding-ireland/social-housing-delivery-2017-ministers-statement.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently validating data from local authorities in order to report detailed progress by local authority on the RLS in the final quarter of 2017. This will be published shortly. However, I can confirm that at the end of 2017, a total of 820 applications had been received under the scheme. Local authorities were engaging with the property owners in relation to 573 properties, 31 agreements for lease had been signed and 9 homes had been delivered and tenanted. A detailed breakdown of the RLS scheme data up to end Q3 2017 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p>  <p>  www.housing.gov.ie/housing/social-housing/social-and-affordble/overall-social-housing-provision.</p>  <p>  While my Department is currently finalising detailed output data across each of the social housing delivery programmes in 2017, it is already clear that the RLS has not yet delivered the level of new social housing homes envisaged. I have reviewed the operation of the scheme, as part of the review of Rebuilding Ireland, and I have concluded that the scheme has significant potential but there are areas where it can be improved to make it more attractive and effective. At the Housing Summit held on 22 January 2018, local authority Chief Executives were advised that, from 1 February 2018, a number of key changes are being made to the scheme. These include:</p>  <p>  -  a reduction in the minimum lease term required from 10 to 5 years;</p>  <p>  -  increasing the proportion of market rent available to property owners where they take on more responsibilities under the tenancy, meaning that up to 92% of market rent will be available; and</p>  <p>  -  provision of additional funding for property owners, over and above the current &euro;40,000 limit, where the dwelling is a bedsit type dwelling being brought into compliance with the Standards for Rented Houses Regulations and made available for social housing. </p>  <p>  In total, my Department spent &euro;196,385 on the Repair and Leasing Scheme in 2017. I am making &euro;32 million available for the scheme in 2018 and I expect local authorities and approved housing bodies to continue to implement the scheme locally and to achieve the target of 800 new properties this year.</p></reply>

The review involved discussions with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, the representative body of the group water sector.  Discussions concluded in December, when I approved revised subsidy levels.  The new subsidy arrangements, endorsed by a special delegate conference of the Federation on 13 December 2017, came into effect on 1 January 2018.</p>  <p>  The changes implement the recommendation contained in the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services (JOCFFDWS), endorsed by both Houses of the Oireachtas in April 2017, that there be equity of treatment and equivalent financial support between households using public water services and those availing of private water services. The subsidy scheme is demand-led and available to all eligible group water schemes irrespective of county location.  </p>  <p>  The revised subsidy levels are as follows:</p>  <p>  1) For the annual subsidy towards the operation and maintenance costs of group water schemes providing a supply of water for domestic purposes (known as &lsquo;Subsidy A&rsquo;): </p>  <p>  The maximum subsidy per house in private group water schemes has increased from &euro;140 per household to &euro;231. An increased maximum subsidy of &euro;281 per household is available for small schemes of less than 100 houses that are willing, in the interests of providing in the long-term a more sustainable water supply to their members, to progress towards rationalisation or amalgamation with other schemes.</p>  <p>  The maximum subsidy per house for public group water schemes has increased from &euro;70 per household to &euro;115.  These are schemes that supply their members with water that is provided by Irish Water.</p>  <p>  The portion of costs than can be recouped by group water schemes has also increased.  Typically up to 60% of costs have been covered by the subsidy payments.  This has increased to 85%.  There are also changes and simplifications to how these costs are assessed.</p>  <p>  2) For the additional subsidy that is paid towards the costs of group water schemes that have long-term Operation and Maintenance Contracts (for example, as part of a Design Build Operate project) for the delivery of water (known as &lsquo;Subsidy B)&rsquo;: </p>  <p>  There has been an increase in the level of volumetric costs incurred by group water schemes operating under these contracts that is recoupable, from 60% to 85%.  This will allow for a greater portion of costs to be included within the subsidy payment.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above, my Department is currently finalising proposals to increase the level of grant support for users of private wells, details of which I will be announcing shortly. </p>  <p>  Separate to the initial review of group water scheme subsidy levels and also in fulfilment of the JOCFFDWS recommendations, I will shortly be establishing a working group to conduct a wider review of investment needs in rural water services. The review will focus on issues such as governance, supervision and monitoring of the sector, and capital investment requirements.  It is anticipated that this group would engage with relevant stakeholders and will aim to complete its work by mid-2018.</p>  <p>  Cognisance will be taken in this regard of any required measures to support the implementation of the finalised River Basin Management Plan 2018-2021, which I plan to finalise and publish early this year.</p></reply>

The Act provides for the discontinuance of water charges for domestic customers and a threshold of free water supply for domestic households.</p>  <p>  In respect of non-domestic water use, the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013, as amended, provides that Irish Water shall collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) and the CRU has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.  With effect from 1 January 2014, Irish Water is responsible for public water services.  All non-domestic customers were transferred to Irish Water under the existing charging regime of each local authority with no changes, as instructed by the CRU.</p>  <p>  From 2001, national water pricing policy required local authorities to recover the costs of providing water services from all non-domestic users of these services. This policy provided for charges based on actual metered consumption and is consistent with the requirements of the Water Framework Directive.  The existing arrangements for all non-domestic customers are remaining in place with no changes for the time being.</p>  <p>  I understand that the CRU is conducting a review of all aspects of non-domestic water tariffs and in conjunction with Irish Water will establish an enduring non-domestic tariff framework. Information Notes are published by the CRU from time to time to inform and update stakeholders on the broad approach being pursued and setting out the proposed timeframe for the overall project and outlining details of papers to be published by the CRU for public consultation and corresponding timelines.</p></reply>

A list of the 74 proposals submitted is set out in the table below.

The map also includes details of some 300 hectares of land in ownership of other State or semi-State bodies, with the potential to deliver a further 7,500 homes. All of the mapped sites can be viewed at the following link: .</p><p>A new Affordable Purchase Scheme is being introduced. It will be governed by the relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which will be commenced shortly. It will be targeted at households with annual gross income below &euro;50,000 for a single applicant or &euro;75,000 for joint applicants. The maximum discount permissible under the Act is 40% and the sale prices will vary, depending on costs, the discount given and other relevant factors.  </p><p>Once the relevant legislative provisions are commenced, I will develop detailed regulations covering the operation of the Scheme, including the full eligibility criteria. The elected members of each local authority will then determine the order of priority for the sale of affordable homes to eligible households. </p><p>In addition, I am providing funding of &euro;25 million over 2018 and 2019 for a targeted programme, where the local authority will make low-cost serviced sites available for affordable housing, within the parameters of the overall affordable purchase scheme that will be set down in Regulations.  My Department is currently drawing up the criteria for access to this fund, taking account of broader policy on affordable housing, and will be seeking submissions from local authorities in the coming weeks.</p><p>The Government is also determined to make affordable cost rental a major part of the Irish housing system. Under this approach, rents are set at levels to recover construction costs and to facilitate the management and administration of developments. Accepting that this innovative concept will take time to test and deliver, a pilot cost rental project is currently being progressed in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, in conjunction with the Housing Agency and Approved Housing Bodies, on publicly-owned land. The pilot project is providing significant lessons to the State in terms of the delivery of cost rental and in parallel, discussions are ongoing with the European Investment Bank regarding experiences in delivering cost rental and other affordable models in other jurisdictions that could also work in Ireland.  </p><p>The delivery of additional affordable homes, to buy or rent, will rely on the State developing the full potential of its residential land bank. In the context of my Department's role in driving and co-ordinating housing delivery, I am establishing a dedicated Residential Land Management and Development Group to oversee this important work. </p><p>I anticipate that there is significant potential for the delivery of affordable homes on local authority lands. Following on from the Housing Summit on 22 January, I have asked local authority Chief Executives to submit, in the coming weeks, an outline of their respective affordable housing programmes, with a particular emphasis on Dublin, Galway and Cork, where there is the greatest affordability gap. The overall scale of delivery, and timescales, will be informed by these responses.</p></reply>

However, the range of supports put in place under the Plan is primarily focused on helping those households most in need of support in meeting their housing costs and, therefore, social housing and addressing homelessness have been the key priorities. </p>  <p>  Similarly, insofar as mortgage holders are concerned, the priority has been to provide supports for those borrowers experiencing most difficulty in meeting their mortgage repayments.  In that regard, I refer to the reply to Question No. 149 to the Minister for Finance on today's Order Paper.  In addition, for those homeowners whose mortgage position is unsustainable, there are two Mortgage to Rent schemes in place, one for homeowners with mortgages from a private financial institutions and the second for those with a local authority mortgage, under which an Approved Housing Body or the relevant local authority can take over ownership of the home, while the household is allowed to remain in their home as a social housing tenant.</p></reply>

The current number of MEPs in the European Parliament is 750 plus the President with each Member State having between 6 and 96 Members.</p>  <p>  Council Decision 2013/312/EU provided that it would be revised again in advance of the 2019-2024 parliamentary term upon an initiative of the European Parliament to be presented before the end of 2016.  The launch of this process was, however, postponed by the European Parliament&rsquo;s Committee on Constitutional Affairs (i.e. the AFCO Committee) until after the referendum in the United Kingdom on its withdrawal from the European Union.</p>  <p>  On 7 September 2017, a draft report on the composition of the European Parliament for 2019-2024 was published by the AFCO Committee.  This draft report was adopted, with some amendments, at a plenary meeting of the AFCO Committee on 23 January 2018.  In broad terms, the revised report adopted proposes, among other things, that:</p>  <p>  -  when the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union becomes legally effective, 27 of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s 73 seats would be re-distributed among 14 Member States, of which 2 would go to Ireland, increasing Ireland&rsquo;s MEPs from 11 to 13 in number.  This would mean a reduction in the overall size of the European Parliament from 751 to 705 members; </p>  <p>  -  however, if the date on which the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union becomes legally effective takes place after the European Parliament elections are held in May/June 2019, the number of MEPs to be elected from each Member State for the 2019-2024 parliamentary term would remain the same as that of the current parliament.  The additional seats would only be filled on the date after which the United Kingdom's withdrawal becomes legally effective.</p>  <p>  These proposals were approved at a plenary of the European Parliament on 7 February 2018. My Department understands that it will now be put to the European Council for a unanimous decision, and then returned to Parliament for a final vote.  </p>  <p>  In the event that Ireland&rsquo;s total number of seats in the European Parliament is changed in respect of the 2019-2024 parliamentary term, it will be necessary to review our European constituency arrangements.  Section 5(1A) of the Electoral Act 1997 makes provision for the establishment of a committee to make a report in relation to European Parliament constituencies.

The Film Board supports writers, directors and production companies across these sectors by providing investment loans for the development, production and distribution of film, television and animation projects. Production funding is only available to Irish production companies with the focus on supporting Irish creative talent. Therefore all films have significant Irish production content and the Film Board does not categorise its films as "indigenous" or "foreign". Of course, given the nature of the film industry many films  also include an element of co-production with other States.</p>  <p>  Whether a film makes a financial return is dependent on a range of factors including the nature of the funding sources and terms and conditions attaching to it. The IFB provides limited recourse production loans to Irish production companies. This means that if the film achieves a certain level of commercial success the IFB participates in a share of the revenue from that success.  The amount that the IFB recoups on an annual basis from those films it supported is published in its Annual Reports which are available on its website www.irishfilmboard.ie/about/ifb-annual-reports. </p></reply>

A further two projects were funded under the Structures at Risk Fund to a value of &euro;59,000.  The funding related to churches, houses and thatched structures.  The closing date for 2018 applications under both schemes has now passed and the assessment process is underway.  The successful projects will be announced in due course.</p><p>A total of 22 National Monuments are in State care in Co. Louth, including St Laurence&rsquo;s Gate.  Data in relation to the numbers of heritage sites in the care of the local authority or otherwise are not held by my Department.  Funding for the upkeep of National Monuments in State care is provided through the Office of Public Works (OPW) which maintains approximately 1,000 structures on 768 sites nationwide.  I am advised by the OPW that the funding is not allotted on a county basis and the overall national outturn and allocation figures for 2017 and 2018, respectively, are set out in the following table. <table><tr><th></th><th>&euro;'000<br /><br />2017 Outturn</th><th>&euro;'000<br /><br />2018 Provision</th></tr><tr><td>National Monuments <br /><br />(Includes maintenance personnel pay, works and materials costs, utilities, etc.) </td><td>15,932</td><td>15,487</td></tr><tr><td>Visitor Services<br /><br />(Includes costs of presentation, guide staff pay, advertising, website, etc.)</td><td>9,583</td><td>9,308</td></tr></table></p><p>St. Laurence's Gate is a National Monument in the guardianship of the State and as such it is maintained and managed by OPW; it is owned by Louth County Council.  Funding for the upkeep of the monument is provided through the relevant allocations set out in the table.  My Department has been advised by OPW that, while it is generally satisfied from a conservation point of view that the monument is in reasonable order, there are some structural issues that need to be addressed.  Though they do not represent an imminent threat, OPW state that the issues must be dealt with before any long term decisions are made about the future use of the Gate.  The necessary corrective works will be undertaken as resources allow.  In the meantime, OPW personnel monitor the structure on a regular basis and routine maintenance needs are dealt with as they arise.</p><p>St. Laurence&rsquo;s Gate is a particularly striking structure and a significant local landmark, being a remnant of the former town walls and dating from the 13th century.  I am aware that there is significant interest in having it opened to the public.  Before the local authority closed the arch to vehicular traffic, visitors could only be admitted on an occasional basis or for special events when OPW provided personnel to supervise access to and within the monument in order to comply with health and safety requirements.  However, I understand that OPW also intends to carry out a detailed assessment of the interior of the monument to establish the areas that can be accessed safely and to plot those parts of the structure where regular visitor access may be facilitated in future.</p></reply>
