The NTA's Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016-2035 provides a framework for the planning and delivery of transport infrastructure and services over the next two decades. </p>  <p>  The GDA Strategy proposes implementation of the new Metro North project.  It also proposes implementation of the DART Expansion Programme including construction of the DART Underground Tunnel.  The Government decided in September 2015 that the original proposal for the tunnel should be redesigned and work is underway on that at present.</p>  <p>  The NTA is currently in the process of preparing an Implementation Plan for the delivery of the GDA strategy for the period 2017-2022.  Key to implementation over this period is the capital funding that will be available for investment in public transport infrastructure over the period.</p>  <p>  The Capital Plan includes funding for the new Metro North project to enable construction of the link to commence in 2021 with a view to delivery by 2026/2027.  Due to continuing constraints on funding, not all of the elements of the DART Expansion Programme can be progressed during the lifetime of the Capital Plan.  Funding has been allocated for the extension of the DART to Balbriggan and for work on the redesign of the tunnel. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Government is embarking on a Mid-Term Review of the Capital Plan, which will take stock of progress and provide the Government with an opportunity to consider the scope for increased levels of investment, including in the transport sector, taking economic growth and fiscal progress into account. I will be making the case for increased capital funding for public transport in that context.</p></reply>

It is expected that the service will offer capacity for 9,900 passengers per hour per direction with the potential to expand services in the future if demand requires.</p>  <p>  The NTA and Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) have commenced preparatory work on the planning and design of new Metro North and a dedicated project Steering Group has been established which is meeting on a regular basis.  The NTA, in collaboration with TII, is undertaking an option analysis and selection study of possible metro alignments and station locations.  Arising from this work a final route and station configuration will be established.  It is my understanding that the NTA and TII expect that this process will be complete by the end of 2017, after which a public consultation process will be undertaken in 2018.</p></reply>

I have however been informed that there are no plans to make either Portarlington or Portlaoise stations unmanned.</p><p>The broader issue of staffling levels at stations generally is under review by the Company, primarily in response to changes in customer behaviour.  ​</p><p>This changed customer behaviour is evidenced by the fact that the just 17% of ticket sales are now made through station ticket offices, with the vast majority made online or through self-service modes in stations.</p><p>The Company is seeking to enhance customer service to ensure that:</p><p>-More Intercity services are staffed to ensure customer service and assistance is available including for those with disabilities and older customers.</p><p>-  Station resources are more focused on direct customer service in the station area, rather than confined to the ticket office area, with a mix of staffed and self-service stations as appropriate to demand.</p><p>-Customers who require assistance can avail of this more easily.</p><p>Specifically for customers requiring assistance, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann plans to confirm new pilot arrangements for mobility-impaired customers shortly, which will dramatically reduce the current advance notification period and ensure a better response when customers requiring assistance cannot give notice.  These new arrangements are being designed following extensive customer research, and liaison with the Company's Disability Users Group.</p><p>The Company has communicated with all station managers around its network on its plans, and is now working with employees to design local implementation plans.</p><p>It is intended that the rollout of enhanced on-board staffing will commence this summer, with station changes to be phased over time.</p><p>As well as liaising with employees and their trade unions, I understand that the company also held an open information day on these plans 7<sup>th</sup>March last to which all Oireachtas members were invited.</p></reply>

My Department's Statement of Strategy 2016-2019 lists the publication of a new Public Transport Policy Statement as a key indicator of progress.  My Department plans to undertake this work later this year.</p>  <p>  The Statement will take cognisance of relevant initiatives in several other areas of public policy on which the Government is already deeply engaged including the preparation of a new National Planning Framework (NPF), the Action Plan for Rural Development and a National Mitigation Plan and Climate Adaption Paper for the transport sector.  The new NPF in particular will influence how national transport objectives are achieved in our regions, cities, towns and rural areas.  In terms of funding, we must get the balance right in relation to regional and rural transport services and the associated investment.  I will be ensuring that a strong case in this regard is made as part of the Mid-Term Review of the Government's Capital Plan in 2017.</p>  <p>  The precise nature and detailed content of the new Public Transport Policy Statement has yet to be scoped out.  However, I am clear as to whom public transport should be about - the ordinary citizen - regardless of who the service is provided by.  Placing the citizen at the heart of our policy will allow us to realise the true potential of public transport, allow it to play its full role in promoting social progress and economic prosperity and ensure that a quality service is provided to the customer.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-22a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017032200057#WRB00700"><p>The Deputy may wish to note that I responded in relation to this RSA survey on 24 January this year, in Question No. 607 of that day.​</p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for legislation in this area.  The prevention/detection of driving while disqualified is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and falls within the remit of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  The legislation is clear on the question of disqualification.  It is an offence to drive while disqualified.  When a person is disqualified, the notice of disqualification directs them to surrender their licence to the National Driver Licensing Service (NDLS) within 14 days.  The disqualification period runs irrespective of licence surrender.</p>  <p>  Copies of the notice to disqualified drivers are provided electronically to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the NDLS.  Instances where the licence has not been surrendered are flagged on the relevant records on the National Vehicle Driver File, which is also provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  Surrender of the licence is not in any case the key issue.  People who surrender their licences might continue to drive while disqualified, and people who do not surrender their licences may not necessarily drive.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can demand production of a driving licence and may seize a licence where they have reasonable grounds for believing that the individual has been disqualified.  They may also arrest people who are driving while disqualified.</p>  <p>  I have indicated that I intend to legislate so that the RSA can publish lists of people disqualified from driving.  This 'naming and shaming' will make it more difficult for people to drive while disqualified.  The new measure will be part of the forthcoming RSA Amendment Bill.</p></reply>

    <ques id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-22a.26.q" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017032200057#WRB00900"><p><i>35.</i> To ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport his plans to alleviate congestion by examining possible solutions such as an outer ring-road motorway to stop reliance on the M50 and examining current public transport costs, in view of the increasing traffic congestion in Dublin and the fact that major public transport projects, such as metro north, are not due for commencement or completion for a number of years. <b>[14247/17]</b></p></ques>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-22a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017032200057#WRB01000"><p>​I fully recognise that there is considerable evidence emerging of increased travel demand across the Dublin Region in general.</p>  <p>  Insofar as congestion issues in Dublin are concerned, the National Transport Authority's (NTA) transport strategy for the Greater Dublin Area provides the overarching framework for the planning and delivery of transport infrastructure and services over the next two decades.  Addressing urban congestion on both the strategic road network and locally in certain locations is an important theme in the Strategy.  The measures proposed are linked to an analysis of current and projected levels of travel demand across the region.</p>  <p>  The Strategy does not include the implementation of the Leinster Outer Orbital during its lifetime.  Other large scale projects proposed in the Strategy include the DART Expansion Programme, New Metro North, and various other light rail projects.  However, as the Deputy correctly notes, it will not be possible to deliver these projects in the short to medium term due to planning and design requirements as well as the significant capital requirements.  Therefore, the only option to tackle congestion in the short to medium term is to radically improve the bus system to deliver a step change in performance across the GDA and to complement that improved public transport system with a network of park and ride sites.</p>  <p>  I must highlight that already planned projects for the period 2015-2018 which include Luas Cross City, the Phoenix Park Tunnel, additional bus fleet and bus lane infrastructure, small scale interventions on the M50 and numerous other measures will go some way to addressing growing travel demand.  However, we must look to a greatly strengthened bus system as the basis for tackling congestion.  This requires a step-change in funding and I will be making a strong case for increased public transport investment as part of the Mid-Term Review of the Government's Capital Plan.</p></reply>

My Department is kept apprised of developments as part of the regular communications that take place between the company and shareholder.</p>  <p>  D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council procured consultants to conduct due diligence of the Dun Laoghaire Harbour Company.  The completed due diligence report was presented by the Chief Executive to the Council meeting held on 9 January 2017.  The Council has engaged a risk and finance consultant to produce a Risk Assessment on the main issues identified in the report.  This will enable the Council to fully understand the implications of models of transfer and the responsibility that will transfer in financial and other terms.  I understand that both the Council and the port are engaging with the risk assessor.  Officials from my Department also recently met with the risk assessor to give the shareholder perspective on National Ports Policy and to explain the different models of transfer.</p>  <p>  The process of transferring governance of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company to Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council is progressing.  However, the future governance and operational structures of the port are primarily matters for agreement between the Council and the port company.  When the risk assessment process is completed, I expect matters to progress towards agreeing a model and a date of transfer.</p></reply>

Donegal continues to be extensively promoted through a series of Wild Atlantic Way adverts and will feature in the upcoming Star Wars film providing a superb promotional opportunity.  Tourism Ireland also works with overseas travel, lifestyle and special interest media as part of their overseas promotional programme.  I understand that Tourism Ireland recently provided details of such campaigns to the Deputy.</p>  <p>  In 2016 F&aacute;ilte Ireland invested &euro;1.7m on marketing the Wild Atlantic Way and along with the local authorities from Donegal to Galway have co-funded a marketing campaign in Great Britain in 2017 in which Donegal features heavily.</p></reply>

In Budget 2017 I secured an 11% increase in the amount of funding available for public transport services generally and Bus &Eacute;ireann will share in that increase.  The Deputy is aware that Bus &Eacute;ireann actually received 21% more in taxpayer funding last year as compared to 2015 and that I have publicly committed to further increasing the level of subvention as resources allow in future Budgets.</p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann also operates a much smaller network of commercial services which do not receive taxpayer funding and operate in competition with other operators.  These services lose money and those losses must be addressed.</p>  <p>  I am obviously disappointed in relation to last week's news that the WRC-led discussions between unions and Bus &Eacute;ireann adjourned without agreement.</p>  <p>  The seriousness of the Company's financial situation requires renewed efforts to reach an understanding on how to solve the company's problems.  I am encouraged that recent public comments from both sides focused on the potential for a common ground to be found on potential efficiencies within the Company.</p>  <p>  I have repeatedly stated that a difficult situation such as this involves different stakeholders with different roles to play.  I have been proactive in increasing taxpayer funding for PSO services, reviewing the level of funding provided for the Free Travel Scheme and assuring rural Ireland as regards the powers of the NTA to maintain public transport connectivity.</p>  <p>  However, last week's comments by both management and unions reinforce my stated position that there are issues internal to the Company which require attention if this situation is to be resolved.  I do not believe that any member of this House can ignore the existence of such issues when both a Company's management and a Company's trade unions are highlighting inefficiencies in work practices which require attention, as both did last week.</p>  <p>  I'm clear that the situation requires realistic negotiations between management and unions in order to address the inefficencies both are seemingly agreed upon as existing and which will then presumably provide a pathway to a sustainable future for the Company.</p>  <p>  As always, the industrial relations machinery of the State remains available to assist the parties in reaching a realistic, fair and sustainable settlement.</p></reply>

The Green-Schools Programme encourages and supports primary and secondary schools to use sustainable transport as a means of travel to school.  Green Schools Travel Officers also continually work very closely with Local Authorities and the Road Safety Authorty to identify gaps in the provision of infrastructure and other barriers to enabling children to travel to school either by walking or cycling.  The Department also separately funds cycle parking in schools.</p>  <p>  A new cycling training standard, Cycle Right, is currently being rolled out across the country to provide a standardised training programme for all school-going children to provide them with the necessary skills to cycle safely including cycling to school.  It is in all our interests to continue to encourage children, their parents and students to use more sustainable forms of transport.</p></reply>

Due to constrained levels of funding available in the early years of the plan, the priority in this period is to ensure the safety and efficiency of existing transport infrastructure.  Funding of &euro;2.6bn has been prioritised for essential 'steady state' maintenance and asset renewal of the public transport network.  The remaining &euro;1bn of the total allocation available for public transport is being invested to help address growing congestion driven by the recovery and population growth.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for the implementation and development of public transport infrastructure in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA).  The need to address urban congestion was a key element in the development of the NTA's <i>Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016-2035.</i></p><p><i></i>The NTA is currently preparing an Implementation Plan for the delivery of the GDA Strategy for the period 2017-2022.  Key to implementation is the capital funding that will be available for investment in public transport infrastructure over the period.  The allocation for Public Transport under the Capital Plan 2016-2021 includes funding for capacity enhancements including completion of the Luas Cross City Project, renewal and replacement of the PSO bus fleet and other improvements to the bus and rail networks.  Construction of the new Metro North project will commence around 2021 and be operational around 2026/27.  Funding is also included for elements of the DART Expansion Programme including the extension of the DART to Balbriggan. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, a mid-term review of the Capital Plan has been initiated and I will be making the case for increased funding for public transport in that context.  I consider that the optimum approach to tackle congestion over the short to medium term is to radically improve the bus system to deliver a step change in performance across the GDA region and in our regional cities to complement that improved public transport system with a network of park and ride sites.  Such measures can be complemented by investment to increase capacity across public transport and to improve the infrastructure for sustainable transport options.</p></reply>

The Strategy unequivocally commits to promoting transport options that will reduce carbon emissions. </p>  <p>  The methodology of measuring the expected impacts of the Strategy is to compare a future year emission scenario both with and without the Strategy in place.  During the preparation of the Strategy, an assessment was carried out to evaluate CO2 emissions in the absence of any of the policies that might be included in the National Mitigation Plan, and in the absence of any future engine technology improvements or future fuel efficiency improvements.  As a result of the projected shift in total numbers carried by sustainable modes a decrease in CO2 emissions of approximately 4% would be achieved in 2035 with the Transport Strategy in place compared to the situation without its implementation.</p>  <p>  In order for Ireland to effectively and equitably contribute to the EU emissions reduction commitments in line with the Paris Agreement and the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, an ambitious low-carbon development strategy is being developed.  My Department is working closely with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment (DCCAE) and the Department of Agriculture to prepare our National Mitigation Plan.</p>  <p>  Transport will have to play a significant role on the national mitigation effort.  The measures under consideration for transport will be wide-ranging and will focus on modal shift, movement to alternative fuels, and targeted behavioural change.  To date, considerable progress has been achieved through measures aimed at promoting improved technologies and changing behaviour.  The draft mitigation plan is currently available for extensive public consultation.</p></reply>

Of course any loss of contracted service will also mean Bus &Eacute;ireann is liable for financial penalties to be applied to it.</p>  <p>  Outside of its PSO contracted routes Bus &Eacute;ireann also operates on commercial routes through its Expressway service.  On the majority of these services, Expressway operates in competition with other operators on some or all of a particular route.  Obviously therefore in the event of strike action in Expressway, a significant number of the travelling public will have other transport options available.</p>  <p>  I think it clear that a strike is in nobody's interests - neither the Company, employees or the travelling public.

The first type is those services which are funded by the Exchequer through either the Public Service Obligation or the Rural Transport funding programmes.  In Budget 2017 I secured an 11% cumulative increase in the amount of funding available for both programmes which will underpin the delivery of new and improved taxpayer funded bus services across rural Ireland.  I have also committed publicly to further increasing the funding of those programmes in the future as resources allow.</p>  <p>  The second type of bus services in rural Ireland are those commercial bus services provided by  operators under licence from the National Transport Authority pursuant to the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009.  While public commentary tends to focus on these services in the context of the major inter-urban routes, commercial bus services also frequently connect rural towns and villages across the State.  In 2015 around 23 million people travelled on a commercial bus service, which represents approximately 9% of all public transport journeys that year.</p>  <p>  I have repeatedly assured rural Ireland that the National Transport Authority has the statutory powers available to it to ensure continued public transport connectivity for communities who may lose services in cases where a commercial operator introduces service changes.  In its recent response to proposed Expressway route changes announced by Bus &Eacute;ireann, the NTA has utilised these statutory powers through for example announcing increased PSO services and amending the scheduling of existing rural transport services in order to address identified transport needs caused by the Expressway changes.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific routes raised by the Deputy, Bus Eireann does not serve Borris-in-Ossory or operate between Athy and Kilkenny.</p>  <p>  The NTA's National Journey Planner indicates that Borris-In-Ossory is currently served by two private commercial bus operators, one connecting the town with Dublin Airport and the other a local service linking into Portlaoise.  In relation to connections between Athy and Kilkenny I understand there is both a commercial bus service and a PSO bus service using the N78, while both places are of course also served by the PSO supported rail link.</p></reply>

This means that the backlog of repair works is increasing and a recent survey based on limited data suggests that the backlog of repairs has increased from &euro;3 billion in 2005 to over &euro;10 billion in 2016.</p>  <p>  The 7 year transport element of the Capital Plan published in September 2015 includes provision for expenditure of &euro;6 billion on the road network.  The Capital Plan provides for a gradual build up in capital funding from a relatively low base in 2016 towards the levels needed to support maintenance and improvement works by 2022.  I announced the 2017 regional and local road allocations on 24 January 2017.  While 2017 sees an increase in overall funding, it will take some years yet under the Capital Plan to restore "steady state" funding levels for land transport and to progress the improvement projects included in the Plan.  Allocations in respect of regional and local roads in 2018 are part of the Estimates process.</p></reply>

Following the publication of the TII report on these consultations, a decision was taken in late 2015 to pause development of the Greenway west of the Shannon to allow all stakeholders to consider how best to progress this project.  In January this year, Minister O'Donovan and I met with a delegation of landowners and elected representatives from the region to discuss this project and that provided us with a good understanding of the issues involved.  It is recognised that the approach taken initially in relation to the preferred route was sub-optimal and lessons have been learned from that experience.  My Department is currently developing a new strategy to set out a cohesive and forward looking approach to the development, funding and promotion of greenways generally and we will be consulting publicly on this in the near future.  The proposed Strategy will include a recommended approach to be taken by authorities and agencies tasked with delivering greenway infrastructure where engagement and consultation with landowners is required and, when finalised, will inform the approach to be taken to progress the delivery of the section of the Dublin to Galway Greenway from Athlone to Galway.    </p>  <p>  In order to maintain momentum in the meantime, and to facilitate progress on the non-contentious elements of the project, the draft plan, Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and Appropriate Assessment (AA) for the overall Galway to Dublin Greenway were published in January.  It is important to point out that the SEA is high-level and looks at the corridor between Galway and Dublin; it does not look at any specific routing or alignment on this corridor.  The majority of the submissions received on the plan were favourable and I intend to publish the final SEA and overall plan shortly.

I understand the NTA is now in the process of preparing a report on the consultation process.  I intend to bring this report to Government.

Works on those roads are funded from the local authority's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.  Maintenance of private laneways/roads not taken in charge by local authorities is the responsibility of the landowners concerned.  Due to the major cutbacks in roads funding it was necessary for my Department to cease making separate allocations to local authorities in respect of the Local Improvement Scheme (LIS).  The approved scheme remains intact and local authorities can use a proportion of State grant funding for LIS should they wish to do so.  While there is a modest increase in funding for roads this year, it will take some years yet under the Capital Plan to restore "steady state" funding levels for regional and local roads.  The primary focus has to continue to be on the maintenance and renewal of public roads.  Local authorities can continue to use a proportion of their Discretionary Grant for the Local Improvement Scheme in 2017.</p>  <p>  In light of the provision in the Programme for Government indicating that, as the economy recovers, the Government will promote increased funding for Community Involvement and Local Improvement Schemes, I will review the scope for making a separate grant allocation once the planned Review of the Capital Plan is completed.</p></reply>

This Government has supported that role through the 11% cumulative increase I secured in Budget 2017 for both the Public Service Obligation (PSO) programme and the Rural Transport Programme.  That increase means that in 2017 approximately &euro;277million be available to the National Transport Authority to support the delivery of these important programmes, which underpin the delivery of taxpayer funded bus services across rural Ireland. I have committed publicly to further increasing the funding of those programmes in the future as resources allow.Publicly funded bus services in rural Ireland are expanding and improving and that is reflected in the increases in passenger numbers, particularly within Bus &Eacute;ireann's PSO network.</p><p>That Exchequer financial support is supported at a policy level by the commitment given within the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>to review public transport policy so as to ensure services are sustainable into the future and are meeting the needs of a modern economy.  I am glad to say that this commitment is also reflected within the actions contained within <i>Realising our Rural Potential - Action Plan for Rural Development</i>which specifically references the rural transport dimension and the needs of rural communities.</p><p>I have no doubt the Deputy is aware that across rural Ireland the publicly funded bus services are complemented by a huge range of privately operated bus services.  These bus services are provided by operators under licence from the National Transport Authority pursuant to the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009 and contrary to some reports are not solely focused on major inter-urban routes, but are also frequently found connecting rural towns and villages across the State.  In 2015 around 23 million people travelled on a commercial bus service, which represents approximately 9% of all public transport journeys that year.</p><p>The National Transport Authority has assured rural Ireland that it has the statutory powers available to it to ensure continued public transport connectivity for communities who may lose services in cases where a commercial operator introduces service changes.  The NTA has used those powers in the past and will do so again in the future if required.</p></reply>

The Company is currently losing money.  These losses stem from its Expressway services.  These are services operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann on a commercial basis, often in competition with other bus operators.  In 2015 almost 23 million people used a commercial bus service, with around 30% of that number using an Expressway commercial service.  No commercial bus operator receives taxpayer funding for commercial bus services. The issue Expressway faces therefore is not one of taxpayer funding, but rather a commercial one.  I have repeatedly stated my view that different stakeholders have different roles to play in resolving this difficult issue.</p>  <p>  First and foremost, the company and its employees' trade unions must agree upon a realistic framework that allows the Company address the commercial issues it faces and restores it to a financially sustainable position.  These issues are internal to the Company and can only be resolved through internally focused discussions and agreement.</p>  <p>  In relation to Public Service Obligation (PSO) services, I have highlighted how I have already increased taxpayer funding in 2017 by 11% compared to 2016.  That means that the National Transport Authority (NTA) has almost &euro;263million available to fund PSO services in 2017.  That money can only be used to fund PSO services as provided by operators, such as Bus &Eacute;ireann, under contract with the NTA.</p>  <p>  In relation to the funding of the Free Travel Scheme, I have previously referred to the work underway by officials from both my Department and the Department of Social Protection in examining the funding levels associated with that Scheme and I expect that work to conclude very shortly.</p>  <p>  I have assured rural Ireland that the NTA will step in and assist in cases where connectivity is threatened and we have seen the NTA respond where it has deemed necessary in relation to recently announced route changes.  </p>  <p>  But let me reiterate that the issues within Bus &Eacute;ireann must be resolved by Bus &Eacute;ireann and I hope that the company can do so through constructive and realistic engagement with employees and trade unions.</p></reply>

Reports on the outcome of these Sectoral dialogues can be found on my Department's website at the following <i><i>Link. </i></i>The All-Island Sectoral dialogues were in addition to other stakeholder engagements in the areas of aviation, maritime, road transport and logistics, and tourism which have been held by my Department.</p><p>A major concern of transport operators was a possible return of border controls and the implications these would have on tourism and also for the transport of goods on the Island of Ireland and to our continental markets. </p><p>The outcome of these consultations inform the analyses of the Department, including in relation to the implications of possible border controls,  and feed into the overall analyses of Government.  Details of the  type of border, if any, will become clearer as the negotiation process evolves. In the meantime, my Department is represented on Inter Departmental Groups looking at the implications of Brexit from an economic, customs, EU Funded Programmes and Common Travel Area perspective.</p><p>A number of existing measures in place will assist in alleviating some of the adverse impacts of Brexit.  I have already highlighted the importance of the 9% rate for the tourism sector and the retention of this rate was recognised by the Government in Budget 2017. The reduction of the Air Travel tax to zero, the temporary reduction of employers PRSI and changes to the VISA regime have also been important measures in supporting the tourism sector and these will assist in mitigating some of the implications of Brexit also.The question of additional financial or other measures in the  tourism sector, and in the transport sector, is being kept under review and the position will become clearer during the EU/UK negotiations.</p></reply>

Trump on 27 January 2017, the Taoiseach requested that the relevant departments undertake a review of US Pre-clearance at Dublin and Shannon Airports.  My Department, along with the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Justice and Equality contributed to this Review which was furnished to the Taoiseach last month and discussed at cabinet on 28 February.  The Review set out the position with regard to the history of pre-clearance, the Ireland/US Pre-clearance Agreement and the Aviation (Pre-clearance) Act 2009, its current operation, along with its benefits for Ireland and potential issues which have arisen in the light of the recent Executive Order.</p>  <p>  Based on the work undertaken in the context of the Review, it is my view, and the view of Government, that US pre-clearance arrangements in Dublin and Shannon Airports should remain in place.  In arriving at this decision, the following issues were taken into consideration:-</p>  <p>  The operation of pre-clearance, a consensual and non-discriminatory facility, where the roles of Irish and US officials are clearly established, does not give rise to any breach of Ireland's European or International Human Rights obligations, including those in respect of refoulement and the rights of refugees or persons wishing to seek international protection in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Pre-clearance is a valuable service for Ireland facilitating the movement of people between the two countries.  It offers a unique service for passengers, providing them with essentially a domestic to domestic connection.  Airlines flying to the USA using Dublin and Shannon Airports are permitted to fly to less congested domestic terminals at US airports, which enables faster onward connections for passengers.</p>  <p>  It is a strategic asset for the airports in question, and a key enabler of market growth, which improves our global connectivity.</p></reply>

Creation of another statutory body in this context would not make for greater clarity and could lead to confusion for members of the public who seek advice or redress.</p>  <p>  I would draw the Deputy's specific attention to section 40 of the Disability Act 2005, which makes provision for the Ombudsman to investigate complaints from members of the public about non-compliance by public bodies with the accessibility requirements set out in Part 3 of the Act or about matters contained in a Sectoral Plan prepared under that Part.  I would wish to see this facility used more often.  It is vitally important that people with disabilities are informed as to their rights on access to services and information, and that they are aware of their right of recourse to the Ombudsman to examine unresolved complaints.  It is also crucial that both professional and non-professional people involved in the disability sector are knowledgeable about the Disability Act 2005.  In this context, I have been advised by the Ombudsman that his Office regularly takes initiatives to raise awareness of its services, including the provision of an information leaflet on complaints from the sector and direct engagement with NGOs.</p></reply>

A PIA includes a number of important statutory protections for the debtor.  These include the right to reasonable living expenses before payments to creditors are fixed, a statutory priority for their continued ownership and occupation of their home subject to the conditions set out at section 104 of the Act, a right of court review (subject to certain conditions) under section 115A if creditors reject a reasonable PIA proposal by a debtor, a return to solvency on completion of the payments envisaged by the PIA, and protection from other enforcement action by creditors during the period of the PIA.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Personal Insolvency Act does not set any minimum duration for a PIA.  Section 99 of the Act sets the maximum duration of a PIA at 6 years, although this period may be extended for up to a year in certain circumstances. In fact, many PIAs are concluded with a very short duration.  Analysis by the Insolvency Service of Ireland of a sample of 100 recently concluded PIAs showed that 43% provided for a period of less than 12 months, while 41% lasted from five to six years. None was concluded for longer than 6 years.</p>  <p>  This flexibility regarding the duration of a PIA is an important element which can significantly benefit the debtor.  Allowing a longer period can be very important in allowing an insolvent person to put together a proposal which can be accepted by creditors and, in particular, can be sufficient for them to remain in their home.  It can allow for a person in financial difficulty, or with temporarily reduced income or working hours, to recover from illness or unemployment, retrain, or increase or restore their earning capacity.</p>  <p>  Reducing the maximum length of a PIA from six years to three years is likely to have the unintended effect of denying some debtors the opportunity to avail of a PIA as they would not be able to make sufficient payments to creditors during the shorter arrangement period.  The Act's provisions already allow a PIA to be concluded for a much shorter period where this is desirable in the light of the debtor's individual circumstances.</p></reply>

Under the model developed by the ISI, which is based on a budgeting model originally developed in Ireland by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, reasonable living expenses are the expenses a person necessarily incurs in achieving a reasonable standard of living, this being one which meets a person&rsquo;s physical, psychological and social needs. </p>  <p>  Section 23 also provides that the guidelines shall have regard to the need to facilitate social inclusion, and active participation in economic activity, of the person and their dependants.  Thus, reasonable living expenses may, for example, include the necessary costs of childcare or of a car which is needed to facilitate participation in economic activity. </p>  <p>  Section 23(6) provides for the Guidelines to be reviewed at least annually by the ISI.  The most recent Guidelines were published in July 2016 and are currently under review, including as regards the issues raised by the Deputy's question. </p></reply>

The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016), brought Part 1 (Preliminary and General) and Part 9 (Director of the Decision Support Service) of the Act, other than sections 3, 4 and 7 in Part 1 and sections 96 and 102 and Chapter 3 in Part 9, into operation on 17 October 2016.  These provisions were brought into operation in order to enable the process of recruitment of the Director of the Decision Support Service (DSS) to begin.  The recruitment and appointment of the Director of the DSS, and the appointment of DSS staff, is a matter for the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health) with the approval of the Minister for Health. My Department does not have any statutory function in relation to the recruitment and appointment of the Director. </p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.  The Minister for Health, under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) (No. 2) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 517 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 8 of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016 . The provisions commenced in Part 8 were the definition of &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in section 82; the definitions of &ldquo;code of practice&rdquo; and &ldquo;working group&rdquo; in section 91(1); and section 91(2).  The commenced provisions provide for the establishment by the Minister for Health of a multi-disciplinary group to advise in relation to codes of practice on advance healthcare directives.  The multi-disciplinary group has been set up and work is ongoing on the code of practice on advance healthcare directives.</p>  <p>  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission, must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced.  A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from my Department, the Department of Health and the Mental Health Commission is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service and this work is ongoing.  It is intended that significant progress will be made in 2017 on the implementation of the new decision-making support options provided for in the Act.  The remainder of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 will be commenced on a phased basis as these new decision-making support options are being rolled out by the Decision Support Service.  </p></reply>

If no agreement is reached, the matter proceeds to a more formal investigation and adjudication, and the parties are issued with a legally binding Finding.  The FSO aim to have the Dispute Resolution process completed within 3 months from receipt.  If Dispute Resolution is not successful, the length of time taken to investigate and adjudicate depends on the number of exchanges that take place between the parties.  A full exchange is required in order to ensure fair procedures, and typically this exchange of documents takes about 4-6 months.  Upon completion of the exchange, the FSO aim to issue a finding within 3 months.  If a complaint is received, arising from a situation of arrears on a commercial borrowing (Buy to Let/Investment Properties), the FSO will consider the protections afforded to borrowers and commercial mortgage holders by the Central Bank of Ireland's Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises and the Consumer Protection Code (CPC). </p>  <p>  In addition, if a Receiver is appointed by the lender, either before a complaint is made to the FSO, or after the FSO has begun dealing with the matter, the appointment of the Receiver will not impede the mediation, investigation or adjudication of the complaint by the FSO.  In that event, the FSO will investigate whether the mortgage deed in place permitted the appointment of a Receiver, and secondly whether it was reasonable and fair for the lender, at the particular point in time, and in the overall circumstances, to proceed with the appointment of a Receiver. </p>  <p>  If the FSO upholds the complaint and takes the view that it was wrongful of the lender to have appointed a Receiver, the FSO can direct compensation of up to &euro;250,000 and/or direct such rectification as considered to be appropriate in the circumstances.</p></reply>

In identifying the requirement for additional school places in a school planning area, my Department uses a Geographical Information System to identify the areas under increased demographic pressure nationwide.  The GIS uses data from a range of sources including my Department&rsquo;s own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic analyses at primary and post primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.</p>  <p>  Edgeworthstown feeds into the Longford school planning area which has three post-primary schools.  As with other school planning areas nationwide, the demographic data for the Longford school planning area (which includes Edgesworthtown) is being kept under review by my Department to take account of updated child benefit data and updated enrolment data and also the impact of existing and planned capacity increases in this area.</p></reply>

The DEIS Plan for 2017 sets out our vision for future intervention in the critical area of social inclusion in education policy.</p>  <p>  In its initial application, the new identification model has identified that there are schools in disadvantaged areas, not previously included in DEIS, whose level of disadvantage is significantly higher than many schools already in the programme.  Accordingly, we are moving as a first step to include these schools in the DEIS School Support Programme.    </p>  <p>  Schools included in the list published by my Department on 13th February are those whose level of concentrated disadvantage has been identified as being at the same level as the current DEIS category for schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage.  This includes 15 new Urban Band 1 schools, 30 Urban Band 2 schools raised to Urban Band 1 status, 51 new Rural DEIS schools and 13 new Post Primary DEIS schools. </p>  <p>  Schools which have not been included or upgraded at this stage, including the school referred to by the Deputy, are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort, under the new identification process, which is fair and objective.</p>  <p>  The DEIS Plan provides for a verification process and any school wishing to seek verification of the information used to assess the level of disadvantage of its pupil cohort may submit an application for same to social inclusion@education.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the school details published on 13th February represent a first step in the application of the assessment process to support pupils in schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.  I am fully aware that there are further schools whose concentrated level of disadvantage may not be at the highest level, but may nevertheless be at a level which warrants additional supports for pupils under DEIS. </p>  <p>  However, as noted in the DEIS Plan, the implementation of a new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model.</p>  <p>  Once this work has been completed, consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.</p>  <p>  In delivering on the DEIS Plan 2017 we must be conscious that there are ongoing changes in demographics which may be more marked in some areas than others.  Populations in some areas have changed considerably since schools were originally evaluated for inclusion in DEIS in 2006.  The new model may reveal that some schools currently included in DEIS have a level of disadvantage within their school population much lower than that in some schools not included within DEIS.  If this turns out to be the case, then we must consider whether it is fair that those schools continue receiving these additional resources, using resources that may be more fairly allocated to the schools with greater levels of disadvantage.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the fact that a school has not been included in the DEIS programme on this occasion does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should its level of disadvantage warrant the allocation of additional resources.</p></reply>

Indeed international research indicates that school leadership is second only to classroom teaching as an influence on pupil learning. </p>  <p>  Budget 2016 provided 250 posts to second level schools to enable Deputy Principals to be more fully available to assist the school principal with the leadership of the school.  At primary level Budget 2016 provided for additional release days for teaching principals to range between 15 and 25 days depending on the size of the school. </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 has provided for the equivalent of 170 additional posts to second level schools to employ an additional Deputy Principal to assist the school principal with the leadership of the school.  With effect from September 2017, schools with pupil enrolment in excess of 700 will be allocated additional Deputy Principal posts.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 also provides for the commencement of the restoration of middle management posts in both the primary and post-primary sector. </p>  <p>  The recently established Centre for School Leadership (CSL) is a collaboration between my Department and the representative professional bodies for school principals.  It has been created to offer professional and practical support to schools leaders.  This support structure for leadership teams in schools will attempt to ensure that school leaders have opportunities to access, share and create knowledge and experience within their leadership roles.  The work of the Centre draws on best international practice and research in the professional development of school leaders.  Priorities for the Centre include a new postgraduate qualification for aspiring school leaders, a mentoring programme for newly appointed school principals, coaching support for serving principals, a review and alignment of leadership programmes with Department standards. </p>  <p>  Last year my Department published &ldquo;Looking at Our School 2016", a quality framework for primary and post-primary schools which is designed to support the efforts of teachers and school leaders, as well as the school system more generally, to strive for excellence in our schools. </p>  <p>  The current review of the post of responsibility structure in schools will, in the context of restoration of posts, address the further development of a distributed leadership model.</p></reply>

This indicates that the level of pupil intake at post-primary level in Lucan is likely to continue at or close to the current level and therefore it was deemed prudent by my Department to plan additional provision in the Lucan school planning area on this basis.</p>  <p>  As a result of the patronage assessment process for the nine new post-primary schools due to open in September 2017 and September 2018, Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board (DDLETB), with Scoil Sinead Ltd as Trustee Partner, was appointed as patron of the new 1,000 pupil non-designated Community College to serve the Lucan school planning area. </p>  <p>  As part of this process, the parental demand submitted in support of each patron&rsquo;s application was assessed and in this regard I am satisfied that the level of parental demand for a post-primary school for the Lucan area supports a viable school which will not displace pupils from existing schools.</p>  <p>  It is intended that the permanent site for the school will be located in the Clonburris Strategic Development Zone area.  Officials in my Department are currently engaging with officials in South Dublin County Council in this regard.  The school will open in suitable interim accommodation in September 2017 as scheduled pending completion of construction of its permanent building. </p>  <p>  The 1,000 pupil post-primary school, Kishoge Community College, opened in 2014 to cater for the increase in demand for post-primary provision in the Lucan area identified by my Department.  This school is currently in its third year of operation and the establishment of the new Community College this September is intended to enhance provision at post-primary level within the Lucan area.  It is my Departments view that the establishment of the new school will not impact on the future development of Kishoge Community College.</p></reply>

The SWS is designed to allow post primary schools to carry out small and medium scale building works that will improve and upgrade existing school buildings.  This scheme is additional to other capital funding schemes that are operated by my Department such as the Additional Accommodation scheme and Emergency Works scheme i.e. for projects of such urgency that they would prevent some or all of the school from opening. </p>  <p>  The current SWS is being applied on a multi-annual basis for the years 2016 and 2017.  Nearly 50% of schools have applied for inclusion under the current SWS which reflects a very high demand.  We are therefore, unfortunately, not accepting further applications at this time.</p></reply>

The number of special classes at post-primary level has doubled in the past five years and continues to rise rapidly. </p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is the body responsible for organising and planning provision for children with Special Educational Needs, including establishing special classes in mainstream primary and post primary schools.  The NCSE has informed my Department that, in general, they are satisfied that there are sufficient ASD special class placements to meet existing demand.</p>  <p>  Careful evaluation needs to be carried out before any policy decision is considered to give the Department or the NCSE the power to compel a school to open a special class or an ASD unit.  In particular, there should be convincing evidence that the school system in an area is failing to make provision for ASD students before any such move should be considered. </p>  <p>  However, it should not be presumed that there should be a special class placement in post primary school for every child that leaves a special class in primary school as many of these children should be able to consider transferring to mainstream or special schools as appropriate.</p>  <p>  In many cases, refusal to open classes arises because the school has either no space; is currently full; is awaiting a new building or renovation of existing buildings or rooms, or cannot access suitably trained teachers.  Where the difficulties are infrastructural or relate to the availability of suitably trained teachers or SNAs, it is clearly preferable that my Department would work to ensure that these difficulties are addressed and overcome. </p>  <p>  I will continue to work with my officials to address all issues in this area, supporting children with special educational needs is a big priority for my Department and this will continue to inform all actions in this important area.</p></reply>

One of the criticisms of the last process was that it did not take sufficient account of local communities and local stakeholders.  The ETBs, as statutory education authorities, present in every county, with representation from local groups on their boards, are ideally placed to carry out this process.  The protocols surrounding how the consultation will be carried out will be carefully designed by my Department, in consultation with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and each ETB will submit a report to the Department showing the results of these consultations, including details of how they were carried out in accordance with the protocols. </p>  <p>  There will then be discussions between individual ETBs and the existing patrons/landowners concerning the possible transfer of schools to accommodate this demonstrated demand for diversity.</p>  <p>  Each ETB will prepare a report for the Department outlining the levels of demand within their functional areas and the responses of the existing patrons as to how this might be accommodated through the reconfiguration of existing school provision.</p>  <p>  In the subsequent implementation phase, where the level of demand for multi-denominational schools is sufficient to justify transfer of a school from denominational to multi-denominational patronage, a process will commence to give effect to that.  There will be a role for the existing patron/landowner in consulting with local community and school interests and taking into account proposals from different prospective multi-denominational patrons.  It is envisaged that transfers will largely be by way of voluntary transfer of live schools by existing patrons.</p>  <p>  This new process for supporting transfers of schools to multi-denominational patrons in response to the wishes of local families is based around principles of transparency and cooperation.  Therefore, there will be a very substantial level of consultation of local communities in the process, both with the ETBs&rsquo; in the initial phase to establish evidence of demand by consulting pre-school parents and subsequently through the requirement for the existing patron to consult with local community and school interests in proposing to transfer patronage of an existing school to an alternative patron body.  In that process, the existing patron will also take into account proposals from all prospective multi-denominational patrons that wish to be considered.  I would urge all parties to engage in this process constructively, with a view to reaching solutions to meet parental preferences.</p></reply>

The Council, when established shortly, will oversee research and provide advice on the prioritisation of identified skills needs and how to secure the delivery of identified needs. </p>  <p>  As part of this new skills architecture, nine Regional Skills Fora were established in 2016 with a view to providing an opportunity for employers and the education and training system to work together to identify and meet the existing and emerging skills needs of their regions.  Employers in the construction sector are represented on many of the Fora. </p>  <p>  The apprenticeship system is a major supplier of craft skills to the construction sector.  Following a number of years of decline, registrations in the 27 existing apprenticeship trades are rising as the employment and economic situation improves.  As economic activity in the relevant sectors continues to strengthen, registrations are forecast to continue to increase in these trades in the coming years.  SOLAS forecast that registrations will increase to 3,390 in 2016, 4,219 in 2017 and 5,089 in 2018.  Both the Action Plan for Education 2016-2019 and the National Skills Strategy 2025 contain specific measures in relation to the apprenticeship system.</p>  <p>  Further Education and Training providers deliver a range of specific skills programmes for the construction sector outside of the apprenticeship system.  SOLAS are engaging with the Education and Training Boards to continue to expand provision in identified areas of skills needs. </p>  <p>  A broad range of courses are also available in the area of construction and the built environment in the Higher Education sector.  There were 56 construction related courses offered to full-time level 8 (honours bachelor degree) students in 2015/16 and 46 at levels 6 and 7 (undergraduate ordinary degree and certificate enrolments).  In total 10% of all HEA-funded higher education graduates in 2015 were from the &ldquo;Engineering, Manufacturing and Construction&rdquo; disciplines. </p>  <p>  Construction-related courses have also featured in the Springboard+ programme, which funds short form higher education courses primarily for unemployed people. In 2016, a total of 246 construction-related places were approved.</p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water shall collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it in accordance with a water charges plan, to be approved by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). Section 22(5) of the Act provides that a water charges plan may provide for charges in respect of the provision of a service connection (within the meaning of the Water Services Act 2007) to, or in respect of, a premises. </p>  <p>  In its decision on Irish Water's Water Charges Plan, published in October 2014, the CER stated that, until it made a decision on Irish Water's new connection charges, Irish Water should continue to apply the rates charged by the local authorities at 31 December 2013. In its Water Charges Plan Decision Paper of 5 March 2015, the CER published a list of the areas that it would be progressing, which includes the development of a connection charging policy.  </p>  <p>  Planning authorities were requested in Circular PS 21/2013 issued by my Department on 30 December 2013 to operate revised procedures in relation to the application of development contribution levies. In respect of planning permissions granted prior to 1 January 2014, planning authorities were advised that the full development contribution charge (where such was attached as a condition of the planning permission), including, where relevant, the portion in respect of water services infrastructure, must be paid to the planning authority in accordance with the terms of the permission.</p>  <p>  In respect of planning permissions granted after 1 January 2014, planning authorities were advised that when granting planning permission, they should no longer include a portion in respect of water services infrastructure in any development contribution applied. Such charges would be levied by Irish Water instead. Planning authorities were further advised that new development contribution schemes made after that date should not contain charges in respect of water services infrastructure.</p>  <p>  Currently, over 900 different connection charges exist. I understand from the CER that Irish Water is currently developing proposals for a single national connection charging policy aimed at developing a more harmonised methodology for connections to the public water and wastewater networks. A single national policy on the provision of network connection services is a common model employed in other utilities in Ireland as well as internationally. The CER expects to be able to consult publicly on Irish Water's proposals in the middle of 2017 and to make a final decision by the end of 2017.</p></reply>

There are approximately 18,400 small areas across the country, which consist of 100 households, and each area is given a relative index score to indicate its level of affluence or deprivation.  The index provides a score which allows the direct comparison of all census areas, down to the smallest CSO component.  Three sets of data are used to calculate the relative index score &ndash; demographic profile, which includes indicators such as the percentage of the population aged under 15 or over 64 years of age, as well as social class composition and labour market situation.  However, in general, SICAP is focussed on providing supports to people of working age, to assist them to get a foothold in the labour market.  </p></reply>

The Citizens Information Board (CIB) assures me that there will be no job losses, no closure of services, no change to service delivery locations and no change to the terms and conditions of serving staff during the lifetime of the restructuring programme.  Most importantly, there will be no disruption to CIS and MABS services for those who use them.  The decision was communicated by the Board to all CIS and MABS Boards and to all staff on the same day. </p>  <p>  The decision comes after a lengthy and extensive analysis of options and a detailed consultation period with all stakeholders on the need for a more streamlined governance model.  It is worth clarifying that the new governance arrangements are not aimed at centralising the services provided by CIS and MABS.  The restructured governance arrangements are being implemented at local company board level only.  The decision taken will simply reduce the number of individual local CIS and MABS company boards from ninety three (93) to sixteen (16).  A new regional board structure will be put in place which will comprise eight (8) CIS boards and eight (8) MABS boards.  </p>  <p>  The valuable work carried out by the employees and volunteers working in CIS services and the employees of MABS services will continue as heretofore.  A more streamlined governance structure will result in a more targeted use of valuable staff resources, re-directed to increased front line service delivery, made possible by reduction in the current significant administrative burden associated with maintaining ninety three (93) individual companies nationwide.</p>  <p>  The changes will bring the CIS and MABS organisations more into line with modern public service governance guidelines and requirements where significant State funding is involved.  In 2017, CIB is set to receive State funding of &euro;54 million, of which &euro;15 million is allocated to CIS services (including &euro;13.1 million to the 42 local Citizens Information Services, &euro;1.2 million to Citizens Information Phone services and, the balance, &euro;0.7 million to central and other supports), and &euro;24.6 million is allocated to the network of MABS services (including &euro;15.4 million to the 51 local MABS, &euro;0.3m to National Traveller MABS, &euro;2.0 million to MABS National Development Company, &euro;3.3 million to the MABS Dedicated Mortgage Arrears initiative, &euro;3.5 million to the Abhaile service, and the remaining &euro;0.1m to MABS central supports).</p>  <p>  Following on from the decision of the Board, a Restructuring Implementation Group is being set up by CIB to examine all aspects of implementing the new sixteen (16) board model.  This work will include examination of the establishment costs of the new structure and the potential for future savings derived from the reduction in the administrative burden associated with ninety three (93) individual local companies.  Current costs are an aggregate of the costs incurred by each of the ninety three (93) local companies on items such as audit fees, professional fees (including legal services), payroll administration and board of director expenses.  While cost is not the driver of the restructuring project, some efficiencies are likely to result from moving to a reduced sixteen (16) company model.  The main aim of the project is to improve existing governance arrangements and optimise the benefits from operating a more modern, streamlined and customer focused service delivery model.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

My Department will spend approximately &euro;232 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 425,000 customers.  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen significantly each year, as the number of eligible customers grew.  At the end of September 2013 there were almost 396,000 receiving the telephone allowance compared to approximately 316,000 people in 2007.  This was an increase of 25%, or an average increase of approx. 4% per annum. </p>  <p>  The Government is keenly aware of the impact of Budget decisions on the Department's clients, and strives to ensure that the money available is targeted in the most effective way.  In Budget 2016, the first increase in the basic rate of the State pension in seven years was given.  This increased the personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;222, and that of the contributory pension to &euro;233.30.  There was also a &euro;2.50 increase in the rate of the Fuel Allowance, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week.  </p>  <p>  In Budget 2017, I announced a further increase in the rate of State pensions by &euro;5, bringing the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory) to &euro;238.30.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, over the past two Budgets, the maximum weekly rate for State Pensions has increased by &euro;8 per week, which is the equivalent of over &euro;34 per month.  The value of these increases is significantly in excess of the value of the telephone allowance previously provided.</p>  <p>  Any decision to restore the household benefits in full would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.  To date, the Government has concentrated additional resources on increasing the rate of the pension, rather than on the Household Benefits package.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Firstly, the State pension non-contributory is a means tested pension.  Secondly, the State pension (contributory) is paid from the Social Insurance Fund.  Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  </p>  <p>  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.  </p>  <p>  Using another date would require legislative provision, and introducing such legislation would mean a number of decisions would have to be made, notably (a) what date should be used (preferably it would be a date that was not considered arbitrary)? (b) would the contributions paid before that date be ignored in the calculation of the yearly average, and would there be relief for such pensioners if this change reduced their entitlements? and (c) if there was a significant net benefit for pensioners as a result of this change, what would be the source of that funding (e.g. higher PRSI/taxes, or a lower core rate of the pension generally)?</p>  <p>  The &lsquo;marriage bar&rsquo; describes a rule that existed in most of the public service and some private sector employments, where women were required to leave their employment upon marriage.  This practice was abolished in 1973 when Ireland joined the EEC.  As it was a rule rather than law, married women affected by it could take up other employment, and many did.  It is worth remembering that most public servants recruited prior to 1995 pay a reduced PRSI rate of 0.9% and so they are not generally entitled to the State pension.  Therefore, in such cases, the marriage bar would not be expected to have impacted on State pension entitlement, as they would not have qualified for that payment had they remained in public sector employment.  Instead, by impacting upon their continuing public service employment, the marriage bar&rsquo;s pension implications, where they exist, more generally relate to a person&rsquo;s eventual entitlement to a Public Service pension.  Any questions regarding this issue are a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension there are supports available in the overall State pension system which assists qualification for a contributory payment, based on factors such as the contributions made by their spouse, and/or other factors likely to impact upon their needs. These include &ndash; </p>  <p>   - The Homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, which was introduced to make qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties. This applies to periods following the introduction of that scheme in 1994.</p>  <p>   - Widows generally qualify for a full-rate Widows Contributory Pension.</p>  <p>   - Increases for Qualified Adults.</p>  <p>   - Credits for periods of unemployment and illness. </p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;227 (over 95% of the maximum rate of the contributory pension). </p>  <p>  I know my office received this query from your office and responded with a reply.</p></reply>

We recognise the positive steps that the new Government of Myanmar/Burma has taken in pursuit of peace and reconciliation, democratic reforms and economic growth. As noted in my reply to parliamentary question number 137 of 14 December 2016, I am however deeply concerned about the plight of the Rohingya people in Myanmar, as well as Rohingya refugees in neighbouring countries, particularly in light of the escalation of violence in Rakhine State in the wake of attacks on police posts near Myanmar/Burma&rsquo;s border with Bangladesh in October 2016.I note with serious concern the report of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights which issued on 3 February, which outlined experiences of the Rohingya community who recently entered Bangladesh from Rakhine State. </p><p>Ireland has consistently called for an independent investigation into the allegations of human rights violations by the security forces, as well as the need for the full restoration of humanitarian and media access to Rakhine State, most recently in its national statement at the Interactive Dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar/Burma on 13th March at the 34th session of the Human Rights Council<font color="#004080"> </font>(HRC 34).</p><p>At HRC 34, Ireland has also supported the ongoing drafting of the EU-led resolution on the situation of human rights in Myanmar/Burma, which conveys the HRC&rsquo;s serious concerns over the recent deterioration in the security, human rights and humanitarian situation in Rakhine State.

A civic forum was set up in 2000 and met on a number of occasions but was suspended following the collapse of the political institutions in October 2002. Following the restoration of devolved government in 2007 a review of the Forum was announced by the new Executive but was not re-established.</p>  <p>  In addressing outstanding commitments, the parties to the Stormont House Agreement in 2014 agreed that it was important that civic voices be heard and their views considered in relation to key social, cultural and economic issues. A new model was envisaged through the establishment of a compact civic advisory panel, to meet regularly and to advise the Northern Ireland Executive. In the Fresh Start Agreement of November 2015, the parties committed to the establishment of a compact civic advisory panel.</p>  <p>  On 6 December 2016, the then First and deputy First Minister announced the formation of such a civic advisory panel. The 6-person panel will consider specific issues relevant to the Executive&rsquo;s Programme for Government and engage with civic society stakeholders. Reporting to the Executive, the panel may also propose subjects it wishes to consider.</p>  <p>  The establishment of the civic advisory panel by the Northern Ireland Executive is very welcome as it fulfils the commitment under the Stormont House and Fresh Start Agreements and, when fully operating, should allow for stronger representation of civil society voices in policy formation in Northern Ireland, as envisaged under the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  In terms of other support to civic engagement and inter-community dialogue, my Department&rsquo;s Reconciliation Fund provides funding to non-governmental organisations, community groups, and voluntary organisations to support reconciliation and to create better understanding between people and traditions on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain. The Reconciliation Fund has been running since 1982, and was increased significantly in 1998, following the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. As part of the 2014 Stormont House Agreement, the Government committed to guaranteeing the continued allocation of &euro;2.7 million annually to the Reconciliation Fund. </p>  <p>  In the second round of 2016 funding, over &euro;1m was announced in December 2016 for grants under the Reconciliation Fund to support 60 organisations working on peace and reconciliation.</p>  <p>  In relation to inter-community dialogue, I would also note that the European Union Peace Programme have also, over a number of years, provided extensive financial support for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border Region. The current PEACE IV programme includes as a specific aim the improvement of cross-community relations and further integration of divided communities. </p>  <p>  Finally, I would note that the Government&rsquo;s All Island Civic Dialogue on Brexit provides a further important forum, ensuring civil society voices, North and South, are heard and taken account of in preparing for and dealing with the all-island implications of Brexit. There have so far been two plenary sessions of the Dialogue and fourteen sectorial events.  The Civic Dialogue has provided valuable opportunities for Ministers to engage directly with stakeholders across the island of Ireland on the implications of the Brexit process for their sector. The Civic Dialogue will continue to inform the Government&rsquo;s approach to managing Brexit, and the Government is considering the best way through which to continue these valuable discussions.</p></reply>

The Agreements, and the principles and values underpinning them, are at the core of the Government&rsquo;s approach to peace, reconciliation and prosperity on this island.  The Government will continue to work tirelessly for that full implementation in both letter and spirit.</p>  <p>  The power-sharing Assembly and Executive are at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement and an essential part of the cross-community partnership that is the basis of the peace process. These institutions are indispensable for addressing the needs and concerns of people in Northern Ireland, including peace, prosperity and reconciliation. </p>  <p>  As co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, both Governments have a role to play in supporting the effective operation of the devolved institutions, and in upholding both the letter and the spirit of the Agreement as a whole, in the interests of all in Northern Ireland. In this context I am representing the Government in the ongoing talks at Stormont Castle. The discussions are focused on addressing outstanding issues, including the implementation of past agreements and addressing the legacy of the past, as well as on the formation of a new power-sharing Executive.  Both parts of these discussions are essential and inter-dependent.  </p>  <p>  I expect to be intensively engaged this week in Belfast, working with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties to see the power-sharing Assembly and Executive restored to effective and harmonious operation. As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement the Government is determined to uphold the principles of the Agreement and to protect its institutions.</p>  <p>  In terms of other support to inter-community dialogue, my Department&rsquo;s Reconciliation Fund provides funding to non-governmental organisations, community groups, and voluntary organisations to support reconciliation and to create better understanding between people and traditions on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain.

Between 1 January and 16 March a total of 191,428 applications were received compared to a total of 155,163 for the same period last year.  This represents an increase of over 23% in volume.  </p><p>The Passport Service is working extremely hard to manage the ongoing surge in passport applications.  A total of 230 Temporary Clerical Officers have been assigned to the Passport Service to assist with the processing of passport applications and to respond to customer queries including via phone calls, emails and social media.  This is an increase of 59 officers over the number recruited in 2015. The majority of the TCOs are already in place and the remaining officers will join in the coming weeks.  </p><p>In addition to the recruitment of Temporary Clerical Officers, my Department has requested the Public Appointments Service to assign additional Clerical and Executive Officers to fill recent vacancies in the Passport Service.  </p><p>The turnaround times for the each category of passport applicant are updated weekly on the Passport Service website.  The average processing time for renewal applications submitted through Passport Express is currently 16 working days (our aim is a 15 day turnaround).  First time applicants or those with lost/stolen passports take longer because of additional anti-fraud measures and these applications are being processed in an average of 23 working days (our aim is a 20 working day turnaround).  </p><p>The Passport Service advises customers to apply at least six weeks prior to travelling and to submit their application through Passport Express if they have no immediate travel plans.  There are a limited number of appointments available at the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork for those travelling in three weeks or less.  These appointments can be made online.</p><p>The Passport Service offers a free email reminder service to holders with passports due for renewal and I would urge the Deputy to promote use of this facility where possible.

Both Governments agreed on the need for intensive engagement to address outstanding issues and commitments to ensure the early establishment of an Executive.  </p>  <p>  As co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, both Governments have a role to play in supporting the effective operation of the devolved institutions, and in upholding both the letter and the spirit of the Agreement as a whole, in the interests of all in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  In this context I am representing the Government in the ongoing talks at Stormont Castle. The discussions are focused on addressing outstanding issues, including the implementation of past agreements and addressing the legacy of the past, as well as on the formation of a new power-sharing Executive.  Both parts of these discussions are essential and inter-dependent.  </p>  <p>  All parties have shown a willingness to engage on the key issues. However, there is a limited timeframe for the formation of a new Executive. In the time remaining, all sides, including the two Governments and the parties, will have to work hard and with a spirit of compromise, to achieve the collective objective of re-establishing the power-sharing institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  Particular responsibilities attach to the parties who are entitled to nominate a First Minister and deputy First Minister to engage with each other, and to advance discussions with the other political parties, on the formation of a new Executive.</p>  <p>  As part of my engagement with the Secretary of State and with each of the parties in the current discussions, I have emphasised the critical importance of forming a new Executive so that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s interests can be represented as effectively as possible in the preparations for the EU-UK negotiations. I very much hope that the new Executive will be in place as soon as possible so that it can directly represent the interests of the people of Northern Ireland in these vital negotiations.</p>  <p>  The interests of the island as a whole and protecting the gains of the peace process will remain a priority for the Government in the upcoming EU-UK negotiations and the Government will continue to be proactive in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland, including through engagement with the Northern Ireland parties. The Government&rsquo;s All-Island Civic Dialogue is also a central strand of our approach to preparing for and managing Brexit. </p>  <p>  I expect to be intensively engaged this week in Belfast, working with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties to see the power-sharing Assembly and Executive restored to effective and harmonious operation. As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement the Government is determined to uphold the principles of the Agreement and to protect its institutions.</p></reply>

The UK Government had previously ratified the Convention.  </p><p>The Council of Europe Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities published its Fourth Opinion on the United Kingdom on 9 March 2017.  The Advisory Committee made a number of observations and recommendations in relation to the status and protection of the Irish language in Northern Ireland, which relate to provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent Agreements. </p><p>The Committee&rsquo;s recommendations include the adoption of appropriate legislation by the Northern Ireland Assembly as a necessity to protect and promote the Irish language.  The Committee also called on the UK Government to help create the political consensus needed for such adoption.  The Committee made further recommendations in relation to support for Irish-medium education, Irish language teaching and shared education in Northern Ireland.  The Committee also made a recommendation on funding under the BBC Charter for programming in minority languages, in particular the Irish language. </p><p>The Council of Europe Advisory Committee report is a welcome and timely contribution to the current discussions on ensuring respect for linguistic diversity and the Irish language in Northern Ireland, consistent with the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.  </p><p>Further to the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, a specific commitment to an Irish Language Act in Northern Ireland to be enacted by the British Government was part of the St Andrews Agreement in 2006.  Successive Irish Governments have advocated in favour of an Irish Language Act and continue to do so.  Regrettably to date, there has been no agreement within the Northern Ireland Executive to take forward what is now a devolved matter.  </p><p>As part of the outstanding commitments under previous Agreements, the question of an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland was discussed on several occasions during the Stormont House negotiations in late 2014.  While I and other Irish Government representatives advocated for this commitment being honoured and implemented, regrettably it was not possible to reach agreement for such an explicit undertaking.  Nevertheless, in the text of the final Stormont House Agreement, the Government and the British Government, recalling the commitments from previous Agreements, endorsed the need for respect for and recognition of the Irish language in Northern Ireland.</p><p>The Stormont House Agreement provides for regular review meetings with the participation of the Government, the British Government and the Executive party leaders.  At the last two Review Meetings &ndash; most recently in December &ndash; I had the opportunity to draw attention to these outstanding commitments, including in relation to the Irish language, and asked that they remain on the agenda for future review meetings.</p><p>As part of the current talks process in Northern Ireland, I have engaged in<font color="#004080"> </font>discussions with the British Government and the main political parties on outstanding commitments and the implementation of past agreements.  In relation to the Irish language in my discussions with the British Government and each of the parties, I have noted clearly the Government&rsquo;s support for a statutory basis for the<font color="#004080"> </font>Irish language in Northern Ireland, consistent with our support for an Irish Language Act over many years.</p><p>The Government will continue to support the Irish language on an all-island basis, including through financial support for the work of Foras na Gaeilge.  The Government will continue to work with the British Government and the political parties in Northern Ireland to seek the full implementation of all provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent Agreements, including those relating to the Irish language.</p></reply>

Consequently, the efficient management of parking spaces and traffic flow on hospital campuses is of crucial importance. This is to ensure on-going availability of parking spaces; free flow of traffic on campus; unobstructed access for emergency vehicles at all times; proper use of spaces designated for drivers with disabled permits; and proper use of spaces designated as drop off points near the hospital entrance.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that income from car parking charges in most statutory hospitals and some voluntary hospitals forms an integral part of the hospitals budgetary policy and is invested back into services provided at the hospitals.  Income is also used to fund the upgrade and upkeep of the car parks, including security and management systems. </p>  <p>  Arrangements for car parking generally is an operational matter for the HSE. The HSE has also advised that it does not provide guidelines on hospital parking and each hospital/hospital group implements their own guidelines.  I understand that some hospitals continue to provide reduced rate parking rates for long-term patients and visitors for whom the payment of the full rate would cause hardship.</p></reply>

It is envisaged that the General Scheme will be completed by the end of June 2017.  Once the General Scheme has been completed, a memo will be submitted for Government approval, and once approved by Government, the General Scheme will be submitted to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health for pre-legislative scrutiny.</p>  <p>  The proposed legislation will take cognisance of the 2014 Supreme Court judgment in the MR &amp;amp; Anor v An tArd Chl&aacute;raitheoir &amp;amp; Ors (surrogacy) case, which found that the birth mother, rather than the genetic mother, is the legal mother.  It is envisaged that the legislation will establish a mechanism for transfer of parentage from the surrogate (and her husband, if she has one) to the intending parents.</p>  <p>  The intention of the legislation in this area is to protect, promote and ensure the health and safety of parents, others involved in the process (such as donors and surrogate mothers) and, most importantly, the children who will be born as a result of AHR.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that, under the provisions relating to surrogacy in the General Scheme of AHR and associated research, surrogacy will be permitted on an altruistic basis, though, the reimbursement of reasonable expenses will be allowed.  However, due to the concerns raised in relation to the welfare of the children, the potential for financial coercion and the risk of the exploitation of financially vulnerable women, commercial surrogacy will be prohibited.</p></reply>

Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria.</p><p>1. The health needs of the public.</p><p>2. The cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services.</p><p>3. The availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement.</p><p>4. The proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks.</p><p>5. The potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item.</p><p>6. The clinical need for the item or listed item.</p><p>7. The appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety.</p><p>8. The efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it eats a condition than existing therapies).</p><p>9. The resources available to the HSE.</p><p>I am informed that the HSE received a request and economic dossier from the manufacturer of Respreeza, for reimbursement of maintenance treatment of emphysema in adults with documented severe alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency.</p><p>In June last year, the HSE asked the NCPE to carry out a health technology assessment on the cost effectiveness of this treatment.  The NCPE completed its assessment and made a recommendation on 9 December 2016.  The NCPE determined that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness of the drug and did not recommend it for reimbursement.</p><p>A summary of the health technology assessment has been published on the NCPE website and is available at: .</p><p>The HSE considers the NCPE assessment, and other expert advice, as part of its decision-making process for reimbursement, which is made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE in line with the 2013 Act.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed that the drug Respreeza was considered by the HSE Drugs Group, which did not make a recommendation for reimbursement on clinical grounds.  The HSE Leadership team has accepted the Drugs Group recommendation of non-reimbursement.</p><p>Under the HSE statutory assessment process, the HSE is required to set out a notice of any proposed decision to an applicant company.  The HSE is legally required to provide at least a 28 day period (from the formal written notice of proposal), to enable the company to consider any such proposal not to reimburse and to make representations to the HSE if it wishes to do so.  The HSE is required to consider any such representations in advance of a formal decision.</p><p>Therefore, as the statutory process is still ongoing, the company has an opportunity to have further discussions with the HSE.</p><p>In relation to the access scheme, the operation of such schemes is at the discretion of manufacturers.  As Minister for Health I have no role in the operation of these schemes.  There is no provision in Irish legislation for the approval of compassionate use programmes for specific groups of patients with an unmet medical need.</p><p>I have previously said that any attempts by manufacturers to link continued access, for patients already being treated with a new medicine, with decisions under the statutory reimbursement process is both inappropriate and unethical.  Manufacturers should operate such schemes in a compassionate and not a commercially-motivated manner.  There should be no link between compassionate use schemes and reimbursement decisions and manufacturers should be open with patients and clinicians from the outset.</p></reply>

The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill contains a suite of meaningful measures to reduce the level of harmful consumption of alcohol in Ireland and the harms caused by alcohol.</p><p><b>Separation and Reducing Visibility</b></p><p>The Bill provides for restrictions on the display, advertisement and visibility of alcohol products in mixed trade retail outlets.  These provisions address concerns that alcohol is not an ordinary consumer product but a psychoactive drug that requires a licence for sale.  The separation and reduced visibility of alcohol products in the manner prescribed will achieve the following objectives:</p><p>- access to alcohol products will be controlled in premises to which it applies;</p><p>- alcohol products cannot be on open display near grocery products, thereby discouraging impulse purchases and the purchase of alcohol products as part of everyday household grocery shopping;</p><p>- separate display of alcohol products or closed display in storage units will make alcohol products less visible to children and protect them from in-store marketing techniques.</p><p>The options provided for in the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill address the reasonable need for flexible implementation of the requirement to separate and reduce visibility of alcohol products in mixed trade retail outlets.</p><p><b>Labelling </b></p><p>The principle of the labelling provision is to provide consumers with information about the alcohol product and to provide health warnings.  The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill provides a 3 year lead in time for the introduction of the labelling provisions.  This time frame is considered to give sufficient time for manufacturers and retailers to prepare for these new provisions.  The labelling provisions are necessary as part of the suite of measures to increase awareness and knowledge of the dangers posed by alcohol consumption.  Research indicates that the labelling measures will be welcomed by consumers.  The Health Research Board Report &lsquo;Alcohol: Public Knowledge, Attitudes and Behaviours&rsquo; stated that there is strong support for more labelling on cans and bottles containing alcohol.  The vast majority of those surveyed support including the number of calories (82 per cent), details of alcohol-related harms (95 per cent) and the ingredients (91 per cent) of alcohol products.</p><p>My Department considers that the suite of measures contained in the Bill are a proportionate response to address the harms caused by the misuse of alcohol and bring about a cultural shift in our attitude to alcohol.  The Bill commenced Committee Stage in the Seanad on the 26 October 2016.  The Bill is scheduled to return to Committee Stage in the Seanad during this session of the Oireachtas.  In the interim, consideration is being given as to how best this important public health measure can be brought forward.</p></reply>

Ireland opted to apply clawback on the sale of entitlements without land.</p>  <p>  EU Regulations state that the application of "clawback" must not present a substantial obstacle or prohibition of the transfer of entitlements in a Member State.  Ireland is one of the only Member States in the EU that operate a "conacre" system, and widespread corresponding short term leasing of entitlements.  In many cases the only option open to Irish farmers at risk of losing entitlements due to non usage is to lease entitlements without land to a farmer who has "naked" hectares to use them, thereby safeguarding their assets.  The introduction of "clawback" on leased entitlements would present a significant obstacle to this option.</p>  <p>  The option to lease entitlements without land is critical for many Irish farmers who are unable to obtain sufficient hectares of land to use their entitlements annually.  Under the Single Payment scheme the rotation of entitlements safeguarded farmers&rsquo; entitlements but this is not available under the Basic Payment Scheme where 100% of farmers&rsquo; entitlements must be used at least once every two years.  A large number of farmers in Ireland depend on the availability of affordable leased/ rented land to use their entitlements.  If farmers are unable to obtain leased/ rented land through unavailability or high price they are at risk of losing their Basic Payment scheme entitlements permanently through non-usage. In many cases the only option open to them is to lease their entitlements without land to a farmer who has naked hectares to use them, thereby safeguarding their assets.</p>  <p>  Decisions in relation to Basic payment Scheme entitlements including the National Reserve and &lsquo;clawback&rsquo; are made in consultation with the Direct Payments Advisory group which includes members of the main farming bodies and agricultural education and advisory services.  Following consultation with this group a decision was made to reduce the level of &lsquo;clawback&rsquo; on the sale of entitlements without land from 50% in 2016 to 20% in 2017.  The group did not express support for the option to apply &lsquo;clawback&rsquo; to the lease of entitlements without land. </p></reply>

Some 6,250 applicants were allocated entitlements under the 2015 National Reserve.  There was no National Reserve in 2016 as all available funding of &euro;24 million had been fully utilised under the 2015 scheme. In 2017 the National Reserve is being funded from a linear cut to all entitlements held under the Basic Payment Scheme. </p>  <p>  In line with the Programme for Government commitment  Department officials consulted with the EU Commission with regard to funding of &lsquo;specific disadvantage&rsquo; categories such as &lsquo;Forgotten farmer&rsquo; under the National Reserve in 2017 and future years.  The Commission has confirmed that Member States cannot use the proceeds of a linear cut to fund the specific disadvantage categories of the National Reserve.  The only funding option for this category is natural replenishment, but only after the 2 priority categories of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant&rsquo; have been catered for. </p>  <p>  Decisions in relation to the funding and operation of the National Reserve in future years can only be made once the position regarding remaining funding following the 2017 scheme year becomes apparent.  Consultation between Department officials and the Direct Payments Advisory Committee comprising members of the main farming organisations, agricultural education and farm advisory bodies takes place annually as part of the decision making process for the National Reserve.</p></reply>

In addition any such limitation would be contrary to existing Government policy, such as those contained in the Agri-taxation Review, which provides the granting of tax relief to include entitlements where a farmer leases both his land and entitlements. One of the qualifying criteria for the tax relief is the lease must be for a definite<b></b>term of five years or more.  Applying a limitation to the number of year&rsquo;s entitlements may be leased, would undermine the extension of the tax relief to cover entitlements and therefore be contrary to existing policies aimed at supporting generational renewal in the agriculture sector.</p></reply>

One of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some agriculture sectors.  This Scheme is significant in this regard, providing farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital, which will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.</p>  <p>  SBCI uses the &euro;25 million of public funding provided by my Department to leverage the total amount of &euro;150 million and, along with the European Investment Fund&rsquo;s &lsquo;COSME&rsquo; (the EU programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs), is providing the guarantee required to underpin the loan&rsquo;s flexibility and lower the cost of the loans.  The Scheme is administered through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank and they will report on progress to the SBCI on a regular basis, although no official returns have been made to my Department as yet.  However all of the banks have confirmed that they have applications up to the amounts available under the Scheme.  There may be some residual availability but this will only emerge as applications are processed and loans drawn down.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s contribution of &euro;25 million includes &euro;11 million from the EU&rsquo;s &lsquo;exceptional adjustment aid for milk and other livestock farmers&rsquo;.  It was this exceptional aid package which facilitated the Scheme from an EU State Aid perspective, and additional funding is not possible under this particular arrangement.  Other sectors, such as tillage and horticulture, were facilitated by national funding under the &lsquo;de minimus&rsquo; State Aid rules.</p>  <p>  I am very pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance. I hope that the commercial banks will respond positively to this demand by reducing interest rates and providing more flexible terms for cash flow loans in the future.  I plan to meet with the Chief Executives of the banks shortly to discuss this and other issues relating access to finance in the agri-food sector.</p></reply>

The report of the Cost of Insurance Working Group was published in January 2017, and all stakeholders are currently working to implement the recommendations to strict deadlines.  I would, however, point out to the Deputy that neither I, nor any other Government Department, have the power to direct insurance companies on the pricing of insurance products.  The EU framework for insurance expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  However, I am confident that the implementation of the recommendations of the Cost of Insurance Working Group will assist in driving down the cost of motor insurance in Ireland.</p></reply>

However, the NCPF has been integrated into the Development Plans of the majority of local authorities so ensuring that the objectives and policies to support and promote cycling are taken account of in current and future planning.  In addition, the National Transport Authority (NTA) published the GDA Cycle Network Plan covering the seven local authority areas in the Greater Dublin Area in 2013.I think that the success of the framework can be seen in the significant increase in the numbers of people cycling numbers shown in the Dublin City Canal Cordon Report for 2016 published recently by Dublin City Council and the NTA. This showed that over 12,000 people cycled into Dublin's centre in November last year in the morning peak, nearly the same number as used the LUAS during the morning peak commuting hours. It must be remembered that this figure does not include the numbers using Dublin Bikes between the canals.   In 2013 and 2015 my Department requested local authorities and other stakeholders for an update on progress on implementation.  The Department now intends to undertake a full review of the framework and we will be pursuing this during 2017.</p></reply>

This Government has supported that role through the 11% cumulative increase I secured in Budget 2017 for both the Public Service Obligation (PSO) programme and the Rural Transport Programme. That increase means that in 2017 approximately &euro;277million will be available to the National Transport Authority (NTA) to support these important programmes, which underpin the delivery of taxpayer funded bus services across rural Ireland. I have committed publicly to further increasing the funding of those programmes in the future as resources allow.   Bus &Eacute;ireann has benefitted from that increased funding for its PSO services and I have no doubt it will benefit again this year. So let's be clear, publicly funded bus services in rural Ireland are expanding and improving and that includes Bus &Eacute;ireann's PSO network.</p>  <p>  I have no doubt the Deputy is aware that across rural Ireland the publicly funded bus services are complemented by a huge range of privately operated bus services. These bus services are provided by operators under licence from the National Transport Authority pursuant to the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009, receive no taxpayer funding and operate on a commercial basis. Unlike the PSO network, commercial routes are decided by the operator with a view to a commercial return. In 2015 around 23 million people travelled on a commercial bus service, which represents approximately 9% of all public transport journeys that year.</p>  <p>  I have repeatedly assured rural Ireland that the NTA has the statutory powers available to it to ensure continued public transport connectivity for communities who may lose services in cases where a commercial operator introduces service changes. In its recent response to proposed Expressway route changes announced by Bus &Eacute;ireann, the NTA has utilised these statutory powers through for example announcing increased PSO services and amending the scheduling of existing rural transport services in order to address identified transport needs caused by the Expressway changes.</p></reply>

Ireland has successfully passed the Applicant Phase of that process and is now through to the Candidate Phase.

At an individual level the resources required to achieve a minimum essential standard of living is very dependent on family circumstances and thus the interaction of individual earnings with household income and State-provided supports such as Child Benefit, Family Income Supplement as well as supports available in relation to housing, education and health all contribute to an individual&rsquo;s standard of living. </p>  <p>  It is important that Ireland&rsquo;s statutory National Minimum Wage and the Living Wage concept are not conflated. The Living Wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual&rsquo;s basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare.  The Living Wage is voluntary and has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement.  It is different to the National Minimum Wage which is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis. </p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission was established in 2015 and its primary function is to, on an annual basis, examine and make recommendations on the national minimum wage, with a view to securing that the national minimum wage, where adjusted, is adjusted incrementally over time having had regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels.  The Commission presented its first report in July 2015 in which it recommended an increase of 50 cents per hour to the minimum hourly rate bringing it to &euro;9.15.  That increase, which was accepted by Government, came into effect on 1 January last. </p>  <p>  The Commission presented its second report in July 2016 and its recommendation that the minimum wage be increased to &euro;9.25 per hour was subsequently accepted by Government and came into effect on January 1 last. </p>  <p>  The Deputy might note that the most recent figures published by EUROSTAT show that Ireland has the second highest national minimum wage of any country in the EU at &euro;1,563 per month, behind only Luxembourg whose minimum wage is &euro;1,999 per month. (EUROSTAT for comparison purposes converts countries hourly or weekly rates into monthly rates).  </p>  <p>  I have no plans to bring forward proposals outside of the work of the Low Pay Commission.</p></reply>

These conclusions have a broad focus on youth affairs, including education, training, learning mobility and employment.</p>  <p>  Ireland's youth unemployment rate continues to decline as the labour market improves.  Eurostat measure Ireland's youth unemployment at 15.1% in January, down from 17.6% from January 2016 and significantly below the euro area average of 20%.</p>  <p>  While this improvement is welcome, the Government recognises the importance of a continued focus on measures to facilitate young unemployed people find and sustain employment. </p>  <p>  The key objective of Ireland&rsquo;s policy response to the EU Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee is to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  In this regard, the Department of Social Protection is overseeing specific measures to address these challenges.  I am confident these measures, and continuing economic recovery, will support further youth employment opportunities.</p></reply>

Our enterprise base is more competitive, export oriented and more innovative.  Jobs are being created by enterprises in every region and every sector in the country.  The Action Plan for Jobs process, which I and my Department co-ordinate across Government, has been very successful. </p>  <p>  Almost 206,000 more people are at work since the first Plan was launched in 2012 - that is an average of just under 40,000 per annum over the last five years.  We want to add up to 45,000 more jobs in 2017.</p>  <p>  As Minister, I want two of every three jobs created in the regions.  I will shortly announce a competitive call for innovative proposals to boost regional growth, with funding of up to &euro;60 million. </p>  <p>  We will promote the development of a network of eHubs across the regions, beginning with an audit of all existing and potential hubs. </p>  <p>  EI&rsquo;s target is to add 15,000 gross new jobs in 2017, support 250 large scale investments, win an extra 1,000 sales contracts and increase exports to &euro;23 billion. </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices support a net increase in employment of over 3,800 in 2016 and we are targeting a similar increase in 2017.</p>  <p>  We are also developing an integrated communications plan to raise awareness of the range of enterprise supports available and how to access them.</p>  <p>  We also want to ensure that all sections of the workforce contribute to their full potential and as Minister, I am placing an emphasis on female participation and female entrepreneurship in particular.  We are focusing on the older workers in the labour market through a combination of measures.  This includes a new draft Code of Practice to set out best practice in managing the engagement between employers and employees in the run up to retirement and measures to support senior entrepreneurship. </p>  <p>  We will launch a toolkit for employers and employees to engage in workplace innovation and roll out a pilot programme. </p>  <p>  We will harness the creativity of our citizens to address these challenges and opportunities.  Creativity and our strength in design can give us a competitive advantage in all sectors of the economy from manufacturing to retail. </p>  <p>  Maximising the retail potential of our town centres is vital and we are committed to developing a template for retail development in our towns. </p>  <p>  I am also focusing on new opportunities arising from the digitalisation of the economy and society.  We will develop a whole of Government approach to realise the digital economy opportunities across all sectors, including a stakeholder summit in the first quarter. </p>  <p>  The National Broadband Plan (NBP), which is being delivered by my colleague Minister Naughten, aims to deliver high speed broadband services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland.  The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.   </p>  <p>  There has been significant progress in relation to broadband roll out so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint.  </p>  <p>  Minister Naughten has informed me that a formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.</p></reply>

(Under the current schemes, payment is largely based on receipt of social welfare payments, rather than income.)</p>  <p>  The base income threshold of &euro;22,700 in the new Affordable Childcare Scheme will guarantee that the maximum rate of subsidy is available to all families below the relative income poverty line, while ensuring that the taper rate between the base and maximum thresholds does not generate strong disincentive effects with regard to taking up or increasing employment.  It will also ensure that the majority of current scheme beneficiaries will receive the maximum subsidy rate under the new scheme.</p>  <p>  While the new scheme will target subsidies predominately based on income, it was considered whether other criteria such as a work/training requirement should also apply, i.e. whether the family needs childcare because both parents - or one parent in the case of a one-parent family - are working or in training.</p>  <p>  Incorporating a work/training test into the eligibility criteria ties the scheme more clearly to its labour market participation objective, given parents&rsquo; need for childcare availability to match hours of work.</p>  <p>  Given that both a child development objective and a labour market objective are relevant to this scheme, it was determined that there should be a balanced approach to eligibility: while parents will qualify for a subsidy because of their income level, participation in work/training will determine whether the subsidy is for enhanced hours of childcare (up to 40 hours per week) or standard hours of childcare (up to 15 hours per week).  When parents are not in work or training, childcare will be subsidised on a standard hours basis.</p>  <p>  This approach will mean that this scheme is open &ndash; albeit for standard hours rather than enhanced hours &ndash; to parents who stay at home to care for their children, or who are not taking part in work or training, but who choose to avail of up to 15 hours of childcare per week. This 15 hours is inclusive of time spent in school or the ECCE Programme each week; in the case of school-going children it is considered that the child development objectives are met through school attendance and, therefore, the standard 15 hours of subsidised childcare per week will be available only in holiday periods (i.e. non-term time).</p>  <p>  Finally, under the existing Community Childcare Subvention programme, to be replaced by this new scheme, beneficiaries may qualify for full-time childcare subsidies even if they are not in work or training.  During the transition to the new scheme, any current beneficiaries who face a reduction in their subsidy will enjoy a &ldquo;saver&rdquo; status whereby they will retain their existing benefits for a period of time following the introduction of the new scheme.  However, thereafter they, and any similar new entrants to the scheme, who are not in work or training will qualify for the standard hours of childcare only.</p></reply>

This has resulted in the occasional temporary closure by the Defence Forces of the Hollow Road.  The temporary road closures are required as part of strict control and safety measures put in place by the Defence Forces to ensure public safety during the firing of live ammunition on Range No. 3.</p><p>These occasional temporary road closures by the Defence Forces are in accordance with the provisions of Section 274 of the Defence Act, 1954, as amended.  This provides the Defence Forces with the powers to temporarily stop all traffic in the vicinity of any place used for rifle practices. It is acknowledged that the occasional temporary closure of the Hollow Road may be an inconvenience for some local residents.</p><p>I have been advised by the military authorities that signage is temporarily erected at either end of the Hollow Road and Brownstown on the day prior to the required closures.  This gives advance notice of the date and duration of the proposed road closure.  This alerts local residents and road users of the need to take alternative detour routes.  Military Sentries are on duty at either end of the Hollow Road during the road closures to control the traffic and to advise users of the alternative routes. The military authorities have also advised that red warning flags are flown while firing is being conducted, and warning lights are activated in the centre of the Curragh Camp outside of the water tower, in full view of the public as further safety and information notification measures.</p><p>The Defence Forces website, <i></i>, provides members of the public with details of planned road closures.</p><p>There are no plans in place to upgrade the signage at this time.</p></reply>
