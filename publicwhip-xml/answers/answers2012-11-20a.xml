It is established policy that guidance is a whole school activity and under existing arrangements each school develops a school guidance plan as a means of supporting the needs of its students. I am confident schools will act in the best interest of students.</p><p>  I acknowledge that the reduction in resources to second level schools is challenging for schools and this is borne out by the survey undertaken by the JMB. However, the budget measure that requires schools to manage the provision of guidance from within their standard staffing allocation, the alternative to which was to make an adjustment to the standard staffing schedule, must be seen in the context of our very difficult budgetary constraints. It is also worth pointing out that, as part of last years budgetary measures, my Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations.</p></reply>

The percentage of students who sit the Leaving Cert overall has risen by almost 9% to 90.2% in 11 years.</p><p>  It is particularly encouraging to see the retention rate in DEIS schools increase substantially, from 68.2% to 80.1%. The retention rates of pupils who entered the first year of the junior cycle in 2005 and 2006, which coincides with the introduction of DEIS, representing the first cohort of students to have DEIS resources available to them throughout their second level education.</p><p>  I do not propose to comment in detail on the contents of the Budget in respect of the education sector in advance of Budget Day. However, it is my intention to protect front-line provision, including that in DEIS schools, to the greatest extent possible.</p></reply>

The Economic Stimulus Package announced last July includes two further bundles of school projects that would be advanced in the context of my Department's five year school building programme, as well as a major project for the consolidation of Dublin Institute of Technology at Grangegorman. However, no decisions about funding have been made at this time. </p><p>  It is envisaged that if EIB funding is secured for these projects, it would be structured on the same basis as the recent third schools bundle with the EIB lending directly to the PPP project company.</p><p>  I would also add that, earlier this year, the EIB provided a direct loan of &euro;100 million to the Exchequer to enable the Department to finance a programme of traditional school building works as part of the overall five year school building programme.</p></reply>

Assessment will be a key component to supporting quality teaching and learning outcomes across the 3 years of Junior Cycle and will provide on-going high quality feedback to students and their parents. </p><p>  Assessment in the Junior Cycle is no longer high-stakes since in reality the vast majority of students continue to senior cycle. </p><p>  The current Junior Certificate examination is also at variance with best practice internationally. For example, in New Zealand, Finland, Scotland and Queensland high-stakes, public examinations are confined to the end of the senior cycle. They emphasise school-based assessment approaches throughout the lower-secondary cycle.</p></reply>

In addition, the joint Government-Industry ICT Action Plan, which has been developed as a direct response to identified ICT skills shortages, contains a comprehensive range of measures to build the domestic supply of ICT graduates, including through the roll out of over 800 places on graduate skills conversion courses from March 2012.

SUSI is staffed to the level that has been requested and all the necessary resources should be in place to enable them to process applications to completion, subject to all the necessary documentation being in order to enable them to make a decision in each case.

Teachers will receive professional development in educational assessment, including processes of moderation, and providing feedback to students. Continuing professional development (CPD) will be provided on a phased basis in line with the roll out of curriculum changes in each subject. The CPD programme will be developed over coming months and further information will be available when it is completed.</p><p>  Costs will arise in relation to staffing and substitution of teachers for attendance at in-service. Estimated costs will be of the order of &euro;3.6 million in 2013 and &euro;10 million on a full year basis for a period of at least 5 years thereafter.  From 2017 onwards there will be some savings in the budget of the State Examinations Commission but these will be absorbed in the reform of the Leaving Certificate.</p></reply>

My Department's opinion is that the level of investment required could be greater.</p><p>  In the light of the very difficult economic situation, and these significant costs, the previous Government deferred the full implementation of EPSEN.  The NCSE have been asked to provide comprehensive policy advice on how the education system can best support children with special educational needs. This advice will guide the preparation of a plan on how aspects of EPSEN can be implemented, including the prioritising of access to children with special needs to an individual education plan.</p></reply>

Given our recent population growth we will have a much increased enrolment at all levels of education which is expected to continue in the medium term. Many pupil places are required in areas that currently have no school provision at all and we have schools in areas of stable or declining population with relatively low pupil numbers. Our current configuration of small primary schools is being examined by my Department in a value for money review.  Among the issues the review will take into account are questions such as availability of diversity of provision, ethos of schools, parental choice, language of instruction, travel distances, transport costs and the impact of schools on dispersed rural communities. My Department expects to publish the analysis and findings shortly and I look forward to a constructive engagement on the matter.</p></reply>

A total of 10 proposals were received. These proposals were examined by an independent selection panel against the evaluation criteria which was an integral part of the Expression of Interest procedure.  Four of these proposals were short-listed for oral presentation.  Following this, the selection panel made a recommendation to the Minister for Education and Skills on the preferred proposal which was the City of Dublin VEC proposal to establish Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) as a unit of itself.</p><p>  The selection panel evaluated the proposals under the following criteria: organisational capacity to perform the function; experience in dealing with comparable schemes/services; existing core management, expertise and resources available to be deployed to the function; capacity to deliver strong cost and efficiency benefits; overall quality of the proposal for delivery of a central student grants function.</p><p>  Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI)'s proposal was underpinned by a staffing of 65 whole-time equivalents, thereby reducing the number of administration staff currently operating the system in the 66 grant awarding bodies by some 105 posts once the transition is complete. The 65 whole-time equivalents would be made up a combination of core staff which would be employed all year round and seasonal staff. This provided for the staff in SUSI to rise during the peak processing months.</p></reply>

A recent report by my Department's Inspectorate found that there is a trend towards the greater incorporation of ICT into classroom activities in our primary schools.</p><p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has developed an ICT framework which sets out a structured approach to ICT in curriculum and assessment. This sets out the types of learning appropriate for students during the period of compulsory education and provides a guide to teachers for embedding ICT across the curriculum. </p><p>  A Framework for Junior Cycle was published last month. It contains 24 Statements of Learning which students should experience. One of the Statements of Learning aims to ensure that all students &quot;use ICT effectively and ethically in learning and in life&quot;. The key skills in Junior Cycle include the use of digital technology to ensure successful learning by students. </p><p>  The Junior Cycle Framework will allow for the introduction of short courses. Seven short courses, including short courses on Digital Media Literacy and in Programming/ Coding, are currently being developed by the NCCA for use by schools from 2014. In addition, schools will have the opportunity to develop their own short courses, in accordance with set specifications, to reflect the needs and interests of their students.  </p><p>  My Department has introduced a number of measure to support the use of ICT in schools. These measure have included funding for increased broadband capacity in post-primary schools as well as funding for the provision of laptops/ PC and a data projector for teaching purposes in primary school classrooms. </p><p>  There is also a Transition Year option in relation to Having Fun with Computer Programming and Games and, under the ICT Action Plan, this is being expanded nationally. At Senior Cycle, the development of ICT skills is important not only in the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme and in the Leaving Certificate Applied but also in the study of Design Communication and Graphics where it is a core component of the learning. </p></reply>

In closing the gap between revenue and spending, unpalatable savings measures are necessary and savings for student supports were inevitable as part of that. Given the growth in demand for participation in third level, the Government has endeavoured, to the greatest extent possible, to protect disadvantaged students. </p><p>  This approach has enabled me to ensure that substantial allocations continue to be made to students from lower income backgrounds to achieve an under-graduate qualification to improve their job opportunities. Undergraduate students who qualify for a student grant have their student contribution paid on their behalf, and therefore the increases in this contribution does not impact on those students. Higher income thresholds exist for the payment of a fee grant towards the student contribution. Students from families with less than 4 children with a gross income of less than &euro;51,380 can qualify for full the student contribution and where the gross income is greater than &euro;51,380 but less than &euro;55,920 they can for 50% of the student contribution.

A loan system is now in place for such students by Bank of Ireland which is more flexible and affordable than standard unsecured personal loans as the repayment schedule provides for a significant period of interest-only payments.

At primary level, the P.E. curriculum includes six broad strands featuring Athletics, Dance, Gymnastics, Games, Outdoor and adventure activities and Aquatics.  A minimum of one hour of P.E. per week is recommended for all primary school pupils.</p><p>  At junior cycle, P.E. forms part of the new Junior Cycle Framework which I published last month.  Promoting physical activity, as well as enabling students to make healthy life choices more generally, are reflected in the 24 'statements of learning' that are at the core of the new Framework.  P.E. is also one of the short courses that will be developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) for use by schools on an optional basis from 2014.  </p><p>  At senior cycle, my Department is currently considering two new curricula for senior cycle P.E. &ndash; one for examination and the other a non-examination curriculum framework. </p><p>  There are other measures both within and outside of schools that complement the aims of the P.E. curriculum.  These include the following: </p><p>- Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE), which is mandatory at primary and as part of Junior Cycle, and which stresses the importance of regular exercise and the need for a balanced diet as essential to physical and mental well being. </p><p>- The Active School Flag, launched by my Department in 2009, which seeks to recognise schools (both primary and post primary) that provide quality P.E., co-curricular physical activity and sports programmes for their students.</p><p>- Many schools provide extensive programmes of physical activities outside of school hours in conjunction with sports organisations such as the Gaelic Athletic Association, Basketball Ireland, and the Football Association of Ireland. </p><p>- 'Sport for All' Day: my Department promotes the dedication of one day in the school year to encourage greater participation in sport at primary school level. </p><p>  While schools are playing an important role in promoting physical activity, and thereby contributing to tackling obesity, they cannot be expected to meet this challenge alone.  In particular, their efforts must be supported and complemented by parents and the local community, as well as other stakeholders, who have a crucial role to play in promoting health and well being in general at all stages of the life cycle. </p></reply>

The Programme for Government sets out that education will be a priority for this Government and that we will endeavour to protect and enhance the educational experience of children, young people and students.  Approximately 15% of the entire budget of my Department &ndash; some &euro;1.3 billion &ndash; was spent in support of children with Special Educational Needs in 2011.  The provision for the current year is in line with expenditure last year and shows that despite the current economic difficulties, the overall level of funding for special education has been retained.</p><p>  In line with this Government's commitment to frontline services for pupils with special educational needs: </p><p>- 10,575 whole time equivalent (wte) Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts are being provided for primary, post-primary and special schools for the coming school year in order to support the care needs of pupils with disabilities, of which 8,306 WTE SNAs have been allocated to Primary and Special Schools for the 2012/13 school year.</p><p>- Approximately 9,950 learning support/resource teacher posts, including those provided under the General Allocation Model, are also being provided in primary and post primary schools in order to provide additional teaching support to pupils with special educational needs,of which over 7,100 WTE posts are being provided in Primary schools.</p><p>- Approximately &euro;1.3m is also provided annually to schools for assistive technology support, of which almost &euro;1m is provided for Primary and Special schools.</p><p>- Over 1,100 teachers are also being provided for in special schools providing teaching to pupils with various disabilities at much reduced pupil teacher ratios, for example the autism PTR is 6:1 and the moderate general learning disability PTR is 8:1.</p><p>- Early educational intervention is provided for children with autism from 2&frac12; years of age.  There are now 76 early intervention classes for children with autism attached to mainstream schools that are funded by the Department.  Funding is also provided through the home tuition programme for children with autism who are unable to access placement in an early intervention class.</p><p>  This is in addition to funding provided by my Department in respect of school building adaptations, special School Transport arrangements and enhanced capitation rates which are payable to most special schools and special classes.   </p><p>  The continued commitment of this Government to special education provision, at a time when savings are being required across a range of expenditure areas, has ensured that children with special educational needs can continue to have access to educational facilities in line with their requirements.

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</p><p>  10,575 Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) SNA posts have been made available for allocation to schools by the NCSE throughout the current school year, subject to qualifying applications being received.  The NCSE allocates a level of SNA support for each school annually, taking into account the assessed care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school.  The NCSE initially allocated 10,311 WTE SNA posts to schools for the 2012/13 school year in June of this year, based on the number of valid applications received and the extent of the care needs of qualifying children.  A further 103 WTE SNA posts have since been allocated to schools which leave 161 posts available for allocation throughout the school year for new assessments of disability, new entrants, or emergency or late applications, in accordance with the terms of the SNA scheme.  The NCSE has estimated that based on the experience of last year, these posts should be sufficient to meet demand during the school year.</p><p>  The NCSE has also advised that every child who has met the criteria for access to SNA support in the current school year to date is in receipt of such support.</p><p>  Finally, I wish to confirm to the Deputy that this Government remains committed to protecting services for children with special educational needs.

There are two methods of tendering (the Restricted procedure and the Open procedure).  In both procedures there are minimum standards for participation (including previous experience, turnover, insurances, capacity to obtain a bond etc).  The minimum standards for participation are stated in the Contract notice/ eTenders advertisement. </p><p>  For less complex projects of a small to medium scale, the open procedure is generally used and all contractors meeting the minimum standards are entitled to submit a tender (thus facilitating the inclusion of small to medium enterprises and those with no experience in educational projects).  For larger or more complex projects, where it is considered that pre-qualification of contractors is warranted, the Restricted procedure is normally used.  In the Restricted procedure, there is an intermediary qualification stage during which the numbers of applicants is reduced (or restricted) to a specified amount (normally 10).  The criteria for suitability assessment, which are taken from the Department of Finance Capital Management Works Framework, include company turnover, insurances, capacity to obtain a bond, personnel for the project, previous experience, and Health and Safety competence.  Guidance on this process and standard questionnaires used by the Department are available on my Department's website. </p><p>  In any procurement process, my Department adheres to the rules and guidelines set down by the Department of Finance and the EU Commission in relation to public procurement.

This website has been developed as part of the Irish Government's Strategy for the Implementation of eProcurement in the Irish Public Sector.  The site is designed to be a central facility for all public sector contracting authorities to advertise procurement opportunities and award notices.  Contractors seeking to tender for public works contracts in Ireland are advised to register with this website and monitor it for tendering opportunities.</p></reply>

The Strategy Statement sets out eight strategic priorities for the period 2011-2014: Jobs and Growth, Europe, Programme for Government, Service, Reform, Trust, Fairness and Peace.  It also identifies horizontal action areas including policy capacity, implementation, communications, strategic thinking, working with others, incubation and innovation, changing the culture and rebuilding trust, and developing our internal capacity.</p><p>  The Strategy Statement also reflects the significant restructuring of the Department following the election of the new Government in 2011, including establishment of the Economic Management Council, a new Cabinet Committee structure, a Programme for Government Office, an Office of the T&aacute;naiste, a new integrated European Affairs Division, and transfer of staff and functions relating to public service reform to the new Department of of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  The HR Strategy sets out a range of actions to support the achievement of the Department's strategic priorities in the areas of Organisational Structure, HR Planning, Upskilling our Staff, Leadership Development, Communication and Consultation, Performance Management and Development, and Corporate and Legal Responsibilities.</p><p>  Through ongoing implementation of the Strategy Statement and the Human Resources Strategy, both of which cover the period up to 2014, my Department is responding comprehensively to the issues raised in the Organisational Review Programme.  Specific measures taken to date include:</p><p> - weekly meetings of the Management Advisory Committee (MAC)</p><p> - regular meetings of the MAC with Prinicipal Officers</p><p> - quarterly general staff meetings</p><p> - new ICT shared services initiative with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine</p><p> - completion of a skills availability and needs survey</p><p> - increasing policy analysis capacity available within the Department</p><p> - use of flexible arrangements such as secondments and internships, including for the EU Presidency</p><p> - new grade-based and skill development programmes</p><p> - a leadership development programme for senior management</p><p> - occasional 'lunch and learn' events for staff</p><p> - improved implementation of PMDS</p><p> - completion of a review of the National Economic and Social Council</p><p> - publication of an annual progress report on implementation of the Programme for Government</p><p>   My Department has also taken a number of steps to date in response to the commitment in the Strategy Statement relating to strategic thinking and planning.  The Department's capacity in this area has been increased through the secondment of staff with relevant skills from the National Economic and Social Council and Forfas, as well as the recruitment of a number of staff who are part of the new Government Economic and Evaluation Service.  This has enhanced the Department's capacity to support the Taoiseach and the Cabinet Committee system in dealing with strategic policy challenges facing the country.</p><p>  The Department also organised a seminar in May 2012 entitled <i>Perspectives on the Role of a Prime Minister&#8217;s Department </i>which considered how the Department could best perform as a &#8216;strategic centre&#8217; ensuring delivery of the Government&#8217;s priorities.  Speakers and participants gave an international and external perspective on how to develop the Department's role in this area.  Copies of the presentations are available on the Department's website.</p><p>  Specific recent initiatives include the work which the NESC is currently completing on a long-term socio-economic vision to underpin effective national transition to a low-carbon future by 2050, and the recent visit by former US Congressman Bruce Morrison to advise on future immigration and integration issues.</p><p>  The Department's Management Advisory Committee regularly reviews progress against the commitments in the Strategy Statement and will be leading further initiatives in this area over the period up to 2014.</p><p>  The Department's Annual Report for 2012 will give an overview of progress on all aspects of the Strategy Statement.</p></reply>

The objective was to leverage the collective buying power of all Government Departments and Offices for these events and thereby secure better value. A good competitive response was received and the hotels mentioned in the Deputy&rsquo;s question were identified as the most economically advantageous for the various events in question. Departments who will be hosting informal Ministerial meetings in Dublin will be contracting individually with these hotels for their requirements at the tendered rates.  </p><p>  While the precise number of rooms to be booked will vary between meetings, the Presidency will pay only for the hotel room for the Head of Delegation.                 </p><p>Similarly, it was decided in the interests of better competition to have an advertised tender for ground transport requirements during the Presidency. A primary competition was held to establish a framework of five suitably qualified service providers from whom a range of transport services will be procured by further competitive mini-tenders held by Departments/Offices over the coming months as and when needs arise. This framework is open to all Government Departments and Offices for their Presidency-related transport requirements. Details of the arrangements may be viewed on the National Procurement Service website www.procurement.ie.</p><p>  The provision of transport by the Presidency will be strictly controlled. My expectation is that, due to the concentration of Presidency events in the Dublin area, and the economies envisaged, the accommodation and transport costs for the Presidency will be kept under tight control.</p></reply>

I welcome the recent moves made by the Turkish authorities, including agreeing to allow family visits to Mr &Ouml;calan, and the submission of a bill to Parliament which will allow suspects to use the Kurdish language during their defence statements in trials. My firm belief remains that the best way forward has to be through a process of outreach and dialogue. I would encourage all sides to redouble their efforts to address the Kurdish issue in a peaceful and democratic manner. </p><p>  I also urge the Turkish Government to continue reach out to the Kurdish community. The escalation of PKK terrorist attacks makes it much harder to reach a solution, but the fight against terrorism must be conducted with due regard for human rights. As I stated in this House last week, Turkey, as an EU candidate, is expected to uphold the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms that are core values of the EU. These are issues which will continue to be raised in the context of the EU&rsquo;s ongoing dialogue with Turkey.</p></reply>

On foot of a Polish initiative, the EED builds on the EU&rsquo;s strong legacy in the promotion and development of democracy across the European continent and beyond. It is a welcome addition to the efforts to promote democratic reforms in the Union&rsquo;s Eastern and Southern neighbourhoods.    </p><p>  The EED is formally established as a private foundation under Belgian law and, as such, is not an EU institution.  The Board of Governors of the EED includes representatives from all the Union&rsquo;s 27 Member States. It also includes representatives from the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European External Action Service. The Board of Governors chooses the EED&rsquo;s Executive Director and its Executive Committee.  </p><p>  The EED currently has funding of some &euro;15 million pledged by the Commission and several Member States. The money available to the EDD may still increase as the pledging process is not closed as yet. Due to current economic and financial circumstances, Ireland is not in a position to make a financial contribution to the EED at present.  However the EED Statute provides for Member States to make contributions in kind. This enables EU Member States to contribute to the EED in a manner which is appropriate to their financial circumstances by organising seminars and conferences, as well as by sponsoring publications and training. Ireland will consider making contributions within this framework as circumstances permit.</p><p>  Ireland is currently represented on the Board of Governors of the EED by an official in the Permanent Representation of Ireland to the European Union who also acts as the Irish delegate to the Working Party on Eastern Europe and Central Asia (COEST). </p><p>  The first meeting of the EED took place in Brussels last week. At that meeting, the Board of Governors elected its Chair, co-opted three members of Civil Society to the Board and appointed three non ex-officio members to the Board.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that tax relief is already available at the taxpayers&rsquo; marginal rate in respect of the cost of employing a person (including a person whose services are provided by or through an agency) to take care of either a family member who is totally incapacitated by reason of physical or mental infirmity or a relative who is totally incapacitated by reason of physical or mental infirmity. Relative in this context includes a relation by marriage or civil partnership and includes an individual in respect of whom the claimant is or was the legal guardian. </p><p>  Tax relief may be claimed on the lower of the actual cost incurred in employing the carer or &euro;50,000.</p><p>  To extend the definition of incapacitation to include old age would not comply with the stipulation that an individual must be totally incapacitated by reason of physical or mental infirmity. Old age does not necessarily mean infirmity, as many elderly people live active and healthy lives. If an elderly person has an illness or is incapacitated, then they would be eligible individuals for the purposes of this tax relief. </p><p>  I would point out that the Revenue Commissioners indicated in Tax Brief No. 65 of 2006 that services provided 'by or through an agency' includes services provided by or through the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland and Home Instead Senior Care.</p></reply>

As of the end-October, total receipts from the pension levy this year amount to &euro;490 million. This is broadly in line with the amounts anticipated to be collected over the period.</p><p>  As regards the resources available for job creation these are detailed in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2012 which was published earlier this year. Further details on specific measures can be provided by the relevant Ministers.</p><p>  Employment data are presented in net terms and information on gross flows into and out of employment is not available, making it difficult to assess the number of jobs created by any policy initiative. For these reasons, it is not possible to provide figures on the number of jobs created by the Jobs Initiative   in Waterford City and County. </p><p>  Notwithstanding that quantifying the impact is difficult, I am confident that the measures introduced by the Government in May last year, such as reducing the rate of VAT in the high value added tourism sector, are playing an important role in both creating and sustaining employment. Encouragingly, there are signs of stabilisation in labour market conditions as evidenced by the standardised unemployment rate estimated from the live register. </p><p>  Finally, I want to reiterate that addressing the difficulties in the labour market remains the Government&rsquo;s biggest challenge and, accordingly, the Government is giving its highest priority to job protection and job creation.</p></reply>

The budget generally takes place in the first week of December in order to ensure that it is underpinned by the most robust data available including the very significant proportion of corporation and income tax revenues that are paid into the Exchequer in November. This enables an assessment of what impact revenue collection in the key month of November might have on budgetary plans for the following year.   </p><p>  That said, one of the reforms underway at European level concerns the bringing forward of a common budgetary timeline which will require that draft budgets be made public no later than 15 October each year. At this point, this new timeline seems likely to &ldquo;kick-in&rdquo; from 2013.  </p><p>  This means that much of our existing budgetary process, which is traditionally completed in the first week of December, will have to be finalised earlier in the year. While this will pose challenges for all concerned, effective action will be taken to ensure that we remain in full compliance with these requirements.</p></reply>

The Commission on Credit Unions was charged with bringing forward recommendations for the Irish credit union sector. It was not bound to limit its thinking to approaches in place in other financial sectors or in other jurisdictions. The Report is tailored to the Irish credit union system and does not apply 'banking' thinking nor does it slavishly import models from other international credit union movements. </p><p>  I understand that the Commission recommendation on term limits was the subject of much discussion at the Commission and the final agreed recommendation is clear and unambiguous as regards the limits to apply.  The Commission recommendation is reflected exactly in the Credit Union Bill 2012.</p><p>  This issue was raised during the second stage of the Credit Union Bill 2012 and I have indicated that I will give consideration to the issue of term limits at Committee Stage. However, it is important that the principle of board renewal is retained in the legislation. </p></reply>

For tax neutrality purposes the same VAT rate must apply to beverages such as soft drinks, fruit juices, smoothies and bottled water, regardless of their sugar content. While it is possible to apply a reduced VAT rate to soft drinks, this would have to apply to all beverages, including soft drinks with sugar and would be costly to the Exchequer.  However, it is not possible to apply a reduced rate to sugar free soft drinks, while applying the standard rate to soft drinks with sugar.  The application of the same VAT rate to these beverages is consistent across the EU.  Prior to 1992 bottled waters and fruit juices had applied at the zero rate, but were made subject to the standard rate from 1 November 1992 in order to correct the competitive anomaly, as the similar competing products such as soft drinks were standard rated.</p></reply>

The underlying approach of the Bank is to work constructively with each borrower on an individual basis.  I have been advised that the tenancy arrangements for commercial properties, financed by IBRC, are principally governed by contractual lease agreements between the borrower (or receiver) as landlord and the lessee (tenant).  In circumstances where IBRC receives a request from a borrower (or receiver), to add its consent to an amendment to lease terms, agreed with the lessee, typically a payment concession in terms of a lower rent or a rental holiday, the Bank will undertake a thorough review through its multi-faceted credit processes.  This will include a comprehensive assessment of the individual tenant&rsquo;s financial profile and underlying business circumstances, in order to assess fully their ability to meet their existing contractual obligations.  I have asked IBRC to review NAMA&rsquo;s policy guidance on upward-only rent reviews to see if IBRC could implement this policy guidance or a variation of this policy guidance.

The eighth review mission took place from Tuesday, 16 October to Thursday, 25 October last.  In line with each of the previous quarterly reviews, Ireland has met all of the commitments and our continued strong programme implementation has been recognised by the Troika.   My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and I met the EU-IMF delegation during the recent quarterly review of the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland.  These meetings were also attended by senior officials from both Departments.  A wide range of topics was covered at these meetings, including financial reforms, structural reforms, economic developments and the progress of the Programme.  The fiscal consolidation path, in terms of extending the period, was not discussed. </p><p>  We have agreed a timeline for correction of the deficit by 2015 with the European authorities. The fiscal consolidation path is set out in the Council Implementing Decision 2011/77/EU of 7 December 2010, and any change to this would require ECOFIN Council of Ministers agreement.  In addition, the Deputy should recall that we previously secured an extension of this timeline from 2014 to 2015.  Any further extension of the fiscal consolidation timeframe would most likely mean a higher peak debt ratio and more of the State&rsquo;s resources going towards debt servicing costs.  Both the debt and debt servicing costs are at a very high level already.  It is important they are stabilised and then reduced as quickly as possible.  The State entered into excessive deficit in 2008.  Based on the current plan, the State will be in excessive deficit for seven years, coming out of it only in 2015.  This is a long period of time to be running deficits in excess of 3% of GDP.  The Government is of the view that a 2015 deadline for correcting the deficit strikes the right balance between allowing the economic recovery to take hold but at the same time restoring sustainability to the public finances in a phased, timely manner.  The current consolidation strategy is delivering on its main aim of reducing the deficit and Government is of the view that it would not be wise to change course at this point.</p></reply>

As indicated in my previous response to the Deputy on this topic, EII is already available to the majority of SMEs including micro businesses. My concern in relation to providing a more attractive tax incentive for micro businesses is that it would draw investments away from other small businesses that do not meet the definition of a micro business which includes having less than 10 employees.  It is likely that any incentive scheme that is more attractive than another, in terms of tax relief or reduced risk, would draw investors in the first instance to it.  Only where such investors had access to greater amounts of capital to invest than allowed under the terms of the more attractive scheme, would they consider making other investments.  In this regard, it is worth pointing out that the high earners' restriction imposes a limit on the amount of specified tax reliefs that can be claimed in a single tax year of &euro;80,000 or 20% of adjusted income, whichever is higher.</p></reply>

Pensions are generally taken to be deferred income and any action to reduce a pension in payment needs to be comprehensively founded lest it run the risk of being considered an unjust attack by the State on the property rights of individuals affected by the proposed legislation.  In a general way, the intent of the Credit Institutions (Stablisalation) Act (CISA) 2010 is to operate its provisions at a system level to permit the imposition of obligations on credit institutions.  Accordingly, while individuals may be affected by the operation of CISA, the scope for it being used in the manner the Deputy suggests is severely limited.</p></reply>

Included in the response is an additional disclosure to its Interim accounts, stating that the Group now advises that it recorded an accounting write off amounting to &#8364;2.3 million of its impairment provisions in respect of Residential Mortgages in the Republic of Ireland in the six months ended 30 June 2012. </p><p><b>Bank of Ireland Statement</b>:</p><p>  &#8220;The level of disclosure that Bank of Ireland gives on its Irish Residential Mortgage portfolio has been favourably commended by investors and market commentators.</p><p>  Bank of Ireland gives significant and comprehensive disclosure on its provisioning policies per pages 124-126 of its Annual Report for the year to 31 December 2012.  There have been no material changes to these policies since then.  Bank of Ireland gives significant and comprehensive disclosure on its asset quality including in connection with Retail Ireland residential mortgages in pages 25-29 of its Interim Report for the 6 months to 30 June 2012 and gives further significant and comprehensive disclosure on its Retail Ireland Residential Mortgage portfolio in pages 107-117 of that Interim Report including that it had formally restructured or modified 15,861 mortgages at that date.  The Bank also has a significant number of informal temporary arrangements with customers.</p><p>  In its Interim Management Statement issued to the Stock Market on 13 November 2012 Bank of Ireland commented on its Irish Residential Mortgage book as follows:</p><p>  &#8220;We continue to actively focus on credit quality and our exposures to the Irish SME sector and our Irish Mortgage book continue to be key priorities.  With regard to our Irish Mortgage book, the pace of arrears formation has continued to reduce and we have continued to formally restructure and modify a significant number of customer mortgages on a sustainable basis.  86% of those customers whose mortgages are currently in formal restructure or modification are fully meeting their revised arrangements&#8221;.</p><p>  Bank of Ireland is conscious that this question was also asked at Bank of Ireland&#8217;s appearance at the recent meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Expenditure and Reform on 1 November 2012 and Bank of Ireland came in for some criticism in relation to its response to that question.  Bank of Ireland wishes to put this matter into context.  </p><p>  In such public appearances the Bank wishes to be as open as possible with members of the Committee.  It must also, however, be conscious of its responsibilities as a public company to adhere to the disclosure obligations of the various Stock Exchanges where the Bank is listed, including disclosure of matters the Bank considers to be commercially sensitive.  On this occasion, as previously, Mr Boucher stressed this responsibility, for the information of Members, in his opening remarks:</p><p><i>&#8220;The Bank is a public company that is subject to the listing rules of the Irish, London and New York stock exchanges.  The presentation is a public document and is presented under the rules of the aforementioned stock exchanges.  All comments I make are governed by the stock exchange disclosure rules.&#8221;  </i></p><p>  The Bank&#8217;s appearance before the Committee on 1 November 2012 was prior to it giving a Trading Update to the Stock Exchanges which was released to the markets on 13 November 2012 and on 13 November 2012, in conjunction with its Trading Update, the Bank successfully launched the first public non-Government guaranteed bond issued by an Irish Bank since 2010 raising &#8364;1billion in the process.  There would be very strict disclosure obligations prior to, at the time of and post events such as these. </p><p>  Spokespersons for the Bank cannot make incremental accounting disclosures for prior accounting periods unless they are described as being such when being made and have been extensively verified before being made.</p><p>  Consistent with its accounting policies, the Group only writes off debt once all avenues to recover the loans have been exhausted.  In the case of Residential Mortgages in the Republic of Ireland, this happens after the property has been repossessed / sold and all other means of recovering any residual amount owing have been exhausted.  As an additional disclosure to its Interim accounts, the Group now advises that it recorded an accounting write off amounting to &#8364;2.3 million of its impairment provisions in respect of Residential Mortgages in the Republic of Ireland in the six months ended 30 June 2012.</p><p>  Bank of Ireland has made several appearances in front of Oireachtas Committees in recent years and has at all times, provided significant information and sought to be helpful and cooperative in such engagements.  On the occasion of the previous appearance with the Committee on Finance, Expenditure and Reform in September 2011, members of the Committee were publicly complimentary on the openness and comprehensive nature of the contributions from the Bank.</p><p>  On the most recent occasion the Bank, once again, welcomed the opportunity to update members of the Committee on progress made by Bank of Ireland on its strategic objectives and to provide as much detail as possible on the Group&#8217;s business.  In this respect the Bank submitted, in advance, a detailed 31 slide presentation on its business and also responded to a lengthy questionnaire issued by the Committee.  </p><p>  Bank of Ireland is very much conscious of the support provided by the taxpayer, has always acknowledged this, and wished to provide an update on progress to a shareholder representing 15% of the Group&#8217;s stock.  In his opening remarks Mr Boucher stressed this point at some length:  with specific reference to slide 27 in the presentation he said:</p><p><i>&#8220;As investors and representatives of the taxpayer, we try to demonstrate [to you] what the taxpayer is getting out of its support for Bank of Ireland.  Our first task is to reduce the risk to the taxpayer from support provided by the taxpayer.  We believe the capital we have raised, the restructuring and deleveraging, the cost-reduction programmes we have undertaken, the agreement of our EU viability and restructuring plans, and the enhancement of our franchises &#8211; including the franchise in the UK, further protected by the extension of the Post Office contract &#8211; have been a very important part of reducing the risk to the taxpayer.  The most significant contingent liability the taxpayer has is in respect of the eligible liabilities guarantee or ELG.  Through a range of initiatives, particularly deleveraging and increasing our deposit franchises, we have reduced the liabilities under the ELG from &#8364;136 billion at their peak in September 2008 to &#8364;36 billion at the end of June.  They will have reduced further since that date.  Bank of Ireland notes that the ELG is due to expire on 31 December and we are prepared for that.</i></p><p><i>The State invested &#8364;4.8 billion in cash in Bank of Ireland in the period up to June 2012, and Bank of Ireland returned &#8364;2.5 billion in cash to the State in that period.&#8221;</i></p><p>  The presentation also noted rules governing profit disclosure, forward guidance etc at Page 2.</p><p>  The issues of disclosure and commercial sensitivity arose on a number of occasions during a lengthy hearing and Mr Boucher attempted to explain that, while wanting to be helpful, he was operating under disclosure obligations that inevitably constrained his ability to respond in full to some questions.  At one point in the transcript during an exchange where Mr Boucher was explaining this point he said:</p><p><i>&#8220;I apologise if I sound pedantic but I operate under strict rules.&#8221;</i></p><p>  The Bank understands the frustration expressed by some members of the Committee, in particular in relation to a perceived inconsistency with the position of other witnesses appearing before it.  Bank of Ireland cannot speak for other institutions but stresses that it has always been and must continue to be entirely consistent on its obligations as a public company.  </p><p>  The Bank regrets the frustration expressed by members of the Committee in this respect but asks for the Committee&#8217;s understanding of the Bank&#8217;s public company obligations and the Bank again reiterates its willingness to participate in the public engagement process including with Oireachtas Committees.  </p><p>  The Bank would also ask that any consideration of this matter include a review of the Bank&#8217;s presentation and submission as well as the full transcript of a lengthy hearing where, the Bank believes, it attempted to put important and relevant information on the public record and to help the Committee&#8217;s deliberations.&#8221; </p></reply>

In such cases the individual was entitled to apply to the Revenue Commissioners for a refund of the DIRT deducted from the deposit interest paid. </p><p>  In April 2007, this exemption became automatic (i.e., the interest is paid gross by the financial institution) on the submission of a declaration to the financial institution where the account is held.  To qualify for the automatic exemption, the individual must declare on form DE1 that they or their spouse or civil partner are aged 65 years or over during the year and&mdash;</p><p>1. in the case of an individual who is single,  his or her  total annual income does not exceed the current exemption limit of &euro;18,000, or</p><p>2. in the case of an individual who is married or in a civil partnership, the joint total annual income of the individual and his or her spouse or civil partner does not exceed &euro;36,000.</p><p>  Where the individual&rsquo;s circumstances change following the submission of this declaration form, they are required to notify the financial institution to that effect. </p><p>  Where a person&rsquo;s income exceeds the relevant exemption limit by a small amount, he or she will not be entitled to the exemption but may be entitled to a partial refund of the tax deducted.</p></reply>

The Central Bank&#8217;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears is a key protection and provides that each bank must put in place a formal Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process to deal with its mortgage customers who are in arrears or pre-arrears and for the establishment of dedicated arrears support units and appeals processes to handle such cases.  The Code highlights the importance of a borrower contacting their lender when they are in arrears or pre-arrears.  A key protection is a 12 month moratorium on action by lenders.  The Central Bank has published a guide for consumers on mortgage arrears called &#8216;Mortgage Arrears &#8211; A Consumer Guide to Dealing with your Lender&#8217; and this is available on the Central Bank website:  </p><p><i>   . </i></p><p>  The Government is committed to advancing appropriate measures to assist those mortgage holders who are experiencing real and genuine difficulty.  In this regard, the Government is now actively implementing the main recommendations contained in the &#8216;Keane Report&#8217;.</p><p>   A number of significant milestones have now been achieved:-</p><p>- The Personal Insolvency Bill was published last June and the Bill has been progressed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence and D&aacute;il Report stage on the Bill has recently concluded.  </p><p>- The Minister for Housing and Planning has formally launched the &#8220;mortgage to rent&#8221; scheme on a nationwide basis;</p><p>- Lenders have now provided details to the Central Bank on their proposed forbearance and loan modification options for appropriate cases.  The roll out of these options commenced in the final quarter of this year with Central Bank oversight; </p><p>- Also an extensive independent mortgage advice framework has now been put in place by the Minister of Social Protection comprising (i) an enhanced website www.keepingyourhome.ie (ii) a Mortgage Arrears information helpline, and (iii) the provision of free independent &#8216;one-to-one&#8217; professional financial advice to borrowers when considering a long term forbearance/resolution offer from their lender.  The list of accountants providing this service is located on the www.keepingyourhome.ie website.</p><p>  The general policy issue of mortgage arrears is of the utmost importance to Government and in recognition of this, the Taoiseach is chairing a special Government committee on mortgage arrears to oversee the overall Government response to tackle the problem. In addition to this, a high level Steering Group, chaired by the Department of Finance, is continuing to drive the implementation of the recommendations set out in the Inter-Departmental Group on Mortgage Arrears (the &#8216;Keane Report&#8217;) at official level.</p></reply>

This reduction is being effected through the  gifting of a proportion of salary to the Exchequer under Section 483 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. Gifting of a proportion of salary to the Exchequer under this provision does not affect the calculation of pension benefits.  The remuneration packages of the NTMA and NAMA chief executives are published in the Financial Statements of the relevant bodies included in their respective annual reports which are available on the websites <i>www.ntma.ie  </i> and www.nama.ie.  In respect of 2011 the details were as follows:</p><p><b>Chief Executive NTMA </b></p><p><table><tr><th>Salary</th><th>&#8364;490,000</th></tr><tr><td>Taxable benefits (car and health insurance)</td><td>&#8364;28,635</td></tr></table></p><p><pfli1></pfli1></p><p>The Chief Executive waived any consideration for performance-related pay in respect of 2010 and 2011.</p><p>Applying the 15% reduction agreed by the Chief Executive brings his salary to &euro;416,500.</p><p><b>Chief Executive NAMA </b></p><p><table><tr><th>Salary </th><th>&#8364;430,000</th></tr><tr><td>Taxable benefits (car and health insurance)</td><td>&#8364;24,483</td></tr></table></p><p><pfli1></pfli1></p><p>The Chief Executive waived any consideration for performance-related pay in respect of 2010 and 2011.</p><p>Applying the 15% reduction agreed by the Chief Executive brings his salary to &euro;365,500.</p><p>The Public Service Pension Deduction is applied to the Chief Executives of the NTMA and NAMA. They are members of the NTMA defined benefit superannuation scheme and as members of the scheme prior to 1 January 2010 their pension benefits are based on final salary. The pension benefits of members who joined the scheme on or after 1 January 2010 are based on career average earnings. Unlike most public pension schemes which are funded on a pay-as-you-go basis, the NTMA superannuation scheme is a funded scheme. Pension entitlements are within the standard entitlements in the model public sector defined benefit superannuation scheme. Pension contributions are not paid to individual employees &ndash; they are paid into the scheme. The level of potential pension payments to members is dependent on length of service, based on final salary or career average earnings, with 1/80th of salary accruing for each year of service.</p></reply>

The net effect of these emerging pressures in 2013, after taking account of offsetting savings arising in other areas, will not be known until closer to the end of this year. However, it is currently anticipated that net upward pressures of the order of &euro;13 million will have to be met in 2013. This means that I will have a requirement to secure overall savings and efficiencies of some &euro;90 million to remain within the 2013 ceiling for my Vote.</p><p>  The upward expenditure pressures identified relate mainly to pay expenditure for teachers and Special Needs Assistants, as well as to a projected reduction in Appropriations-in-Aid receipts.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-20a.381.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1035" speakername="Ruairi Quinn" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012112000054#WRH03500"><p>My Department's position is that as each child with autism is unique, they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs. Applied Behavioural Analysis, or ABA, is one of the approaches used in special classes for children with autism. </p><p>  The use of ABA as part of the range of interventions is particularly useful for addressing behavioural issues. My Department supports the use of ABA and training is provided for teachers in its use. However, the Department does not accept, based on research, advice and best practice, that ABA should be the only approach used. While ABA helps to improve behaviour, other approaches, such as Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS) are just as important in developing children's communication and speech skills. It is important that children have access to a range of approaches so that their broader needs can be met. As children differ significantly from one another and as children's needs vary and change over time, it is not possible to impose a method or approach that will work for all children with autism.  This child centred approach is based on advice received from international experts on autism, NEPS, the Inspectorate and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism.</p><p>  The Deputy may be interested to note that teachers in special schools have been using ABA principles for more than 25 years. ABA involves the systematic application, at any time during the child's day, of behavioural principles to modify behaviour. The effectiveness of behavioural interventions to improve the performance of children with autism and to ameliorate behavioural difficulties has been recognized for decades.</p><p>  To clarify the position regarding psychological assessment reports prepared by health service staff which identify a child's educational needs, the Health Service Executive (HSE) circulated guidance to their staff earlier this year.  The guidance clarified that, if a report prepared by HSE staff identifies a child's educational needs the report should not specify how the education sector should meet those needs. </p></reply>

In line with this approach the policy is to promote a child-centred approach to education of all children with special educational needs including those with autism. As each child with autism is unique they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.</p><p>  Children with autism present with a wide range of needs. Some children are capable of being fully integrated into mainstream schools without additional teaching or care supports. Others are able to attend mainstream schools but need additional teaching and/or care assistance. Many are best enrolled in autism-specific classes where more intensive and supportive interventions are required. Some may move from one setting to another as they get older and differing needs/strengths/abilities emerge.</p><p>  The Deputy will be familiar with the standards associated with qualified teachers, the registration of qualified teachers required by the Teaching Council, the probationary process, whereby teachers are supported and advised by the inspectorate during their first year of teaching. Furthermore the Department recognises that specialised training and continued professional development (CPD) is important for staff working with children with special educational needs and supports the provision of CPD through the Special Education Support Service (SESS) which was specifically established for this purpose. The SESS co-ordinates and delivers a range of professional development initiatives and support structures for school personnel working with students with special educational needs.</p><p>  Autism classes are established with a staffing ratio of 1 teacher and a minimum of 2 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for every 6 children. Other SNAs may be allocated if required to meet the care needs of the children. Start-up grants are provided to the schools to enable special equipment to be purchased. Enhanced capitation is paid in respect of each child and assistive technology is funded where this is recommended.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years. In excess of 540 classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level, including many in special schools. Thirteen new special schools for children with autism were granted official recognition in 2010 having been funded by my Department as centres in a pilot project for a number of years.  The number of pupils enrolled in these classes are not readily available but I have arranged for them to be compiled and forwarded directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The purpose of the report, which I requested, was to identify new possible structures to improve initial teacher education in Ireland so that it is comparable with the best in the world. </p><p>  The international panel of education experts recommended that teacher education be provided in six &quot;centres for teacher education&quot;. Currently there are 19 state funded providers of ITE (and three non-state funded) offering more than 40 college programmes in primary and post-primary teaching. The new collaborations recommended by the international panel will mean that a smaller number of centres for ITE exist, but that they offer education across multiple sectors from early childhood to primary, to post primary to adult education. These centres for teacher education will also possess a critical mass in terms of research capacity which is not always possible in smaller institutions. The new configurations will mean strong research bases can be created in each centre.</p><p>  The HEA has been requested to consult with the relevant parties and to prepare a detailed plan on how to implement the recommendations of the Panel. I understand that this process has started and a plan is expected by the end of the year.  I will fully consider the implementation plan from the HEA when received.</p></reply>

The scheme which was implemented with the help of Sustainable Energy Ireland, allowed schools to apply for funding on a once-off basis to upgrade the fabric insulation in attics and the external cavity walls of their buildings. The closing date for receipt of application under this scheme was November 2009.</p><p>  In light of the financial constraints imposed by the need to prioritise the limited funding available for the provision of accommodation to meet the rising demographic requirements over the next few years results in there being limited resources available for improvement/health and safety works to the existing school stock.  This is in line with Government stated aims to prioritise the delivery of additional accommodation in developing areas.</p><p>  In light of the above, my Department is not in a position to provide funding to schools to specifically replace windows and doors.</p></reply>

Two other major school building projects have been terminated due to a contractor's default for reasons other than insolvency. Five of these projects were subsequently completed and handed over to the school authorities, four are currently being completed by completion contractors and the remaining two projects are in the process of procuring a completion contractor to complete the works. Please see the attached document for details of the eleven projects.</p><p>The original value of the eleven projects was circa &euro;44m. There is a bond in place for each of the eleven projects. The bond is used to cover costs that would otherwise accrue to the Employer (i.e. the Department, School, VEC etc.) on foot of a contractor's failure to complete the works. As such the Employer's financial exposure is generally minimal. Negotiations are ongoing with regard to a number of these projects and in some cases the full cost of re-tendering and completion of the works is not yet known. The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to release commercially sensitive cost information which is currently the subject of negotiations or tender competitions. To do so would undermine the Employer's position with regard to such negotiations.</p><p>The contract used for the construction of major school projects is the Public Works Contract. This contract was developed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and is used across the State Sector for all capital works. With regard to the project in Kilkenny, the Deputy will be aware that the contractor's obligation to complete the works was recently terminated.  Therefore it is not legally possible to complete the project under the existing contract.</p><p>My Department does not hold details of sub-contractors engaged on major school building projects. A school building project is a complex arrangement of contractual relationships between the client, the main contractor, specialist sub-contractors, domestic sub-contractors, suppliers of materials, suppliers of plant etc. In general all sub-contractors employed on school building projects are employed directly by the Main Contractor or indirectly by the Main Contractor through other sub-contractors.</p><p><b>Details of Major School Building Projects where the Contractor&rsquo;s obligation to complete the works was terminated (2008 to 2012)</b></p><p><table><tr><th><div>County</div></th><th><div>Roll Number</div></th><th><div>School Name</div></th><th><div>Reason for Re-tender</div></th><th><div>Current Status</div></th><th><div>Year of Termination</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>Dublin City</div></td><td><div>20139T</div></td><td><div>Inchicore NS, Sarsfield Road, Dublin 10</div></td><td><div>Insolvency Event</div></td><td><div>Under Construction</div></td><td><div>2011</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Dun Laoghaire  Rathdown</div></td><td><div>70030E</div></td><td><div>Senior College, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Eblana Avenue, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Co Dublin</div></td><td><div>Insolvency Event</div></td><td><div>Under Construction</div></td><td><div>2011</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Galway City</div></td><td><div>62970K</div></td><td><div>Col&aacute;iste Iogn&aacute;id SJ Bothar na Mara</div></td><td><div>Insolvency Event</div></td><td><div>Under Construction</div></td><td><div>2011</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Kildare</div></td><td><div>17662R</div></td><td><div>Scoil Bhride NS, Kill</div></td><td><div>Insolvency Event</div></td><td><div>Project Completed</div></td><td><div>2009</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Kildare</div></td><td><div>17674B</div></td><td><div>SN Aine Naofa, Ard Cloc, Straffan</div></td><td><div>Termination due to Contractor Default</div></td><td><div>At tender stage</div></td><td><div>2012</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Kilkenny</div></td><td><div>61580P</div></td><td><div>Loreto Secondary School, Granges Road</div></td><td><div>Termination due to Contractor Default</div></td><td><div>At tender stage</div></td><td><div>2012</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Limerick</div></td><td><div>13026P</div></td><td><div>Kilfinane National School</div></td><td><div>Insolvency Event</div></td><td><div>Project Completed</div></td><td><div>2011</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Limerick City</div></td><td><div>64201T</div></td><td><div>Ardscoil Ris, North Circular Rd, Limerick</div></td><td><div>Insolvency Event</div></td><td><div>Under Construction</div></td><td><div>2011</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Meath</div></td><td><div>18016O</div></td><td><div>S N Columbain, Ballivor</div></td><td><div>Insolvency Event</div></td><td><div>Project Completed</div></td><td><div>2008</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Offaly</div></td><td><div>17523D</div></td><td><div>SN Cronain Naofa, Dromakeenan</div></td><td><div>Insolvency Event</div></td><td><div>Project Completed</div></td><td><div>2010</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Roscommon</div></td><td><div>65100S</div></td><td><div>Scoil Mhuire, Strokestown, Co Roscommon</div></td><td><div>Insolvency Event</div></td><td><div>Project Completed</div></td><td><div>2011</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

Its research provides a valuable input to the development of training course curricula for national training providers and has also informed the development of new competitive funding models of provision to address emerging skills needs.</p><p>  The Government's activation policy, 'Pathways to Work', provides for engagement by the Department of Social Protection's INTREO Employment and Support Service with unemployed people, particularly the long-term unemployed, with a view to assisting them in finding jobs or referrals to appropriate education and training.</p><p>  To complement this policy, and despite reducing resources, my Department will fund over 450,000 education and training places across the range of provision in the higher education, further education and training sectors in 2012. My Department and its agencies are prioritising places, including in the further education and training sector, specifically for those on the Live Register for 12 months or more.</p><p>  In 2012 F&Aacute;S aim to facilitate over 81,000 unemployed individuals through a range of training programmes, that provide industry/occupational specific skills as well as preparatory type training, to enable a diverse range of unemployed individuals referred to F&Aacute;S by the Department of Social Protection, to gain a recognised qualification, access job opportunities or progression opportunities to further/higher education/training. The Department of Social Protection provides appropriate guidance and advice, as required, to unemployed individuals relating to F&Aacute;S courses. The re-alignment of F&Aacute;S training programmes with evolving labour market needs is evidence-based. This is facilitated by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) and other relevant international and national sources including employers.</p><p>  More than 10,000 higher education places are being provided in areas of identified skills need under the Springboard programme and 6,500 places are being rolled out under the new Labour Market Education and Training Fund which will be managed by FAS.</p><p>  In addition, the joint Government-Industry ICT Action Plan, which has been developed as a direct response to identified ICT skills shortages, contains a comprehensive range of measures to build the domestic supply of ICT graduates, including through the roll out of over 800 places on graduate skills conversion courses from March 2012. A roll-out of a second phase of the conversion courses is scheduled for early 2013.</p><p>  The Irish Further Education and Training sector is undergoing major structural reform.  The creation of a new further education and training authority, SOLAS, will facilitate a coherent integrated strategic national response across the further education and training sectors and will ensure a greater focus on the evolving requirements of the unemployed and of industry.</p></reply>

(Please note that one prefab unit may consist of one or more classrooms and/or ancillary accommodation).  Historical data in relation primary and post-primary schools with purchased prefabricated accommodation is not readily available.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware I announced earlier this year a new initiative to replace rented prefabs in both primary and post-primary schools.  Over 170 schools have been approved to replace rented prefabs with permanent accommodation.  A total of &euro;41.8 million has been allocated for this initiative which will result in approximately 6,000 pupils moving from prefabs into permanent classrooms and resource rooms when building works are completed in all schools.  It is expected that this initiative will achieve savings of up to &euro;5m per annum on the rental of prefabs in the coming years.</p></reply>

A number of measures have been put in place to address the current processing backlogs and the situation is being kept under continuous review to ensure the timely processing of grants for this current year.</p></reply>

These allocations are approved by the D&aacute;il as part of the overall Voted expenditure ceilings for each Department.  My Department monitors all current and capital spend reported by Departments on a month by month basis to identify potential overruns.</p><p>  Information from Departments indicates that the bulk of their remaining capital budgets will be spent by year end.  The spending pattern is in line with trends from previous years which show that the bulk of capital expenditure takes place in the last quarter of the year.  Where it is not possible to spend their capital allocation in full by year end, Departments may apply to carryover unspent capital (up to a maximum of 10% of their Voted capital allocation) into the next year.</p><p>  In the context of the requirement to meet our deficit targets and restore our economic sovereignty, each Department must ensure that the Vote level allocations are adhered to and that both capital and current expenditure are managed from within the overall allocation for the Vote.  Should an overspend arise, the relevant Department may seek to address it through virement of savings from one sub-head to another; however, to do so requires sanction from my Department.</p></reply>

The stimulus package comprises two elements: 1.4 billion euro to fund the proposed new Public Private Partnerships (PPP) programme.  This will come from the European Investment Bank, the National Pensions Reserve Fund, domestic banks and other potential sources of funding.  The National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) and the Department of Finance are leading on sourcing this funding and are liaising with my Department in this regard; 850 million euro coming from the proceeds of the sale of State assets and from the new licensing arrangements for the National Lottery, to be used as a project preparation facility for the new PPP programme and to fund additional Exchequer capital projects and other commercial and publicly needed projects.</p><p>  The PPP investment will be directed towards projects that meet key infrastructural needs and are in line with the priorities in the Government's Investment Framework.  In the case of the primary healthcare centres the NDFA is the procuring authority and is working closely with the Department of Health and the HSE in the development of the projects, including development of the project specific details of the funding.  The projects selected are from the education, health, transport and justice sectors.

Details of the Ministers announcement are on the Department of Education and Skills website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.education.ie</font></i>.</p><p>  I understand this investment will provide some 5,700 places for pupils in 8 new schools throughout the country.  This will create and sustain important jobs in the construction sector. It will bring the total number of schools delivered under the PPP model in the State to 23.  The Bundle of schools consists of 8 individual schools: 7 post primaries and one primary - at the following locations:</p><p>  Post-primary: <b>Col&aacute;iste Ailigh, Letterkenny, Co Donegal</b>: permanent school for the gaelchol&aacute;iste established in 2000 (350 pupils); <b>Ballinamore Community School, Co Leitrim</b>: amalgamation of Fatima and Felim's Secondary School and Ballinamore Vocational School (400 pupils); <b>Doughiska Community College, Co Galway</b>: new school for a rapidly growing population in the Doughiska area (650 pupils).  It will be provided on a shared campus with the new primary school (see below); <b>Gorey, Co Wexford</b>: new school for a rapidly growing population in the Gorey area (1,000 pupils); <b>Doon/Cappamore, Co Limerick</b><b><font color="#00204F"> </font></b><b>Secondary School, Co Limerick:</b> new school arising from the amalgamation of St. Fintan's Doon, St. Joseph's Doon and Colaiste Phobal Mhichil Cappamore (850 pupils); <b>Tramore Secondary School, Co Waterford</b>: amalgamation of CBS Tramore and Stella Maris schools (1,000 pupils); <b>Athlone Community College, Co Westmeath</b>: replacement for the current building (1,000 pupils) Primary; <b>Doughiska, Co Galway</b>: new school for a rapidly growing population in the Doughiska area on same site as Doughiska Community College (447 pupils).</p><p>  It has taken some time to get agreement with all the partners on this project and I acknowledge the efforts of all those involved including the procuring authority for this project the National Development Finance Agency, the sponsoring authority the Department of Education and Skills, and our funding partners the EIB and Bank of Ireland and the PPP Consortium Bam Ireland.  EIB provided 50% of the funding and I am aware that Bank of Ireland provided the balance of senior debt for this project.  The agreed financial terms and the overall budget for the project are commercially sensitive and are therefore confidential.  <font color="#00204F">All schools are expected to be completed by 2014.</font></p></reply>

The stimulus package included 1.4 billion euro to fund the proposed new Public Private Partnerships (PPP) programme.  The investment is directed towards projects that meet key infrastructural needs and are in line with the priorities in the Government's Investment Framework.  The PPP package involves projects across a number of sectors &#8211; transport, education, healthcare and justice.</p><p>  In line with the normal division of responsibilities in relation to expenditure, my Department developed the overall policy approach for the stimulus package while the details of the actual projects and locations was a matter for the relevant Ministers and their Departments and agencies.  All of the projects in the stimulus package are subject to the normal rules and guidelines on the management and appraisal of capital investment including, in the case of PPPs, the specific guidance on PPP appraisal and value for money, details of which can be found on the website <i>www.ppp.gov.ie</i>.</p></reply>

We must all maximise the Agreement&rsquo;s potential to leverage further pay and non-pay savings as well as further reform of work practices and service delivery in the public service.  As part of that process, I attended a meeting chaired by the Taoiseach, with the Chair and members of the Implementation Body, which is responsible for driving the implementation of the Agreement, on 11 October last. Deputies will be aware that the Body&rsquo;s membership is comprised of representatives of public service management and from the Public Services Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU).  A key output from that engagement is that revised Action Plans are being advanced at sectoral level.  I understand that the Implementation Body is currently considering those draft plans and they will be published on the Body&rsquo;s website in due course.</p><p>  Separately, today I invited members of the Public Services Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to discussions on a new agenda for improvements in the productivity of public servants and reductions in the cost of delivery of public services.  This invitation has been issued in light of the Government&rsquo;s determination to meet the challenge posed by the fiscal consolidation in the period from 2013 to 2015 to reduce the deficit below 3% of GDP by 2015, and a shared ambition to build on the substantial contribution already made by public servants to Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing economic recovery.</p><p>  Depending on the outcome of the initial discussions, the Government has indicated its willingness to enter a process of negotiation with the objective of concluding an agreement on workplace change and savings with its employees at the earliest possible date.</p></reply>

The Action Plan for Jobs contains a number of measures which are aimed specifically at the facilitation and incentivisation of national enterprise development from start-ups to growth companies.  The Enterprise Development agencies, under the aegis of my Department, are at the forefront of implementing the Action Plan for Jobs across all regions and will ensure that enterprises can maximise their contribution to economic and jobs growth.</p><p>  In 2011, Enterprise Ireland paid over &#8364;5.4m in financial support to its client companies to assist them to develop their business and create employment in South County Dublin including Tallaght.  The New Frontiers Programme, which focuses on developing a person&#8217;s entrepreneurial abilities is co-ordinated by Enterprise Ireland and is providing &#8364;4.25m in funding to enable the Institutes of Technology, including Tallaght IT, to deliver the Programme at a local level.  Participants receive financial support of &#8364;15,000.  So far this year, 23 people participated in Phase 1 of the Programme at Tallaght IT and 15 applicants are currently completing Phase 2.A new Community Enterprise Centre Development Programme was launched this year for the maintenance or establishment of a strong business development function in the Community Enterprise Centres, funded by Enterprise Ireland.  Three Community Enterprise Centres in the Tallaght Area were successful in securing this funding in 2012, including Partas Centres in Killinarden and Brookfield.</p><p>  The South Dublin County Enterprise Board provides support for small businesses with 10 employees or fewer in the start-up and expansion phases, to develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level. In 2011 the Board paid out &#8364;357,682 in grant assistance to 38 microenterprise projects in the county.  This year, the Board will continue to be actively involved in economic development in the area and will ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development.</p><p>  From IDA Ireland&#8217;s perspective, Tallaght continues to be well-equipped to compete for potential Foreign Direct Investment, with superb infrastructure facilities at City West and Grange Castle.  IDA announcements in 2012 include Xilinx &#8211; a &#8364;50m expansion in its operations; SAP &#8211; creation of 150 jobs; Microsoft &#8211; US$130m expansion in its operations.  As recently as September 2012, Aspen, announced the creation of 44 jobs at its facility in City West.  </p><p>  Ensuring that more micro and small businesses can start up, expand and export is a key pillar of the Government&#8217;s plans for jobs and growth.  That is why the Government has decided to implement an ambitious reform in the delivery of service to small and micro business.  This will include the:-</p><p>- Development of a new Small and Micro Business Division within Enterprise Ireland (EI) as a centre of excellence in the provision of supports to the small and micro enterprise sectors; </p><p>- Dissolution of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) and the transfer of their functions, assets and liabilities to Enterprise Ireland (EI);</p><p>- Establishment of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) to provide a high quality, innovative, &#8220;one-stop-shop&#8221; support service for small businesses within Local Authorities, and providing early access to the services of national bodies and,</p><p>- Integration of key local authority business services into the Local Enterprise Office and promotion of a local environment in which enterprise can thrive.</p><p>  Pending the introduction of these proposed new arrangements, micro-enterprises employing less than 10 persons, in Tallaght can, as their first port of call, continue to contact South Dublin County Enterprise Board (SDCEB) on: <font color="#3F803F">.</font></p><p>  To improve access to credit for entrepreneurs and micro-enterprises, and to facilitate the growth and expansion of viable businesses from all industry sectors which have been refused access to credit by banks, the Government recently established the Microfinance Loan Fund.  The Fund is open to entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs of all ages, across the country. </p><p>  Microfinance Ireland, (MFI), the company set up to operate the Fund, is working closely with the CEBs and Enterprise Ireland and are very conscious of the particular difficulties entrepreneurs face with regard to credit history, previous business experience etc. and where they can assist entrepreneurs, they will do so.  However, the potential viability of the business proposal is the dominant factor in any credit decision made by Microfinance Ireland.</p><p>  I am confident that the measures outlined in the Action Plan for Jobs, together with the initiatives being pursued by the State Agencies will ensure the creation of enterprise development and employment opportunities for Tallaght and the surrounding area.</p></reply>

Ireland has long championed the vital role of the United Nations in the promotion and protection of human rights, including the rights of workers, and will continue to do so as members of the Human Rights Council.</p><p>  The issue of ratification by Ireland of Convention No. 189 on decent work for domestic workers is being considered in the context of our standard approach to the ratification of international instruments.  Ireland does not ratify international Conventions until any such necessary amendments to domestic legislation have been identified and effected. </p><p>  A preliminary assessment of the implications of ratifying the International Labour Organisation&rsquo;s Convention 189 on Domestic Workers is currently being finalised by my Department.  The Assessment includes an Article-by-Article examination of the extent to which Domestic legislation provisions already provide for the Rights and Entitlements enunciated in each Article, as well as the extent to which any legislative amendments will be required.  This assessment will then be forwarded to the Office of the Attorney General for their examination. </p><p>  My officials have been in contact with EU Commission officials and I am aware that they are in the process of issuing a document to all its members in relation to the ratification of the Convention.  I have asked the Commission to provide me with this document when it is available.</p><p>  It is important, to note, however, that domestic workers are protected by virtue of the fact that the full suite of employment rights legislation, including that of redress for violations of their employment rights, apply to domestic workers in the same way as they apply to other categories of employees in Ireland.  Also it is worth pointing out that NERA has carried out a programme of inspections involving Domestic Workers as well as continuing to respond to any complaints it receives from Domestic Workers.</p><p>  A voluntary Code of Practice for Persons Employed in Other People&rsquo;s Homes was developed under the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  The Code sets out certain employment rights and practices for persons employed in other people&rsquo;s homes and encourages good practice and compliance with the law in such employment situations.  In any proceedings before a court, or a workplace relations dispute resolution body, a code of practice shall be admissible in evidence and any provision of the code which appears to the court, body or officer concerned to be relevant to any question arising in the proceedings shall be taken into account in determining that question.</p></reply>

The Scheme provides a 75% State guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying enterprises to facilitate lending that would not otherwise take place.  The Scheme is intended to address two distinct barriers to lending; inadequacy of collateral (Pillar 1) and inadequacy of understanding of the novelty of a business model, market, sector or technology (Pillar 2).  </p><p>  The lender assesses viability according to its normal assessment criteria and the decision of the lender in terms of assessing viability is final.  Guarantees may be provided for any loan value between &euro;10,000 and &euro;1 million.  The borrower pays a 2% annual premium which partially covers the cost of providing the guarantee.  Use of the Scheme is limited to additional new lending, with refinancing of existing debt explicitly excluded.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Scheme went live on Wednesday 24th October.  At this early stage, the number of approved guarantees on Friday 16th November is two.</p><p>  Bank of Ireland, AIB and Ulster Bank are participating in the Scheme.  Initial enquiries regarding the Scheme are not currently being monitored as potential borrowers are being advised to contact the participating banks directly.  The Department will of course keep a close eye on developments in respect of the scheme as matters unfold.</p></reply>

As independent quasi-judicial bodies, I have no role in the day-to-day exercise of their functions. </p><p>  If an employee considers that s/he has been unfairly dismissed, s/he may submit a claim for redress under the Unfair Dismissals Acts to a Rights Commissioner or a claim may be submitted directly to the EAT.  <font color="#2F2F2F">Where a claim is heard by a Rights Commissioner under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, the Rights Commissioner will issue a recommendation and either party may appeal that recommendation to the EAT.  The appeal must be made within 6 weeks of the date on which the Rights Commissioner communicated the recommendation to the parties.  This is done by giving written notice of appeal within that period to the EAT on the prescribed form.</font>  In communicating Rights Commissioners&#8217; recommendations, it is standard practice to include with the recommendations, information on how an appeal of recommendation can be made.</p><p>  Where a claim or appeal is heard by the EAT under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, the Tribunal will issue a determination.  There is a right of appeal by either party to the Circuit Court from a determination of the Tribunal.  </p><p>  The statutory time limits for appealing the recommendation of a Rights Commissioner to the EAT are provided for in the Unfair Dismissal Acts and the EAT does not have any discretion to extend these time limits in any circumstances. </p><p>  I am fully aware of the specific issues and circumstances surrounding your constituent&#8217;s complaint.  Having made enquiries into this matter, I understand that Officials within my Department have conducted a thorough scrutiny of the facts in relation to this case and letters have issued, in both November 2011 and February 2012, in respect of earlier complaints made by your constituent in relation to this matter.  I am informed that there has been no change in facts of this case since then.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, I have addressed the specific issues concerning your constituent&#8217;s present complaint in my reply which will issue to you in response to the representations you have made on his behalf in relation to the matter (Ref: 121035/MIN refers). </p><p>  As you may be aware, I am currently undertaking a root and branch reform of the existing Workplace Relations Bodies.  The Reform Programme I have commenced will deliver a two tier Workplace Relations structure by merging the activities of the Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the EAT and the Labour Court into a new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).  The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court. Work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to the new two-tier structure.</p><p>  My objective is to establish a world-class Workplace Relations Service. The Workplace Relations Bill which I hope to publish in early 2013 will contain provisions in respect of the relevant procedures for appeals along the lines already outlined in the policy document &#8216;<i>Legislating for a Worldclass Workplace Relations Service&#8217;</i> and also in my presentation before the joint Oireachtas Committee on Jobs Enterprise and Innovation last July.  I intend proposing to the Oireachtas that all first instance complaints requiring adjudication will be heard by the Adjudication Officers of the new Workplace Relations Commission and any subsequent appeals will be heard by the Labour Court as a full fresh appeal.  The Labour Court will act as a court of final appeal for all adjudication decisions of the Workplace Relations Commission, subject to the right of either party to bring a further appeal from a determination of the Labour Court to the High Court on a point of law only.</p><p>  The WRC will have statutory jurisdiction for facilitating the resolution of disputes under employment, equality and industrial relations legislation, in accordance with best practice and in compliance with international human rights standards.  To ensure that the WRC delivers its services to the highest standards, the Director will be supported by a Registration Service with a suitably qualified and experienced lawyer as Registrar.  It is envisaged that such a Registration Service would be responsible for the receipt, validation and processing of all employment related complaints and the coordination, management and referral of those cases to Hearing.  For example, the Registration Service will check complaints on receipt and reject or redirect incomplete complaints, complaints which are out of time or which are grounded incorrectly.  The Registration Service will have responsibility for steering each case through the system and ensuring it is dealt with efficiently and effectively.</p><p>  In this regard, I am happy to report that substantial progress has been made to date and a number of important priority actions have been successfully delivered within the target timescale which will ensure that all employment related complaints are dealt with effectively, efficiently and in a timely manner, including:-</p><p>- the introduction of a new single contact portal called &#8220;Workplace Relations Customer Services&#8221; (for information provisions and complaints receipt and registration) which has replaced the five separate entry points, and</p><p>- a Single Complaint Form that deals with 100 first instance complaints has replaced the 30 forms previously in use.</p><p>  I fully expect the work that I have initiated with regard to the reform of the Workplace Relations Bodies to significantly improve the quality of service to users and I am confident that all employment related complaints will be dealt with in an effective, efficient and timely manner under the new structures.</p></reply>

This holds for all sectors of the labour market, including the care sector. </p><p>  Incentivising the take-up of employment is essentially being achieved by three means:-</p><p>- First, the Government is determined to continue to reform the tax and social welfare system to ensure that a person who takes up employment is significantly better off financially then if they remained on social welfare. Our current Jobseekers Benefit and Jobseekers Allowance payments are already designed in such a way as to ensure that persons are incentivised to take up either full-time or part-time employment.  This is achieved by a gradual tapering of the social welfare payment for people who take up part-time employment.  Currently, a person can work up to three days and still have an entitlement to a reduced social welfare payment, with the reduction in the social welfare payment tapered in line with a person&rsquo;s increase in earnings from work.  A person who wishes to work on a part-time basis over a period in excess of three days per week can avail of the Part Time Job Incentive Scheme or the Family Income Supplement Scheme.  People who are more than 12 months unemployed are also entitled to an increased personal tax credit in certain circumstances further increasing the returns to work.</p><p>  In addition, reforms to the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes are being introduced to ensure that people in part-time employment are incentivised to take up full-time employment as such opportunities become available.  This includes rebasing the payment week for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit on a five-day week rather than the previous six-day week basis where a person is working for part of the week.  This measure was introduced in July 2012.  And from February 2013 employment on a Sunday will be taken into account when determining the level of entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s payments.  The recognition of Sunday working from the perspective of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and benefit will reduce the amount of jobseeker&rsquo;s payable to casual workers and thereby encourage workers to take up offers of full-time employment rather than combining part-time employment with social welfare payments.  </p><p>  In a further effort to improve the financial incentive to take up employment, the Government has halved the lower rate of PRSI until end-2013 on jobs that pay up to &euro;356 per week and exempted low-paid, part-time and seasonal workers with an annual income of less than &euro;10,036 from the Universal Social Charge (increased from &euro;4,004).</p><p>  The Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare is examining issues around the operation and interaction of the tax and social welfare systems and may also recommend further measures to improve incentives to take up employment.</p><p>- Second, the Government is incentivising employers to hire the long-term unemployed.  The Government has introduced a range of reforms and incentives to support, protect and create jobs, including through the Jobs Initiative in May 2011 which among other measures reduced VAT rates for labour intensive sectors.  The Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme is available to employers who hire persons who have been in receipt of specified social welfare payments for a period of six months or more and the Revenue Tax Assist Scheme is available to employers who hire a person in receipt of those benefits for in excess of 12 months.  This scheme, which provides a double tax relief for employers, also provides increased tax credits for the employee.</p><p>- Third, with the unemployed via the roll-out of the new one-stop-shop Intreo offices which were launched in October.  Interventions will include referral to group engagement, one-to-one interviews, education and/or training and placement/work experience opportunities at appropriate intervals.  In addition, the Department of Social Protection will continue to implement its powers to sanction individuals in the form of reduced social welfare rates, if they fail to make a meaningful effort to engage in efforts to progress towards employment.</p></reply>

At the end of October, there were <b>7,267</b><b><font color="#FF0000"> </font></b>new FIS applications and <b>7,864 </b>renewal applications awaiting decision.  The volume of FIS claims on hands and the delays in processing are a consequence of continued strong claim intake.</p><p>  An in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project has recently been completed for the FIS scheme.  This project focused on optimising output and customer service and the elimination of backlogs.  Part of the project was a detailed examination of workloads and a full assessment of existing capacity within the area and what capacity is needed in order to process the volumes of claims, both new and renewal, being received on a weekly basis.</p><p>  A plan has now been devised and implementation commenced on 5 November 2012.  This plan sees the normal weekly new claim and renewal intake processed without delay while the backlog is ring-fenced and a focused team assigned to this work with a clear plan for its elimination.</p><p>  The first steps taken to permanently eliminate future backlogs in FIS are to put in place sufficient capacity and suitable structures and processes to deal with the weekly intake of work.  This has been done in the case of the FIS scheme and the first week of operation has been very successful in this regard, achieving its target output.</p><p>  This is not to say that the backlog of claims awaiting decision is being ignored or that work has ceased on it.  On the contrary, a separate team including additional temporary resources has been identified and is already assigned and working on the claims in question.  This team is fully focussed on the elimination of the backlog of claims in the shortest possible timeframe, concentrating in the first instance on those claims which were previously in payment but where payment has expired.</p><p>  It is expected that the backlog will be fully eliminated by the end of March 2013.  Claims which are approved by the backlog team will be backdated to the date of claim or the date of expiry of the previous claim, as appropriate, and all arrears due will be paid.</p></reply>

Over 12,100 internships have commenced to date with 5,398 participants currently on an internship as at 15<sup>th</sup> November 2012 and over 1,900 internship opportunities presently advertised on </p><p>  The interim evaluation report conducted by Indecon found that 52% of the participants who have finished their JobBridge internship placement have progressed into employment.  These progression rates compare favourably with European averages in this area.</p><p>  In order to protect the Intern and to ensure the integrity of the JobBridge Scheme a variety of control measures and criteria have been introduced.  These ensure that the internship does not displace an existing position; that it provides appropriate training and development experience; and that appropriate mentoring and support is provided to the Intern.</p><p>  Under the current guidelines, upon the conclusion of an internship position a cooling off period of 6 months must elapse before a Host Organisation can re-advertise either this position or another placement in the same area of activity.  This is to prevent potential displacement and checks are conducted by the National Contact Centre in Edenderry.  However, should the proposed placement be in a different area of activity or in cases where a Host Organisation has employed their incumbent intern no such cooling off period will be applied.</p><p>  Furthermore, to ensure that both the host organisation and intern are abiding by the spirit and the rules of the scheme, the Department of Social Protection are involved in the on-going monitoring of internships.  Through a strong on the ground presence; this involves the regular review of monthly compliance reports and the conducting of random monitoring site visits to facilitate discussions with both parties to the Internship.  I am delighted to advise that 95% of monitoring visits conducted to-date were of a satisfactory nature.  Remedial action has been taken in a small number of cases where the monitoring exercise deemed that not all aspects of the internship were of a satisfactory nature.</p><p>  It is worth noting that participation in the Scheme is voluntary and an intern may contact the JobBridge Team at any stage of their Internship for advice and support.  Moreover, any individual who suspects that an internship may be in breach of the scheme&#8217;s criteria, including cases of suspected or potential displacement and quality may contact the JobBridge directly via the &#8216;Contact Us&#8217; section of the JobBridge website.  This dedicated support unit will investigate matters further.</p><p>  However, it is important to note that an independent evaluation of the Scheme is currently being undertaken by Indecon International Economic Consultants and is anticipated that a final report will be published later this year.  Part of its remit includes recommendations on how the Scheme might be improved or expanded. It is at this stage that further consideration will be given to amending the terms and conditions of the Scheme.  Any such amendments to the scheme will be notified via the website.</p></reply>

The core eligibility criterion for CE is that the person is in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment such as jobseekers allowance, jobseekers benefit, one parent family payment for a specified amount of time, generally 12 months. Persons in receipt of a qualifying disability-linked social welfare payment are also eligible if they are currently in receipt of their payment (at least 6 months for illness benefit). </p><p>  CE is an active labour market programme aimed at persons who are not considered ready for entry to employment, with the programme emphasis on progression into employment and/or further education/training.  Thus, CE is not generally available to persons who are already in employment. There is a limit of 30 worked days in the 12 months qualifying period for jobseeker clients wishing to apply for CE under the one-year version of CE, or 30 worked days in each of the three years for jobseeker clients wishing to apply for CE under the three-year version of CE. </p><p>  The CE programme is one of a range of training and employment programmes available for unemployed persons. All of these programmes have specific objectives and eligibility criteria that address the specific needs of a wide range of jobseekers.</p><p>  In the circumstances, the person concerned should contact their local Employment Services Office where  the employment and training options that are available to her can be outlined.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  </p><p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for the State pension (contributory) easier by disregarding time spent out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme was introduced in and took effect from 1994.   Eligibility for the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is conditional on firstly meeting the standard qualifying conditions for State pension. </p><p>  Backdating the scheme to 1964 would involve considerable costs.  An analysis undertaken in the 2007 Green Paper on Pensions identified that to backdate the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme to 1953, the year when the unified system of social insurance was introduced in Ireland, would cost the Exchequer in the region of &euro;160m and to 1973/73, an estimated  &euro;150m.  Costs in relation to this scheme under the current rules, are expected to increase in the coming years due to the increase in female employment rates since 1994. </p><p>  In relation to income support, Ireland&rsquo;s pensioners have the lowest consistent poverty rate and are least likely to be at risk of poverty compared to other groups - pointing to the adequacy of the State pension.  Between 2004 and 2010, consistent poverty for older people (those over 65) fell from 3.3% to 0.9%.  The &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; rate for people in that age group fell from 27.1% to 9.6% over the same period.</p><p>  The recently published review of the Social Insurance Fund identified that in the medium to long term, pension related expenditure will account for an increasing proportion of the Social Insurance Fund expenditure - rising from 57% in 2011 to 85% in 2066.    The pensioner support ratio is projected to decline from 5.3 workers for every individual over pension age in 2010 to 3.9 workers by 2020 and to 2.1 workers by 2060. </p><p>  In terms of value for money for those who take time out of the workforce, the report confirms that social insurance benefits offer excellent value for money for those:</p><p>- on the lower part of the income distribution,</p><p>- those with shorter contribution histories, mostly women</p><p>- and the self-employed.  </p><p>  Notwithstanding the changes in the contribution rules and associated rates of payment which were introduced in September 2012, those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories, will continue to obtain the best value for money from the Fund.  This can be of particular benefit to women.  </p><p>  In relation to the marriage bar, it should be noted that women affected by the marriage bar are public servants who would not be eligible for the homemakers scheme due to the type of PRSI being paid by them at the time of leaving the workforce. It should be noted that women who do not qualify for a full rate pension may, if their spouse is in receipt of a State pension contributory, receive a qualified adult payment at a higher rate where they satisfy a means test.   </p><p>  A State pension non-contributory pension, which is a means tested payment, may also be payable.  Time taken out of the workforce for homemaking and caring duties will continue to be protected by the current disregard.  While my Department will keep the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme under review, any improvements which could result in further costs for the Exchequer could only be considered in a budgetary context.  The Government&rsquo;s priority is to secure economic recovery, promote growth and employment.  To this end, the State must pursue a determined deficit reduction strategy.  Accordingly, there will be an on-going requirement to curtail expenditure in 2013 and in later years. </p><p>  The Government is considering the appropriate level of expenditure on the wide variety of schemes and services operated by my Department in 2013 in the context of the forthcoming Budget. The outcome will be announced on Budget Day.</p></reply>

In this context, the staffing needs of all areas within the Department are continuously reviewed. </p><p>  In recent months, the Department has restructured a number of Community Welfare Service (CWS) clinics across the country, including in the County Meath area, with the aim of providing an efficient service to all customers. Some smaller clinics have been closed where the level of demand for a service was low and a number of other clinics have also been identified for closure. Where a closure has occurred or is planned, an increased level of service has been made available to the customers from these areas at alternative locations in the general vicinity.</p><p>  In the case of Summerhill, the clinic was open to the public for 1&frac12; hours per week (2pm-3.30pm, every Wednesday).  Customers who attended the Summerhill clinic will, from 3rd  December 2012, be served in Enfield, which is approximately 10km from Summerhill.  The CWS Clinic in Enfield is available each Wednesday for two hours - 10.00am &ndash; 12:00pm. </p><p>  In the case of Clonard, the clinic was open to the public for 1 hour per week (11am-12pm every Wednesday).  Customers who were dealt with in the Clonard clinic are now served in Enfield, which is approximately 14km from Clonard.   The CWS clinic in Enfield, for customers from the Clonard area, is available on Thursdays from two hours 10.30am &ndash; 12.30pm.  </p><p>  Notices were issued to local Department of Social Protection Offices, Money Advice and Budgeting Service and Citizen&rsquo;s Information Centres and posters have been displayed in both Summerhill and Clonard clinics advising customers of these changes.</p><p>  Where clinics are closing, an emergency contact telephone number has been made available to customers who are unable to attend the alternative clinic.</p><p>  The decision to close the Summerhill clinic was not made on the basis of cost savings which might accrue.  Rather locating the service in Enfield will, I believe, enable customers to receive a more effective and comprehensive response from the CWS.</p></reply>

Property for this purpose includes:</p><p>i.	Money invested in a bank, building society or other financial institution;</p><p>ii.	The current market value of stocks and shares of every description, and  </p><p>iii.	Houses and premises owned by a claimant which may or may not be put to commercial use (including property which is rented out). </p><p>  However, it does not include property such as the home or, for example, a premises used by the claimant in carrying out a business. </p><p>  For assessment purposes, the current market value of the property is established as well as the amount of any outstanding mortgages on that property. The balance (market value less outstanding mortgage) is assessed by reference to a formula. Where the current market value is less than the outstanding mortgage, no assessment is made. </p><p>  In establishing the current market value of a property, the Department may make enquiry of the State Valuation Office. Alternatively, the market value may be established through receipt of a reasonable current valuation from a registered auctioneer, with reference to the purchase price and date of purchase of the property or, alternatively, the inspector may agree a valuation with a customer having regard to the type and location of the individual property and prevailing market values in that area. </p><p>  The current market value of a property is the best estimate of what would be achievable if the property was offered for sale. Such an estimate will have regard to reductions in prices over recent years. Given that background, I have no plans to change the assessment of property for the purposes of means tested social assistance schemes operated by the Department of Social Protection.</p></reply>

It is designed to remove the barriers to participation in second and third level education by enabling those in receipt of certain social welfare payments to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher qualification than that already held.  The BTEA scheme covers a large range of full-time courses of education in approved colleges spanning basic foundation courses to third level courses across all disciplines.</p><p>  BTEA guidelines are, in the main, in line with the mechanisms in place for student support type schemes administered by the Department of Education and Skills. Progression in education is a condition which is not unique to BTEA, indeed State support for education purposes is grounded on a student progressing from one qualification level to a higher one. This is necessary to ensure displacement does not occur, in that courses could be offered to students who are not progressing at the cost of students progressing from a lower education level. </p><p>  The Department is currently reviewing a wide range of activation supports available to the Department&rsquo;s customers, including BTEA, and it is the intention to canvass the views of stakeholders as part of the implementation process resulting from the review.</p></reply>

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability.  The estimated expenditure on child benefit for 2012 is around &euro;2 billion and it is paid to around 600,000 families in respect of some 1.15 million children. </p><p>  Parents of multiple birth children receive an additional monthly premia paid at one and a half times the monthly child benefit payment rate for each twin and double the monthly payment rate for each child in other multiple births. While Budget 2012 maintained this additional monthly payment, the multiple births grant of &euro;635 paid at birth, at 4 years of age and at 12 years of age was discontinued. </p><p>  As a universal payment child benefit assists parents with the cost of raising children and it contributes towards alleviating child poverty. The Government is also conscious that child benefit is an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment. Bearing this in mind, any plans to change the amount paid in respect of such payments will be a matter to be decided in a budgetary context and announced on Budget day.  I do not therefore propose to speculate on any possible approaches to child benefit payment rates changes.  </p><p>  With regard to the application process for child benefit, when a parent registers the birth of their child the Department of Social Protection will initiate a child benefit claim. In cases where the parent is not claiming child benefit for another child, such as their first child, a partially completed form is sent to the parent to sign in order to claim the payment. In cases where the parent is claiming child benefit for another child, the new child is added to the child benefit claim and payment begins automatically from the month after the birth. A letter confirming payment is then sent to the parent by the Department. If a parent does not wish to claim their child benefit payment, they can notify the Department in writing to that effect and their claim will be stopped in accordance with their wishes. </p><p>  I am conscious that achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, including child benefit, raises complex issues about the effectiveness of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children. In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment incentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and has completed its work on this area. Their report is currently receiving my consideration and will assist the Government in setting out a pathway towards a more appropriate system of child income supports.</p></reply>

In addition, factors outside the Department&rsquo;s control can have an impact, for example, insufficient information received from claimants at time of application and delays in claimants furnishing the information requested.</p><p>  At present, approximately 220 new invalidity pension claims are received in the Department each week and these are examined within a short time after receipt.

The number of invalidity pension claims awaiting action and decision at the end of May 2012 was 7007 &ndash; this has reduced to 4561 at the end of October 2012 and presently all of these claim have been actioned by my department and are awaiting further information from the customers or a Medical Assessment.  It should also be noted that this number includes approximately 800 claims which are being assessed under EU and/or bi-lateral arrangements and that such claims are more complex and take longer to decide.  Once all the necessary information is received, the claim will be processed promptly usually within two weeks</p><p>  Any person making an enquiry concerning the progress of their claim is given the most up to date status of their claim and the next steps to be taken.</p></reply>

The student details are then matched against the claim databases and any cases identified with open claims are referred to the relevant areas for investigation. </p><p>  In 2011, data was received from 57 individual colleges, including all 3rd level colleges, Institutes of Technology and PLC course providers.  Details are only obtained in respect of students attending full-time day courses.  The 2011/12 student registration data match resulted in 5,191 jobseeker cases requiring further examination.  It is important to note that in a lot of these cases the customer may be part of the Department&rsquo;s Back to Education Programme or the Local Office may be aware that the customer is attending a course which does not affect his/her entitlement to a jobseekers payment.  In fact, it should be noted that savings have only been recorded in less than 200 jobseeker cases to date.</p><p>  Data is currently being received and collated for individuals registered as full-time students in the current academic year 2012/2013.</p><p>  The Department does not keep records of the number of the persons who continue to claim benefits by proving that they have ceased their education, as requested by the Deputy.  It should be noted that the Department&rsquo;s Back to Education Programme is designed to encourage people getting certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications by taking an approved second or third level course at a recognised school or college and still continue to receive a payment.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-20a.686.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012112000054#WRO01000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 356 and 406 together. </p><p>  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently approximately 89,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;436 million in 2012.</p><p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant.  Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs.  There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.</p><p>  However, rent supplement payments can, at the request of the tenant and with the agreement of the Department, be paid directly to the landlord.  If the Department were to introduce a system whereby all rent supplement payments were to be made directly to landlords the efficiency of the scheme would be significantly affected.  For example, the Department would potentially have to create a formal relationship with some 89,000 additional clients, the landlords.  This would involve greater complexity and significant resources to deal with a new set of third parties.  It would not be an effective use of resources to have departmental staff negotiating rental agreements for those with a short term need.</p><p>  The Government has effectively two initiatives to deal with long term reliance on rent supplement.  The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) is in operation since 2004 and the new Housing Policy Initiative as announced by my colleagues the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Housing &amp; Planning on 16th June 2011.</p><p>  In March 2012, the Government approved in principle to transfer responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long term housing need from my Department, currently provided through rent supplement, to housing authorities using a new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  Among the main features of HAP is that landlords will be paid directly by the local authority.</p><p>  A multi-agency steering group has been established to develop proposals to give effect to this transfer.  The group is chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and consists of representatives from the Departments of Social Protection; Public Expenditure and Reform; Office of the Revenue Commissioners; the County and City Managers Association, and the Housing Agency.  It is planned that pilot testing of HAP arrangements will commence during the second half of 2013 with general roll out and commencement of transfers from January 2014. </p><p>  The new arrangements will achieve a key Government commitment of removing barriers to employment and at the same time returning rent supplement to its original purpose of a short-term income support.</p></reply>

In this regard, I held a pre-Budget forum in October which was attended by thirty community and voluntary groups, including a number of groups representing carers.  I listened carefully to the groups&rsquo; views and proposals in relation to the forthcoming Budget and I am considering all submissions made to me in that regard, including written submissions made by Care Alliance Ireland and the Carers Association.</p><p>  The Government is considering the appropriate level of expenditure on the wide variety and schemes and services operated by my Department in 2013 in the context of the forthcoming Budget.

The project involved the development of IT functionality and associated business process re-organisation.  Full deployment of the new system for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance was completed in June 2012.</p><p>  Initial focus was placed on clearing the backlog of CA applications awaiting scanning and registration. An additional 4 temporary staff were allocated to this effort. Over July and August 2012, 4,414 applications were scanned and registered - clearing the scanning backlog completely. Applications are now scanned within a day or two of being received.</p><p>  The focus then moved to the processing of new applications. Processing of applications was divided into two streams.  One concentrates on dealing with new application intake and processes these without delay and the other on the backlog which is ring-fenced with a clear and targeted plan for its elimination. The 4 temporary staff originally allocated to scanning duties were reassigned to CA application processing to support this plan. Implementation of the plan commenced on Monday 3 September.  During the month of September 2012 1,147 CA applications were received, while 1,317 were decided. In October 2012 1,061 CA applications were received, while 2,520 were decided.</p><p>  Under the initial plan, elimination of the backlog of CA applications was targeted for the end of May 2013.  However, within the current month, a further additional 10 temporary staff have been assigned to CA section.  This further injection of resources brings the target for backlog elimination the backlog of CA forward to the end of March 2013.</p><p>  The allocation of available resources to this task continues to be monitored and managed to ensure that the backlog is eliminated in the quickest possible time.</p></reply>

Since it commenced operations, some 6,784 people, who had been on the live register for 12 months or more, have taken up work placements.  </p><p>  The process for collating data for T&uacute;s involves gathering data provided by the 52 Implementing Bodies managing T&uacute;s across the 13 divisional areas operated by the Department.  A computer-based tracking system has been put in place by the Department to gather data on each person referred by it to each Implementing Body.  This system is currently being populated with historic data and the verification of this data will be undertaken when the Department is satisfied that all persons referred have been recorded by the Implementing Bodies.  Additionally, to coincide with the new divisional structure of the Department&rsquo;s services (introduced in the first half of 2012), arrangements for gathering current and historic data in respect of T&uacute;s are currently being put in place.  </p><p>  The collation of this data is progressing more slowly than anticipated due to a variety of factors, including, the work involved for external bodies in capturing data from the inception of T&uacute;s to the introduction of the computer-based tracking system, changes in the Department&rsquo;s divisional structure and related personnel changes, resource constraints and priorities associated with the completion of the first set of 12 month contracts for participants. </p><p>  The Department is considering an evaluation of T&uacute;s and anticipates that this task will be undertaken during 2013, depending on the level of resources available.

Membership of the organisation, which is by peer nomination and election, is limited to 250 living artists who have produced a distinguished body of work. Members of the organisation must also have been born in Ireland or have been resident here for five years.</p><p>Members of Aosd&aacute;na are eligible to receive a 'Cnuas' from the Arts Council, a tax- free means-tested annuity for a term of five years  to assist them in concentrating their time and energies in the full-time pursuit of their art. The eligibility criterion for the payment of the cnuas requires that a recipient may not have other earnings in excess of &euro; 25,755 (one and a half times the value of the cnuas). Cnuas recipients are therefore allowed to receive income from other sources so long as it does not take their earnings above this threshold. When a member makes an application for the Cnuas they must provide a signed declaration stating that they do not have other earnings in excess of the eligible threshold.</p><p>As with all elements of Arts Council expenditure, the payment of the Cnuas is independently managed by Council and is not a matter in which I have a statutory function.</p><p>Details of the current membership of Aosd&aacute;na and a schedule of those members in receipt of the Cnuas are available on the Arts Council website at www.artscouncil.ie.</p><p>The table below shows my Department's grant-in-aid to the Arts Council along with funding provided by the Arts Council to Aosd&aacute;na over the five year period from 2007-2011.

One of the objectives of the Authority, set out in Section 25(b) is to ensure &ldquo;that the democratic values enshrined in the Constitution, especially those relating to rightful liberty of expression, are upheld&rdquo;.</p><p>  Section 39 of the 2009 Act provides for the duties of broadcasters and includes duties, for example, in relation to objectivity and impartiality in news and current affairs.  In the discharge of its functions, the BAI is required, under Section 42, to draw up Broadcasting Codes on the standards and practice to be observed by Broadcasters and for compliance matters.</p><p>  In the context of these statutory provisions, the BAI has developed a Broadcasting Code on Referenda and Election Coverage, which was published in September last year.  This Code sets out the rules that Irish broadcasters must comply with when covering any election, or referendum held in the State.</p><p>  The aim of the Code is to ensure that broadcasters&rsquo; coverage of all elections and referenda is fair, objective and impartial.  Coverage should be undertaken without any expression of a broadcaster&rsquo;s own views on an election or referendum or on election parties or candidates.</p><p>  The Code also contains specific provisions that relate to party political broadcasts and moratoria on coverage of referenda and/or elections.  The Code also restates the prohibition on broadcasters airing political advertising.</p><p>  It is incumbent upon the BAI and all broadcasters in the State, to ensure that they adhere to the Code on Referenda and Election Coverage, as well as to the spirit and letter of the relevant judicial rulings in this area.</p><p>I have no plans to amend the existing legislation in this area.</p></reply>

With basic broadband services now widely available across Ireland, the challenge is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.</p><p>  The National Broadband Plan, which I published recently, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>  The Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country &ndash; specifically:</p><p>- 70Mbps &ndash; 100Mbps will be available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015;</p><p>- At least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% (and potentially as much as 35%) of the population during the lifetime of the Government; and </p><p>- A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country, also during the lifetime of the Government.</p><p>  During the preparation of the Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.</p><p>  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30Mbps and 40Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&rsquo; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.

These will be reflected in, or developed from, Service Level Agreements (SLAs), or negotiated agreements with a common understanding about the services to be provided, priorities, responsibilities, performance, etc., which will be developed between Government Departments or, where appropriate, State agencies and local authorities. The SLAs will identify the levels of performance expected and resources available, along with the relevant responsibilities and expectations necessary to enable the required services. Since the focus will be on the performance of the local authorities, the service indicators are being reclassified as performance indicators to enable assessment of a local authority&#8217;s overall performance in delivering a particular activity or service and to facilitate evaluating its performance against the relevant performance standard.</p><p>  The performance standards and performance indicators will also inform and assist in the development of Customer Charters and in monitoring and reporting adherence to the charters.</p><p>  Increased emphasis will be placed on identifying customers&#8217; expectations and requirements and their experience of service delivery in their local authority. Indicators will also reflect value for money and the cost effective use of resources by local authorities. The reporting of the performance indicators will be structured to facilitate comparison across local authorities (clustered by type/size as appropriate), and changes in the performance of individual local authorities over time. It is intended that performance standards and performance indicators will &#8211;</p><p>- provide members of the public with more information about what their local authority actually does and on how it is performing, and how this performance is changing over time;</p><p>-  enable each authority to monitor its progress, assist in the allocation of resources locally and assist Ministers and Departments similarly;</p><p>- allow comparative analysis of performance between local authorities, and enable authorities to identify what they need to do in order to raise performance levels to match better performing authorities.</p><p>  To optimise the benefits of performance standards and performance indicators, local authorities will prepare Annual Service Plans and set targets to be achieved in the delivery of services against each of the performance standards. The service plans, which will cover each service division in each local authority and will set out the decisions taken in relation to the services and levels of standards to which they are expected to be provided, will be adopted by the elected members as a reserved function. It is intended that these plans will be updated and approved annually in parallel with the budgetary process.</p><p>  The authorities&#8217; Annual Reports will include a comprehensive review of performance of the service plans against the performance standards and will show how &#8211;  </p><p>- targets set at the start of the year have been achieved against performance indicators;</p><p>- the authority performed compared to other local authorities, especially those of comparable size, and;</p><p>- each local authority is improving its level of service year-on-year.</p></reply>

Persons who make submissions are also entitled to be notified of any new information provided, and to be notified of the decision of the planning authority. These increased rights were introduced in tandem with the &euro;20 fee for making a submission or observation, the aim of which was to contribute to the increasing costs for planning authorities in administering the development consent system, while not discouraging public participation in the process.</p><p>  In relation to planning appeals, the position is that any person who made a submission on the planning application may appeal the decision of a planning authority on the application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the independent statutory appeals board. There is, however, also a fee for making an appeal - currently &euro;220. When an appeal is made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la any person may make a submission on it for a fee of &euro;50.</p><p>  It should also be noted that the Board has discretion to dismiss an appeal where it is satisfied the appeal is vexatious, frivolous or without substance or foundation or where the appeal is made with the sole intention of delaying development or of securing the payment of money, gifts, considerations or other inducement by any persons.</p><p>  Planning legislation therefore permits a person to make observations, or appeal the decision, in relation to any number of planning applications (subject of course to the payment of the appropriate fee). However I do not see that that is any reason to amend the current provisions.</p><p>  The views of third parties are part of the planning process and, in any case, are only one of the matters considered by a planning authority when considering the planning application. In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities, and An Bord Plean&aacute;la on appeal, must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to a number of matters, including the provisions of the development plan, any submissions or observations received, and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any guidelines issued by my Department.</p></reply>

The two principal sources of revenue for the Local Government Fund are the proceeds of motor tax and the income from the Household Charge. The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides that income from the charge is to be paid into the Local Government Fund. The proceeds from the household charge are being re-distributed on an equalised basis to local authorities within the context of the annual allocations of general purpose g rants. General purpose grants contribute towards meeting the reasonable cost to local authorities of providing services to their customers. Some &euro;651m in general purpose grants had been allocated to local authorities for 2012. It has been necessary for me to reduce general purpose grant funding to local authorities in the third quarter of 2012 in light of the level of compliance with the household charge.</p><p>It is estimated that there are some 1.6 million residential properties potentially liable for the household charge. As such, if collected in full, the household charge has the potential to raise &euro;160 million annually. As of 16 of November 2012 some &euro;107.7 m or over 66% had been collected nationally. A total of &euro;15,695,292 was withheld from the Quarter 3 general purpose grant payment. For county and city councils, this represented a reduction of between 1% and 3% of the total general purpose grant allocation for 2012.</p><p>Local authorities can maintain the remainder of their general purpose grant allocation for 2012 through improved household charge compliance. Those authorities achieving a collection rate of 65% nationally will not have a further reduction in their final quarter general purpose grant payment. Local authorities achieving a collection rate of 60-65% will incur a further reduction of 0.5%, while those authorities achieving a compliance rate below 60% will incur a further 1% reduction in their annual allocation.</p><p>I am confident that the level of general purpose grants together with other Government grants and subsidies, and income raised from local sources, is appropriate to meet the costs of providing a reasonable level of local authority services to communities.</p><p>The information requested is set out in the following table.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Local Authority </div></th><th><div>Allocation 2011 <br />&#8364; </div></th><th><div>Allocation 2012 <br />&#8364; </div></th><th><div>Quarter 3 2012 Reduction <br />&#8364; </div></th><th><div>Revised 2012 Allocation <br />&#8364; </div></th><th><div>% Reduction in 2012 </div></th></tr><tr><td><div>Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council </div></td><td><div>31,522,005 </div></td><td><div>25,780,316 </div></td><td><div>343,583 </div></td><td><div>25,436,733 </div></td><td><div>1.3% </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Fingal County Council <br /></div></td><td><div>26,267,018 </div></td><td><div>20,455,071 </div></td><td><div>545,285 </div></td><td><div>19,909,786 </div></td><td><div>2.7% </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>South Dublin County Council </div></td><td><div>21,709,971 </div></td><td><div>16,963,904 </div></td><td><div>475,210 </div></td><td><div>16,488,694 </div></td><td><div>2.8% </div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date is liable to pay the Charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver. It is a matter for an owner of a residential property to determine liability. Residential property is defined in the Act as a building that is occupied or suitable for occupation as a separate dwelling. The legislation provides for a number of exemptions and waivers from payment of the Charge. </p><p>  The exemptions from payment are: </p><p>-  Residential properties that are part of the trading stock of a business and have not been sold or been the source of any income since construction;   </p><p>-  Residential property owned by a Minister of the Government, a housing authority or the Health Service Executive;   </p><p>-  Voluntary and co-operative housing;   </p><p>-  Residential property subject to commercial rates and wholly used as a dwelling;   </p><p>-  Residential property owned by certain charities or discretionary trusts; and,   </p><p>-  Residential property which an owner has vacated due to long-term mental or physical infirmity (e.g. an elderly person that has moved into a nursing home). </p><p>  The waivers which apply concern:   </p><p>-  Owners of residential property entitled to mortgage interest supplement; and,   </p><p>-  Owners of houses in certain unfinished housing estates. </p><p>  I urge any person who is unsure as to their liability for the Household Charge to contact their local authority with a view to resolving their status.</p></reply>

The Government legislation programme includes an Electoral (Amendment) (Referendum Spending and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to be published in 2013 which will implement more commitments in the Programme for Government. Arising from the Action Programme for Effective Local Government I have established a Local Electoral Area Boundary Committee to review and make recommendations on local electoral area boundaries in time for the 2014 local elections and my Department will be providing administrative support to that committee. </p><p>  Following these tasks, I will be addressing the Programme for Government commitment to establish an Electoral Commission to subsume functions of existing bodies and my Department. Establishment of an Electoral Commission will be a major body of work. Issues for consideration include international best practice, the Commission's structure and functions, who it reports to, its relationship with other bodies currently involved in electoral administration, and the approach to be followed in relation to the extensive legislation that will be required, as well as practical matters including staffing and funding arrangements.</p></reply>

The Commission in its report , presented to the Ceann Comhairle on 21 June 2012 , recommended maintenance of the existing arrangement of constituencies for the election of Ireland's twelve members to the European Parliament. Consistent with established practice since the first independent constituency commission reported in 1980 the Government has accepted in full the recommendations in the Constituency Commission report. I will not therefore, on foot of that report, be bringing forward any amendments to the Third Schedule of the European Parliament Elections Act 1997 in which the constituencies for European Parliament elections and the number of members to be elected for each constituency are specified. That Schedule was most recently amended by Section 8 of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2009. </p><p>  While the number of seats in the European Parliament allocated to Ireland stands at twelve there is a need to adjust the distribution of seats in the Parliament before the 2014 elections to take account of the accession of Croatia in 2013. I understand that the proposal of the European Parliament in this matter is awaited. Article 14.2 of the Treaty on European Union sets an absolute limit of 750 seats, plus the President, for the European Parliament and provides that the composition of the Parliament is decided by the European Council by unanimity on the initiative of the Parliament and with its consent.</p></reply>

This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body who in turn rent it to the original owners.</p><p>  One case has been finalised with several more due to close by year end; however lenders have put forward in excess of 500 cases and currently are actively engaged with over 100 customers on Mortgage to Rent with a further 100 cases at an early stage in the process.</p><p>  The numbers of completed transactions is low but significant progress has been made. All of the main lenders and so called sub - prime lenders are fully engaged and have instituted the necessary internal processes. It is also important to bear in mind that the transition from being a homeowner to a social housing tenant is a major one for families. Mortgage to rent or other such interventions cannot be rushed for any party. For example, the process provides a 60 day decision period and a 28 day cooling off period within the time frame of the scheme. My Department estimates that the overall time frame per case from start to completed transaction will be up to eight months . This compares favourably to the time frames in other jurisdictions operating similar schemes.</p><p>  The level of ambition for next year under mortgage to rent and the prospective associated mortgage to lease arrangements will be determined largely in the context of the Estimates process for 2013. It will be essential to deal with any potential displacement effect for other categories of social housing need arising as a result of the wider roll-out of mortgage to rent.</p></reply>

There are 35 Local Action Groups (LAGs) contracted, on my Department&#8217;s behalf, to deliver the RDP throughout the country and these groups are the principal decision-makers in relation to the allocation of project funding. Such decisions are made in the context of the local development strategy of the individual groups and in line with Departmental operating rules and EU regulations. </p><p>  Projects that request funding of &#8364;150,000 or more are required to seek final approval from my Department. The assessment of such higher value projects usually involves detailed consultations between my Department and the relevant local development company. It frequently necessitates the provision of further documentation or clarifications. It may also, in some instances, result in modifications to the project proposed to ensure best value for money and compliance with all the necessary regulations, both national and European, governing the activities funded under the programme. These assessments also consider whether the project as proposed addresses the needs of the local community in the best possible way. A full and detailed assessment of all projects is essential. Currently, LEADER activities are co-financed by the European Union at a rate of 85% and, accordingly, come within the remit of a strict regulatory regime which requires that each project must be compliant before any funding is awarded by the LEADER companies.   </p><p><font color="#111111">  The policy in my Department is to work with the Local Development Companies to ensure that the projects submitted are fully compliant and can be approved rather than to refuse approval for funding , and it can therefore take some time to come to a final conclusion. My Department will continue to work with   Cavan Monaghan LEADER regarding the projects in question , to make a full assessment of their eligibility, and will inform the Group once all queries have been addressed satisfactorily.</font></p></reply>

It will provide extensive provisions for the regulation by the insolvency service of the new personal insolvency practitioners. There will be regulatory provisions, oversight and provisions to ensure there are indemnities to guarantee that where funds are being dealt with, those using personal insolvency practitioners are protected.  As I said in the course of this debate, many of the regulatory mechanisms already exist in other contexts. It is a question of adapting them to the insolvency legislation. A substantial amount of work has been done on that. <br /><br />  There was an issue at one stage as to whether it would be the Central Bank or the insolvency agency that would deal with the regulatory side but in the context of providing a unified focus on the insolvency area it was decided that it would be the insolvency agency. I was optimistic that we would be in a position to bring the amendments before this House on Report Stage but we will have them for the Seanad proceedings. Members will have an opportunity to consider them when they come back from the Seanad&quot;.</blockquote></blockquote>  The engagement of a personal insolvency practitioner to negotiate either a Debt Settlement Arrangement or Personal Insolvency Arrangement will be entirely a matter for the debtor concerned. The debtor will be able to choose from the list of those practitioners regulated by the Insolvency Service of Ireland. As I have said on a number of occasions, I expect that accountants, lawyers and a broad range of financial advisors may wish to seek regulation as practitioners.</p></reply>

This total is unchanged from 2011. Applications from nineteen eligible organisations, that is, charities that operate lotteries that were established before 1997, are currently being processed by the Department of Justice and Equality and payments will be made later this year. The total funding available under the Scheme will begin to reduce in 2013 and will be gradually decreased over a period of three years after which the scheme will be discontinued. Recipient organisations were advised of this in early October, in effect giving them more than 12 months notice of this change. The decision to wind down this Scheme has been taken in the context of the requirement for all Government Departments to meet exacting savings targets in the years ahead.</p><p>  Funding disbursed under the Charitable Lotteries Scheme is drawn from both the National Lottery surplus and exchequer funding. The Scheme was set up in 1997 to supplement the incomes of charitable organisations that were operating lotteries in competition with the National Lottery. Approximately &euro;114 million has been disbursed under the Scheme since its inception. The amount each organisation receives is determined in proportion to its gross annual sales of relevant lottery products. The criteria for the Scheme do not take account of either the profitability of the lottery or the proportion of the revenue it generates that reaches the charitable cause in whose name the products are sold.  This means that the scheme has not provided any incentive for charities to operate lotteries with a low cost base or to ensure that a high proportion of the revenue generated goes directly to the cause with which the ticket is identified. Such a Scheme can no longer be justified in the current circumstances.</p><p>  The gradual phasing out of the Scheme will yield savings of &euro;11 million over the three year period 2013-2015, with a further saving of &euro;6 million each year after 2015 when no further payments will be made. The level of assistance is being reduced gradually in order to minimise the impact on the organisations affected and to afford them an opportunity to consider appropriate action they could take to generate greater net profit from their fundraising activities and to make such changes as they consider beneficial.</p><p>  In this context, I am also considering an increase to the current limits on private lottery prizes under the Gaming and Lotteries Act of 1956.  I have asked organisations in receipt of funding under the Charitable Lotteries Scheme to consider this issue and have invited them to make a submission to my Department. I look forward to receiving their views in the near future.</p><p>  The matter of the State's lottery licence is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

The Bill is currently being drafted and it is intended to have the legislation in place early next year.  In parallel, arrangements are being made to select members of the new Commission.  This is being handled by an independent Selection Panel set up for that purpose.  Advertisements inviting applications were published last Sunday, with a deadline of 29 November for submission of applications.  The successful applicants will be appointed to the two existing bodies, pending enactment of the necessary legislation to effect the merger.  This will ensure that the two organisations can start to operate as a cohesive whole, with a transition programme being prepared and put in place, that the board(s) can commence preparing a Strategic Plan for the new body and that work can be taken forward rapidly on the staffing review envisaged in the Working Group report.</p><p>  I can also inform the Deputy that a group of officials, led by the Secretary General, met with the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights (OHCHR) in October.  This was a very positive meeting and addressed fully all the issues and concerns raised previously by the High Commissioner.</p><p>  The OHCHR consider that Ireland has engaged in a good process in the development of the new Commission; has full confidence that the Government is approaching the issue in the right way and considers our approach as a best practice model for other countries.  </p><p>  The OHCHR welcomed the approach taken in the draft legislation of having two definitions of human rights and will encourage other countries to adopt this approach.</p></reply>

The number of inspections carried out on the Towers since it opened are as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Year</div></th><th><div>Independent Inspection Company QTS</div></th><th><div>RIA Inspection</div></th></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td>2012 (to date)</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td><div>6</div></td><td><div>8</div></td></tr></table></p><p>Asylum seekers are not allocated to particular centres based on status of their asylum claim or their length of time in the asylum process.  Records are not maintained in such a way as to distinguish one centre from another in terms of residents who have been deported or granted leave to remain: such information would have no practical application or value.  It is therefore not possible to provide the Deputy with any information on the number of deportees from the Towers since it opened on 10/10/2006.</p><p>In relation to cost, it is assumed that this question relates to the cost of the contract between RIA and the proprietor of the Towers. This is set out in the table below.  It does not include costs in relation to the provision of medical, educational or other services to the residents of the Towers, as these costs would be borne by the relevant Government departments dealing with same.</p><p>Clondalkin Towers was first contracted to RIA on 10/10/2006. The current contract ends on 24/12/2012. A new contract with a reduced accommodation capacity will follow thereafter covering a further period to 26 June, 2014.  As I have explained before in response to previous D&aacute;il Questions, it is not in the interests of the taxpayer that details of current individual contracts are known to the public or to other parties who are, or may be in the future, engaged in negotiations with RIA. Therefore, details of <i>current</i> contracts are not provided. The policy is that the updating of the table of contracts will take place only at the end of January each year in respect of all financial information up to the end of December two years previously, e.g. at the end of January, 2012 the records are updated to end of December 2009.  This policy has been upheld by the Office of the Information Commissioner.</p><p>Therefore, whilst the current contract in respect of the Towers ends on 24 December, 2012, details of payments under this contract in the table below cover only the period to 31 December, 2009.</p><p><table><tr><th>Centre</th><th>Contract start</th><th>Contract end</th><th>Value * (see note)</th><th>Capacity</th><th>Contractor</th></tr><tr><td>The Towers</td><td>10/10/2006</td><td>31/03/2009</td><td>&#8364;7,993,500</td><td>50-250</td><td>Rowtes Ltd</td></tr><tr><td>The Towers</td><td>01/04/2009</td><td>24/12/2012</td><td>&#8364;2,656,500 *</td><td>250</td><td>Rowtes Ltd</td></tr></table></p><p><bi>*where contract date goes beyond 31/12/2009, the value shown represents those payments made up to 31/12/2009.</bi></p></reply>

As recent tragic events have shown, it can have the most serious and tragic consequences.</p><p>  Cyberbullying may amount to the offence of harassment under the 1997 Non Fatal Offences Against the Person Act. As Minister, my function is to ensure the removal of barriers hindering not only the prosecution but also the effective investigation of offences under that Act.</p><p>  In a statement in this House on 7 November I referred to my request to the Law Reform Commission to examine the requirement that, in order for it to secure a conviction, the prosecution must show persistence by the accused in pursuing the offence of harassment under the 1997 Act.</p><p>  The matter raised by the Deputy relates for the most part to the investigation of offences. In just the same way as already mentioned, I will pursue any evidence of difficulties in gaining the access required by the Garda&iacute; in the course of their investigations, bearing in mind that some sites are based outside of this jurisdiction. However, I have not been alerted to any difficulty in securing access to data required in relation to investigations into cyberbullying. The IT industry in Ireland, I am pleased to say, acts in line with the spirit as well as the letter of the law.</p><p>  I therefore have no immediate plans for legislation but I will review my position in the event that the need for legislative change becoming evident.</p></reply>

I am not aware of any proposal for the introduction of a separate early retirement scheme or that consideration is being given to same. Given the fact that the Defence Forces are currently below strength and that recruitment is ongoing, there are no plans to introduce a voluntary redundancy or an early retirement scheme for the Defence Forces at this time.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-20a.1058.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012112000054#WRU03100"><p>The person referred to would not have received a higher pension if he had retired after 21 years service. The basic position is that an &#8216;additional increment&#8217; is paid over and above the 21-year pension for each additional year of service above 21 years to a maximum of 31 years.  However, this additional element ceases to be payable when an individual reaches social welfare State Pension age.   </p><p>  The detailed position is as follows:  Under the pre-April 2004 Defence Forces Pension Schemes, the minimum service required for an immediate pension and lump sum in the case of NCOs and Privates is 21 years, regardless of age.  Maximum benefits accrue after 31 years.  The 21-year pension consists of the following elements:</p><p>(a)a basic flat-rate pension that varies according to rank (&#8364;12,913.19 p.a. for a Corporal as in the specific case of the person referred to); <i>plus</i></p><p>(b)an addition in respect of military service allowance (MSA) equal to 40% of the MSA rate where discharged since August 1990 (equal to &#8364;2,536.16 p.a. in this case); and</p><p>(c)if applicable, fixed % additions to (a) in respect of certain other qualifying payments (e.g. 3% extra for Technician Pay in his specific case). </p><p>  All of the above elements are payable for the person&#8217;s lifetime.  However, an &#8216;additional increment&#8217; is also payable at a flat rate for each year of service in excess of 21 years up to a maximum of 31 years. This increment is increased, where appropriate, by the top-up at (c).  Where maximum pensionable service is 31 or more years, as applies in this instance, the MSA top-up is 50% of the rate of MSA (rather than 40%).  In this specific case, his additional increment (inclusive of the top-up at (c)) amounted to &#8364;4,804.84 p.a.  However, this ceases to be payable when the pensioner reaches the qualifying age of 66 under the Social Welfare code for a State Pension Contributory, or if they become entitled to a State Pension (Transition) at the earlier age of 65.  At the same time, the 50% MSA top-up reverts to the 40% rate.</p><p>  I am advised that these arrangements are in accordance with the long established principle of integrating occupational pensions with Social Insurance benefits of employees who are in full PRSI class.  This includes NCOs and Privates, who are fully insured for the range of benefits under the Social Welfare Acts such as the State Pension.  &#8216;Integration' means that a person&#8217;s entitlement to Social Insurance benefits such as the State Pension is taken into account when calculating the rate of occupational pension payable.  In effect, integration results in a reduced rate of occupational pension than would otherwise be the case.  In the public service generally, the practical effect of integration is that the maximum occupational pension is 50% of pensionable pay <i>less</i> the maximum personal rate of State Pension (Contributory) applicable at retirement date.  The State Pension etc. is regarded as part of the overall pension package payable to the individual.  The occupational pension integrated (combined) with the State Pension makes up the &#8216;total pension&#8217; for full PRSI contributors in the public service. The integration principle applies right across the public service and, indeed, in many areas of the private sector as well as in other countries.</p><p>  When the person in question retired on 1 February 2007 (at age 60) from the Defence Forces he had accrued the maximum pensionable service of 31 years and, on that basis, qualified for a significantly higher pension than if he had left after 21 years service.  From that date up until the eve of his 65<sup>th</sup> birthday (31 January 2012), his military pension included the additional increment for 31 years&#8217; service and the corresponding MSA top-up, on that date giving a pension rate of &#8364;20,719.08 a year.  On turning 65 (1 February 2012), he qualified for the State Pension (Transition).  In accordance with the arrangements mentioned, the additional elements in respect of his service for 22 &#8211; 31 years ceased to be payable from that date.  Since then, his revised military pension rate has been &#8364;15,606.55 a year, a reduction of &#8364;5,112.53.  These are the gross rates in his case after application of the &#8216;Public Service Pension Reduction&#8217; introduced under emergency legislation in 2011 (the actual amount of which itself has been reduced in this person&#8217;s case by virtue of his lower military pension rate).</p><p>  The maximum personal rate of State Pension is currently &#8364;230.30 a week (if under age 80).  This is considerably greater than the actual reduction of &#8364;97.98 a week in this person&#8217;s case under the pre-April 2004 Defence Forces&#8217; pension arrangements on his qualification for the State Pension at age 65.  Indeed, his current combined weekly pension of &#8364;529.39 (i.e. Defence Forces pension of &#8364;299.09 <i>plus</i> State Pension of &#8364;230.30) represents a one-third increase on what he was getting alone from his military pension before turning 65.</p><p>  The method of integration for these military pensioners is considerably less severe than in other areas of the public service.  This is because elsewhere generally, the integration mechanism begins from the time an occupational pension comes into payment and, as I have already indicated, it effectively caps at 50% of pensionable pay the combined value of the occupational pension plus State pension.  In contrast, for retired pre-April 2004 enlisted personnel such as the person referred to, integration as outlined above does not actually apply at all until the social welfare State Pension becomes payable at age 65 / 66.  This could be some (or many) years after the person concerned had retired on pension from the Defence Forces.  Even then, at age 65/66, the Defence Forces pension plus State Pension actually exceeds the public service maximum of 50% of pensionable pay.  In effect, these military pensioners have what amounts to a partial, and more favourable, form of integration.</p><p>  The general issue of integration of occupational pensions in the public service was examined by the <i>Commission on Public Service Pensions. </i>  Its final report, published in November 2000, was considered and broadly accepted by Government.  The Commission accepted that integration is a fundamental component in the public service pension framework and was strongly of the view that it should be continued. It did not make any recommendations that would affect the current integration arrangements applicable to retired NCOs and Privates covered by the pre-April 2004 Defence Forces pensions schemes.</p></reply>

No. 357 of 2011 - European Communities (Equine) Regulations 2011.<b></b>This legislation requires that equine animals be identified with a passport and a microchip within a precise timeframe. If an equine animal has not been identified within six months of the date of its birth, or by the 31<sup>st</sup>  of December in the year of its birth, whichever date occurs later, then the equine animal cannot be admitted to the food chain. There is no legal mechanism that would allow the creation of a temporary horse registration waiver scheme for factory horses that would be obtainable only at the factory gate.  </p><p>  The fees charged by the Passport Issuing Organisations for registration of foals have remained the same for a long number of years. The registration fee for an equine that is ineligible for a studbook is in the order of &#8364;35.  There is an additional cost of a veterinary fee in the registration process.  It is understood that good quality horses suitable for the food chain make in the region of &#8364;300 to &#8364;500.</p><p>  Horses that are not eligible to enter the food chain may be euthanized by a registered Veterinary Surgeon or by a person licensed to slaughter equines.  The carcass should then be disposed of through an approved knackery.  The Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council (FAWAC) recommend that, in situations where an owner can no longer adequately provide for an animal or where the equine can no longer fulfil the purpose for which it was bred, owners should be proactive in seeking to dispose of the animals before their welfare is compromised, including the option of humane disposal.   Such action will help prevent the emergence of long-term and severe animal welfare problems. </p></reply>

That National Programme also funded a range of other schemes not included in the OP.  The modest level of EFF co-funding available to Ireland for the period 2007-2013, &euro;42 million over 7 years, meant that all investment needs for the sector could not be included in the OP. A decision was taken by the previous Government to allocate the available co-funding to certain programmes and to fund others from the Exchequer.</p><p>In their Interim Evaluation Report conducted in 2011, Fitzpatrick Associates noted the changed economic circumstances facing Ireland since the OP was originally drafted and the impacts this was likely to have on availability of Exchequer funding for measures included within the National Programme.  Fitzpatrick Associates also noted that the measures included in the OP were not likely to be sufficient to draw down the full &euro;42 million allocation from the EFF.  They recommended the amendment of the OP to include most of the measures previously included in the National Programme, to ensure availability of supports to these important areas of the seafood sector and to ensure full draw down of EFF funds.  The recommendations were accepted and a revised OP was submitted to the European Commission in March 2012.  That revised OP must be adopted by Commission Decision and that is awaited.  The revised OP will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website immediately after its adoption.  However, it is important to note that the measures included in the revised OP took effect immediately following its submission to the Commission.</p><p>The Interim Evaluation Report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p><i>http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/fisheries/seafoodpolicydevelopment/seafooddevelopmentinireland2007-2013/</i></p><p>I have no information available to me on the timing of submission to, or approval by, the European Commission of other Member State&rsquo;s Operational Programmes.  The process of developing a new OP for the period 2014 to 2020 will commence shortly.  The EU Regulation on the new European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) is still under negotiation as part of the CFP reforms.  That Regulation will specify the areas of the seafood sector that may be supported in the next programming period and will specify the criteria that will determine how much of the EMFF fund will be available to Ireland.  These two issues will be central in shaping the new OP.  Consultation with stakeholders will form an important part of the process for preparing the new OP.</p><p>EU rules do not permit the carrying over of allocations from one programming period to the next, so strictly speaking no funds were carried over from the previous FIFG fund.  However, depending on the level of drawdown of funds under the programme, the rules do allow for eligible expenditure after the programming period.  This is referred to as N+2.  This was the case with the transition period between the FIFG and the EFF, where expenditure under the FIFG continued for a certain period after 2006.  This may also be the case with the transition period between the EFF and the EMFF.</p><p>The 2011 Annual Implementation Report for the Seafood Development Operational Programme 2007-2013 shows that approximately &euro;28 million of the &euro;42 million EFF allocation had been committed up to the end of 2011.  As processing and aquaculture did not become part of the OP until 2012, this spend can be attributed to the catching sector.  The majority of this spend was accounted for by the 2008 Decommissioning Scheme.  Up to 2011, BIM was the implementing agency for all elements of the OP, so all funds spent were disbursed through BIM.</p><p>Approximately &euro;14 million of EFF funds remains to be committed over the period from 2012 onwards.  That period may extend up to 2015, if the N+2 rule is invoked.  The table below indicates the breakdown of allocations by EFF priority axis.  These priority axes are specified in the EFF Regulation (1198/2006).  It is important to note that the Exchequer must provide matching funding, generally at the same level as the EFF contribution.  Beneficiaries must also provide private funding.  The level of private funding required varies from one scheme to another.  Priority Axis 1 includes decommissioning and fleet safety, axis 2 includes marketing, processing and aquaculture, axis 3 includes marine environmental measures, axis 4 includes coastal area development and axis 5 covers technical assistance (implementation costs).

The measures make it an offence to import ash plants and seed from any country known to have the disease.  As the island of Ireland has harmonised plant health status under the EU Plant Health Directive, these legal measures were introduced in conjunction with similar measures taken by the Northern Ireland. </p><p>  While plants are a higher risk pathway, scientific advice is that the movement of ash timber is also a possible pathway of infection.

Department Inspectors are also surveying for this disease in garden centres, nurseries and landscape plantings.  Our website provides details of the disease and contact phone numbers and an email address for anyone who believes they may have ash with the disease.   My Department and Teagasc have prepared a poster on the disease which we intend circulating to every Teagasc, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Coillte and NPWS office in the country as well as other relevant private sector offices.

The balancing payments will issue in the first week of December.</p><p>  Insofar as the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is concerned, despite having to implement changes to the Terms and Conditions of the 2012 Scheme, in order to achieve budgetary savings, there was no resultant delay in the commencement of payments, which began issuing, on target, on 26 September. I can report that, to date, payments worth some &euro;191 million have already issued to 85,972 beneficiaries.</p><p>  I should add that, in the expectation of many farmers wishing to enquire as to the status of their applications and specifically as to when payments would issue, I established a dedicated call centre, from within existing staff resources, to deal with such enquiries. I can confirm that over the past eight weeks a large volume of calls were processed through the call centre. This approach allowed the maximum number of telephone enquiries to be dealt with, while simultaneously allowing payment processing to continue unabated. I can confirm that it is my intention that every effort continues to be made to maximise payments under both Schemes before year-end.</p></reply>

Grasslands continue to be eligible where it is evident that the stocking rate on the land is sufficient and, for example, keeps rushes under control and avoids their proliferation.  In such situations, the reality is there may not be a necessity to cut rushes. However, where a farmer cuts rushes as part of management practice, with the exception of certain designated lands, there are no restrictions on when this is done, enabling the task to be carried out at any time throughout the year once conditions are suitable.</p><p>  Where land is deemed ineligible, this, in the main, is a result of the inclusion of ineligible areas/features and is not being used for an agricultural purpose. In cases where land, with rushes, is rejected, it will be seen that this is due to the broader issue of insufficient agricultural activity being undertaken on it to keep it in GAEC.  My Department therefore does not maintain records specifically on the presence of rushes since the issue has to be seen in the broader context.</p><p>  In terms of the conduct of inspections, my Department makes appropriate allowances for the effect of prevailing weather conditions in individual cases.</p></reply>

Prevention of the spread of Chalara is my primary concern and early detection plays a key role in achieving this objective. While my Department has been surveying for Chalara since 2008 these surveys are set to intensify as officials Department commence an extensive examination of forests focusing on sites planted with imported ash.  Specific training for the winter symptoms of ash dieback has been provided to District Forestry Inspectors and horticultural staff. Department Inspectors are also surveying for the disease in garden centres, nurseries and landscape plantings.</p><p>  Our website provides details of the disease and contact phone numbers and an email address for anyone who believes they may have ash with the disease. My Department and Teagasc have prepared a poster on the disease and we will be circulating these to every Teagasc, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Coillte and NPWS office in the country as well as other relevant private sector offices. The aim will be to inform people of the symptoms of the disease and so as promote early detection.</p><p>  In terms of preventing further infections originating from outside of Ireland, I introduced legislation on the 26<sup>th</sup> October 2012, to prohibit the importation into Ireland of plant material from ash dieback infected areas.  The measures make it an offence to import ash plants and seed from any country known to have the disease.  As the island of Ireland has harmonised plant health status under the EU Plant Health Directive, these legal measures were introduced in conjunction with similar measures taken by the Northern Ireland.  Great Britain also brought in similar measures.</p><p>  While plants are a higher risk pathway, scientific advice is that the movement of ash timber is also a possible pathway of infection.  Legislation on the movement of ash wood was introduced, again in conjunction with Northern Ireland, on the 6<sup>th</sup> November 2012 and will limit the movement of ash wood into the island of Ireland as a precautionary measure.</p></reply>

Approximately 65,700 children are availing of the ECCE programme in the current school year and &euro;175.8 million has been provided to cover the cost of the programme.</p><p>  Since the introduction of the programme, services have been expected to have a minimum enrolment of at least 8 eligible children to participate in the programme.  This number is considered the minimum appropriate number for the fostering of pro-social behaviour and cognitive development.  It is important that the pre-school classroom should provide stimulating, motivating activities that promote student involvement, where individual choices are encouraged and where there is  an opportunity for children to engage with a diverse range of friends.</p><p>  However, to allow for the flexible implementation of the programme a number of exceptions to this minimum requirement may be considered.  For example, a service which is an appropriate setting for the pre-school year and has an enrolment of at least 8 children of whom at least 3 qualify for the programme and the remainder will qualify in the following year, can apply for entry to the programme.  Smaller services which have an enrolment of not fewer than 5 children in their pre-school year can also apply for entry.  In addition, in order to ensure that no child is denied the opportunity of availing of the free pre-school year, certain rural services not meeting the minimum requirement may participate where parents in the area would have no other convenient option.</p></reply>

Meetings have been held by myself and my Department with representatives from SOUND on a number of occasions.   Department is working closely with the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the Department of Education and Skills to address the needs of those affected by narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination. </p><p>  The HSE provides a range of services and supports to those affected including access to rapid diagnosis, clear treatment pathways, temporary medical cards and reimbursement of expenses incurred. Multi-disciplinary assessments which allow for the appropriate individualised health and educational supports to be put in place have commenced. The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is also engaging with the HSE and with the individual schools and parents of children concerned to identify and provide educational supports for the children and adolescents affected. </p><p>  The Department of Education and Skills has also held a number of meetings with SOUND to outline the range of educational supports which may be provided for children with narcolepsy, subject to an assessment of their needs. These supports can include special arrangements at state exams, access to Special Needs Assistant support, additional learning assistance in schools, information for schools regarding this condition, and home tuition support for children who have missed a significant time in school due to illness. </p><p>  A meeting was recently held between  SOUND and representatives from the Higher Education Authority National  Access Office and the Department of Education Higher Education Unit, in relation  to assistance which may be  made for young adults with narcolepsy in Third Level education. Students with  Narcolepsy may access the  Disability Access  Route to Education (DARE) scheme, which offers  enhanced access routes to third level education for pupils with disabilities.  Support can also be provided to pupils in colleges through the Disability  Officers at third level colleges.

The water services authorities have regard to the Code of Practice on the Fluoridation of Drinking Water 2007 published by the Expert Body on Fluorides and Health to ensure effective and efficient implementation of the technical aspects of the fluoridation of drinking water. The water services authorities also measure the quantity of hydrofluosilicic acid used plus the quantity of water treated in order to calculate the concentration of hydrofluosilicic acid in the water.  The HSE undertakes monthly sampling of tap water and can access the daily records of the water services authorities if an issue arises regarding fluoridation levels.</p><p>  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) collects and analyses the monitoring results carried out by water services authorities on drinking water supplies. The most recent EPA report on 'The Provision and Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland' (2010) includes information on water supplies where fluoride parametric values are exceeded. Of the 3,398 samples from public water supplies which were analysed, 74 were above the Irish statutory requirements of 0.8mg/litre. All but one of these elevated levels was below the EU standard of 1.5mg/litre. The EPA is not required to collect data where fluoride parametric values is below the statutory requirement. I have asked the HSE to collate this information and I will forward it to the Deputy when it is available.</p><p>  Hydrofluosilicic acid is used to fluoridate public water supplies. The amount used for 2009, 2010 and 2011 was over 3.9 million litres each year and up to the end of August 2012  was at over 2.6 million litres. Hydrofluosilicic acid is derived from fluorspar and sourced in Spain.  </p><p>  Water fluoridation is one of the most widely studied public health policy initiatives in the world. There have been a number of relevant WHO documents, notably &quot;Fluorides and Human Health&quot;, Monograph Series 59 (1970), WHO Geneva; &quot;Fluorides and Oral Health&quot;, Technical Report Series No. 846 (1994), WHO Geneva; and &quot;Environmental Health Criteria 227 FLUORIDES&quot;, (2002), WHO Geneva. More recently, the review by the EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER, 2011) considered the environmental impact of water fluoridation. </p><p>  Oral health studies carried out in Ireland include O&rsquo;Mullane DM, McCarthy D (1981) &quot;Dental Health Status and Dental Knowledge Attitudes and Behaviour in Irish Adults&quot; (Journal of the Irish Dental Association); National Survey of Adult's Oral Health 1990; National Survey of Adult's Oral Health 2001; North South Survey of Children&rsquo;s Oral Health 2002; Comber et al (2011) &quot;Drinking water fluoridation and osteosarcoma incidence on the island of Ireland&quot;. </p><p>  International reviews include &quot;The York Review &ndash; A systematic review of public water fluoridation: a commentary&quot; (2002) Treasure et al; The Report of the Forum on Fluoridation (2002); &quot;A systematic review of the efficacy and safety of fluoridation&quot; (2007) Australian Government. All of these publications are in the public domain.</p><p>  The balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and continues to be safe and effective in protecting the oral health of all age groups. There are no plans to discontinue the policy of fluoridation of public water supplies, which continues to make an effective contribution to oral health in Ireland.</p></reply>

Under UHI, everyone will have equal access to a comprehensive package of curative services.  The key changes required to support the reform programme which will pave the way for the introduction of universal health insurance are outlined in the provisions of "Future Health:  A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012 - 2015" which was published by the Minister for Health on 15 November 2012.  Earlier this year I appointed Professor John Higgins to chair a Strategic Board on the Establishment of Hospital Groups. Work is continuing on finalising a Draft Report on the recommendations for submission to the Strategic Board. The Report will be submitted to me when the Board have signed off on it and in turn, I will then bring it to Cabinet.</p><p>  Another key building block for UHI is the development of a 'Money Follows the Patient' funding model to replace the current block grant allocation system.  Under 'Money follows the Patient', providers will be paid for the needs they address, the quantity and quality of the services they provide and the outcomes they deliver. They will be liberated, subject to overall budgetary ceilings, to pursue the most cost-effective means of achieving this standard of performance.  Once the key building blocks have been put in place, it will be possible to proceed with implementation of UHI.  Hospitals will then become independent, not-for-profit trusts with managers accountable to their boards. As a precursor to this, it is intended to integrate hospitals into groups on a collaborative administrative basis.</p><p>  The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive service reforms and provide the maximum possible benefit to patients. As part of the drive to ensure real accountability, an annual budget and employment ceiling will be developed for each group.  Groups will also have the authority to deploy and re-deploy staff across hospitals within the group; this will help to alleviate problems that have arisen in the past in relation to the equitable distribution of health care staff across all hospital sites.  Before Hospital Trusts are finally established, the make-up and functioning of the Groups will be reviewed and if changes prove necessary then they will be made with Government approval when the hospital trusts are being formed.</p></reply>

External Service Delivery is an area that can potentially deliver a range of benefits for the provision of health services. These include both cost and efficiency savings stemming from better work and management practices. The Health Sector, along with Education, Justice and Local Government Sectors, are required to prepare  and implement detailed benefits-driven external service delivery plans. This plan is currently being prepared by my Department in conjunction with the HSE.  The option of external delivery of the HSE payroll is currently being explored. In the event of a tendering process, the process will be in line with EU Public Procurement Directives. </p></reply>

Generic substitution allows pharmacists to substitute a cheaper generic equivalent, at the patient&rsquo;s request, when a more expensive product has been prescribed. Reference pricing involves setting a common reimbursement amount for selected groups of medicines, which will be done by the HSE. Only the reference price is reimbursed by the State. When this Bill is enacted and commenced eligible patients will not be required to pay any additional costs for medicines priced at or below the reference price. However, if a patient chooses a particular brand that is more expensive than the reference price they will have to pay the difference between the brand price and the reference price to the pharmacy.  Reference pricing coupled with generic substitution provides patients with an incentive to opt for the cheapest available product, but does not impose any unavoidable additional costs on patients. </p></reply>

In the case of disability services, the HSE National Service Plan 2012 provides for a 3.7% reduction in budgets but makes it clear that there is scope for achieving efficiencies of 2% or more through measures such as consolidation and rationalisation of back office costs. All providers will be expected to achieve some efficiency savings but the level of savings required will vary depending on the profile of the service provider, efficiency savings achieved to date and the scope for further savings.   Some reductions in day services, residential and respite services will be unavoidable even with such efficiencies. The aim will be to tailor such reductions to minimise the impact on service users and families as much as possible.  Pending completion of the national estimates, budgetary and service planning process for 2013 it is not possible to predict the service levels to be provided next year.</p></reply>

In 2010 and 2011, the annual TB notification rates in Ireland were 9.2 per 100,000 (420 cases in 2010 and 424 cases in 2011) which is the lowest rate recorded since surveillance of TB began in the 1950s and now categorise Ireland as a low incidence country and represents a drop from 11.3 per 100,000 (480 cases) in 2007.The number of TB notifications for 2012 up to week ending November 9th is 339 cases, which is a decrease of 49 cases compared to the same period in 2011 (388 cases).</p><p>  The overall rate of tuberculosis continues to decline and this decrease has prompted a review in the HSE of the continuing requirement for BCG which is currently in progress.</p><p>  WHO data indicates that TB notification rates always tend to be higher in inner city locations compared to the general population as is reflected in all major cities worldwide. The rates of TB remain high in parts of inner city Dublin and North Dublin, ranging between 17 per 100,000 to 30 per 100,000 in some areas.However, LHO 7 (comprising mainly Dublin 1 and 7) has shown a decline in rates of TB from 2010 when the rate was 22.9 per 100,000 population (31 cases) to a rate of 14 per 100,000 (19 cases) in 2011. In 2011 a prison outbreak in Dublin increased the TB rate in that local area to 28/100,000.</p><p>  Homeless people are at increased risk of TB, have higher default rates and worse treatment outcomes (including mortality) than the general public. In many industrialised countries, TB rates among the homeless can be up to 20 times higher than the general population.TB has also increased in other marginalised groups such as prisoners and those involved in substance misuse. </p><p>  Similar to other low prevalence countries in Europe the disease is more focussed in marginalised groups such as homeless, prisoners, substance misusers, immigrants from countries of high endemicity. The recommendations of recent expert advice on the Control and prevention of TB are being reviewed and implemented. The focus on TB is being prioritised to the key high risk groups, homeless, immigrants from high endemic countries, and prisoners; and this will guide future funding and developments in services for people with TB.</p></reply>

Under this system, most beds are either designated as public beds or private beds: there is a small number of non-designated beds, such as those in Intensive Care Units.  Under the current  framework, private in-patients who occupy public beds in public hospitals are not levied the daily maintenance charge, which ranges from &euro;586 to &euro;1,046 in most public hospitals. </p><p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General reported in 2010 that 45% of in-patients treated privately by their consultants were not charged for their maintenance costs because they were not occupying designated private beds. As part of Budget 2012, I announced that I intended to bring forward legislation to provide for the charging of all private patients in public hospitals, irrespective of whether they occupied a public or a private bed.   In view of  the significant potential cost implications for private health insurers, I subsequently indicated that I would be prepared to postpone implementation of the legislation until 2013 provided that the funds targeted for the current year were raised through a system of improved cashflow from the private insurers.  Arrangements for this improved cashflow have been agreed in principle with the insurers, and the legal details are being finalised at present. </p><p>  In relation to charging all private patients in public beds, the issue will be dealt with as part of the budgetary process for 2013 and I will bring legislative proposals to Government on the matter in due course.  I am committed to keeping the cost of health insurance premia as low as possible and, to this end, my Department is working closely with the four health insurers, through the Health Insurance Consultative Forum.  The objective of the forum is to explore ways to minimise costs, while always respecting competition law.</p></reply>

These operational efficiencies include the removal of on-call arrangements in rosters, where ambulance staff are not actually on duty in ambulance stations or vehicle but may be contacted in the event of a 999 call.  This means that it could take over 20 minutes for an emergency ambulance to leave its station after the crew has been tasked. All parties have accepted that, in accordance with a Labour Court recommendation, providing ambulance services under on-call arrangements should cease. </p><p>  The NAS is not a static service. It deploys its resources in a dynamic manner and works on an area and national, rather than a local, basis.  The dynamic deployment of ambulance resources ensures that the nearest appropriate resource is mobilised to the location of any incident, including incidents in the greater Dublin area.

It is supported by a National Coordinating Group which has representatives from the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills in addition to other key stakeholders. The Programme is based on the recommendations of the <i>Report of the National Reference Group on Multidisciplinary Services for Children aged 5-18 Years</i>   produced by representatives of the professions and management involved in delivering multi-disciplinary services to children (available on the HSE website www.hse.ie.) </p><p>  The Programme aims to address the following issues in relation to children&#8217;s disability services:</p><p>- Inequity of access to services due to inconsistent development of services;</p><p>- Environmental change arising from the reorientation towards mainstream education leading to increasing demand for health services to support inclusion;</p><p>- Increasing demand for services due to population growth and increased identification of children with disability;</p><p>- The need to re-align services with emerging primary care and integrated service structures.</p><p>  While the Programme supports the principle of providing access to mainstream education where appropriate, it also recognises a continuing role for special schools. </p><p>The Programme is rolling out at national, regional and local level and involves representatives from the health and education sectors, statutory and non-statutory service providers and parents working together to see how current services can best be re-organised.  Implementation of the Programme encompasses two elements:</p><p>- Ongoing work in co-ordinating and re-organising early intervention services for children aged 0-5 years into integrated, geographically based teams;</p><p>- Supporting the re-organisation of services for school-age children aged 5-18 years according to the same model.</p><p>  Decisions regarding any local re-organisation of services are the responsibility of the Local Implementation Groups (LIGs). These include stakeholders such as representatives of the service providers involved, parents and the educational sector representatives. Detailed local area action plans are being developed by the LIGs with the following objectives:</p><p>- One clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need;</p><p>- Resources used to the greatest benefit for all children and families;</p><p>- Health and education working together to support children to achieve their potential.</p><p>  The HSE is working very closely with the education sector, which is fully involved in the development of the Programme, to ensure that, from the children&#8217;s and parents&#8217; perspective, the services provided by each sector are integrated. An Education and Health Working Group, comprising representatives of both sectors, is developing a framework for closer working relationships.</p><p>  The long term goal of this Programme is to bring consistency in service delivery and a clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need. Implementation of this Programme will have a positive impact on the provision of clinical services for all children requiring access to health related supports, regardless of where they live or which pre-school or school they attend.</p></reply>

To examine the on-going sustainability of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme,</p><p>2.  To examine the overall cost of long-term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating/setting prices,</p><p>3.

To consider the extension of the scheme to community based services and to other  sectors (Disability and Mental Health), and</p><p>5.  To make recommendations for the future operation and management of the scheme.</p><p>  As the Scheme is statutory based, the implementation of any recommendations arising from the review may require significant amendments to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, 2009.</p><p>  A considerable amount of preparatory work for the review has already been completed.  It will progress within the constraints of available staff and other priorities.  At this stage I envisage that the review will be completed in 2013.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-20a.1491.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012112000054#WRCC01400"><p>Much is being done in Ireland regarding research and innovation and the growth and jobs agendas.  In this regard the Action Plan for Jobs (2012), and the Report of the  Research Prioritisation Steering Group, were published this year.  The aim is to target public investment towards research based on potential for economic return, particularly in the form of jobs; and protecting as much current employment while also creating jobs in new areas of opportunity.  </p><p>  I continue to stress that while the economic benefit of research is extremely important, it is imperative that the critical importance of research for policy and research for knowledge is recognised and supported.  Knowledge derived from research is  paramount in providing the evidence-base for better health policies and systems; systems that underpin effective and efficient health service provision.  Such evidence will be a key input to the creation of a fairer, more efficient health system.  </p><p>  In acknowledging the potential for research to support economic growth and job creation, I consider that the economic and societal agendas are not necessarily mutually exclusive.  The interaction and interdependence between research for health and research for economic purposes are evident in the research and innovation objectives supported by my Department.</p><p>  In 2009 the Action Plan for Health Research 2009-2013, prepared by the Health Research Group was launched.  The plan is in the implementation phase and Subgroups/Work Streams established under the Health Research Group are progressing the actions therein.  The main purpose of the HRG, which is chaired by my Department, is to ensure that health research in Ireland is coordinated, prioritised, and focussed, and that national policies and strategies for health research are framed strategically in the context of the wider science, technology and innovation agenda.  </p><p>  The Health Research Board (HRB) is a statutory body under the aegis of the Department of Health.  The HRB is the lead agency in Ireland supporting and funding health research.  It provides funding, maintains health information systems and conducts research linked to national health priorities.  The aim is to improve people's health, build health research capacity and make a significant contribution to Ireland's knowledge economy.</p><p>  A robust clinical research infrastructure and established capacity and expertise are essential in developing and delivering health care.  Through strategic investment, the Health Research Board (HRB), funded by my Department, is developing infrastructure, expertise, and capacity to create an integrated framework for clinical research in Ireland.  This will not only improve patient outcomes, peoples health and health service delivery, but will support growth and jobs here in Ireland.  I opened a Clinical Research Facility in Cork earlier this year which is funded by the HRB.  In addition to this investment in Cork, the HRB is funding the establishment of two facilities in Dublin and Galway.  The Wellcome Trust is co-funding the build in Dublin. These three facilitates will network together using standardised practices and procedures in clinical research conduct thereby greatly increasing Ireland&rsquo;s appeal as a country of choice for performing large-scale multinational clinical research studies.</p><p>  The Health Information Bill, which my Department is progressing,  will provide for a range of measures including facilitating a uniform approach for ethics approval for multi site health research projects, not already otherwise governed by statutory regulation and EU law.  It is expected that the Health Information Bill will be ready for publication by mid 2013.</p><p>  During the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union key legislative proposals on Clinical Trials and Medical Devices will be progressed. </p><p>  My Department is also represented on the Prioritisation Action Group (PAG), established by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and chaired by Minister Sherlock to progress the Report of the Research Prioritisation Steering Group.  It is evident that while much of the work being progressed in the area of health research may not necessarily lead to direct commercial opportunity, it can complement and support the work of other sectors in the economy.  </p><p>  Senior officials in my Department recently had a very positive meeting with representatives of the organisation mentioned by the Deputy at which health research policy was discussed.</p></reply>

The directive strongly promotes the principles of the three Rs (replacement of the use of animals to the greatest extent possible with alternative testing methods, refinement of scientific procedures to improve animal welfare and reduction in numbers of animals used).  Significant changes in this regard are requirements to perform ethical evaluations prior to authorisation of projects using animals and higher standards of care and accommodation.  Many of the provisions set out in the directive are mandatory.  The directive will be transposed into Irish law during November, 2012 and will take effect from 1 January, 2013.  </p><p>  My Department sought the views of the public and interested parties in July, 2009 on the proposed directive.  These views informed Ireland&rsquo;s position as negotiations on the proposed directive progressed at EU level.  My Department again sought the views of the public and interested parties in October, 2011 after the adoption of the directive.  Officials of my Department have met with stakeholder groups including animal welfare groups in relation to the Directive's provisions.  My Department has recently met with consultants of the Irish Anti Vivisection Society and with Research and Development establishments in this area.  The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) has also had meetings with stakeholders to inform them of the requirements which will apply from 1 January 2013 and has updated its website with relevant information. </p><p>  I appreciate the time and effort devoted by individuals and stakeholder groups in this regard.  The submissions received in response to the first public consultation were particularly welcome as the directive was still under discussion at that stage.  The second public consultation, of necessity, had a different focus given that the directive was already finalised at that stage.  The responses to the second public consultation are, consequently, primarily focused on the nuts and bolts of the transposition process itself and are of particular assistance to the Department in this regard.</p><p>  On the matter of scrutiny of the Directive, in July 2009, my Department provided an information note to the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny on the then proposed directive and indicated that the transposition of the directive would be done by Statutory Instrument in order to ensure that this transposition would be implemented within the allowed timeframe.  Failure to do so could delay the considerably enhanced protections the new directive provides for animals - a circumstance which animal protection organisations would, quite correctly, take issue with.  It could also result in EU infringement proceedings against the State during the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the European Union.  I am sure the Deputy would agree that it is important to transpose the considerably enhanced protections afforded to animals in the directive without delay. The joint committee, after consideration of the proposed directive, agreed that no further scrutiny was required, given that the aim of the proposal is to improve the existing 1986 directive and in view of the scope allowed in the directive for member states to decide on practical transposition measures. </p><p>  In the run up to the implementation of the directive, the Department and the IMB, which is the designated competent authority responsible for the implementation of the directive, will continue to consider the views of stakeholder groups.</p></reply>

The implementation of individual national road schemes, including Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects, is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Acts 1993-2007.  In addition, the statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll bye-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads is vested in the NRA under Part V of the Roads Act (as amended).  The contracts for the privately-operated toll schemes are, therefore, commercial agreements between the NRA and the PPP concessionaires concerned.</p><p>  Two PPP contracts, the M3 Clonee-Kells PPP and the Limerick Tunnel PPP, incorporate a traffic guarantee mechanism. With regard to the remaining PPP schemes, all traffic risk remains with the operator while the State stands to benefit from the revenue share arrangement where the average daily traffic (&quot;ADT&quot;) exceeds scheme specific predefined threshold traffic. Noting the above position, I have referred the Deputy's question to the NRA for further reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.</p></reply>

Obviously The Gathering Ireland 2013 will be the main focus for tourism promotion next year.</p><p>  The Government has identified tourism as one of the key drivers of economic recovery and has set out its medium term priorities in the Programme for Government.  As well as encouraging increased international access, these include prioritising the Tourism Marketing Fund, exploring the possibility of a new agreement on visitor visas with the UK, offering tourists the opportunity to visit the UK and Ireland with one visa, developing emerging long haul markets such as China, Russia, India and the Middle East, and recovery of market share in Britain. At home, priorities include improving the e-capability of our tourism product, targeting available resources at developing and co-ordinating niche tourism products and activity packages that are attractive to international visitors, including event tourism.  Significant progress has been made across these areas, in the Jobs Initiative and by the agencies on the ground, and they will continue to be pursued over the next few years.   </p><p>  While external factors including global economic conditions impact significantly on visitor numbers to any destination, my Department's Statement of Strategy has set a target of 8 million visits to Ireland in 2015. In terms of further initiatives and plans to achieve this target, Tourism Ireland, as the body responsible for promoting the island of Ireland as a visitor destination overseas will be preparing a Corporate Plan, based on the Programmes for Government north and south, setting out its objectives and targets for the period 2014 to 2016 for approval by the North South Ministerial Council next year. </p></reply>
