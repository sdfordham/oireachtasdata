All young people who have had a care history with the HSE, be it foster care, residential care or high support, are entitled to an aftercare service based on their assessed needs. The length of time an aftercare service is provided is dependent upon the assessed needs of the young person, but is generally provided for up to the age of 21 years or 23 years if the young person is in education. </p><p>  As regards the young person referred to in the Deputy's question,  I asked the HSE to investigate the case last month, following receipt of representations on the matter. The HSE has advised me that the young person in question reached the age of 18 in February 2012 and the full fostering allowance continued until they completed school in June 2012. The young person commenced a full time course for the academic year 2012/2013  and is in receipt of disability benefit from the Department of Social Protection and a pro-rata fostering allowance also issues from the HSE.  The young person continues to retain a combined yearly financial support package of &euro;18,304 from the HSE and the Department of Social Protection.  </p></reply>

These reports are published on the HSE website. The latest published report shows that there were 6,421 children in the care of the HSE in April 2013, of which 5,932 children had an allocated social worker.  This is compared to 5,700 in March 2011.</p><p>  It is important to note the dynamic nature of children entering and leaving care. The HSE Review of Adequacy for HSE Children and Families Services 2011 showed that 36.7% of children admitted to care during 2011 were also discharged within the year. The Review also showed that there were over 2,000 admissions to care in each of the years, 2009 to 2011.</p><p>  Latest figures from the HSE indicate that there are currently 1,390 WTE (whole time equivalent) social workers in child and family services. This includes all 270 additional social workers recruited in line with the detailed recommendation of the Ryan Report Implementation Plan 2009. The recruitment of these posts was completed in full by this Government and these posts were not subject to the public service recruitment moratorium.  Social work figures are consistently in flux with vacancies arising due to maternity leave, career breaks, etc. However this Government is overseeing an ongoing programme of active recruitment to fill vacancies. 94 vacancies have recently been filled with a further 81 currently being filled.</p></reply>

The inspection of preschools and the enforcement of the Regulations are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE). </p><p>  At present childminders taking care of more than three preschool children from different families, and after-school care for children, are not subject to the Child Care Regulations.  These are issues which I am reviewing and will consider further in the coming months in the context of both the Early Years Strategy, which is being developed by my Department, and other amendments to the Child Care Act 1991 which are being considered.</p><p>  Childminders who are not subject to the Childcare Regulations are encouraged to voluntarily notify their service to their local City or County Childcare Committee.  Both notified and voluntarily notified childminders can avail of the Childminders Tax Exemption which exempts child minding earnings of up to &euro;15,000 from income tax. While my Department continues to actively promote the notification of child minding services and the participation of childminders in quality and training programmes, it is not in a position to prevent parents from entering into informal arrangements with childminders who are outside the scope of the Regulations. </p><p>  One of the specific issues of policy which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of Ireland's first ever Early Years Strategy for children aged from birth to 6 years, is the future role and regulation of the child minding sector.  I expect work on the Strategy to be completed later this year and I will review the future regulation of childminders in that context.</p><p>  My Department is currently piloting a new School Age Childcare scheme in conjunction with the Department of Social Protection.  When fully operational, the scheme will provide 6,000 subsidised, after-school places for primary school children, to assist qualifying parents to avail of employment opportunities.  Eligibility for the scheme will be determined by the Department of Social Protection.  Parents qualifying under the scheme will be able to access after school childcare at a weekly cost of &euro;20.  My Department will subsidise each of these places with weekly payments of &euro;35 during term time and &euro;100 in school holidays.  Pending any change to the Child Care Act 1991 to extend regulatory control to after-school childcare, all services participating in the scheme will be subject to strict contractual requirements drawn up by my Department and monitored by Pobal.</p></reply>

I am advised by the HSE that there has been very significant demand to access these files and consequently the HSE Regional Adoption Service in Cork has not been able to respond as quickly as would have been hoped.</p><p>  In parallel with facilitating such access, work by the HSE on the organising and storage of these files has taken place and planning is underway for reorganising the approach to dealing with information requests to improve access.</p><p>  Files in relation to Bessboro will continue to be managed by the HSE Regional Adoption Services in Cork. The HSE intends to transfer files in relation to the other two centres to other HSE regional adoption services to address service pressures in the Regional Adoption Service in Cork and facilitate those wishing to access information in relation to these files. In the meantime the HSE, in some instances, may refer individual applicants to their appropriate HSE Adoption services in the areas the applicant is now resident in order to assist in responding to queries.</p><p>  I am advised by the HSE that in parallel with facilitating such access there has been very significant demand to access files and consequently the HSE Regional Adoption Service in Cork has not been able to respond as quickly as would have been hoped. </p><p>  At present, the Regional Adoption Service in Cork provides a  system for clients of these mother and baby homes which affords them an opportunity to meet with a Social Worker as a first step in commencing the tracing process. This service will continue to be provided by HSE Regional Adoption Services in Cork until the files and responsibility for providing assistance transfers to other regions.</p><p>  Queries can be directed to the Principal Social Worker, HSE South, Regional Adoption Service, P&aacute;irc na gCrann, St. Stephen's Hospital, Sarsfield Court, Glanmire, Co.

Lack of access to affordable, quality childcare is a significant barrier to many low income and disadvantaged families seeking to avail of work opportunities. This initiative will provide an important support measure to enable parents to avail of job opportunities.  This is in line with the Government's overall strategy to support parents of low income families to take up employment and demonstrates how Departments are working together to deliver the Government's agenda on promoting employment and supporting children's development.</p><p>  The initiative is expected to receive full year funding of &euro;14 million to provide over 6,000 after-school places for children attending primary school in order to support parents to take up employment.  This funding has been made possible through savings from the Vote of the Department of Social Protection. </p><p>  Eligibility for the new After-school Childcare programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.  Officials from the Department of Social Protection and my Department are continuing in close collaboration on the operation of the programme.   The pilot phase of the programme has commenced and this will assist both Departments in determining the procedural, quality and practical issues that require attention prior to the finalisation of the programme.  Up to 500 childcare places are available with  Department of Social Protection local offices in Tralee, Mullingar, Dundalk, Cork City, Finglas, Kings Inn and Limerick City participating.  The full roll-out of the programme will commence in September 2013, to coincide with the new school year.   </p><p>  The programme will provide &euro;35 per week per child enrolled in a participating service for after school services and this payment will rise to &euro;100 per week during holiday periods when parents will be availing of full day care.  A further &euro;20 per week will be paid by the parent to the provider in both instances.</p><p>  The new After-school Childcare programme will further augment my Department's programme of childcare supports for low income families. These include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programmes, both of which provide subsidised childcare for low income parents, including qualifying parents who are on approved VEC and F&Aacute;S education and training courses.  The CCS programme provides funding to community childcare services to enable them to provide a range of supports including funding towards the provision of after-school services.</p><p>  In 2013, my Department expects to spend in the region of &euro;70 million on the CCS and CETS programmes, supporting over 30,000 childcare places.</p></reply>

In 2012, I am advised that 1,559 children aged 0-18 years were discharged from care. A total of 327 children aged 0-17 years were discharged from care up to the end of March 2013. The figure includes children of all ages who were discharged from care. The HSE Review of Adequacy Report for 2011 states that approximately 37% of new admissions to care during the year had been discharged from care within the year.</p><p>  The HSE compiles performance reports which include statistics in relation to children in care. These reports are published on the HSE website. Information in  relation to aftercare services is published quarterly   The latest published report for March 2013 shows that there were 1,149 young adults aged 18-21 years in receipt of an aftercare service, 604 of whom were in full time education. </p><p>  The HSE has also informed me that 1427 young people over the age of 18 years - 674 males and 753 females were in receipt of an aftercare service at the end of March 2013. This number differs from that published in the performance reports, as it would include young people over 21 years of age who were in receipt of a service.</p><p>  Information for 2012 is as follows-</p><p>- In December 2012, 1,073 young adults were in receipt of an aftercare service, 599 of whom were in full time education;</p><p>- In September 2012, 1,101 young adults were in receipt of an aftercare service, 596 of whom were in full time education.</p><p>- In June 2012, 1,053 young adults were in receipt of an aftercare service, 614 of whom were in full time education.</p><p>- In March 2012, 1,123 young adults were in receipt of an aftercare service, 642 of whom were in full time education.</p><p>  I have requested a breakdown by gender of these numbers for 2012 and will arrange to forward same to the Deputy when it is available. </p><p>  The HSE has provided further information in relation to previous years-</p><p>- In 2011, 1,213 young adults were in receipt of an aftercare service, 770 of whom were in education or training</p><p>- In 2010, 1,046 young adults were in receipt of an aftercare service, 774 of whom were in education or training</p><p>- In 2009, 847 young adults were in receipt of an aftercare service, 587 of whom were in education or training</p><p>- In 2008, 979 young adults were in receipt of an aftercare service, 673 of whom were in education or training</p><p>- In 2007, 1,051 young adults were in receipt of an aftercare service, 674 of whom were in education or training</p><p>- In 2006, 810 young adults were in receipt of an aftercare service, 531 of whom were in education or training</p><p>  The HSE National Aftercare Service is underpinned by a National Policy and Procedures Document which was developed in cooperation with the key stakeholders, including the voluntary sector agencies representing children in care and those involved in aftercare provision and my Department. The policy  commits to promoting and achieving the best outcomes for young people leaving care and in ensuring consistency of support to these young people. </p><p>  An intra-agency National Aftercare Implementation Group, comprised of NGO groups representing aftercare, child advocacy, foster care and other groups, was established by the HSE to monitor progress in implementing the national policy. This group aims to provide a standard, intra and inter-agency approach to the delivery of aftercare services in partnership with the wider voluntary and statutory sector. Given the particular difficulties for some young people leaving care in areas of mental health and disability, the aftercare policy has a strong multi-agency dimension. The Implementation Group is developing protocols with Social Inclusion, Disability Services, Mental Health Services and Primary Care in the HSE and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government regarding housing  to support this approach.

From its establishment the Agency will have service responsibility for Child welfare and protection services currently operated by the HSE including family support and alternative care services; Child and family-related services for which the HSE currently has responsibility including preschool inspections and domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services; The Family Support Agency which currently operates as a separate body under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and will be merged into the new Agency; The National Educational Welfare Board which also currently operates as a separate body under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and will be merged into the new Agency; Community-based psychology services (this does not encompass psychologists operating within acute, disability, mental health or other specialist settings).</p><p>  The Child and Family Agency Bill will largely focus on the technical task of bringing together the functions of the three &ldquo;source&rdquo; agencies (the HSE, the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board). Particular care is required in respect of the disaggregation of the functions from the HSE to ensure that there are no unintended consequences (for either the Agency or the Directorates remaining within the HSE framework) in the separation of functions, either in legal terms, or in terms of the practical operation of day-to-day services for children and their families or HSE clients across the life cycle.</p><p>  A key task in drafting the legislation is to ensure that the Agency operates within a strong framework of public accountability.  Other important features of the legislation relate to the need to create the correct platform for inter-agency arrangements, shared service arrangements and a robust process for the commissioning of services from a range of providers. </p><p>  It is my intention to introduce the Bill to the Houses of the Oireachtas in this current session. When enacted the legislation will allow the Agency to assume full statutory responsibility for services for children and families, and to bring further cohesion to how these essential services are delivered.</p></reply>

My priorities related to the contribution of quality youth work to young people&rsquo;s development, well-being and social inclusion and the potential contribution of youth work to youth employment.</p><p>  Council Conclusions, adopted by the Education, Youth, Culture and Sport Council on 16 May 2013 propose actions that will maximise the potential of youth policy in addressing the goals of Europe 2020.  A second set of Conclusions, also adopted, highlight the importance of quality youth work as a tool for engagement with, and development of, young people.</p><p>  These conclusions include a concrete set of measures aimed at raising the profile of youth work at EU level and mainstreaming youth work into broader EU policy responses to youth employment and social inclusions. These include establishing a new EU expert group on quality youth work; strengthening the working relationship between the Council of Ministers and other Council of Minister configurations; mainstreaming youth policy input into the European Semester reporting process; recognition of centrality of youth work in contributing to the Europe 2020 growth and jobs agenda; recognition of the role of youth work in implementing the Youth Guarantee; greater coordination between EU youth policy and education, training and employment policies.</p><p>  As a follow-up to these Conclusions, I hosted a two day informal expert roundtable on 20 and 21 June which considered the contribution of youth work to youth employment.  The outcome of the meeting, the Dublin Declaration, recognises the challenges facing young people in Europe as a result of the lack of jobs and work experience, as well as the challenges posed by the widening gap between skills being sought by certain employers and those held by many prospective employees. It also recognises that youth work can play a highly-relevant role in developing young people's skill-sets, in particular with respect to &lsquo;soft&rsquo; skills such as learning to learn, social and civic competence, leadership, communication, teamwork, and entrepreneurship &ndash; all of which are highly-valued and sought-after by employers. The Declaration in particular notes the centrality of the role of quality youth work in the implementation of the Youth Guarantee by Member States. </p><p>  The EU Youth Council&rsquo;s work programme under Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency was informed by the findings of widespread consultations with young people. Over 11,000 young people and youth organisations throughout Member States participated in consultations across Europe on the theme of Social Inclusion.</p><p>  The EU Youth Conference which I hosted in Dublin on 11-12 March 2013 was a flagship event of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency Programme. Almost 250 people from across the EU attended the Conference, including 109 young people and youth representatives and 65 Ministry officials participating in workshops. The Conference was organised by my Department in partnership with the National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI).  It was a major opportunity to showcase the talent and innovation of Ireland&rsquo;s young people and the youth sector. Almost 100 young people were involved in supporting the Conference.  They acted as volunteers and took on roles as guest MCs and speakers, and provided inputs through Arts and Drama presentations.  Over the three days, some 25 information stands showcased the work underway in youth programmes in communities throughout the country.</p><p>  The conclusions from this Conference informed Youth Ministers&rsquo; deliberations on quality youth work and will inform the structured dialogue consultations with young people during the Lithuanian and Greek Presidencies. The meeting of the Directors General for Youth hosted by my Department alongside the Conference explored the personal, social and economic impact of youth work.</p><p>  The work undertaken under Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency including the conclusions of the Ministers and the outcome of the expert group meeting provide the basis for an ambitious agenda which offers the potential to greatly enrich the European Union&rsquo;s policy responses in the area supporting youth employment, in particular with respect to the potential of non-formal learning to reach out to those young people not in education, training and employment. My Department will continue to work with the Departments of Education, Social Protection, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, to identify, in what ways, the youth sector can contribute to shared policy objectives to address youth employment and with European colleagues to progress this important agenda for Europe&rsquo;s young people. </p><p>  Also, as an associated Presidency event, I was pleased to support a conference on LGBT Youth and Social Inclusion which held in Croke Park on 17 June 2013.  This event which was organised by BeLonG To brought together the main EU institutions and LGBT groups from Europe to discuss the areas of LGBT youth and education, employment, participation and rights and youth services.  The conference was developed following findings from a Europe-wide consultation under the Irish Presidency which identified LGBT youth as one of the most socially excluded groups in Europe. </p><p>In the context of Ireland's Presidency, I should also note that I addressed the Confederation of Family Organisations of the European Union (COFACE) at their European Conference held in Dublin Castle in February to mark Ireland's EU Presidency.  The Conference was brought to Dublin by the Irish Countrywomen's Association who are members of COFACE and was supported by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  The conference theme was &quot;Vulnerable Families _ What can Europe Do?&quot;.   </p><p>As part of my Department's EU Presidency programme I also launched the UNICEF Report Card in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, Dublin in April.  Following the launch I hosted a high-level EU roundtable discussion on &ldquo;Moving forward to promote children&rsquo;s well-being&rdquo;.</p></reply>

I understand a number of follow on queries regarding funding were received by my Department between then and  28 May.  I was also aware around that time that RTE was planning to feature the area of childcare in a Primetime programme to be broadcast in May.  I was not informed of the nature of the broadcast planned and I did not see any of the film footage until it was broadcast by RTE.  As a result, I was unaware of the specific incidents until they were shown. </p><p>  I understand that officials in the Health Service Executive (HSE) received separate complaints in relation to the services filmed for the Primetime programme but that there was no indication that these were linked to one another or to the forthcoming Primetime programme.  The HSE responded to these complaints by commencing an investigation.  I also understand that the HSE was shown some of the film footage in the days before it was broadcast and immediately went to the Garda who initiated the investigation which is now taking place.</p><p>  I have already expressed my shock and distress at the scenes broadcast on this Primetime programme.     I am working closely with the HSE to progress a number of immediate actions to strengthen the current inspection process.  I am also continuing to work on a number of fronts to drive the quality agenda for preschool services, including increasing the qualification requirements for staff working in preschool services and increasing the supports available to services to implement the Siolta and Aistear quality frameworks.</p></reply>

The factors associated with overweight and obesity in Irish children is complex and research suggests that a multidimensional approach is needed which crosses government departments and agencies and involves children and families and community organisations working with statutory and voluntary sector.</p><p>  Obesity - the policy challenges: The report of the National Taskforce on Obesity was published by the Department of Health in 2005 and remains the guided document for work in this area. My colleague the Minister for Health, has established a Special Advisory Group on Obesity to advise on implementation of the report and this group has representation from my own Department. One of their current projects involves a media campaign on preventing childhood obesity developed with Safe Food, the HSE, the Department of Health and my own Department, which is scheduled to take place in the autumn. Other work of the group includes technical support for providing calorie content information for small restaurant / coffee shop owners, to facilitate young people in making health choices.</p><p>  It is widely accepted by researchers that there is a strong link between physical activity and being overweight, habits formed in youth tend to carry into adulthood. The Growing Up in Ireland study also clearly confirms this finding. Young people who took more exercise were less likely to be overweight or obese, especially in comparison to those who never exercised.</p><p>  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I have responsibility for Play and Recreation Policy which have been set out in the policy documents, 'Ready, Steady, Play! A National Play Policy' and the 'National Recreation Policy for Young People', which seeks to actively promote the participation of children and young people in play and exercise, which is an effective way of helping them maintain a healthy weight.</p><p>  In February 2012, I established the Local Authority Play and Recreation Network (LAPRN). This national network has been established to introduce a more coordinated and interagency approach to achieving the main goals of the play and recreation policies at both national and local level. An early achievement of the network has been the development and expansion of <b>National Recreation Week </b>  which took place recently and National Play Day which is due to take place this month. Targeted grants are provided to Local Authorities by my Department to encourage participation across the Local Authority Network. This year saw the largest ever participation with all counties staging popular events.</p></reply>

The programme is being co-funded by The Atlantic Philanthropies and is expected to have a total funding allocation of  &euro;29.7 million.  The programme is being introduced on foot of the Programme for Government commitment to adopt an area-based approach to child poverty, drawing on best international practice and existing services to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched and improve the outcomes for children and young people.  The programme will build on and continue much of the work of the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP) which was also implemented by my Department and co-funded by The Atlantic Philanthropies.</p><p>  The three existing PEIP sites and at least three additional sites are expected to participate in the new programme.  In addition, it is my intention to broaden the impact of the programme by beginning the process of mainstreaming some of the evidence-based programmes which have been positively evaluated and are cost-effective.  The establishment of my Department's new Child and Family Agency later this year will be important to this process.  </p><p>  Applications to participate in the programme were invited from interested not for profit consortia earlier this year.  The closing date for receipt of applications was 31 May and fifty applications were received.  The current priority has been to transition appropriate activities funded under PEIP into the new initiative, and this has been progressed as a matter of urgency.  It is hoped that agreement will be reached with the 3 sites concerned shortly regarding their initial activities  and funding under the programme.  It is hoped that this will be approved by Government later this month.</p><p>  Twenty six further applications have been prioritised for evaluation based primarily on the level of disadvantage in their areas, and also the child population expected to be impacted, and these will be evaluated in the period July-September by a Working Group led by my Department, using criteria set out in the application process.  An Interdepartmental Project Team, chaired by my Department, will consider these applications, and make proposals to Government in October for  funding  under Phase 1 of the initiative.  </p><p>  The remaining twenty-one proposals will be evaluated in the period October 2013 - January 2014, and where appropriate, good proposals made in this cohort, along with any good proposals which narrowly missed funding under Phase 1, will be considered for funding under Phase 2 of the initiative.</p></reply>

The Policy Framework is expected to be published later this year and will build on Our Children - Their Lives, Ireland's first Children's Strategy which was published in 2000. This is relevant to the Early Years Strategy as the Strategy is one of three, more detailed strategies which will be developed under the Framework.</p><p>  The Early Years Strategy, which will be Ireland's first ever national strategy for early years, is under development. It is expected that it will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as child health and well-being, parenting and family support, learning and development, play and recreation and early childhood care and education. The Strategy will further recognise the economic imperative and benefits accruing from targeted investment in early years interventions.</p><p>  Key issues to be addressed in the Strategy include the further development of early childhood care and education programmes; the need to enhance quality provision, curricular support; and workforce capacity in early years services; support and regulation of the childminding sector; and the future development of early intervention, therapeutic and family support services to support young children and their parents.</p><p>  The Strategy will bring together and consider a significant amount of international and domestic research on the importance of early years for child development, including findings from the &quot;Growing Up in Ireland&quot; study. It will also be informed by the evaluations from the Prevention and Early Intervention Projects which have been funded jointly by my Department and philanthropic organisations, as well as an analysis of existing service provision and associated resources. The major programme of institutional change which is currently underway, including the establishment of the Child and Family Agency, will also be taken into account.</p><p>  The results of a public consultation, undertaken as part of the development of the Children and Young People Policy Framework, is currently being analysed and will inform both the Framework and the Early Years Strategy. </p><p>  I have appointed an Expert Advisory Group, chaired by Dr. Eilis Hennessy, Head of School of Psychology at UCD, to advise on the preparation of the Strategy. The Group comprises external experts from a range of specialties, including paediatrics, early childhood care and education, child protection and public health nursing and is continuing to meet on a regular basis.  I have met the Expert Advisory Group on a number of occasions,  and I am very satisfied with the progress being made in developing Ireland's first Early Years Strategy.  </p><p>  While supports for children with special needs will form part of the discussions of the Expert Advisory Group, the implementation of the EPSEN Act is a matter for the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>  I expect the Early Years Strategy to be published before the end of the year.</p></reply>

My Department works closely with the Departments of Education and Skills, Social Protection, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and others as part of a cross departmental effort  to realise these Government objectives.</p><p>  Youth unemployment is a particular concern because of the prospects it holds for young people themselves, their personal development and for social inclusion. The Government has a range of measures in place to tackle youth unemployment and these include programmes and initiatives in education, training, job search assistance/ work experience and to encourage job creation.</p><p>  Through the Action Plan for Jobs, my Department is progressing work  in relation to actions outlined for my Department and is firmly committed to maximising the role the youth sector can play in this area. There is growing recognition in Ireland and across Europe of the potential of youth work services to enhance employability of young people.  In particular, recent European policy developments suggest that youth work has the potential to do more and has a special relevance for those young people who are marginalised from traditional systems of education, employment and training. </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s EU Youth Presidency Programme sought to maximise the potential of youth policy in addressing the goals of the Europe 2020 Strategy and aimed to highlight how youth policy, as expressed through quality youth work and youth activities, can do more to enhance a range of life skills including employability. Council Conclusions, adopted by the Education, Youth, Culture and Sport Council at their meeting on 16 May 2013, which I chaired, propose actions to maximise the potential of youth policy in addressing the goals of Europe 2020, in particular youth employment.  A second set of Conclusions, also adopted, highlight the importance of quality youth work as a tool for engagement with, and development of, young people. EU Youth Ministers further reaffirmed the relevance of quality youth work in contributing to measures to enhance the employability of young people, in particular those not engaged in education, employment or training.</p><p>  As a follow-up to these Conclusions, I hosted a two day informal expert roundtable on the 20 and 21   June which considered the contribution of youth work to youth employment.  The outcome of the meeting, the Dublin Declaration, recognises the challenges facing young people in Europe as a result of the lack of jobs and work experience, as well as the challenges posed by the widening gap between skills being sought by certain employers and those held by many prospective employees. It recognises that youth work offers a significant infrastructure, reach and capacity, outside of formal education and training; and therefore can play a highly-relevant role in developing young people's skill-sets, in particular with respect to &lsquo;soft&rsquo; skills such as learning to learn, social and civic competence, leadership, communication, teamwork, and entrepreneurship &ndash; all of which are highly-valued and sought-after by employers. The Declaration notes the centrality of the role of quality youth work in the implementation of the Youth Guarantee by Member States. </p><p>  The Conclusions of the Ministers and the outcome of the expert group meeting provide the basis for an ambitious agenda which can greatly enrich the national and European Union&rsquo;s policy responses to youth employment. My Department is working closely with the Departments of Education, Social Protection and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, to identify, in what ways, the youth sector can contribute to these shared policy objectives, in particular with respect to the potential of non-formal learning to reach out to those young people not in education, training and employment and to measures to implement the Youth Guarantee. The National Youth Work Advisory Committee, whose members include representatives of voluntary youth work organisations, is also considering issues to do with progressing this important agenda for our  young people.</p></reply>

Preschool inspections, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE), are necessary to ensure compliance with the Regulations and the delivery of quality childcare services.</p><p>  In relation to the publication of preschool service inspection reports, the HSE Preschool Inspectorate is working to put these online.  In the first instance the reports will be available from the Pobal website via a direct link on the HSE website.    A commitment has been given to place new reports, once completed, online from 1 July 2013.  I understand that the first of these will be placed online in the coming days.  Work is ongoing to have reports on all services online by the end of the year and my Department is supporting the HSE and Pobal in this work. </p><p>  I have identified a number of key areas of action which I believe need to be considered and addressed as a matter of urgency.  These include introducing a registration system for all school services; taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust; publishing inspection reports on-line as soon as possible; ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance; increasing and widening the sanctions which can be taken for non-compliance.</p><p>   My Department is also undertaking a review of the penalties currently in place for breach of the Child Care Regulations.  The review will look at increasing the range and severity of the existing penalties including the actions which can be taken by Inspectors without recourse to court prosecution, as is currently the case.</p><p>  It is important to realise, however, that inspections alone are not the answer to improving and maintaining quality. What is required is a multifaceted approach.   The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme introduced the first-ever requirement for minimum qualifications for staff working in the childcare sector.  At present, this requirement is limited to the preschool leader delivering the preschool year and the level of qualification is minimum Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ). I believe it is important to introduce qualification requirements for all staff working in preschool services.  For this reason, I have indicated my intention to increase the minimum requirement of Level 5 for preschool leaders delivering the preschool year will be increased to Level 6 and to require all preschool assistants and all other staff caring for children in a preschool service to hold a minimum qualification of Level 5.  These new requirements will apply from September 2014 for new services, and from September 2015 for existing services. </p><p>  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, driving the early childhood care and education quality agenda is one of my key objectives.  I believe we can achieve this objective by taking a number of steps including working with the Department of Education and Skills to develop a more comprehensive and broadly-based inspection regime for preschools.  </p><p>  I am also looking at ways to further support the implementation of the Siolta and Aistear frameworks in preschool services. The successful implementation of the Frameworks on a  nation-wide level will require all childcare practitioners to have a thorough  understanding of quality early years provision and I welcome the fact that the Department of Education and Skills is looking at developing a more accessible practice manual to assist preschool services in implementing Siolta and Aistear.</p></reply>

The number is currently operational in 23 EU countries and has been allocated and will soon be in operation in a further three countries.  In Ireland, the service is operated by the ISPCC and is overseen by a cross-sectoral project team, chaired by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Funding for the operation of the line in Ireland is being provided by my Department and the EU, through its Daphne funding stream.  The funding received from the EU Daphne fund and from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs includes the establishment costs, national promotion and advertisement of the service.  In common with all Exchequer funding, requirements for the operation of the service in future years will be considered in the context of the usual Estimates process.  The Missing Children Hotline has been operating on a limited hours pilot basis in Ireland since December 2012 and on a full-time 24/7 basis since the end of April 2013.  The service was officially launched on 5 June last. </p><p>  A key component of the service is a successful awareness programme.  It is vital that those who could benefit from the service know it exists and that users are aware of the scope of the service.  During the initial set-up phase of the service, the ISPCC focused on community-based promotion of the service.  This included presentations to local community groups.  Posters, flyers and business cards have been distributed to all Garda stations from Garda headquarters and promotional material has been distributed to a variety of community based projects in various locations throughout the country.  The ISPCC has made extensive use of social media such as Facebook and Twitter to advertise this service on an ongoing basis.  The official launch of the service on 5 June 2013 also provided the opportunity to further promote the scope of the service.  The 116000 Missing Children Hotline website, <i>missingchildrenhotline.ie</i>, was launched on 5 June 2013, the day of the official launch of the service.  In less than a month since its launch, the website has received approximately 2,000 hits.  To date, some &euro;35,000 has been spent on awareness measures.  This amount will be doubled for further awareness measures in the rest of 2013.  It is important to note the 116000 number is not an emergency number.  Emergency calls should always be directed to the 999/112 number in the first instance, where the relevant emergency responses, including the recently launched Garda Missing Children Amber Alert mechanism, may be activated.  The establishment of the 116000 line will be of valuable support and assistance to the families of missing children and to missing children.</p></reply>

Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects.

My view is that people affected by adoption should be given a statutory right to as much information as possible within permissible constitutional boundaries.  The constitutional and legal context within which the development of legislative proposals must be undertaken is complex.  This has influenced the existing approach to access to information which, while subject to significant development in recent years, has heretofore operated based upon the consent of all the parties.  The proposed legislation is intended to provide for a structured and regulated approach for applicants seeking access to adoption information and is also intended to facilitate contact between parties affected by adoption, including in circumstances where an adoption order was not effected.  Complex legal and constitutional issues have arisen during the course of the preparation of the heads of Bill, including the setting of criteria for balancing an adopted person's right to information about his or her identity with a birth parent's right to privacy.  This is a particular challenge in considering the impact on individuals in respect of adoptions which took place in the past where the concept of confidentiality and privacy were very central in the adoption process.  These issues are receiving careful examination.  Detailed consideration on the part of my Department and the Office of the Attorney General is under way.  I am anxious to bring the heads of Bill before the Government at the earliest possible date.  Again, my view is that people affected by adoption should be given a statutory right to as much information as permissible within constitutional boundaries.  However, there are undoubtedly challenges remaining in developing a workable framework which respects the constitutional rights of all parties.  I remain committed to achieving my policy objectives notwithstanding these challenges.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits the Government to promoting greater co-ordination and integration of delivery of services to the Traveller community across Government, using available resources more effectively to deliver on principles of social inclusion, particularly in the area of Traveller education.</p><p>  In so far as my Department is concerned, the report card is being considered in the context of the National Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework which follows on from the National Children&rsquo;s Strategy 2000-2010.   The Framework is expected to cover the 5 year period from 2014 to 2018.  In this regard, the views of the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance, including those contained in the Report are being taken into account in the development of the Framework, and indeed the Children's Rights Alliance are members of the National Advisory Council (NCAC), which has advised my Department on the Framework.</p><p>  With regard to education, the Government, through its various interventions in the education sector, is committed to improved retention rates, better learning experiences and improved outcomes for all children, including children who are members of the Travelling community. Recorded overall Traveller participation rates in education in recent years show a steady increase, as do rates for participation in the junior cycle and for progression to senior cycle.   </p><p>  Current policy in relation to Traveller education is underpinned by the Report and Recommendations for a Traveller Education Strategy which was developed following wide ranging consultation with Traveller representative groups. The Strategy covers, in a very comprehensive manner, aspects of Traveller Education from pre-school right through to further and higher education within a lifelong learning context.  The principle of inclusion is at the core of the Strategy and, accordingly, the focus of both current and future provision is on the development of a more inclusive school environment through the whole school planning process, teaching practice, admissions policies, codes of behaviour and whole school evaluation.  Additional resources are allocated, therefore, on the basis of individual educational need rather than that of ethnic or cultural background.</p><p>  Implementation of the Strategy is undertaken by the Department of Education and Skills in consultation with representatives of the Traveller community through the Traveller Education Strategy Advisory and Consultative Forum.</p></reply>

The resources associated with those services include those attaching to the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board both of which are already under my remit. By agreement with my colleague the Minister for Health, the Child Protection and Welfare services of the HSE has been operating as a shadow agency over the period of 2012 in preparation for the transition to the new Agency. The resources relating to these services and any other services proposed for transfer will also come under my remit. Processes regarding the transfer of the related staff are largely finalised and the final budgetary transfers will be subject to an agreed due diligence process. Control of this Voted expenditure will transfer to my Department on establishment day.</p><p>  There is no doubt that this is a substantial programme of reform which does not end on establishment day. The setting up of the Child and Family Agency is at the heart of the Government's reform of child and family services.  The Government decided that it was essential and appropriate that child welfare and protection services transfer from the Health Service Executive to a new, dedicated Agency.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Health are working jointly on an impact analysis of proposed future arrangements for this service as they relate to children and family services covered by the Child and Family Agency and to services provided by the HSE. The establishment of a single agency incorporating key children's services will provide a focus for the major reforms already underway within Children and Family Services.  In addition to this large scale structural reform programme, the HSE Child and Family Directorate is also implementing a significant programme of ongoing reforms. These reforms at operational level respond in detail to many identified gaps and changes needed to ensure a more consistent, effective and quality service delivery. </p><p>  The Department is currently examining its internal structures to ensure they are aligned and resourced to continue and enhance its oversight and performance management function as regards the new Agency. I will be continuing to work with my colleagues the Minister for Health and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (in the context of the budgetary process) on the resources issue as we progress towards establishment of the new Agency.</p></reply>

My Department also implements a number of other areas of programme spend, including funding for youth services and funding for services in the early childhood care and education sector.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, along with all other Government Departments, my Department undertook a Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in November 2011.  This has required savings to be found across almost all areas of expenditure in my Department's Vote.   The funding for family support services and the School Completion Programme is not broken down by reference to City of Dublin Youth Service Board and I am not in a position to state  the cumulative effect of the savings on children and young persons in the areas within the remit of the Board.</p><p>  The Family Support Agency, which is under the remit of my Department, provides support services for children and families through a network of some 106 Family Resource Centres.  Under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, funding for the Family Resource Centres has been reduced in 2012-2013 by 5% per annum which amounts to some &euro;1.6m in total.  The merger of the functions of the Family Support Agency with the new Child and Family Agency in the coming months should provide opportunities for some administrative savings and cost efficiencies. </p><p>  The School Completion Programme (SCP) is one of three educational welfare strands under the remit of the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) for which my Department has responsibility.  The SCP is also a key part of the Department of Education and Skills DEIS programme.  The SCP supports 124 projects and related initiatives which operate in 470 primary schools and 224 post-primary schools across the country to provide targeted supports to approximately 36,000 children and young people.  As a result of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, the SCP was subject to a funding reduction of 6.5% per annum in 2012-2013 amounting to some &euro;3.8m.  An operational review of the SCP will be undertaken in the coming academic year to enable my Department to target support to the pupils most at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving. </p><p>  Funding for youth services and organisations which is provided by my Department to support youth services and projects in the Dublin City area, and which is administered by the City of Dublin Youth Service Board, amounts to almost  &euro;12m this year.  Since 2012, this funding has been reduced by &euro;2.895m.  This is in line with the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure which required funding reductions for youth services of, on average, 5% in 2012 and 10% in 2013.  To minimise the impact of the savings required, my Department is undertaking a comprehensive Value for Money and Policy Review of youth funding to  inform the future provision of youth programmes and services.  </p></reply>

The inspection of pre-schools and the enforcement of the Regulations are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE). </p><p>  My Department is undertaking a review of the penalties currently in place for breach of the Child Care (Pre-School) Regulations, as provided for under the Child Care Act 1991. The review will look at increasing the range and severity of the existing penalties including the actions which can be taken by Inspectors without recourse to court prosecution, as is currently the case.</p><p>  In addition, my Department is working with the Pre-School Inspectorate to develop new protocols on regulatory compliance so that there is greater clarity and consistency of approach as to how inspection reports deal with findings of serious non-compliance vis a vis minor breaches and full compliance. The protocols will also inform the future suspension or termination of funding in the case of serious non-compliance.</p><p>  At present childminders taking care of more than three pre-school children from different families, and after-school care for children, are not subject to the Child Care Regulations.  These are issues which I am reviewing and will consider further in the coming months in the context of both the Early Years Strategy, which is being developed by my Department, and other amendments to the Child Care Act 1991 which are being considered.</p><p>  Childminders who are not subject to the Childcare Regulations are encouraged to voluntarily notify their service to their local City or County Childcare Committee.  Both notified and voluntarily notified childminders can avail of the Childminders Tax Exemption which exempts childminding earnings of up to &euro;15,000 from income tax. </p><p>  My Department is currently piloting a new School Age Childcare scheme in conjunction with the Department of Social Protection.  When fully operational, the scheme will provide 6,000 subsidised, after-school places for primary school children, to assist qualifying parents to avail of employment opportunities.  Eligibility for the scheme will be determined by the Department of Social Protection.  Parents qualifying under the scheme will be able to access after school childcare at a weekly cost of &euro;20.  My Department will subsidise each of these places with weekly payments of &euro;35 during term time and &euro;100 in school holidays.  Pending any change to the Child Care Act 1991 to extend regulatory control to after-school childcare, all services participating in the scheme will be subject to strict contractual requirements drawn up by my Department.</p><p>  One of the specific issues of policy which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of Ireland's first ever Early Years Strategy for children aged from birth to 6 years, is the future role and regulation of the childminding sector.  I expect work on the Strategy to be completed later this year and I will review the future regulation of childminders in that context.</p></reply>

It also sets out what organisations that care for or work with children should do to ensure they are safe whilst in the care of the organisation. All child protection concerns should be reported in the appropriate manner, including those identified  where a child has been in a home where there was domestic abuse. </p><p>  Statutory responsibility for the delivery of child welfare and protection services rests with the HSE, which is the appropriate body to receive all reports of concerns relating to all forms of child abuse. Under Section 3 of the Child Care Act, 1991, the Health Service Executive has a duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care or protection. </p><p><b><i>Child Welfare and Protection Referrals and Assessment</i></b></p><p>  Once a referral has been made to the HSE Children and Family Services all cases are managed through a standardised business process. All reports of concern for the safety or well-being of a child are handled initially by the Duty/Intake team for the purposes of assessment. All staff receiving such a referral are trained in the duty system and are obliged to treat seriously all child welfare and protection concerns whatever their source. Once a report has been made the screening stage deals with the information reported and preliminary enquiries are concerned with formulating an appropriate response. </p><p><b><i>Children First Legislation</i></b></p><p>  The Deputy will be aware the  Government is committed to putting aspects of Children First on a statutory basis. In this regard,  I published the Draft Heads and General Scheme for the Children First Bill 2012 in April last year and immediately referred the Heads of Bill to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for consideration and advice. The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children published their report in July 2012.</p><p>  As part of the Joint Committee's consultation process a number of submissions were received. Overall there was a welcome for the fact that the legislation would increase the focus on child protection.  The contributions in the main came from organisations already implementing Children First. The historic nature of the proposals and their implications for those providing services to children were acknowledged, as was the importance of the precise nature of the duties, responsibilities and sanctions contained in the legislation for successful implementation.</p><p>  Submissions were not all in agreement and many points emerging needed to be considered and reconciled.  This involves consideration of policy and operational issues, as well as the best legal approach to achieving Children First objectives. In this regard, officials within my Department have consulted with a number of organisations and individuals and I have met with a number of key stakeholders to discuss the complex issues that have arisen. I have also taken the opportunity to consult with a number of experts in relation to the development of the policy in this area. In addition, my Department commissioned a detailed academic study on key aspects of the relevant mandatory legislation in place in this area internationally. All of these factors are informing the preparation of enhanced policy proposals that is currently underway.  </p><p>  The framework is now focussed on the safety and protection of children generally; the provision of safe services for children; cooperation amongst professionals and organisations where children are at risk of neglect and abuse and finally mandating key individuals to report child abuse known to them. The latter objective is aimed at removing ambivalence, reluctance or refusal by people and organisations in positions of trust and authority to report child abuse and cooperate with the relevant authorities.</p><p>  I note that the vast majority of reports of abuse against children, reported in the Women's Aid Annual Report were in respect of emotional abuse. This is an issue that I take seriously and it is my intention that it is dealt with in the context of this legislation. It is my intention to submit further proposals in the form of a revised general scheme and Heads of Bill to Government as soon as possible with a view to the drafting of the Children First Bill as a priority.</p><p><b><i>New Child and Family Support Agency</i></b></p><p>  The establishment of  the Child and Family Agency is central to the Government's reform programme in respect of child and family services.  In order to achieve genuine improvements for children and families, the Agency will have a broader focus than child protection. Prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic &amp;amp; care interventions are all key to the provision of integrated multi-disciplinary services for children and families based on identified need.</p><p>  It is my intention that the new Agency will address the persistent issues which have been raised regarding the standardisation of services, communication, coordination and sharing of risk assessment, management and treatment for many of the children and families with the most complex needs. At the same time, the Agency will have a role in supporting families - providing less complex, less intrusive and less expensive responses which have a preventive function. </p><p>  My Department does not provide funding  for women's refuges. However, from its establishment the child and family-related services for which the HSE currently has responsibility including pre-school inspections and domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services will transfer to the agency. </p><p>  The establishment of a single agency incorporating key children's services will provide a focus for the major reforms already underway within Children and Family Services.  The new Child and Family Support Agency and the wider transformation of children's services represents one of the largest, and most ambitious, areas of public sector of reform embarked upon by this Government.</p></reply>

A Special Care Unit provides secure residential service to children and young people who are in need of specialised targeted intervention. Children are detained in special care if their behaviour is deemed to pose a risk to themselves. The detention, by order of the High Court of a child in a Special Care Unit is considered as a last resort, for as short a time as possible, and when other forms of residential or community care are considered to be unsuitable. Special Care Units are inspected by HIQA under Section 69 of the Child Care Act, 1991 on an annual basis, and the inspection reports are published. </p><p>  A subset of this cohort do not meet the criteria for placement in Special Care facilities, or their needs are too specialised to be met in the Units and in exceptional cases, arrangements are required to be made for some of these young people to be placed into care and treatment facilities outside of the State in units that provide a specialist individually tailored mix of care and therapeutic services and/or psychiatric treatment not available in Ireland.I am advised by the HSE that there are currently 10 children in secure placements outside of the State.  </p><p>  The placement of Irish children in secure facilities outside of the Irish jurisdiction by Order of the Irish High Court occurs within the framework of Council Regulation (EC) &ndash; otherwise known as the Brussels 11 bis Regulation.  The High Court retains oversight of these placements through regular intensive welfare review.  The HSE maintains governance and oversight via its statutory obligations to children in the care of the HSE.</p><p>  The HSE ensures that these placements are suitable.  The units in which the children are placed are inspected and monitored by their national authorities and the HSE is attentive to the standards of care delivered in these specialised units.  The level of requirement for these services is closely monitored by the HSE's National Director for Children and Family Services and my officials.  </p><p>  As part of the overall ongoing review of services to meet the needs of children in care, the HSE are reconfiguring some services for children with behavioural difficulties to reflect demand in keeping with best practice and international evidence.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-04a.114.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070400045#WRF00300"><p>I welcome the publication, by the HSE, of the 'A Review of Practice and Audit of the Management of Cases of Neglect'. The report was received by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in May 2013 and it was published on the HSE website two weeks ago.</p><p>  This report follows the publication, in October 2010, of the report of the Roscommon Child Care Inquiry, which catalogued a number of concerns arising from the examination of the management of systematic and problematic neglect in a family known to the HSE Child Protection Services.  The findings of the Inquiry raised concern that this might not have been an isolated case and that there might be more widespread practice and governance issues in the management of cases of neglect, both in Roscommon and throughout the country. </p><p>  This lead to work on a National Audit of neglect cases. From the outset, it was the intention of the HSE that the neglect audit would comprise a number of phases.  Therefore the audit was not simply a once off exercise but constitutes one element of a wider process to improve practice in relation to such cases across the country.</p><p>  For phase 1, the HSE commissioned the services of Ms Lynne Peyton, an Independent Consultant in Child Protection, to complete an initial pilot audit of the Roscommon cases.   This pilot was extended to two other local health areas, Waterford and Dublin South East.   This pilot phase [Phase 1] was conducted in early 2012 and this was worked on subsequent to completion.  The composite report, published two weeks, therefore represents the findings of the pilot phase; and is designed to inform a more significant National Audit of Neglect Cases.</p><p>  Since its completion this document has acted as an important working document informing preparations for Phases 2 and 3 of the process, namely, the workshops for staff and the National Audit of neglect files.  Last August, the attention of HSE social work staff was drawn to the on-going and systemic impact of neglect as identified in the three audits.</p><p>  However the report in itself does provide some key learning with respect to service improvements and in this regard the HSE, has developed an implementation plan to address the recommendations of the report. This has now happened, and the HSE have already demonstrated progress in relation to very many of those actions.</p><p>  In Roscommon: there have developments with respect to implementation of monthly child care meeting chaired by the General Manager; restructuring of Social Work Teams and the streamlining of Family Support Services to include a single point of entry for referrals. In addition, more than fifty staff in all relevant disciplines have participated in training on the Identification of Neglect.</p><p>  In Dublin South East the Social Work Department has been restructured and the new arrangements are working more effectively. There has been a blitz on the waiting list and unallocated cases have been significantly reduced and are constantly reviewed. New standard business processes including in relation initial assessments have been implemented and mew collaborative arrangements and joint training has been progressed between social work and a range of other disciplines including: child and adolescent mental health, speech &amp;amp; language therapy, psychology, etc.</p><p>  In Waterford, the pilot phase of audit has led to a substantive structural alteration of the deployment and governance of child protection services in Waterford. In addition new internal quality assurance arrangements have been introduced, including an increase in the frequency of staff supervision. </p><p>With respect to the general findings, I believe this audit contributes to greater awareness of neglect, highlighting the &quot;harsh reality of neglect&quot;.   </p><p>  The Audit found that parental alcohol misuse was a factor in 62% of families in the overall sample; and states that &quot;family dysfunction was often associated to chronic alcohol and drug misuse&quot;.</p><p>  The Audit further found that</p><p>- domestic violence was a reported feature in almost two thirds of the sample cases;</p><p>- parental mental health issues also featured in approximately 2 thirds of the Dublin;</p><p>- standards of hygiene and physical conditions were unacceptable in more than half of the cases; and</p><p>- non-attendance at medical and other specialist appointments with speech and language therapists, psychology and CAMHs was a feature.</p><p>  The audit highlights how referrals of neglect cases in Roscommon &amp;amp; Waterford have tripled in the period 2005-2009. On a positive note, the audit found that &quot;emphasis on providing Children First training ... was paying off in terms of appropriate referrals&quot;.</p><p>  However the Audit did find that there was too much variation and inconsistency across local areas. I believe that establishment of the dedicated new Child &amp;amp; Family Agency represents an essential response to this. At heart of new Agency will be a new Quality Framework, led by a newly-appointed Head of Quality.</p><p>  In relation to the specific issue of responses to referrals relating to neglect, a very significant body of work has been underway, in tandem with establishment of the Child &amp;amp; Family Agency to develop new standardised models for referral and assessment.</p><p>  Instead of prioritising abuse cases to the detriment of neglect cases, the new models, which have been subject to a number of pilot projects throughout the country, seek to differentiate of child protection and child welfare cases with a view to ensuring timely and proportionate responses to each.</p><p>  A new model for family-based, multi-agency assessment and early intervention known as 'Meitheal' has already been trialled in two regions (Sligo/Leitrim and Donegal and in Limerick) and is being mainstreamed as part of the establishment of the new Child and Family Agency.</p><p>  In addition, under the agency&rsquo;s new Service Delivery Framework, work is at an advanced stage on the development of what are to be known as Local Area Pathways, which are with be local networks of statutory and NGO providers, which will be in position to respond immediately to child welfare referrals, including cases of neglect; by providing a range of services to multi-disciplinary services, including family support.</p><p>  In conclusion, I look forward to the conduct of the national audit and the ongoing work on establishment of the new Agency and accompanying reforms.</p></reply>

Work is ongoing to progress the remaining recommendations in  the context of the wider ongoing reform process in Children and Family Services in the HSE. This reform process includes a number of important strands including work force development, service enhancement and models of care in children and family services.

Funding has also been allocated to the hotline by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in 2013 (and previously in 2012). The funding received includes the establishment costs and the national promotion  of the Hotline service.</p><p>  A key component of the service is a successful awareness programme. It is vital that those who could benefit from the service know that it exists and that users are aware of the scope of the service.  During the initial set up phase of the service, the ISPCC focused on community based promotion of the service.  This included presentations to local community groups.  Posters, flyers and business cards have been distributed to all Garda stations from Garda headquarters, and promotional material has been distributed to a variety of community based projects in various locations throughout the country.  Further, the ISPCC has made extensive use of social media such as facebook and twitter to advertise this service on an ongoing basis.  The official launch of the service  5 June, 2013 also provided the opportunity to further promote the scope of the service.  In addition, the 116000 Missing Children Hotline website (<i>www.missingchildrenhotline.ie</i>) was launched on 5 June 2013, the day of the official launch of the service.</p><p>  The ISPCC will now escalate the promotion of this service, which will include promotion in schools. The Project Team will be kept informed on an on-going basis of the ISPCC's plans and activities related to awareness raising.</p></reply>

I have outlined my commitment to this project on many different occasions and it remains at the top of my agenda. The Deputy will be aware that shortly after taking responsibility for the children's detention schools last year I introduced the legislative changes to transfer responsibility for 16 year old boys from St. Patrick's Institution to Oberstown. I also put in place the required funding package for the major capital development of the Oberstown facilities. My officials have, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, completed the design process and secured planning permission for the capital development.  The tender process is ongoing at present and this is being overseen by a steering group of officials from my Department and the Office of Public Works.  A further announcement on the outcome of the tendering process will be made shortly.  The introduction of expanded detention facilities in Oberstown will also be accompanied by a proportionate increase in staffing resources.  While the full extent of these additional resources has yet to be finalised pending the award of the Oberstown project, the aim is to begin the recruitment process in 2013 with a view for staff to be on campus in 2014 and ready to open the first of the new units by mid 2014.</p><p>  I am conscious that staff working in this area must have the necessary training and supports in order to fully implement the child care model of detention.  A very substantial change programme is underway on the Oberstown campus and the expanded remit of the children detention service will see it accommodate all children detained in the State in a child specific environment from the middle of next year. This implies significant operational change for staff and management in Oberstown.  A new campus staffing roster was implemented on 25 February 2013 following protracted negotiation and agreement between staff and management at the Labour Relations Commission.  This is the first time all care staff on the campus are operating flexibly according to one campus wide roster with a set of harmonised conditions for hours worked. I wish to acknowledge the cooperation of staff with the implementation of this change to date. A number of issues have been the subject of consideration in conjunction with implementation of the campus wide roster, including training needs and the need to achieve greater harmonisation of care procedures between the three children detention schools.  These issues are being progressed at present as part of the ongoing industrial relations process in Oberstown. </p></reply>

I believe that the investment made in childcare supports is an investment in our country&rsquo;s future prosperity.  I have provided sufficient funding to ensure that the programmes can been maintained despite the ongoing need to reduce Government expenditure. </p><p>  It is recognised that intensive and targeted early childhood services have the potential to significantly enhance the life chances of many children.  There is significant international evidence of the benefits for children's outcomes of the provision of quality education and childcare in the earliest years.  Investment in early childhood care and education benefits not only the individual child but also the future development of the wider economy.  I am also aware of the important economic contribution that childcare services provide through direct employment of staff in service delivery and through support for labour participation on the part of working parents. </p><p>  The Early Years Strategy, which is currently being developed by my Department, will be Ireland's first ever national strategy for early years.  It is expected that it will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as health, including physical and mental development, vaccination programmes and population health issues such as nutrition and exercise, as well as parenting and  family support, learning and development, play and recreation and early childhood care and education.  The Strategy will further recognise the economic imperative and benefits accruing from targeted investment in early years interventions.</p><p>  I was successful in securing &euro;2.75m in capital funding in Budget 2013 to support the ongoing improvement of the childcare sector via the 2013 Childcare Capital Programme.  This programme is being implemented by Pobal on behalf of my Department.  Both community not-for-profit childcare facilities and private childcare facilities currently participating in one of the three childcare programmes implemented by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs were eligible to apply for a grant under the Programme.  The application process for funding under the programme has now been concluded and applicants will be advised of the outcome in the very near future.</p></reply>

It was established in June 2011 with a mandate to put in place a unified framework of policy, legislation and provision across Government in respect of children and young people.</p><p>  The responsibilities of my Department encompass a wide range of policy and service activity, both direct and indirect, for children and young people in Ireland. It has a complex mandate, comprised of a number of separate, but interrelated strands including:-</p><p> - the direct provision of a range of universal and targeted services;</p><p> - ensuring high-quality arrangements are in place for focused interventions dealing with child welfare and protection, family support, adoption, school attendance and reducing youth crime;</p><p> - the harmonisation of policy and provision across Government and with a wide range of stakeholders to improve outcomes for children, young people and families.</p><p>  Funding requirements and how resources should be prioritised and allocated across each area of Government spending are generally considered as part of the annual estimates cycle and budgetary process. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to comment at this time on any future decisions that may be taken by Government in the context of Budget 2014 on the expenditure allocations for programmes and services falling within the Vote of my Department.  However, my overall objective will be to realise funding allocations that reflect expenditure policy priorities and that sufficient resources are directed towards those areas of greatest impact on children and young people.</p></reply>

At this time, custodial accommodation for those under 18 years is provided on the Oberstown campus, Lusk, Co Dublin and in St Patrick's Institution, Dublin 7.  The Oberstown campus accommodates boys aged up to 17 years old and girls up to 18 years of age.  Accommodation is currently provided for 17 year old boys in St Patrick's Institution, Dublin 7 which comes under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p><p>  The legal detention capacity of the Oberstown campus comprises 24 male bed spaces in Trinity House School, 8 female bed spaces in Oberstown Girls School, and 20 male bed spaces in Oberstown Boys School. However, only 16 of the certified 24 male bed spaces in Trinity House School are currently available for use due to staffing shortages.  The Irish Youth Justice Service, which is based in my Department, is currently in discussions with management and staff on the Oberstown campus on an initiative to reorganise the detention capacity for males and female bed places, in order to meet the increased demand for male bed places from the courts.  This is being progressed so as to achieve its earliest possible commencement.  </p><p>  With regard to future accommodation, on 2 April 2012 I announced a capital investment package for the National Children Detention Facility project in Oberstown.  This project is required in order to give effect to the Programme for Government commitment to end the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities.

A number of serious concerns were raised throughout the report and in its conclusions.  The HSE was given an opportunity to respond to the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report, and those responses are reflected throughout, including in the recommendations section.  The HSE indicated they were firmly of the view that at no time either previously or currently has there been Immediate or Priority 1 cases left unattended to, and that at all times these cases are receiving a service and depending on their ranking will either receive a service within 24 hours or within 7 days.  In relation to Priority 2 cases, HSE South advised that the necessary network checks are completed when there is capacity within the team to deal with same. At no time are these cases left unscreened as review has taken place by the Team Leader.  In relation to screening of duty referrals the HSE advised the Ombudsman that all referrals received are recorded by a Social Worker, the intake record is completed and more clarifying information is sought if possible from the Gardai, other HSE personnel/agencies or the referrer.  Any case that warrants immediate attention is discussed immediately with the Team Leader or any on site manager.  Overall, HSE National concluded that the area was aware and taking steps to address the issues raised.  A decision was made to keep the area under review which occurs at senior management meetings with the National Director and Regional Managers.  It should be noted that the level of social work service required will vary greatly, depending on the circumstances of each case, and this can put a high degree of pressure on the overall social work resource.</p><p>  The Ombudsman made recommendations in respect of external audit, monitoring of referrals and review of unallocated cases, HSE procedure for management and assurance of child protection cases by file audit, clarification of child protection procedures, social work caseload, public accountability and recording of professional activity.  HSE responses to these recommendations include:</p><p>- During the course of the Ombudsman investigation, the HIQA commenced its inspection of child protection services. The North Lee area fully co-operated with a targeted HIQA inspection, and a report of this inspection is awaited;</p><p>- A review of cases in North Lee is under way as recommended by the Ombudsman;</p><p>- Referral levels and resource capacity are to be reviewed on a monthly basis;</p><p>- A national audit of cases in social work services has commenced;</p><p>- Practice guidance has been clarified in the HSE&rsquo;s Child Welfare and Protection Practice Handbook;</p><p>- The HSE is actively monitoring areas where there are growing caseloads and waiting lists in order that these areas can be supported;</p><p>- Progress continues to be made in respect of the National Childcare Information System going live next year.</p><p>  More generally, reform of the social work service is an ongoing priority process within HSE Children and Families, and this will continue when the new Child and Family Agency is established.  Work is under way to ensure that all areas work to a national policy on review of cases awaiting allocation.  Where immediate actions are needed to safeguard a child the duty social work team provide the service.  For instance where a child needs to come into care, or where an assessment is deemed a priority or a case conference is required, the duty social work team undertake this work.  The HSE has rolled out the Standardised Business Process and is bedding it down across the 17 areas to make sure services are provided on the basis of a consistent assessment and categorisation of risk.  The recently commenced inspection of child protection services by HIQA will assist in the identification of areas where improvement is required and in time will support safer systems for children at risk.  It is important to note, as has been highlighted in other reports, the number of referrals in respect of welfare has increased substantially in recent years.  What has also been highlighted is the challenge of understanding fully and responding to welfare concerns underneath which may lie more serious neglect issues.  What is critical is the support of those reporting concerns to give as much information as is possible to ensure a 'complete' picture and to ensure that the persistence and ongoing nature of concerns is clear to the HSE.  If this is highlighted quickly where necessary the child's case can be escalated to the appropriate level of priority.  The new prioritisation system provides not only assignment to a priority category on intake of a referral, but a review of individual prioritisation by Principal Social Workers on an ongoing basis, as well as an overall assessment of numbers and levels of prioritisation across the area and across the country to ensure consistency of approach and to identify areas of high pressure.  The Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s report is important, and once again a range of service delivery issues have been highlighted. Improvements to the social work services, and integration of these services with a range of other child and family services, continue to be a high priority for the CEO designate of the Child and Family Agency, Mr. Gordon Jeyes, and his senior management team.</p></reply>

Almost 50% of all passport applications are received in the four months April&ndash;July.  Currently the passport service is receiving almost 19,000 applications a week.  This contrasts with 8,000 applications per week in December. For this reason, as we advise applicants on the information note accompanying the form and our website, during the peak summer period application processing times for this service can lengthen.  Due to the present surge in demand, the turnaround time for passport express applications received through the Passport Express system is currently running between 11 and 12 working days, rather than the normal 10 working days.  Measures have been taken to return current turnaround times back to standard service levels at the earliest opportunity.  The Passport Service regrets the delay and any difficulties caused in this regard.  For those who have non-emergency urgent travel, the Passport Service now operates an appointment system and extended opening hours in our Molesworth St office.  People can also attend our Cork public office. It should be noted however that the minimum turn around time for a passport is 3 working days.</p><p>  Approximately 20% of applications submitted to the public counter are processed in less than 5 working days as these passports are required for non-emergency urgent travel.  Non urgent applications received at the public counter are processed in 15 days and first time adult applicants, which require more stringent checking, and who apply at the counter have a 20 day turnaround.</p></reply>

In my letter, I expressed concerns that certain provisions of the US Senate&rsquo;s bill on immigration reform could have the inadvertent consequence of severely restricting the operation of the J1 summer programme.  I noted the significant level of Irish participation in the J1 programme and asked for the Secretary&rsquo;s assistance in resolving these concerns.  I also raised the issue of the Ireland-US Intern Work and Travel Pilot Programme, which is due for renewal later this year and which is the subject of ongoing discussions at official level.

The provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, separated out these distinct functions to constitute the two separate formations of the Council which exist today &ndash; the Foreign Affairs Council and the General Affairs Council.  The Treaty on European Union (Article 16) confers on the GAC two primary functions: first, to "ensure consistency in the work of the different Council configurations"; and to &ldquo;prepare and ensure the follow-up to meetings of the European Council&rdquo;.  The GAC thus has a cross-cutting coordination role among the various formations of the Council and it endeavours to do this, most evidently, through its role in preparing for and ensuring the follow-up to meetings of the European Council.  The GAC is chaired by the rotating Presidency, which over the last six months, has been undertaken by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Article 16 in the Treaty on European Union separately confers on the FAC two primary functions: first, to "elaborate the Union&rsquo;s external action on the basis of strategic guidelines laid down by the European Council"; and to "ensure that the Union&rsquo;s action is consistent".</p><p>  The FAC deals with the EU's external action, including common foreign and security policy, development cooperation and trade. It is tasked with framing the Union&rsquo;s common foreign and security policy and it takes the decisions necessary to define and implement it on the basis of guidance from Heads of State or Government.  The FAC, along with its chair the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, is also tasked under the Treaties with ensuring the unity, consistency and effectiveness of action by the Union.  The FAC and GAC formations of the Council each undertake substantive and distinct bodies of work.  The only overlap of note that occurs between the two relates primarily to the GAC&rsquo;s role in preparing the work of the European Council, which by definition draws upon and engages with the work of many other Council formations, including that of the FAC.  I am happy with the current division of functions, as set out in the Treaties.</p></reply>

Over the past two years, the Government has broadly stabilised the budget for development assistance.

The EU&rsquo;s External Action Service has sought urgent clarification of the situation in both Washington and Brussels.  I understand that High Representative Ashton has also spoken directly to Secretary of State Kerry in a meeting in Brunei.  The Government has already expressed our concerns to the US Embassy in Dublin at a senior official level, including that we expect clarification to follow on the EU request.   It is important that there is clarity and transparency on this matter as soon as possible.  Ireland highly values its relationship with the US both bilaterally and in the context of the EU.  We expect to continue our cooperative partnership, in particular as we begin to work on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership</p></reply>

It applies to a residential property which is not used as the owner&rsquo;s sole or main residence, with limited exemptions.  Liability to pay the NPPR Charge is determined on the basis of ownership of the property in question on the &quot;liability date&quot;, which is 31 March for 2013.</p><p>  A liability to LPT is based on the chargeable value (market value) of a residential property on the valuation date and arises where a person owns a residential property on the liability date which is 1 May 2013 for the year 2013 and, for subsequent years, 1 November in the preceding year (that is, the liability date for 2014 is 1 November 2013).  Properties valued up to &euro;1 million are organised into valuation bands, with an initial band of &euro;0 to &euro;100,000 and 18 bands from &euro;100,001 to &euro;1 million with a range of &euro;50,000 in each band. Liability is calculated using the mid-point of the appropriate band. For properties valued in excess of &euro;1 million, liability is calculated using the actual chargeable value.</p><p>  It is therefore not possible to outline the exact LPT and NPPR Charge liability for 2013 for an individual who owns a second home without knowing the chargeable value of the properties.</p><p>  The inter-Departmental Group chaired by Dr Don Thornhill on the design of a property tax (the &ldquo;Thornhill Group&rdquo;) recommended that the NPPR Charge should be absorbed into the LPT as a separate supplemental tax, in addition to the LPT at the standard level applying to non-principal private residences.  The Government did not accept this recommendation.  The NPPR Charge will be collected in 2013, when a half-year LPT applies, but will be discontinued thereafter.  The Government decided to extend the NPPR Charge into 2013 to ensure as smooth a transition as possible for local authorities pending the introduction of the full LPT.</p></reply>

I have not sought access to these recordings as under statute the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are the body responsible for criminal investigations in the State. I understand that the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation have requested access to various documents/materials in the banks, including audio recordings, and that the banks have fully complied with these investigations to date. It would be completely inappropriate for the Department of Finance to act outside of its legal powers and interfere with any investigation that could compromise potential future criminal or civil investigations by the bodies responsible under statute.    Any phone calls that are relevant around this period may feature as part of the forthcoming banking inquiry for which the legislation is currently before the House. Under the proposed legislation responsibility is assigned exclusively to the Houses of the Oireachtas to determine the requirement for a formal inquiry, the terms of reference of that inquiry and the procedural and organisational aspects of the inquiry.</p></reply>

SEPA is an EU initiative that will change the way that these payments are processed across Europe. SEPA will allow payment systems users to make euro-denominated retail electronic payments to payees located in any of the participating countries, using a single payment account and a single set of payment instruments (the participating countries are the EU member states, together with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Monaco). </p><p>  In order to raise awareness of SEPA, a communications campaign entitled &ldquo;Ready for Sepa&rdquo; began at the end of January 2013 and this culminates in Autumn 2013. This communications campaign is aimed primarily at businesses as SEPA will predominately affect businesses and the campaign is part-funded by the Department of Finance and the participating banks in Ireland. Advertising has appeared in print media, radio and online. The main message of the campaign is to raise awareness and direct businesses to talk to their bank and software provider to ensure a successful migration to SEPA. More information can be found on the website www.readyforsepa.ie. Coupled with this, all of the Commercial banks are advertising separately in the media and communicating directly with their customers.</p><p>  SEPA comes into full effect on 1 February 2014 and businesses will need to ensure that payroll, direct debit and accounting systems are SEPA-ready. SEPA will introduce new business rules in relation to retail electronic payments and implement common standards in all participating countries for issuing and executing the underlying payment instructions. </p><p>  The main change for consumers will be how their bank account will be identified for the purposes of making and receiving payments. The BIC (Bank Identifier Code) and IBAN (International Bank Account Number) will be used instead of the National Sort Code and Account Number that they currently use. </p><p>  The implementation of SEPA within Ireland is overseen by the National Payments Plan (NPP) Steering Committee, which was established in 2012 to modernise the way payments are made in Ireland. In this regard, an NPP-SEPA sub-group has been formed, consisting of representatives of consumers, businesses, Government and banks.</p></reply>

These are ultimately commercial decisions for the management team and board of each bank, having due regard to their customers and the impact on profitability. Notwithstanding the fact that the State is a minority shareholder in Bank of Ireland, I must ensure that the banks are run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure their value as an asset to the State, as per the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF. A Relationship Framework has been specified that defines the nature of the relationship between the Minister for Finance and each bank. These Frameworks were published on 30 March 2012 and can be found at; <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i>  .</p><p>  As I responded to the Deputy in PQ 37717/12, the Life Loan in question was available from February 2001 to November 2010. It provided long term equity release for people over the age of 65. It was a way of unlocking part of the value of your property, without having to move home. The amount a customer could borrow depended primarily on their age and the value of the property in question. </p><p>  No repayments are required on the loan until one of the following events occur:</p><p>  1. The property is sold</p><p>  2. The death of the borrower (In joint cases, the last surviving borrower)</p><p>  3. The property is vacated for six months or more (In joint cases, by the last surviving borrower).</p><p>  As the maximum loan to value available was 30% of the house value, the incidence of potential negative equity in these cases is not material.</p><p>  Notwithstanding this, where a repayment event occurs, the Bank's recourse is limited to the market value of the property at the point of sale. The borrower or their estate has no liability for any potential shortfall following sale.</p><p>  I have been informed that as no payments are required during the term of the loan, by definition it cannot accrue arrears and as a result the product does not fall within the scope of the Bank's MARS strategies.</p></reply>

The anti-money-laundering obligations applicable in Ireland derive from the Third EU Money-Laundering Directive.  The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 was enacted in July 2010 to transpose the Third Money Laundering Directive (2005/60/EC) and its Implementing Directive (2006/70/EC) into Irish Law.</p><p>  Part 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 2010 sets out the obligations of &#8220;designated persons&#8221; in relation to customer identification.  One such obligation set out in the Act is the obligation to conduct customer due diligence, prior to the establishment of a business relationship. Customer due diligence refers to the identification of customers and that of any beneficial owners of financial products associated with the customer.</p><p>An Post and the Prize Bond Company are deemed to be a &#8220;<i>designated person</i>&#8221; under the Criminal Justice Act 2010 as they fall within the definition of a &#8220;<i>financial institution</i>  &#8221;. In light of this, An Post and the Prize Bond Company are required to comply with the relevant provisions of the Act in relation to the sale of Prize Bonds to customers.  This means, in practical terms, that customer due diligence must be conducted on all purchases of prize bonds, irrespective of value.</p><p>  The extent to which any particular person or product may be exempted from the customer due diligence requirements of the Act is determined by reference to the Act having regard to the underlying Directives.</p><p>  The Central Bank of Ireland has no discretion to exempt certain firms from the requirement to comply with the Act.</p><p>  In light of the above, I am exploring with the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) and my colleague the Minister for Justice whether or not exemptions available under the Directives may be applied to small value purchases of prize bonds facilitated on behalf of the State by An Post and the Prize Bond Company.</p></reply>

The capacity of the Central Bank in this respect has been further enhanced under the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill, which is expected to be enacted shortly.</p><p>  A key lesson from the financial crisis is that it is important that key regulatory information is made available to policymakers to ensure that decisions are based on accurate and robust data and analysis.  My Department works closely with the Central Bank to ensure that this is the case.  I have not commissioned an independent assessment of information provided by the Central Bank to me or my department; that is not to say that the information is accepted at face value without proper scrutiny and, where appropriate, challenge.  However, I am not altogether convinced that relying on such third party assessment would address the core of the issue, particularly in light of experience of the financial crisis regarding supposedly objective third party analysis from auditors and credit rating agencies, for example.</p><p>  Nevertheless a core focus of recent reforms by the Government and the Central Bank itself has been on enhancing the access to information by the Central Bank and its capacity to provide timely and reliable information and analysis to support sound decision making.

All deposit-taking credit institutions in Ireland are required by law to participate in the Deposit Guarantee Scheme. The Deposit Guarantee Scheme operates across the EU so deposits with credit institutions from other EU Member States operating in Ireland were similarly guaranteed in 2008. Coverage levels and the scope of Deposit Guarantee Schemes have been harmonised across the EU since 2009.</p><p>  In the event of a credit institution being unable to repay deposits, the Central Bank is currently authorized to make compensation payments to eligible depositors to a maximum of &euro;100,000 per person per institution. </p><p>  The Deposit Guarantee Scheme is funded by a charge on the credit institutions participating in the scheme. The cost of compensation payments is met from the balances in the Deposit Protection Account. In the event of the Deposit Protection Account being insufficient to fund a compensation event, any difference is made up using advances from the Central Bank or the State; the remaining participating institutions are then responsible for the repayment of these advances.</p><p>  The Deposit Guarantee Scheme initially covered deposits up to &euro;20,000. The coverage level of &euro;20,000 was revised, initially by a statement by the Minister for Finance on 20 September 2008 and subsequently under the Financial Services (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Act 2009, to increase the coverage to &euro;100,000 per person per institution.</p><p>  The Central Bank of Ireland advises me that it does not have data on the potential exposure as at 2008. While it had figures on the total deposits held by financial institutions in 2008, it did not have the technical capacity or powers to provide the information in this way. This matter has since been addressed in the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011. </p><p>  As no compensation events occurred in 2008, it was not necessary to draw down from the Deposit Guarantee Scheme in 2008.</p></reply>

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.  This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p><p>  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, I announced at this year's Teacher Union Conferences that I will shortly bring to Government draft heads of a bill &ndash; the Education (Admission to School) Bill 2013.

I also intend to publish draft regulations that I plan to make when the Bill is enacted.  In bringing forward these proposals, it is not my intention to unnecessarily intrude into how schools do their business.  My policy objective is to ensure that every child is treated fairly and that the way in which schools decide on applications is structured, fair and transparent.</p><p> As the Bill and the Regulations will be published in draft form, they will also be subject to a lot of detailed scrutiny before becoming law.  I will be reflecting carefully on the views expressed in the consultation process to ensure they strike the right balance between school autonomy and fairness in our education system.</p></reply>

Smaller projects below &euro;500,000 generally do not require a performance bond due to the nature of those projects i.e. short-term, lower risk, cost of obtaining bond versus contract size, availability of bonding facilities in the market for small value projects and barrier to entry issues for new entrants or SME's. </p><p>  The bond is used to cover costs (up to the value of the bond) that would otherwise accrue to the Employer (i.e. the Department, School, VEC etc.) on foot of a contractor's failure to complete the works.

Accordingly, applicants with enquiries regarding registration should contact the Council without delay.  I understand that there may be a number of courses of action open to a person in this position.</p></reply>

Calculation of reckonable income is set out in Article 22(3) of the Student Grant Scheme 2013.  The eligibility criteria for student grants including the income thresholds is reviewed annually in my Department and approved by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The income thresholds are stated on a gross income basis representing gross pay before any deductions for income tax or PRSI.  On this basis everyone has the same starting point, which eliminates any distortion which may arise from different spending decisions in different households under a net earnings regime.<br />  The Deputy may be aware that various income thresholds apply depending on the number of dependent children in a family and/or the number of relevant persons attending further or higher education.  In the scenario presented by the Deputy, where there are four dependent children in the family, the highest income limit, which enables a person to receive the some grant support for undergraduate studies (50% of the Student Contribution) is &euro;59,595.  In addition, as there are four dependent children pursuing a full-time higher education course, an increment of &euro;4,830 can be applied to the income limit in respect of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th child.  In such a scenario, if the family's reckonable income falls below &euro;74,085, they may be eligible for some support under the student grant scheme.

The policy of my Department is to secure the maximum possible level of inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, or where a special school or special class placement may be required to ensure such placements are provided for.</p><p>  Pupils with Down's syndrome attending mainstream schools may receive additional teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil's educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours which are allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05.</p><p>  Pupils with Down's syndrome may be allocated resources under the category of mild general learning disability, or under the categories of moderate general learning difficulty or Assessed Syndrome, in conjunction with another Low Incidence disability.  Pupils with Down's syndrome who have care needs may also receive access to Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support.  The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school, and on the basis of the assessed care needs of the children, rather than solely by reference to a pupil's disability categorisation. </p><p>  I wish to explain to the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a formal role under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004 in advising me in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities.  My Department requested that the NCSE consider the issue of whether Down's syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability, in the context of its preparation of comprehensive advice on how the educational system supports children with special educational needs in schools.  The NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools has now been published and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie.  The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category.  The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term, pupils with Down's syndrome pupils who are in the Mild General Learning Difficulty (Mild GLD) category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD. </p><p>  The NCSE policy advice did not recommend that an exception should be made for children with Down syndrome who are in the mild general learning difficulty range, over other children who are in the mild range and who also may have other co-morbid conditions.  However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down's syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process.  In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs.  I have requested the NCSE to immediately proceed to establish a Working Group in order to develop a proposal for consideration for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report.</p><p>  In the course of my recent meeting with Down Syndrome Ireland a number of issues were raised which I consider merit further examination.  Accordingly I have asked my officials to consider these issues further and to provide a full response to Down Syndrome Ireland on the issues raised as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This is borne out by the fact that in 2012, 85% of the capital expenditure in the school sector was in respect of large scale projects, additional accommodation and prefab replacement.  The balance was expended on site acquisition, emergency works, furniture and equipment provision and commitments arising from earlier years.  The capital allocation that is available for the school sector in 2013 is expected to have a similar spend pattern as was the case in 2012 and at this time there are no plans to reinstate the Minor Works Grant.</p><p>  All recognised national schools running costs are met by my Department's schemes of capitation and ancillary service grants.  Schools receive capitation funding in January and June of each year.  Enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid to schools in respect of pupils with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools.  The first moiety, paid in January of each year, of 70% is calculated using the enrolment figures from the previous school year.  However, when the second moiety is being paid in June the current year enrolment figure is taken into account and the first moiety is reconciled at that stage.  The ancillary services grant is paid to Schools in March of each year.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.  The staffing schedule is the mechanism used for the allocation of classroom teachers to all primary schools.  It operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location.  The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level.  The staffing schedule also includes provision for schools that have significant increases in their enrolment in rapidly developing areas to be allocated classroom teachers based on their projected enrolments for September 2013.  The criteria for this are set out in the staffing schedule which is available on the Department website. </p><p>  I understand that the school referred to by the Deputy applied for a post under developing school status.  The post was provisionally approved pending confirmation of the enrolment at 30 September 2013.  The school subsequently decided not to proceed with the post on the basis of uncertainty of achieving the required enrolment.  The Deputy will be aware that the Government has protected frontline services in schools to the greatest extent possible in the recent budget and there will no reduction in teacher numbers in primary schools and in free second level schools for the 2013/14 school year as a result of the budget.  The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of the budget.</p></reply>

It sets the overall capital investment framework and the basic principles to be observed for the appraisal, assessment, procurement and evaluation of projects. It does not have a direct role in delivering individual projects (either PPP or traditional Exchequer capital projects). This is primarily the responsibility of the Sponsoring Department/Agency.   All spending Departments must comply with the new Public Spending Code which draws together all of the standard guidance for assessing, reviewing and appraising public expenditure programmes &ndash; current as well as capital &ndash; in the public service. The Code highlights the need to revise appraisals if there are time lapses, changes in circumstances or significant additional costs involved in projects. In particular, Cost Benefit Analyses (CBAs) for capital projects should be reviewed at key stages to make sure the project is still justified. The Code also states, in relation to CBAs, that a final reassessment of demand and costs should be undertaken if there is a significant time lag between the appraisal and commissioning of the project.</p><p>  Additionally, a full suite of guidance material has been published to facilitate the PPP process.   This guidance dovetails with the Public Spending Code but also includes specific technical tools to evaluate PPP proposals and tenders.  The key aspects of the guidance relate to the assessment of projects for procurement as PPP, the compilation of the public sector benchmark and ensuring value for money through the PPP process. There are a number of specific tests throughout the procurement and tender negotiation processes to ensure that best value is derived for the State.  Details of the timing and content of these value for money tests are set out in the various PPP guidance issued by my Department which are available at www.ppp.gov.ie. </p><p>  In accordance with the guidance issued by my Department, the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) has the role of providing an opinion to the Sponsoring Agency in relation to the value for money testing on a PPP project. I am informed that the NDFA issued a value for money letter on 21 June 2007 when the Poolbeg incinerator project was at contract close with conditions precedent outstanding. NDFA later wrote to Dublin City Council in March 2012 to clarify that the previously issued NDFA value for money opinion of June 2007 was no longer valid as this opinion was based on the original contractual arrangements which had since changed.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-04a.363.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070400053#WRO00700"><p>Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 every employer has a duty, to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the safety, health and welfare of their employees and to manage and conduct work activities in such a way so as to prevent, as far as is reasonably practicable, any improper conduct or behaviour likely to put the safety, health or welfare of their employees at work at risk. The provisions in this Act do not specifically identify all possible workplace hazards as to do so would be impractical. However, the Act requires employers, where they know of, or can reasonably be expected to know of, a workplace hazard that is impacting on the safety, health or welfare of an employee or group of employees, to act reasonably in terms of assessing the risk, and putting in place control measures. </p><p>  Under section 19 of the Act an employer is required to carry out and maintain a written risk assessment to identify all potential hazards that may occur in a workplace under their control. Under section 20 the employer is required to ensure that all identified potential hazards and all protective and preventative measures taken are recorded in their safety statement. This statement also identifies the duties of employees in respect to the safety, health and welfare of all persons within the workplace.</p><p>  Similarly, the 2005 Act also places obligations on employees in relation to their duties not to engage in improper conduct or behaviour likely to endanger their own safety, health and welfare at work or that of any other person. </p><p>  Under the 2005 Act, the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) has published a Code of Practice for Employers and Employees on the Prevention and Resolution of Bullying at Work, and this is aimed at preventing and dealing with all bullying where it happens in Irish workplaces. </p><p>  The Code of Practice defines bullying as repeated inappropriate behaviour, direct or indirect, whether verbal, physical or otherwise, conducted by one or more persons against another or others, at the place of work and/or in the course of employment, which could reasonably be regarded as undermining the individual's right to dignity at work. </p><p>  The Code also reflects the legal requirement that employers carry out a risk assessment, and where bullying is identified as a hazard, they ensure that it is included in the safety statement.  The Code gives guidance on how to identify and assess if bullying is a hazard at work as well as on how to prepare a Bullying Prevention Policy. </p><p>  The purpose of an effective policy is not simply to prevent improper conduct and behaviour but also to encourage best practice and a safe and harmonious workplace where such behaviour is unlikely to occur. Employers should therefore adopt, implement and monitor a comprehensive, effective and accessible policy on bullying, at work.  This would include cyber-bullying.</p><p>  The Code of Practice also states that the scope of an employer's Bullying Prevention Policy should state that the protection of the policy should extend beyond the place of work to off-site work activities and to work-related social events.</p><p>  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and Code of Practice for Employers and Employees on the Prevention and Resolution of Bullying at Work state the clear requirements for all employers to have a stated, clear and enforceable policy and procedures which they consistently apply, regarding the access to, use of, and penalties for miss-use of, company property including computers and the software systems used whilst employees are working or in the course of employment. All employees should be made aware of these requirements, and sign off on the duties which they must uphold.</p><p>  The role of the HSA under the Code is to monitor if employers and employees are meeting their obligations and duty of care under the 2005 Act. The Code of Practice is available for free download at . </p><p>  I am satisfied that the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 in addition to the Health and Safety Authority's Code of Practice for Employers and Employees on the Prevention and Resolution of Bullying at Work provide a robust regime to protect employees from bullying, including cyber bullying, in the workplace. Consequently I have no plans for legislative change in this area at present.</p></reply>

The objective of the Treaty is to <font color="#2F2F2F">improve access for the blind, visually impaired, and print disabled to published works in formats such as braille, large print text and audio books.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">It provides also for the exchange of accessible format works across borders by organizations that serve people who are blind, visually impaired, and print disabled.  When the Treaty comes into effect, it will harmonize limitations and exceptions that apply in the contracting states so that these organizations can operate across borders.  This sharing of works in accessible formats should increase the overall number of works available to persons in need of the works in accessible formats.  For instance, instead of five countries producing accessible versions of the same work, it would be possible for the five countries to instead produce an accessible version of a different work, which could then be shared with each of the other countries.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">The treaty is also designed to provide assurances to authors and publishers that the system will not expose their published works to misuse or distribution to anyone other than the intended beneficiaries. It therefore reiterates the requirement that the cross-border sharing of works created, based on limitations and exceptions, must be limited to certain special cases which do not conflict with the normal exploitation of the work and do not unreasonable prejudice the legitimate interests of the rightholder.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  </font>The Treaty will be open for signature at the headquarters of WIPO by any eligible party for one year after its adoption.  It will <font color="#2F2F2F">enter into force after it has been ratified by twenty WIPO contracting States.  Ratification of the Treaty will require contracting parties to adopt national law provisions that permit the reproduction, distribution and making available of published works in accessible formats through limitations and exceptions to the rights of copyright Rightholders. </font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">The text of the Treaty can be found at the following link:</font></p><p>Ireland signed the Final Act of the Treaty on 28 June 2013 in Marrakesh but not the Treaty itself in line with normal protocol which requires Government approval of international Treaties to allow for signature.  Thereafter, and prior to any decision to seek Government approval to ratify the Treaty, a detailed examination of the final text adopted and of the relevant Irish law, will be undertaken.  It is the case that as it stands Ireland already has an exception in its national copyright law that allows for the adaptation of books into formats that are easier to use for visually impaired persons.  These formats include braille and audio files adapted for the visually impaired.</p></reply>

Customers are informed in writing of all decisions and also informed of their options as a result. Customers are entitled to request a medical review if they submit additional medical evidence in support of their claim.  All additional medical evidence received is presented for review to a Medical Assessor following receipt in the Department.

It was for that reason that the Government last year adopted the National Carers' Strategy with a view to giving greater public recognition to carers and their work.  </p><p>  Carers receive significant income supports from the Department of Social Protection so that people can continue living at home as far as possible.  Expenditure on carers has increased significantly in recent years.  In 2013 it is estimated to be &euro;776 million compared with an estimated outturn of &euro;771 million in 2012.  The expenditure on carers in 2012 included: &euro;509 million on carer's allowance; &euro;24 million on carer's benefit; &euro;135 million on the respite care grant and; &euro;103 million on domiciliary care allowance.  </p><p>  Carers also receive a free travel pass at an annual cost of &euro;6 million and carers who reside with the care recipient are eligible for the household benefits package at an annual cost of approximately &euro;30 million. </p><p>  I should stress that the supports available to carers in Ireland are among the highest rates of income support in Europe.  A person getting certain qualifying payments and also providing full-time care and attention to another person can keep their main social welfare payment and receive a half-rate carer's allowance as well.   </p><p>  The respite care grant is available to all full-time carers regardless of their means while the income disregard and means test for carers allowance is the most generous in the social welfare system.  A couple under 66 with two children, earning a joint annual income of  up to &euro;35,400 can qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance while a couple earning &euro;59,300 will still qualify for the minimum rate.  Carers are entitled to an extra half-rate carer's allowance if they care for more than one person and a respite care grant for each care recipient.  </p><p>  I have no plans to make any changes to the above at this time.</p></reply>

The combination of private investment and State interventions such as the National Broadband Scheme means that Ireland has met the EU Commission's Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.</p><p>  The Government, through the National Broadband Plan, which I published on 30<sup>th</sup> August last year, has recognised that the key imperative now is to ensure high speed broadband availability to all.  The Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country by ensuring that high speed services of 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, and in advance of the EU's target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>  We are now therefore moving to a new phase of public and private sector investment in broadband in Ireland which will see significantly improved speeds delivered across the country.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.</p><p>  In tandem with these commercial developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the introduction of next generation broadband access.</p><p>  In order to progress the State-led investment, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My Department has launched a formal mapping exercise to identify the areas of the country to be targeted in the State-led investment under the Government's National Broadband Plan to ensure the provision of high speed broadband services where the commercial market will not deliver.  This exercise will inform an EU State Aids application in respect of the State-led intervention and is a necessary prerequisite for State Aids approval.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p></reply>

Contrary to the view put forward in the correspondence referred to in the question, the new arrangements will not have a detrimental effect on local development services. Rather the establishment of Socio-Economic Committees in each local authority area will facilitate a more strategic, joined-up approach to local and community development locally. Socio-Economic Committees will bring key local and community development actors together in partnership, with a focus on outcomes rather than organisational boundaries , thus enabling collaborative leadership at local level and, ultimately, improving services for citizens and communities.</p><p>  The implementation of the alignment recommendations is being brought forward in a spirit of partnership and co-operation. An Alignment Working Group is advising and assisting my Department on the practical arrangements necessary to give effect to the new Socio-Economic Committees.  It comprises representatives from both the local government and local development sectors and is making good progress.</p><p><i>Putting People First</i> envisages an enhanced role for local government in local and community development. There is, however, no intention to undermine the expertise and staffing of local development companies. The aim is to facilitate a joint consideration locally as to how available resources might be deployed through more collaborative and co-ordinated approaches, supported by a reformed and enhanced local government sector.  As key partners on the Socio-Economic Committees, local development companies will continue to have an important role in the delivery of programmes for which they are contracted by my Department and others. Independent of alignment reforms, however, the level of funding for local development programmes is a key issue for implementing bodies, and this remains to be decided as part of the Government's estimates process and in the context of EU budgets.</p><p>  Our local development system delivers a broad range of local services for citizens and communities. Within the context of increasing pressure on available resources, we need to focus on maintaining these services at the frontline while ensuring that the system continues to be sustainable. The 2010 European Court of Auditors Report on LEADER, while acknowledging good practices in Ireland's management of the 2000-06 LEADER programme for example, highlighted the significant additional administration funding provided by the Irish Exchequer to LEADER companies mid-programme to ensure continued delivery of the programme. This was accompanied by a significant amount of 'interim funding' that was also provided by the Irish Exchequer to ensure the continued operation of LEADER companies in the period between the last two programming rounds.</p><p>  We are operating in a much changed economic context. The level of LEADER administration funding available under the next Rural Development Programme may be much reduced; and we can no longer afford the additional administration resources that may have been provided previously. More effective, efficient and joined-up approaches to service delivery are needed if we are to ensure the sustain ability of our local development system. I am confident that the reforms we are bringing forward can do this and that, as a result, we will be able to continue deliver high quality services for our citizens and communities into the future.</p></reply>

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property, determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function. </p><p>  The Commissioner of Valuation is conducting a programme of revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State on a county by county basis. The purpose of the revaluation process is to provide for more consistent and up-to-date valuations for rating purposes and to assist in providing a more equitable distribution of valuations across those liable to pay rates. </p><p>  To allay concerns that local authorities might gain a disproportionate increase in rates income in the year following a revaluation, a provision was included in the Valuation Act 2001 to limit the overall amount of income it could raise through rates in the year following a revaluation to the total amount of rates liable to be paid to it in the previous year, plus buoyancy (arising from valuations determined in the year of a revaluation of newly constructed property), adjusted for inflation as measured by the CPI.   </p><p>  Rate limitation orders have been made in each of the local authorities to have undergone a revaluation to date, namely, South Dublin County Council, Fingal County Council and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.

Every housing authority has a statutory duty to adopt and review an anti-social behaviour strategy for the prevention and reduction of anti-social behaviour in its housing stock, which must provide for co-operation with other relevant bodies, notably the Garda&iacute; .  Proposals for a new Housing Bill currently being developed in my Department include a revised procedure to replace section 62 of the Housing Act, 1966, which will enable housing authorities to recover possession of their dwellings from households in serious breach of their tenancy agreements, including engag ing in anti-social behaviour. I am also examining the scope in the forthcoming Bill for strengthening the excluding order powers of housing authorities. </p><p>  Insofar as private rented accommodation is concerned, the Residenti al Tenancies Act 2004 prohibits a tenant in a private residential tenancy from engaging in anti-social behaviour in, or in the vicinity of, a dwelling to which the Act applies and allows a landlord to terminate a tenancy at short notice where the tenant is engaging in , or allowing others to engage in , such behavio u r. The 2004 Act also empowers a third party adversely affected by anti-social behaviour to   make a complaint to the PRTB against a landlord who has failed to enforce tenant obligations.   The Act allows the Board to furnish the name and address of the landlord concerned to a person who proposes to make such a complaint.   However, the third party complainant must have taken reasonable steps to resolve the matter by communicating or attempting to communicate with the parties to the tenancy concerned before mak ing the complaint to the Board .   </p></reply>

Arising from this Judgment, the INIS, in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General, is working on the development of a framework, legislative and administrative, under which such applications will be determined into the future. Once the necessary legislative provisions have been completed, the new arrangements will be put into operation as soon as possible thereafter. This framework will also lay some of the foundations for what is proposed in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which I hope to re-publish later this year, under which it is envisaged that applications for asylum, subsidiary protection and 'leave to remain' will be dealt with as a single procedure.</p><p>  The legislative provisions referred to above are being given priority attention.  Once the new arrangements are in place, steps will be taken to have all outstanding applications for subsidiary protection processed to completion in a timely manner.</p><p>  The processing of an application for Subsidiary Protection is often extremely complex requiring detailed consideration of the individual merits of each case.  In addition, cases can often be held up for a number of reasons such as legal proceedings.  In other instances, for example where applications are made for EU Treaty Rights or under the Zambrano judgement, these applications will often be processed first.  In the circumstances, mean waiting times for processing cases would be highly misleading and not reflective of the actual position having regard to the factors as outlined above which are often outside by Department's direct control. </p></reply>

However, I can assure the Deputy that there is a comprehensive legislative regime in place to deal with lawful interception. </p><p>  Under Section 2 of the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993  Ministerial authorisation may be given for interceptions in the interests of the security of the State or for the purpose of criminal investigation. Such authorisations are only issued following application from the Garda Commissioner or the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces, in accordance with the Act.</p><p>  The Act provides for the appointment of a High Court Judge to keep under review the operation of the Act and to ascertain whether its provisions are being complied with.  The judge must report to An Taoiseach on the operation of the Act.  Such reports are subsequently laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. In addition, the Act provides for a procedure whereby a member of the public who believes that his/her communications have been intercepted  may apply to a &quot;Complaints Referee&quot; for an investigation into the matter. The role of the Complaints Referee is to investigate whether an authorisation was in force and, if so, whether the provisions of the Act have been contravened in relation to that authorisation.  If the Complaints Referee finds that there has been a contravention he should notify the individual concerned and report it to An Taoiseach.  He may also recommend the payment of compensation. The current Complaints Referee is a judge of the Circuit Court.</p></reply>

The Regulation provides the legal framework under which a protection order, such as a barring or safety order, obtained by a victim of domestic violence in one EU Member State can be recognised and enforceable in other EU Member States. The measure will enable victims of domestic violence to travel around Europe or to relocate to another EU Member State in safety, without having to go through additional court processes in other Member States.</p><p>  Cosc, The National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, which is an Executive Office in my Department, is working through the National Strategy on this topic with other Government Departments, state agencies and NGOs to support a &quot;whole of Government&quot; response to these issues. </p><p>  The Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime provides some funding to NGOs working to provide services to women and children to support their court accompaniment services. Some &euro;450,000 was given to these NGOs in 2011 and 3,147 victims were helped, while in 2012 the Commission provided just over &euro;440,000 and 3,276 victims were helped. This shows a year on year increase of 4% in the number of victims helped. </p><p>  However, I am informed that in 2012 approximately &euro;16.1m in funding of NGOs working to provide services to women and children experiencing domestic violence was provided by the HSE (Children and Families Service), working under the aegis of the Department of Health. This work is expected to be transferred to the Child and Family Support Agency on its establishment. I understand that the new agency will report directly to my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. </p></reply>

This report is currently under consideration in the relevant Government Departments. My Department's role in the Strategy is one of coordination while the development of particular policy and implementation are a matter for my Government colleagues.</p><p>  From Ireland's perspective, in relation to Roma specifically, it is important to note that the term &ldquo;Roma&rdquo;, as defined by the Council of Europe, refers to Roma, Sinti, Kale and related groups in Europe, including Travellers and Eastern groups (Dom and Lom), and covers the wide diversity of the groups concerned, including persons who identify themselves as &ldquo;Gypsies&rdquo;.  By this definition, the vast majority of Travellers/Roma in the Irish State are indigenous Irish Travellers. </p><p>  Ireland's National Traveller/Roma Strategy was developed following a  communication from the EU Commission entitled &ldquo;An EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies&quot; (April 2011) which requested that member states would, in proportion to the size of the Roma population living in their territories and taking into account their different starting points, adopt or develop further a comprehensive approach to Roma integration.This document thus includes relevant strategies that already exist in the four crucial areas  of education, employment, healthcare and housing.  It also mentions initiatives in place in the same areas to assist the Roma community who are citizens of the European Economic Area and are legally resident in the country.  It should be noted that Traveller representatives are active participants on National Committees dealing with policy in all four areas mentioned by the Deputy and, in this way, were involved in the development of these policies. The Irish Strategy document is envisaged to be a living document and as time goes on there is nothing to prevent the development and inclusion of new actions in any of the sectors; however the actions in the Strategy are at present generic actions in relation to the population covered rather than Roma-specific.</p></reply>

Arising from the refusal of her asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 27th February, 2009, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her.  In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for subsidiary protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.</i></p><p><i>  The person concerned initiated judicial review proceedings in the High Court, challenging the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal in her case. Her judicial review leave application was refused by the High Court </i><i>on 11th April, 2013 meaning that the earlier decisions of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and the then Minister stood.</i></p><p><i>The person concerned has submitted an application for subsidiary protection. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</i></p><p><i>  In the event that the application for subsidiary protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made. Once a decision has been made, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</i></p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Belgium, France and Germany also participated in this joint return operation.</p><p>  In enforcing the law in this respect, Ireland is no different to other countries who also remove individuals who have no lawful right to remain within their territory. Ireland, like other EU member states, uses deportation of illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers as the policy of last resort. The process leading to a deportation is extensive with many avenues of appeal, including judicial review in the High Court, open to persons subject to Deportation Orders. It should also be noted that a Deportation Order requires a person to remove themselves from the State and it is only where they fail to do so that the State is forced to remove them and enforce the rule of law.</p><p>  In determining whether to make a deportation order, I must have regard to the  factors set out in Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 (Prohibition of Refoulement) of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended.</p><p>  This essentially means that the safety of returning a person, or refoulement as it is commonly referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a deportation order i.e. that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State where the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.<font color="#000080"> </font>  My Department uses extensive country of origin information drawn from different independent sources in evaluating the safety of making returns to  third countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo.  The countries that participated in this operation, i.e., Belgium, France and Germany also adhered to this standard in this instance as do all EU Member States for such operations.</p><p>  Each asylum application received from a citizen of the Democratic Republic of Congo is considered on the basis of the facts, individual circumstances and merits of the case presented and a final decision is reached following a comprehensive examination and investigation of these facts, merits and circumstances taking full account of the political and human rights conditions prevailing in DR Congo and the latest reports of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. </p></reply>

The eligibility period for an annual programme extends for a year and a half after the end of the year in question.  So, the eligibility period for the annual programmes up to and including 2011 has ended and it is not possible to allocate unspent monies under those programmes.</p><p>  Up to and including the 2010 Annual Programme (which is the latest for which final figures have been compiled), over &euro;3.4 million, amounting to 40% of the national allocation, was unspent due to an insufficiency of suitable projects with the required level of matching funding.</p><p>  My Department intends to have a call for applications under the European Refugee and Integration Funds in the near future with the aim of making payments to successful projects before the end of the year.  An issue which arises is how to accommodate the existing Funds with the Asylum and Migration Fund which will replace them.  Specifically, the eligibility period for the Asylum and Migration Fund commences on 1 January 2014 and, for the reason outlined above, it will overlap with that of the existing Funds until 30 June 2015.  My Department is in contact with the European Commission on this aspect.</p><p>  While the EU legislation on the Asylum and Migration Fund has yet to be adopted, preparations for the Fund are under way.  My Department is due to undertake a policy or programming dialogue with the European Commission in October on the basis of which a national multiannual programme for expenditure from the Fund will be drawn up.  This dialogue is with the Member State and there is no provision for civil society groups to be directly involved.  However, the relevant draft Regulation contains an article on partnership with such groups and with other bodies in the preparation etc. of national programmes.  The exact terms of this provision are still the subject of negotiation.  However, it is my intention that appropriate consultation will take place with such bodies in the preparation of Ireland's programme.</p></reply>

Approximately 68,000 children are availing of the ECCE programme in the current school year.  Children are eligible to avail of the free preschool year where they are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months at 1 September in the relevant year.  Children born between 2 February 2009 and 30 June 2010 will qualify for the free preschool year in September 2013 and  children born between 2 February 2010 and 30 June 2011 will qualify for the programme in September 2014.  Therefore, children born in July 2010 are below the age range for eligibility for the programme in the school year 2013/14, but will qualify in the school year 2014/15.   As it is not in the best interests of children to enter the programme early, there is no provision under the programme to enrol children who are below the qualifying age.</p><p>  The objective of the ECCE programme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to eligible children in the year before they commence primary school.  To achieve this, services participating in the preschool year are expected to provide age-appropriate activities and programmes to children within a particular age cohort.  For this reason, it is appropriate to set minimum and maximum limits to the age range within which children will qualify.</p></reply>

International human rights norms ratified by Ireland, in particular the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and The Hague Convention on Adoption, provide a framework for domestic policy and practice relating to children&rsquo;s rights.  For example, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child spells out the basic human rights to which children everywhere are entitled, including the right to survival, the right to the development of their full physical and mental potential, the right to protection from influences that are harmful to their development, and the right to participation in family, cultural and social life.  In order to meet our external obligations a priority activity between 2012 and 2014 is to ensure that arrangements are in place to support the DCYA to meet its external obligations in relation to children and youth.</p><p>  My Department had a leadership role in progressing the work of the EU in the youth field during Ireland's Presidency of the EU from January to June 2013.  My Department chaired the Youth Working Party comprising officials of member states which prepares the work for the meetings of the Council of Ministers.  I chaired the meeting of Youth ministers on 16th May, 2013 as part of the Council of Ministers for Education, Youth, Culture and Sport.  My Department also hosted two important flagship events, the EU youth Conference which took place in March in Dublin and an EU Round Table Expert meeting which explored the contribution of youth work to youth employment, this took place in Castletown House on 20th and 21st June, 2013.  Other primary international bodies with which the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is linked are: the European Commission, the Council of Europe, Child One Europe and the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child.</p></reply>

The new youth policy framework will aim to enhance the provision of youth services and activities and it will, inter alia, promote co-ordination between government departments and youth sector organisations with a view to maximising the effectiveness of the State funding available to support services for young people in future years.</p></reply>

At this time, custodial accommodation for under 18 year olds is provided on the Oberstown campus, Lusk, Co Dublin and in St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, Dublin 7.  The Oberstown campus accommodates boys aged up to 17 years old and girls up to 18 years of age.  Accommodation is currently provided for 17 year old boys in St Patrick's Institution, Dublin 7 which comes under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.  In light of the independent inspections by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) and the continuing work of the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) and the Oberstown Board of Management, I am confident that the children detention schools do provide safe and reliable accommodation for the detention of young people. </p><p>  The legal detention capacity of the Oberstown campus comprises 24 male bed spaces in Trinity House School, 8 female bed spaces in Oberstown Girls School, and 20 male bed spaces in Oberstown Boys School. However, only 16 of the certified 24 male bed spaces in Trinity House School are currently available for use due to staffing shortages.  The Irish Youth Justice Service, which is based in my Department, is currently in discussions with management and staff on the Oberstown campus on an initiative to reorganise the detention capacity for males and female bed places, in order to meet the increased demand for male bed places from the courts.  This is being progressed so as to achieve its earliest possible commencement.</p><p>  With regard to future accommodation needs, on 2 April 2012 I announced a capital investment package for the National Children Detention Facility project in Oberstown.  This project is required in order to give effect to the Programme for Government commitment to end the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities.  I have outlined my commitment to this project on many different occasions and it remains at the top of my agenda. My officials have, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, completed the design process and secured planning permission for the capital development.  The tender process is ongoing at present and this is being overseen by a steering group of officials from my Department and the Office of Public Works.  A further announcement on the outcome of the tendering process will be made shortly.  The new facilities will increase the capacity on the campus available to the courts from the current maximum capacity of 52 places to 90 places.  I am advised that based on recent trends, this should be sufficient to meet the requirements of the courts for children detention places.</p></reply>

It has a complex mandate, comprised of a number of separate, but interrelated strands including:</p><p>- the direct provision of a range of universal and targeted services;</p><p>- ensuring high-quality arrangements are in place for focused interventions dealing with child welfare and protection, family support, adoption, school attendance and reducing youth crime;</p><p>- the harmonisation of policy and provision across Government and with a wide range of stakeholders to improve outcomes for children, young people and families.</p><p>  As outlined in my Department's Statement of Strategy, in order to achieve its goals, my Department works in close partnership with other Government departments, statutory agencies and non-governmental organisations on a range of cross-cutting issues in relation to both policy and provision as they relate to children and young people.</p><p>  In the context of the upcoming budget, funding requirements and how resources should be prioritised and allocated across each area of Government spending are generally considered as part of the annual estimates cycle and budgetary process.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment at this time on any future decisions that may be taken by Government on the expenditure allocations for programmes and services falling within the Vote of my Department.  However, my objective will be to realise funding allocations that reflect expenditure policy priorities and that sufficient resources are directed towards those areas of greatest impact on children and young people.</p><p>  The commitment to establish a new Child and Family Support Agency is at the heart of the Government's reform of child and family services.  The new Agency will assume responsibility for Children and Family Services, currently provided by the HSE, and the Family Support Agency.  It will have a workforce of approximately 4,000 staff, and a combined existing budget of over &euro;590 million.  The Agency will be headed by Gordon Jeyes, as the Chief Executive designate, who will be supported by a senior management team.  In order to achieve genuine improvements for children and families, the Agency will have a broader focus than child protection.  Prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic &amp;amp; care interventions are all key to the provision of integrated multidisciplinary services for children and families based on identified need.</p><p>  It is my intention that the new Agency will address the persistent issues which have been raised regarding the standardisation of services, communication, coordination and sharing of risk assessment, management and treatment for many of the children and families with the most complex needs.  At the same time, the Agency will have a role in supporting families - providing less complex, less intrusive and less expensive responses which have a preventive function.  The new Child and Family Support Agency and the wider transformation of children's services represents one of the largest, and most ambitious, areas of public sector of reform embarked upon by this Government.</p></reply>

Some  &euro;439m  has been allocated in 2013 to my Department for these services and programmes.</p><p>  In keeping with these responsibilities for children and young people, my Department is developing a new Children and Young People's Policy Framework which will comprehend the needs and objectives for children and young people throughout their life-course from infancy through to early and middle childhood, adolescence and early adulthood.

The intention is to identify common priorities in areas such as health and well being, education, economic security and poverty, parenting and family support, environment, safety,sports and recreation and media, arts and culture.</p><p>  With regard to funding for youth services,  my Department provides a range of funding schemes, programmes and supports to the youth sector.  Funding of some &euro;53.498m is available in 2013 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.  Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects.

This initiative was announced as part of Budget 2013 and has a funding allocation this year of &euro;2.5 million.  The programme is being co-funded by The Atlantic Philanthropies and is expected to have a total funding allocation of &euro;29.7 million.  The new programme reflects the Programme for Government commitment to adopt an area-based approach to child poverty in co-operation with philanthropic partners, drawing upon best international practice and existing services, to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched and improve the outcomes for children and young people where these are currently significantly poorer than they are for children and young people living elsewhere in the State.</p><p>  The new programme will build on and continue the work of the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme which has also been implemented by my Department with co-funding from The Atlantic Philanthropies.  This earlier programme involved the implementation of a range of evidence based programmes and practices on a pilot basis in three areas of high social and economic disadvantage.  The programmes aimed at improving outcomes for children and young people in relation to literacy, speech and language, health and pro-social behaviour as well as supporting improved parenting skills.  The programmes are currently being evaluated by national and international experts.  The three existing areas of programme interventions, together with at least three additional areas, are expected to participate in the new programme.  In addition, it is my intention to broaden the impact of the programme by, where appropriate, beginning the process of mainstreaming as many as possible of the evidence based programmes which have had positive test outcomes and are cost-effective.  The establishment of my Department's new Child and Family Agency later this year will be important to this process.</p><p>  Applications to participate in the programme were invited from interested not for profit consortia earlier this year.  The closing date for receipt of applications was 31st May and fifty applications were received.  These are currently being reviewed by officials in my Department assisted by members of the cross-Departmental Project Team which is overseeing the process.  When completed, I hope to be in a position to announce successful applicants later this year.</p></reply>

The programme's aims are to provide a broad-based, flexible health promotion / education support and training service to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in out-of-school settings. Its work programme is informed by the knowledge and experience of the partners involved and most particularly by the Health Promotion Unit of the HSE and by the National Youth Council of Ireland which is the representative body for some 50 youth organisations in Ireland.</p><p>  This work is achieved through the development of programmes and interventions specifically for and with youth organisations throughout the country and the provision of training and support for workers and volunteers who implement these programmes. It is covered under the Mindout Mental Health Promotion training and resource pack delivered to youth organisations. The training is based on the resource Mindout which was developed by Health Promotion HSE West and NUI Galway. MindOut is a twelve session mental health programme which takes a positive approach to the promotion of emotional and mental health among young people, looking at the ways they cope ranging from personal coping skills to informal networks of support to professional or voluntary support services. Mindout adopts a universal mental health promotion approach which has strong links with the &ldquo;Support for all&rdquo; element of the recent guidelines on Mental Health Promotion for Schools published by the HSE, the Department of Education and Skills and the National Office for Suicide Prevention. </p><p>  The National Youth Health Programme also offers a Specialist Certificate in Youth Health Promotion. This programme is accredited by NUI Galway and adopts a whole organisational approach to health promotion. It focuses on a holistic model of an individual&rsquo;s health and mental health and reinforces youth work as a valuable setting for mental health promotion. </p><p>  Actions needed to address this issue obviously extend beyond the remit of my Department. The Healthy Ireland policy recently launched by the Dept of Health will be an important vehicle for work in this area.  My own Department is currently leading the preparation of the new Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework and Early Years strategy which will represent a whole of government approach to addressing issues affecting children and young people including their well being.</p></reply>

The development of the Children and Young People's Policy Framework as the overarching framework under which policy and services for children and young people will be developed and implemented in the State, is an important initiative for cross departmental collaboration to secure this objective.  Early childhood care and education programmes, in particular those that are aimed at low income families, are priorities to enhance children's opportunities for social and educational development and to support parents undertaking training and participating in employment. The network of 107 family resource centres that are funded by the Family Support Agency, under the remit of my Department have an important role in this regard. </p><p>  Tackling child poverty is a priority for Government and a goal of the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007- 2016, coordinated by the Department of Social Protection. Children are more likely to be poor if they are living in lone parent households with low labour market participation and dependant on income support. The Departments of Social Protection, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Education and Skills, are working to deliver a range of measures aimed at getting people back to work. My Department is supporting labour activation measures through initiatives such as the School Age Childcare scheme which will provide 6,000 subsidised, after-school places to primary school children of qualifying parents entering employment.</p><p>  My Department works closely with the Department of Social Protection in a 'whole of Government approach' to tackling poverty in the population and is represented on the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare which is examining issues to do with the interactions of the tax and welfare systems so that they provide good incentives for parents to take up and remain in work and thereby contribute to the reduction of poverty and child poverty, in particular. Following a review of the national social target for poverty reduction, which provides a key reference point for Government policies and offers a tangible benchmark against which to measure social and economic progress, the Government agreed to set a new sub-target for the reduction of child poverty.  This is in recognition of the life-long consequences of child poverty and the damaging effects of inter-generational poverty.  The sub-target will take account of the importance of income supports, services and parental access to employment.  The overriding objective for the Government is to increase employment, promote activation, skills training and education.  This will ultimately help to build real and sustainable economic growth and to protect those who are most vulnerable in our society. </p><p>The Minister for Housing &amp;amp; Planning, Jan O Sullivan TD recently published a <i>Homelessness Policy Statement</i> which outlines the Government's aim to end long-term homelessness by the end of 2016. The statement emphasises a housing-led approach which is about accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness. The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing is essential in ensuring sustainable tenancies and ending long-term homelessness. When publishing the statement Minister O'Sullivan announced a set of indicators which will be used to demonstrate the dynamics of homelessness as it is addressed. These indicators will give a clearer picture of homelessness in Ireland and, in quantifying its on-going extent, will support the bringing forward of realistic and practical solutions.    With regard to my own responsibility, my priority, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, is to enhance the role of early intervention and support programmes for the most vulnerable children and their families in the context of the new Child and Family Agency.  </p><p>  In addition, my Department has been given lead responsibility for implementing a new Area-Based Approach to Child Poverty programme during 2013-2016.  This programme was announced as part of Budget 2013 and has a funding allocation this year of &euro;2.5 million.  The programme is being co-funded by The Atlantic Philanthropies and is expected to have a total funding allocation of &euro;29.7 million.  The initiative reflects the Programme for Government commitment to adopt an area-based approach to child poverty in co-operation with philanthropic partners, drawing upon best international practice and existing services, to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched and improve the outcomes for children and young people where these are currently significantly poorer than they are for children and young people living elsewhere in the State.  </p></reply>

These include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification under the programme where a child is developmentally delayed and would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.  Application for these exemptions must be made prior to the child commencing the programme.</p><p>  As I outlined previously, there are no further resources available to my Department to provide additional supports for children who need specialist support in the pre-school setting.

I recently announced a number of measures as part of my response to the distressing events highlighted in the programme.  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, driving the early childhood care and education quality agenda is one of my key objectives.  It is my intention to introduce new qualification requirements for the sector starting in September 2014.  This will be an important new development as, at present, staff working in childcare services other than under the ECCE programme, are not subject to any requirement in respect of qualifications.</p><p>  The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme introduced the first-ever requirement for minimum qualifications for staff working in the childcare sector.  The current requirement under the programme is that the pre-school leader delivering the pre-school provision must hold a qualification in childcare/early education at a minimum of Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ), or an equivalent nationally-recognised qualification or a higher award in the childcare/early education field.  A higher capitation rate is payable to services where all of the pre-school leaders hold a bachelor degree in childhood/early education (minimum of Level 7 on the NFQ) and have three years experience working in the sector, and where all of the pre-school assistants hold a relevant major award in childcare/early education at Level 5 on the NFQ.</p><p>  I have indicated my intention to increase the qualification requirements for all staff working in pre-school services.  The minimum requirement of Level 5 for pre-school leaders delivering the pre-school year will be increased to Level 6.  In addition, all pre-school assistants, and all other staff caring for children in a pre-school service, will be subject to a minimum requirement of Level 5.  This requirement will be effective from September 2014 for new services, and from September 2015 for existing services. </p><p>  Pre-school services are governed by the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No 2) Regulations 2006 as provided in the Child Care Act 1991. Under the Regulations the Health Service Executive has responsibility for the inspection of services and the enforcement of the regulations. Inspection is carried out to monitor compliance with the Regulations thereby ensuring the health, safety and welfare of children and the promotion of their development.   </p><p>As I have outlined in recent weeks, a number of steps are being taken to improve the current inspection system.  These include the introduction of National Quality Standards for pre-school services later this year as part of the inspection process.  In addition, my Department is working with the Pre-School Inspectorate to develop new protocols on regulatory compliance so that there is greater clarity and consistency of approach as to how inspection reports deal with findings of serious non-compliance vis a vis minor breaches and full compliance.    My Department is also undertaking a review of the penalties currently in place for breach of the Child Care (Pre-school) Regulations, as provided for under the Child Care Act 1991.  The review will look at increasing the range and severity of the existing penalties including the actions which can be taken by Inspectors without recourse to court prosecution, as is currently the case.  </p><p>  My Department is currently developing a new Children and Young People's Policy Framework which will set out high level goals for both my own and other Departments for the next five years. The Policy Framework is expected to be published later this year and will build on Our Children - Their Lives, Ireland's first Children's Strategy which was published in 2000. This is relevant to the Early Years Strategy as the Strategy is one of three, more detailed strategies which will be developed under the Framework.</p><p>  The Early Years Strategy, which will be Ireland's first ever national strategy for early years, is under development. It is expected that it will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as child health and well-being, parenting and family support, learning and development, play and recreation and early childhood care and education. The Strategy will further recognise the economic imperative and benefits accruing from targeted investment in early years interventions.  One of the specific issues of policy which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the new Strategy is the future role and regulation of the childminding sector.</p><p>  The results of a public consultation, undertaken as part of the development of the Children and Young People Policy Framework, is currently being analysed and will inform both the Framework and the Early Years Strategy.   I expect the Early Years Strategy to be published before the end of the year. </p><p>  Officials in my Department are continuing to examine the many proposals and suggestions submitted by those concerned by the revelations in the Prime Time broadcast.  These contributions will be considered as part of a comprehensive response to the events highlighted in the programme. </p></reply>

It provides free medicines and medical or surgical appliances to people with specified conditions.  The LTI Scheme arose from a non-statutory scheme, established in 1967, for the free supply of certain products for the treatment of diabetes to persons who did not hold a medical card under the Health Act 1947. The Scheme was also intended to assist those without medical cards who had regular large drug bills from particular conditions.</p><p>  The scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act, 1970,  which has been amended and now reads as follows - &quot;<i>The Health Service Executive</i><i>may make arrangements for the supply without charge of drugs, medicines or medical and surgical appliances, for the time being on the Reimbursement List within the meaning of section 2(1) of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, to persons suffering from a prescribed disease or disability of a permanent or long-term nature.&#8221;</i>   Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the Scheme. There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the Scheme.  The LTI Scheme predates the introduction of the Drug Payment Scheme (DPS), under which no individual or family currently pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The DPS significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p></reply>

It is  proposed to establish the Physiotherapists Registration Board shortly and expressions of interest from interested parties are currently being examined with a view to filling vacancies on the soon to be established Board.</p><p>  All the registration boards and their registers for the remaining designated professions should be established by 2015.</p><p>  While the legislation empowers the Minister for Health to include, if he considers it appropriate and in the public interest to do so, additional health and social care professions in the regulatory system over time, and under specific criteria, I have no plans at present to regulate creative arts therapists. The question of regulating further health and social care professionals may be reviewed post 2015 in the context of progress made at that juncture.</p><p>  The issue of recognition of creative arts therapies in the public health services, the need for such services and the direct employment of creative arts therapists are matters for the Health Service Executive in the first instance.</p></reply>

This funding is being allocated to each HSE Region based on its percentage of population. Both the voluntary sector and the HSE are committed to the best use of the funding in a creative and flexible manner so as to secure as many places as possible for this cohort.  </p><p>  The demand for services for school-leavers continues to grow. The HSE expects that approximately 700 young people who have finished their education or life-skills training will require services in 2013.  Providing the level of services required within the additional funding provided will continue to be a challenge. Work in this area will be progressed largely in line with the HSE guidance document developed in 2012, which led to the successful placement of 99% of RT graduates and 96% of school leavers last year. </p><p>  Information on the final numbers of young people who require training places or day supports is being collated and plans to meet their requirements finalised. Final figures are expected from the HSE shortly, but are likely to exceed last year&rsquo;s total of 700. As soon as plans are completed and approved, a communication process will be agreed with service providers to inform families of the services that will be available from September 2013. </p><p>  In respect of the specific question asked by the Deputy, as it relates to service matters I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Given the lack of emergency aeromedical support (EAS) data in an Irish context and the funding implications, it was decided to run a pilot project using existing state resources. The purpose was to determine the level and type, if any, of dedicated EAS service needed, particularly in light of the requirements of HSE clinical care programmes such as Acute Coronary Syndrome and Stroke.  The review of the pilot EAS service has been completed and is being examined.

This represents a 40% reduction from the corresponding figure of approximately &euro;146 million in 2008 and reflects the ongoing impact of cost containment measures implemented in recent years.</p><p>  Preliminary figures indicate a further reduction, of approximately 3%, in expenditure on statins for 2012.  Further reductions are anticipated for 2013 due to all statins now being off patent and the impact of additional price reductions associated with agreements reached with the pharmaceutical industry in late 2012. </p><p>While the recently published ESRI report <i>Pharmaceutical Prices, Prescribing Practices and Usage of Generics in a Comparative Context,</i> finds that prices for originator in-patent and generic medicines are higher in Ireland compared to other EU Member States, the ongoing programme of reforms introduced by the State to reduce pharmaceutical prices and expenditure will have a significant impact on the cost of medicines in this country.  Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013 and the average cost per reimbursed item is now running at 2001/2002 levels.</p><p>  The HSE's Medicines Management Programme has recently, for the first time, identified 'preferred drugs' for prescribers when prescribing Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) or statin medication for patients. The preferred PPI is Lansoprazole and the preferred statin is Simvastatin. The HSE is asking doctors to prescribe these preferred drugs in order to save money, both for patients who pay for their medication and to deliver savings of an estimated &euro;15 million for the taxpayer.</p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which came into operation on the 24th of June, will further promote price competition, a greater use of generics and deliver lower medicine prices for the taxpayer and for patient.  Under the Act, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is responsible for the assessment for interchangeability of medicines. My Department requested the IMB to prioritise the assessment of medicines which are of the greatest cost and a list of 20 such medicines has been prepared. Atorvastatin products are the first on the list for assessment and it is anticipated that the first   List of Interchangeable Medicines containing groups of atorvastatin products will be published in mid-August. At that stage prices of atorvastatin products will fall by 20% as provided for under the current agreement with generic manufacturers. The HSE will then set a reference price for each group of products resulting in further price reductions for atorvastatin products. It is anticipated that the first reference price will be implemented by November 2013. </p><p>  I am confident that these reforms will result in generic prices in Ireland moving towards European norms over the next year.</p><p>  Statins are one of the most cost-effective drug therapies available and the value for money associated with these drugs will be even greater due to the ongoing price reductions.</p></reply>

The Act explicitly prohibits Female Genital Mutilation along with related offences, which include removing a girl from the State for the purpose of FGM. A defence of custom or ritual in proceedings is not permitted; neither is a defence that the girl/woman or her parents/guardian consented to FGM.  Punishment is up to 14 years imprisonment and/or a fine; for a summary conviction, the penalty is a fine of up to &euro;5,000 and/or imprisonment for up to 12 months or both.</p></reply>

The standards outline what is expected of a provider of services and what a person with a disability, his or her family, and the public can expect to receive from residential care services. They seek to ensure that vulnerable people with disabilities in residential services are safeguarded and protected, and their quality of life is enhanced.</p><p>  While the proposal suggested by the voluntary group referred to by the Deputy was appreciated, it was also acknowledged by the Group that the 'proposal was offered only as a temporary/interim solution until such time as the longer term goal of a permanent inspectorate to inspect residential settings for people with disabilities is put in place on a statutory basis'. As I have already mentioned, the Government is committed to put the standards on a statutory footing, and ensuring that a regulatory system which will allow for a robust registration and inspection of Residential Centres is commenced.</p><p>  The National Standards were formally launched on 14th May, 2013 and work is progressing in the Department on the regulations required to bring the standards into law. These are being developed taking into account the lessons learned from similar regulations for nursing homes. It is anticipated that the new registration and inspection regime will commence on the 1st September this year.</p><p>  It is also important to point out that while the HIQA standards have yet to be put on a statutory footing, it is worth noting that compliance with these standards is already included in the Service Level Arrangements between HSE and service providers in the disability sector.</p></reply>
