    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-28a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013022800039#WRA00800"><p>As the Deputy is aware, earlier this month the liquidation of IBRC was agreed in the Houses of the Oireachtas and the IBRC Promissory Notes were replaced with longer-dated Irish Government Bonds.  As a result of these actions, the issue of any Promissory Note payment in March of this year or any other year is removed.   This Government has taken considerable steps to stabilise and restructure the banking sector.  The Irish authorities had been in discussions with the European Central Bank for some time in relation to the replacement of the IBRC Promissory Notes with more sustainable, longer term debt.</p><p>  The new arrangements go a long way towards addressing the systemic liquidity issue in the Irish banking system and substantially improve the debt position of the State, while materially improving our ability to regain access to the bond markets and exit the Troika programme. </p><p>  The Promissory Notes were replaced with a portfolio of Irish Government bonds comprising: </p><p>- three tranches of &euro;2 bn each maturing after 25, 28 and 30 years; </p><p>- three tranches of &euro;3 bn each maturing after 32, 34 and 36 years; </p><p>- two tranches of &euro;5 bn each maturing after 38 and 40 years.</p><p>  The principal benefits from this arrangement are:</p><p>- The Promissory Notes are gone.  They were exchanged for long term Government Bonds, with an average maturity of 34 to 35 years as opposed to the 7 to 8 year average maturity on the Promissory Notes. </p><p>- The maturity of the bonds have significant benefits from a market perspective as it ensures the liability to repay is beyond most credit investors&rsquo; time horizon.</p><p>- A reduction in the State&rsquo;s General Government deficit of approximately &euro;1 billion (0.6% of GDP) per annum over the coming years, which will bring us closer to attaining our 3% deficit target by 2015.</p><p>- A significant element of the interest payments on the Government bonds, which are held by the Irish Central Bank, will ultimately be returned to the Exchequer in the form of Central Bank dividends.</p><p>- The State will be borrowing &euro;20 billion less cash over the next 10 years due to the cashflow benefit of this arrangement.  Next year the cash flow benefit will be &euro;2.3 billion (excluding initial transaction costs).  </p><p>- The arrangement will lead to a substantial improvement in the State&rsquo;s debt position over time.</p><p>- The housing of all the &lsquo;wind down assets&rsquo; in one entity (NAMA) will result in just one wind-down vehicle.</p><p>  The substantial benefits of this arrangement flow from the exchange of the Promissory Notes for far more efficient financing from the State&rsquo;s perspective.</p><p>  This Government is aware that this solution does not address other challenges in the Irish banking system.  However it was an important step in restoring the health of the Irish banking sector and confidence in the Irish economy.  We have been seeking and will continue to seek a comprehensive solution to the remaining structural and funding issues in our banking sector, in conjunction with our European partners.  We will continue to participate in the development of the ESM and the structuring of the Single Supervisory Mechanism to ensure that Ireland will benefit, on similar terms to other member states, from developments in this regard.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-28a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013022800039#WRA01100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 36 together. 	</p><p>  I have spoken previously about the range of measures the Government has adopted to assist people who are experiencing mortgage difficulty.  These measures include</p><p>- The Personal Insolvency Act which is now in place.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is urgently putting in place the infrastructure to make the provisions of the Act operational shortly.</p><p>- The Minister for Housing and Planning has formally launched the &ldquo;mortgage to rent&rdquo; scheme on a nationwide basis.  This is a social housing response to the problem of mortgage distress.</p><p>- An extensive independent mortgage advice framework has now been put in place by the Minister of Social Protection comprising (i) an enhanced website -  www.keepingyourhome.ie (ii) a Mortgage Arrears information helpline, and (iii) the provision of free independent &lsquo;one-to-one&rsquo; professional financial advice to borrowers when considering a long term forbearance/resolution offer from their lender.  The list of accountants providing this service is located on the www.keepingyourhome.ie website.  </p><p>  In addition, the Central Bank has over the past year had intensive engagement with all regulated mortgage lenders on the development of mortgage arrears resolution strategies. The Central Bank has informed me that in 2013, the Bank is focusing on the implementation of MARS by lenders and is specifically looking at the operational capability of lenders.   </p><p>  The Central Bank has led on this issue and I support the Bank in this leadership role as it continues to actively engage with banks on this process, in particular, now that the process has reached implementation and roll out phase.  </p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Governor of the Central Bank recently stated that the banks are now much better staffed and organised to deal with mortgage arrears and that the Central Bank, as regulator, will now be setting targets for the effectiveness of achieving lasting solutions.  However, it will need to be demonstrated to the Central Bank that restructures put in place by all the mortgage lenders will be durable over the medium to longer term.  I expect the lenders, many of which now have also had significant leadership change, to respond to the challenge made by the Governor and to work with the Central Bank in the roll out of measures to assist their customers who are experiencing genuine and real mortgage distress.  Resolving unsustainable debt is in the best interests of both individuals and the wider economy.  This now needs to be progressed quickly, and the recent statement of the AIB CEO that his bank is dealing with 2,000 distressed mortgages a month, and will address the bulk of the whole arrears book by the end of the year, is welcome.  </p><p>  The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears also remains a very important framework governing the relationship between mortgage borrowers and mortgage lenders and provides a number of important protections for a co-operating borrower who is in arrears or who is at risk of going into arrears on the mortgage secured on a primary home.  However, the Central Bank is currently conducting a review of the Code to take account of recent developments in the mortgage arrears landscape, the review will ensure that the Code continues to provide these protections and also facilitates effective communication and engagement regarding situations of mortgage difficulty.</p><p>  With regard to the covered institutions, as Minister for Finance I must ensure that the bank is run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the bank as an asset to the State, as per the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF.  Relationship Frameworks have been put in place to govern the relationship between me, as Minister, and the banks in which I have a shareholding interest.  The Relationship Frameworks provide that the Boards and management of the covered banks have the responsibility for the operation and day to day decision making of the banks.  This includes decisions they make on individual loans, as well as decisions on the management and resolution of loans in arrears, all of which are commercial matters for the individual banks.</p><p>  Nevertheless, I can assure the Deputy that from an overall policy and financial stability perspective, my Department and the Central Bank are prioritising the mortgage arrears problem.  The Government is proceeding on the basis of the recommendations of the &lsquo;Keane Report&rsquo; committed to building on the progress made we are further intensifying its efforts to address the mortgage arrears problem and in that context is.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-28a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013022800039#WRA01300"><p>As I have stated many times before, the primary duty and responsibility of the public interest directors as well as all the other directors is to ensure that the institution on whose board they serve is run properly and appropriately.  They serve on many Bank committees as well as the Boards themselves and their breath of experience brings a deeper and wider knowledge base and understanding to all the Banks which they serve. </p><p>  Our stated policy is get the Banks fully functioning and run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the banks as an asset to the State.  The public interest directors have an essential role to play in assisting our aims.</p><p>  Of course, the legal position is that any director appointed to the board of the covered institutions whether under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008 or otherwise is subject to the requirements of company law in relation to the discharge of their responsibilities as a company director.  As such, the director is legally bound to act in what he or she believes are the interests of the separate legal entity that is the institution itself. These are the directors so called fiduciary responsibilities.  To address the scope for actual and perceived conflicts between the fiduciary duties of the directors of financial institutions under company law and the wider public interest in circumstances where those institutions have received huge financial support from the State, legal clarity, not just to the role of the public interest director but to that of the entire boards of those institutions, was provided under Section 48 of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010.  It provides that the overriding duty of directors of the covered institutions relates to the public interest as set out in the Act. </p><p>  This recognises the fundamental role that all public interest directors serve.	</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-28a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013022800040#WRB00400"><p>Normal Companies Acts&rsquo; priorities must apply throughout this liquidation process.  This means that the proceeds from the disposal of IBRC&rsquo;s assets will be used to repay creditors in accordance with these priorities, and consequently preferred creditors will be paid first and then the secured debt which NAMA will have purchased from the Central Bank will be paid.  If there are proceeds available after repayment in full of this debt, these proceeds will be applied to remaining unsecured creditors.   Amounts owing by IBRC to contractors, trade creditors and other service providers are unsecured debts.  It is not yet clear whether IBRC will have sufficient assets to repay unsecured creditors in whole or in part.  The Special Liquidators have the power to come to arrangements with any creditor that is considered crucial to maintaining value or vital in providing services for the day-to-day operations of IBRC.  Unless covered by the ELG scheme, bonds, guarantees or letters of credit rank equally with debts to contractors and other service providers as unsecured debt. Any creditors who have queries in relation to their status should contact the Special Liquidators.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-28a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013022800040#WRB00700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 49 together.</p><p>  While I note the launch of an IBF protocol on unsecured debt, this was solely an initiative of the IBF and neither I nor my Department had an involvement in the initiative.</p><p>  Initiatives such as the IBF protocol can assist in encouraging and facilitating creditors and debtors to engage with one another in an open, constructive manner to address debt arrears and genuine debt difficulty. This can resolve positions of over indebtedness in a way that is as fair as possible to both the debtor and creditors and could be a beneficial voluntary addition to the broader debt resolution framework.</p><p>  The Deputy is aware of the mortgage arrears problem and he will also appreciate that the credit union sector is also under financial stress and continues to face significant business challenges. The level of arrears in the credit union sector is also significant. Average credit union sector arrears were reported at 20.1% as at 31 December 2012. The Central Bank has informed me that it believes that changes in the operating environment, including the personal insolvency regime, could have a significant impact on credit unions. </p><p>  In view of this, the Central Bank has written to credit unions to ensure that they fully assess a member&rsquo;s ability to service all debts before advancing any new credit or top up credit facilities, especially where the borrower is in arrears on their mortgage or is in a non-permanent forbearance arrangement.  Additionally the Central Bank has also invited banking and credit union representatives to a meeting next week to discuss the creation of a workable burden sharing agreement between secured and unsecured lenders.</p><p>  It is important, however, to point out that any voluntary initiative or bilateral approach can only be successful if all parties are in agreement.  Where this does not arise, it is necessary to have an effective statutory insolvency process.  Therefore voluntary initiatives, while welcome, do not remove the need for the insolvency reforms as provided for in the recent Personal Insolvency Act.  As the Deputy is aware, under the legislation, insolvent debtors can, through the personal insolvency practitioner, formally make a Debt Settlement Arrangement or a Personal Insolvency Arrangement proposal to their creditors, which may include credit unions and mortgage lenders as appropriate.  These arrangements represent an efficient framework whereby all the relevant creditors can engage with and consider a proposal from the debtor to deal with their insolvent circumstances short of the full judicial bankruptcy process.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-28a.29.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013022800040#WRB00900"><p>I am advised by NAMA that, although its exposure to residential property in Ireland is limited, it has sought to instigate some market activity through the introduction of a deferred payment initiative, which offers downside price protection for a period of up to five years to buyers.  The initiative, which is referred to as the 80/20 Deferred Payment Initiative, was formally launched in October, after an earlier pilot scheme, in respect of an initial 295 houses in 12 counties nationally. NAMA advises that to date sales have been agreed on 115 of these properties with an aggregate value in excess of &euro;20 million.  In the past week the NAMA Chairman in a public address stated that, based on the interest to date, NAMA may shortly announce a further increase in the number of properties included in the initiative.  NAMA has previously indicated that the initiative will be extended on a phased basis up to a maximum of 750 properties.   Under the initiative, home buyers pay 80% of the property&rsquo;s value upfront.  The remaining amount, up to 20% of the property&rsquo;s value, will be paid in five years by the mortgage provider on behalf of the home buyer directly to NAMA.  This will be calculated based on an independent assessment of the property&rsquo;s value at that time. Example scenarios are set out on NAMA&rsquo;s website, http://www.nama.ie/about-our-work/deferred-payment-initiative/.  </p><p>  As the initiative offers the buyer protection from the risk of further house price declines for the first five years of the mortgage, it is not possible at this stage to estimate the potential loss, if any, to NAMA arising from this initiative.  However, NAMA advises that any potential future loss is more than offset by the generation of transactions, and therefore the monetisation of NAMA residential property, under the initiative that might not otherwise take place in today&rsquo;s market place and by the wider benefit for the property market and the economy from increased transitional activity in the market.  NAMA considers that part of its objective is to contribute in a tangible way to sustainable recovery in the Irish property market and by extension the wider Irish economy.</p></reply>

The Central Bank made its decision on required recapitalisation based on loan-loss projections along with further calculations concerning the prospective income, expenditure, and deleveraging plans of the banks as outlined in the 2011 Financial Measures Programme (FMP) Report. </p><p>  In order to arrive at a stressed loan-loss estimate that was fully credible to the international markets, the Central Bank engaged BlackRock Solutions, a specialist in analysing potential loan losses under stressed conditions. However I must again reiterate that the stress test scenarios were designed to represent extreme albeit plausible events, but they were not forecasts. </p><p>  The Central Bank is responsible for monitoring such losses and capital at the banks and tracking their progress against PCAR 2011. I understand that they are due to publish such a report tracking this in the near future, which should provide answers to the type of question you have posed.</p></reply>

As has been previously advised to the House, NAMA seeks to ensure that income generated by assets securing NAMA loans is applied towards repaying a debtor&rsquo;s indebtedness to NAMA. In certain circumstances, debtors are allowed to retain a portion of asset income in lieu of overheads which include staff costs.  NAMA also seeks to obtain charges over a debtor&rsquo;s unencumbered assets and to realise such assets so as to further reduce indebtedness.    Clearly, however, NAMA has no control over the application of income generated by assets securing loans which have been advanced to debtors by other financial institutions.  </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that where the evidence available to NAMA is that a debtor has failed, as part of a sworn statement of affairs, to disclose all his assets, he will be faced with very serious consequences. NAMA has made it clear that it will not work with debtors who fail to co-operate fully and openly with it. NAMA will also pursue through the courts debtors who fail to co-operate with it in terms of agreeing to the reversal of asset transfers or to the granting of legal charges over unencumbered assets.</p></reply>

For example, the liquidator is in the process of overseeing a valuation and sales process for the assets of IBRC, while the final payments made under the ELG Scheme have not yet been determined.</p><p>Nevertheless, as referred to by the Deputy, simulations ran by my Department estimate that the General Government deficit will improve by approximately &#8364;1 billion per annum over the coming years, which will bring us &#8364;1 billion closer to attaining our 3% deficit target by 2015. However, this has to be seen in the light of the estimated General Government deficits of &#8364;8.9bn and &#8364;5.3bn in 2014 and 2015 respectively, as per <i>Budget 2013</i>  .</p><p>  While this agreement is a significant step forward in restoring sustainability to our public finances, this Government is well aware that there remains a considerable gap between what we get in revenue and what we spend. This situation is not sustainable over the longer term. In addition to the requirements to bring our deficit to under 3% of GDP by 2015 as per the EDP, it makes sense that we bring balance back to the public finances and stabilise and reduce our debt burden.  </p><p>  As we are only two months into the year, I will not be drawn into speculation on the composition of the next Budget and the impact that this deal will have on it.  There are a lot of other moving parts to be considered such as economic growth, tax take and expenditure performance.  All of the above, including the impact of the promissory note deal, will form the basis of Government decisions regarding the Budget.</p></reply>

One of the proposals is on the monitoring and assessment of draft budgetary plans and on ensuring the correction of excessive deficits. The other is on the strengthening of economic and budgetary surveillance and sets out explicit rules for enhanced surveillance of countries experiencing or threatened with financial difficulties.<b><font color="#0000FF"> </font></b>The agreement reached on February 20th will have to be approved by member countries and the European Parliament. The &#8220;two-pack&#8221; will be a significant and welcome enhancement of the euro area&#8217;s economic governance regime. It is, to a great extent, a natural extension of the measures contained in the &#8216;six-pack&#8217; which was introduced on 13 December, 2011. The &#8216;six-pack&#8217; - comprising five regulations and one directive - was designed to reform and strengthen fiscal surveillance under the <i>Stability and Growth Pact</i>   and to introduce new macroeconomic surveillance. </p><p>  The &#8216;two-pack&#8217;, which will be applicable to euro area member countries only, has several direct implications for the existing budgetary process.  The key ones are: Member States will be required to produce a medium-term fiscal plan by the end of April each year; the draft budget for central government and the main parameters of the draft budgets for all the other sub-sectors of the general government must be published by the 15th of October each year; both the medium-term fiscal plan and the draft budget must be based on independent macroeconomic forecasts which are defined as forecasts produced or endorsed by independent bodies; and the budget for the central government must be adopted or fixed upon and published by the 31st of December each year.</p><p>  The potential impact of these provisions on the budgetary timeline and the budgetary process are being considered and discussed by my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Other relevant Departments, such as the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government in relation to the local government sub-sector of general government, are also being consulted.  When this process is completed in the near future, the Minister for Public Expenditure and I will be bring a Memorandum to Government setting out our proposals to meet the requirements I set out above. </p><p>  In the context of the Medium-Term Fiscal Plan published in November 2012, reference was made to the two-pack proposals.  The key point made in that publication, which still stands, is that much of the existing budgetary process, which normally is completed in the first week of December, will have to be finalised much earlier.</p></reply>

I would accept his view that having only three main banks lending to the SME sector is not an ideal situation. The Government has taken a number of actions, particularly where SMEs have been refused credit, to improve the situation in relation to credit availability to SMEs.    The Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee scheme addresses the situation where the SME is outside the risk appetite of the banks. This can arise because the SME&rsquo;s lack of collateral or the banks&rsquo; lack of understanding of the business model, the market, the sector or the technology. The three main SME lenders are all participating in the Guarantee scheme. </p><p>  The Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme will provide loans of up to &euro;25k to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people, who have commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks. </p><p>  The funds, recently announced by the NPRF which will make &euro;850m available for investment in Irish SME sector, should also be of assistance. In addition, the NPRF is also currently reviewing additional SME fund opportunities that would complement these funds, with the objective that the eventual suite of funds would have the capacity to invest across the full spectrum of SME financing needs.</p><p>  Ultimately, it is the many actions which this Government is taking to normalise the Irish banking sector such as the cessation of the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee Scheme together with the recovery of the economy which will attract new participants to lend in the SME sector. </p></reply>

Civil servants who hold positions which are &ldquo;designated positions&rdquo; for the purposes of the Ethics Acts are prohibited, within twelve months of resigning or retiring from the service, from accepting an offer of appointment from an employer outside the Civil Service or an engagement in a particular consultancy project, without first obtaining approval, from the Outside Appointments Board  in the case of officers at and above Assistant Secretary level or the appropriate Secretary-General/Head of Office otherwise. This would apply where the nature and terms of such appointment or engagement could lead to a conflict of interest.  </p><p>  Applications are considered by the Outside Appointments Board on the basis of determining whether or not a clear conflict of interest exists.  The Board can either approve the take-up of an appointment, the acceptance of an engagement, attach conditions or recommend against the appointment.  The composition, operation and reporting arrangements for the Board are set out in section 21 of the Code. </p><p>  Officers must also continue to observe the restrictions imposed by the Official Secrets Act 1963. Departments and Offices are required under the Code to monitor the acceptance of outside appointments by civil servants and former civil servants.  </p><p>  I understand that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has made significant progress in developing proposals for the regulation of lobbying in relation to the commitment included in the Programme for Government referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  The consultation process undertaken on this commitment was based on the OECD Principles for Transparency and Integrity in lobbying which recommend that it may be necessary to impose a &lsquo;cooling-off&rsquo; period that temporarily restricts former public officials from lobbying their past organisations. The proposals in this area - which draw on the Outside Appointments Board model applying to senior civil servants - will be published following consideration by Government as part of the General Scheme of a Regulation of Lobbying Bill. </p><p>  The relevant OECD principles also highlight the requirement for countries to consider establishing restrictions for public officials leaving office to address other potential conflict of interest situations that could arise.  It is planned that these other elements of the Programme for Government commitment which also arise from the recommendations contained in the final report of the Mahon Tribunal will be addressed through the proposed reform of the legislative framework for ethics which is currently underway.         </p><p>  I am informed by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) that its capacity to successfully perform its commercial market-facing functions is critically dependent on its ability to attract employees with specialist skills from the private sector, including at middle and senior management level.  In considering this issue it is important not to compromise the NTMA&rsquo;s ability to attract such employees. Mobility with the private sector is a crucial component of the NTMA business model. Indeed, NTMA staff assigned to NAMA is recruited on the basis of specified purpose contracts which will cease when NAMA no longer requires their particular function. </p><p>  NTMA employees have notice periods of one or three months and 6 months in the case of the Chief Executive.  All NTMA employees are subject to section 14 of the National Treasury Management Agency Act, 1990 which prohibits an employee from disclosing any information obtained while carrying out their duties as employees of the NTMA. NTMA employees are also subject to the Official Secrets Act. Contravention of the NTMA Act and the Official Secrets Act is a criminal offence and the prohibition on disclosing confidential information applies indefinitely and extends to former employees.</p><p>  I understand the NTMA Chief Executive is currently reviewing NTMA policy in this area.</p></reply>

At that time, GDP was forecast to grow by 1.5 per cent in real terms this year, with growth of 2.5 per cent projected for next year.  As the Deputy will be aware, the fiscal projections outlined in Budget 2013 point to a steady improvement in the General Government deficit over the coming years.  Annual deficit limits, as set by the ECOFIN Council in December 2010 will be achieved and the deficit is projected to be below 3 per cent of GDP by 2015.  The Budgetary projections assumed that the debt-to-GDP ratio would peak this year and fall from next year.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s focus is on stabilising the General Government debt to GDP ratio and beginning the process of reducing it to a lower, safer level over time.

With that in mind, I am unsure as to the premise of the Deputies&#8217; questions which seems to imply that Ireland has an &#8216;effective rate&#8217; that is significantly lower than our 12.5% rate.</p><p>  I would reiterate that companies in Ireland pay the standard 12.5% rate on their profits which are generated in Ireland.  A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits and profits from certain petroleum, mining or land dealing activities.</p><p>  Unlike some other countries who have a high headline rate of corporation tax but also have a significant number of reliefs, the approach in Ireland is transparent.  Our policy in relation to the corporation tax rate in Ireland is clear: we have a relatively low headline rate of corporation tax which is applied to a broad base.  There are only a small number of targeted incentives in Ireland.  Such reliefs include, for example, the R&amp;D tax credit and the 3 year exemption from corporation tax for start-up companies.  These few reliefs are tightly focussed: firstly on the creation of additional employment as is consistent with current Government policy, and secondly on areas of innovation with a view to generating high value-added economic activity in the country.</p><p>  Specifically in relation to the Eurostat figure referred to in the Deputies&#8217; questions, I understand that this figure is based on national accounts data and the report itself highlights that the tax base derived from national accounts data does not correspond to the actual or legal tax base used in computing tax liabilities.</p><p>  In answer to previous Parliamentary Questions on this subject, I referred to an estimate from a report produced by the World Bank and PricewaterhouseCoopers which put the effective rate in Ireland at 11.9% (<i>Paying Taxes, 2013</i>).  This comparative report looked at 183 countries and calculated the effective rate based on the tax obligations of a standardised company operating in each country, using standard assumptions regarding exemptions, deductions and allowances.  I also referred to a study by the European Commission (<i>Taxation Trends in the EU 2011</i>  ), which indicates Ireland has an effective corporate tax rate which is close to or indeed higher than the statutory 12.5% rate (this is likely because of the 25% rate that applies generally to non-trading income).</p><p>  I have been clear that my Department does not take ownership of these reports, but rather have quoted them to give the Deputy an example of the differences that exist in comparative studies on effective tax rates, depending on how the rate is calculated or who carries out the calculation.  Given the absence of an agreed definition and the fact that certain of the estimates appear to show Ireland as having an effective rate of tax even higher than the headline rate of 12.5% - it is not possible to provide projections on what a minimum &#8216;effective rate&#8217; would yield.</p></reply>

NAMA advises that, to ensure that debtors repay their debt to their full capacity, it requires, inter alia, that they provide security over unencumbered assets not previously pledged as loan security, where such assets exist, and the reversal of asset transfers to relatives and others, where they have occurred.</p><p>  NAMA advises that, in this way, since inception to date it has obtained charges over additional security with an aggregate value of approximately &euro;642 million, and that it is in the process of taking security over further assets identified in the course of its intensive engagements with debtors.  In the past week, the NAMA Chairman publicly stated that the Agency expects, after all negotiations have completed, to obtain about &euro;750 million by taking charges over previously unencumbered assets and by reversing assets transfers by certain debtors.   NAMA advises that the realised proceeds from these sources will be used to pay down debts owed to the taxpayer.  These assets have been identified in a number of ways, including through the valuation and business review process and through searches of assets undeclared by debtors by NAMA&rsquo;s dedicated asset search team.</p><p>  As part of the business plan process, a sworn statement of affairs was requested from personal debtors and guarantors, including details of any unencumbered assets which might be available to support repayment capacity and of any transfers of assets in recent years by debtors to relatives and associates.  In completing that statement of affairs, debtors were reminded that the provision of false or inaccurate information to NAMA is a criminal offence, under Section 7 of the NAMA Act.</p><p>  As previously advised to this House, NAMA has referred two formal complaints to the Garda Bureau of Fraud investigation arising from a possible failure by debtors to fully disclose their assets and liabilities in their statement of affairs to the Agency.  NAMA has also initiated cases in the Irish and English High Courts and in the US Courts for the reversal of asset transfers, including residential property, shares and other assets.  &euro;750 million in additional security represents significant further protection for the Irish taxpayer and underlines the determination with which NAMA has approached this area of its work.</p></reply>

In designing the LPT the Thornhill Group acknowledged that in current circumstances an additional case should be made to target assistance on owner occupiers suffering severe financial stress as a result of housing mortgage commitments undertaken during the housing boom period, aggravated in some cases by reductions in income. The Group recommended increased deferral thresholds in cases where the mortgage was taken out between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2008. </p><p>  The Government accepted the Thornhill Group&rsquo;s recommendation but decided not to limit the increased thresholds to those who purchased properties during a particular time period.  Therefore, an increased income threshold applies in the case of properties occupied as a sole or main residence and subject to a mortgage.  In such cases, the gross income thresholds may be increased by 80% of the mortgage interest payments.  A deferral option in qualifying cases in this regard will apply until the end of 2017 and will assist individuals currently in mortgage distress. Where a liable person no longer satisfies the necessary conditions, amounts deferred prior to the date on which eligibility ceased may continue to be deferred. Interest of 4% per annum will apply to any amounts deferred. Liable persons may also qualify for a 50% deferral of local property tax where gross income does not exceed &euro;10,000 over the increased deferral thresholds.</p><p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2013 provides that a person who has entered into an insolvency arrangement &ndash; i.e. a Debt Settlement Arrangement or a Personal Insolvency Arrangement under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 &ndash; may qualify for a deferral of the LPT that falls due for payment by that person during the period for which the insolvency arrangement is in effect where a valid claim is made to the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>  Subject to the enactment of the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2013 further new measures will provide for the possibility of a deferral for liable persons who cannot without excessive hardship pay local property tax when it becomes payable, as a consequence of a significant and unexpected financial loss or expense (subject to the application for a deferral from the liable person to the Revenue Commissioners, in line with Revenue guidelines to be published, and notification from the Revenue that a deferral is allowed).</p><p>  In relation to consumer spending, the main parameters of the Government&rsquo;s multi-year fiscal plan have been set out in broad terms since Stability Programme Update (SPU) 2011, published in April of that year, just after the Government came into office.  Budget 2013 then set out the quantum to be raised from an LPT on the revenue side.

Eight new Floating Rate Treasury Bonds have been issued to discharge the Promissory Notes liability consisting of: a 25 year bond of &euro;2bn maturing in 2038 with an interest rate of 6-month Euribor plus a margin of 2.50%; a 28 year bond of &euro;2bn maturing in 2041 with an interest rate of 6-month Euribor plus a margin of 2.53%; a 30 year bond of &euro;2bn maturing in 2043 with an interest rate of 6-month Euribor plus a margin of 2.57%; a 32 year bond of &euro;3bn maturing in 2045 with an interest rate of 6-month Euribor plus a margin of 2.60%; a 34 year bond of &euro;3bn maturing in 2047 with an interest rate  of 6-month Euribor plus a margin of 2.62%; a 36 year bond of &euro;3bn maturing in 2049 with an interest rate of 6-month Euribor plus a margin of 2.65%; a 38 year bond of &euro;5bn maturing in 2051 with an interest rate of 6-month Euribor plus a margin of 2.67%; and a 40 year bond of &euro;5bn maturing in 2053 with an interest rate of 6-month Euribor plus a margin of 2.68%.  The bonds will pay interest every six months (June and December).</p><p>  The Central Bank of Ireland will sell the bonds but only where such a sale is not disruptive to financial stability. The Central Bank has undertaken that a minimum of bonds will be sold in accordance with the following schedule: &euro;0.5bn by the end of 2014, &euro;0.5bn per annum from 2015 to 2018, &euro;1bn per annum from 2019 to 2023 and &euro;2bn per annum from 2024 onwards.</p><p>  Any hypothetical acceleration in the bond sale schedule could potentially impact to some extent on sovereign borrowing costs and the pass-through to the real economy, if any, could occur through the impact on the interest rate conditions faced by households and firms. The impact on the economy would also depend on the interest rate environment and liquidity conditions (globally and nationally) which prevail at the time of the sale of the bonds, which are impossible to predict over the very long term.</p></reply>

This will, in turn, allow for the continued creation of jobs and for the improvement of living standards for the people of Ireland.    However, an essential condition for the resumption of balanced economic growth is sustainable public finances. International research has shown that elevated levels of public debt are harmful for growth prospects and ultimately for employment. As such, the Government is committed to cutting the deficit, stabilising our debt level and putting it on a downward path. Considerable progress is being made in this regard.</p><p>  I am conscious, however, that consolidation will have a short-run impact on the economy, although I do not accept that the impact is as large as some have suggested. Ireland is a small, open economy with imports accounting for over three quarters of GDP. As a result, a considerable amount of consolidation leaks out through a reduction in these imports. For this, and other reasons, the fiscal multiplier in Ireland tends to be somewhat lower than in many other European countries.</p><p>  The Government has continually stressed that while further consolidation is imperative for this country&rsquo;s future, there is also a need to ensure that such measures seek to minimise the impact on the economy and the labour market. With this in mind, Budget 2013 - like its predecessor - was framed in such a way as to make it as jobs-friendly as possible and a number of measures were introduced to assist in this regard, including several initiatives designed to lend support to Ireland&rsquo;s job-rich SMEs.</p><p>  It should be noted that Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to carrying out the necessary structural reforms has had clearly visible confidence effects in the financial markets - as evident in the decrease in bond yields in recent months.</p></reply>

As a result the first &euro;100,000 of any claim from these depositors is covered under the DGS.  The bond itself is not covered by the ELG scheme as it predates that scheme.  </p><p>  I understand that the total amount of Credit Unions' investment in the bond is of the order of &euro;15 million and that 16 credit unions may be affected.  As part of their regulatory requirements, credit unions are required to maintain realised reserves for the purpose of absorbing unexpected losses, including from unguaranteed losses.  This should be the first line of defence in such circumstances.  Officials from my Department have met with the Irish League of Credit Unions on this matter and the credit unions affected have been advised to deal with the Special Liquidator.  </p><p>  The Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank of Ireland is the independent regulator for credit unions.  The Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members.  It is a matter for the Registrar to engage with the credit unions affected in that context.</p></reply>

The conditionality in these documents is subject to continuing assessment by the Irish Authorities and the EU, IMF, ECB (the Troika) to ensure the broad programme objectives are met. Such assessment is undertaken at the quarterly reviews. These reviews include discussions where programme commitments are updated and agreed after every mission.   The most recent Programme Documents, dated November 2012, had a commitment to publish a budget in December 2012 and to achieve a specified level of consolidation. In addition, the Programme Documents, dated November 2012, have a commitment to specify as far as possible the tax and spending measures for the 2014&ndash;15 consolidation. These commitments were met with the publication of Budget 2013. The Programme Documents referred to are available on the department&rsquo;s website. In relation to Budget 2014, the MoU does not contain explicit requirements.  However, the EU Council Recommendation on our excessive deficit, dated 7 December 2010, provides for the reduction of  our General Government Deficit to 5.1% in 2014 and to below 3% in 2015 and this requirement is referenced in the EU Council Implementing Decision on Ireland&rsquo;s Programme of Financial Support also dated 7 December 2010. As is always the case, I will not be drawn into speculation on the composition of Budget 2014.  Separately our EU membership requires us to bring our General Government deficit below 3% of GDP by 2015. </p><p>  In relation to the backstop measures, both the IMF and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) can provide precautionary financial assistance. </p><p>  The ESM Treaty provides, in Article 14, that the Board of Governors may decide to grant precautionary financial assistance in the form of a precautionary conditioned credit line (PCCL) or in the form of an enhanced conditions credit line (ECCL).  The Treaty also provides for the conditionality, terms and conditions to be attached to such assistance. Further information in relation to these instruments is available on the ESM website at .</p><p>  The IMF has a number of precautionary or standby type facilities including Flexible Credit Line (FCL), the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL), the Extended Funding Facility (EFF) and the Stand By Arrangement (SBA).   These different instruments are designed to address different sets of circumstances, and the terms and conditions attaching to them are structured accordingly. Further information on these instruments is available on the IMF website at . </p><p>  Initial discussions on exit options were held during the most recent mission (January 29th to February 7th) and provided some further clarity on the possible options that might be available.  Ireland will be the first country to exit an EU/IMF programme of this type.  It was agreed that these discussions should continue before the next mission, with a view to a more meaningful engagement on that mission. All relevant options will be considered in the light of what is appropriate for Ireland, including the terms and conditions attaching to them. Evidently this will require further consideration and no decisions have been taken to date.</p></reply>

The most recent report by the Credit Reviewer shows that the Credit Review Office upheld the credit appeal in 118 cases or 55.9% of cases decided. The upheld appeals have resulted in &euro;13M credit being made available to SMEs and farms, protecting 1,102 jobs. This shows that there is a strong prospect of success for SMEs going to the Credit Review Office and I would strongly encourage SMEs refused credit to seek a review by the Office. I find it difficult to understand why SMEs who are at risk of going out of business are not willing to seek a review of a refusal of credit.    As a first step in implementing the recommendations of the assessment of the Credit Review Office published last year, I sanctioned an increase in the numbers on the Credit Review Panel in order to facilitate faster processing of decisions. </p><p>  My officials are currently looking at how to implement the other appropriate changes to the Credit Review Office regime and at the liaison needed with other stakeholders in the process. This issue has been discussed at the SME State Bodies Group and will be discussed with the SME Funding Consultation Committee. The Credit Reviewer also said in his most recent report that he accepts the proposals in the assessment and that his team is working with stakeholders to implement these proposals where possible. 	</p></reply>

A Poverty Impact Assessment is connected with the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) process.  There was no requirement to carry out a RIA for the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 or the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2013 as the guidelines as set out in section 3.4 of the Cabinet Handbook were followed, including a clear indication of the effect of the tax on persons experiencing or at risk of poverty or social exclusion.  The Memorandum for Government on the Finance (Local Property Tax) Bill 2012 (as it was at the time) indicated that these issues were taken account of as part of the deliberative process, including the considerations of the expert group chaired by Dr Don Thornhill which considered the design of a property tax (the &ldquo;Thornhill Group&rdquo;).  That group commissioned the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) to conduct an analysis of the effect of a property tax, and the group had regard to the ESRI&rsquo;s analysis in recommending the income limits for deferrals of the tax.  The report of the Thornhill Group recommended deferral measures for groups at risk of poverty, and these recommendations were accepted by the Government.</p><p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2013 contains other measures to assist those who have a real and material inability to pay the LPT, including deferral measures for liable persons in a personal insolvency arrangement and a provision to allow Revenue to grant a full or partial deferral in circumstances where a person suffers both an unexpected and unavoidable significant financial loss or expense, as a result of which he or she is unable to pay the LPT without causing excessive financial hardship.	</p></reply>

It was not approved at that time as the child&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship was not demonstrated.  To do this, her mother is required under Section 6A of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, (the Act) to have three years lawful residence in the State within a four year period immediately preceding her daughter&rsquo;s date of birth.  The proofs accepted are determined by the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department with responsibility for citizenship matters.  At the time of application, the submitted evidence demonstrating reckonable residence fell short of the statutory requirement.  However, one element of the evidence provided was a letter from the Department of Justice and Equality, which was the subject of a Supreme Court hearing in a separate but similar case.</p><p>  The Supreme Court has very recently ruled on this issue and has now decided that the period of reckonable residence should be regarded as commencing from the date of that letter.  A preliminary examination of this application suggests that the applicant has an additional period of reckonable residence which would allow her to qualify for citizenship and receive a passport.  As the Supreme Court decision has only recently been received, my Department is currently in contact with the Department of Justice and Equality to review and revise its practices in this area.  In the interim my Department will be in contact with the applicant with a view to finalising the application and issuing a passport at the earliest opportunity.</p></reply>

The Government decided however that, while the NPPR will be collected in 2013, when a half-year LPT will also apply, it should be discontinued thereafter.  Accordingly, it will not apply as a supplemental tax.  There is no exemption from the LPT for those who are liable for the NPPR.   As set out in the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, liability to pay the NPPR is determined on the basis of ownership of the property in question on the "liability date" which is 31 March for 2013.  The LPT does not come into effect until 1 July 2013. The Government decided to extend the NPPR into 2013 to ensure as smooth a transition as possible for local authorities, pending the introduction of the full LPT.</p><p>  Residential properties rented by landlords will be subject to Local Property Tax from 1 July 2013, with the owners of the property &ndash; in those cases, the landlord &ndash; being the liable person for payment of the tax.  The Thornhill Group, the inter-departmental group chaired by Dr Don Thornhill, established to consider the structures and modalities of a property tax, recommended that owners, and not occupiers, be the liable persons for the Local Property Tax.  This was also the view of the 2009 Commission on Taxation.  Given that some rental properties have high tenant turnover, which would present significant difficulties in determining liability and collecting taxes, as well as increasing the cost of collecting the tax, the Government accepted this recommendation.  Occupier liability may also give rise to perceptions of unfairness if the occupier on the valuation date (i.e. the date at which occupation of the property is deemed by law to create the tax liability) is no longer the occupier on the date at which payment of the tax becomes due.</p><p>  The Local Property Tax is not an allowable deduction from rental profit for tax purposes.  This is the same treatment which applied to the Household Charge and the NPPR Charge.  It is, however, proposed to phase in deductibility of the Local Property Tax.</p></reply>

The chargeable value is defined in the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 and means the price that the unencumbered fee simple of a residential property might be expected to fetch on a sale on the open market were that property to be sold on the valuation date of 1 May 2013, in a manner that would secure the best possible price for the property.

The guidance will also draw property owners&rsquo; attention to the publicly available property price register produced by the Property Services Regulatory Authority which provides an actual sales price for all properties sold in the State since January 2010.  As I have previously advised the House, where the Revenue guidance is used in an honest manner, the property valuation made by a property owner will not be challenged by Revenue in accordance with its normal Customer Service Charter.</p></reply>

The Deputy is also aware that NAMA&rsquo;s mandate to achieve the best possible return for the taxpayer from the management and sale of its acquired bank assets and that the NAMA Board has a mandate to independently frame its decisions in this context.</p></reply>

Any repayment on a used vehicle is confined to the residual VRT that is remaining in the vehicle at the time of purchase and which had not already been repaid to a previous beneficiary.  The calculation of the amount of residual VRT is based on the current market price, age, mileage and condition of the vehicle.  Where a vehicle has obtained full relief or the prescribed VRT repayment limits have been reached and it is subsequently purchased (as a used vehicle) by another applicant under the scheme, it may still qualify for repayment of excise duty on fuel and for motor tax exemption.</p></reply>

This means that a person who provides a coach tour service does not register for VAT and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services, such as tyres and mechanic charges, used for the purposes of the person&rsquo;s tour service.  However, there is a VAT Refund Order (S.I. 266 of 2012) under which coach operators who are exempt from VAT may, subject to the conditions in the Order, be entitled to a refund of the VAT paid on touring coaches that are no more than 2 years old and are within specified dimensions.  A coach operator, who meets the criteria of the Order, can complete a form VAT 71 that is available on the Revenue Commissioners website.  </p><p>  The question of whether VAT will be charged on the supply of an Irish-registered second-hand touring coach depends on whether the seller is registered for VAT or not.  However, secondhand coach sellers are generally exempt from VAT and in such case VAT would not be charged on the resale of a coach.</p></reply>

The current exemption limits are &euro;18,000 in the case of a single person and &euro;36,000 in the case of a married couple/civil partnership.  Both the age and the income criteria must be met for the exemption to apply.   Since April 2007, this exemption became automatic on the submission of a declaration to the credit union where the account is held.  To qualify for the automatic exemption, the individual must declare on form DE 1 that they or their spouse or civil partner are aged 65 years or over during the year and that their total annual income does not exceed the exemption limit.  Where the individual&rsquo;s circumstances change following the submission of this declaration form, they are required to notify the financial institution to that effect.  Where a person&rsquo;s income exceeds the relevant exemption limit by a small amount, he or she will not be entitled to an exemption or to have the interest paid without deduction of DIRT, but may be entitled to a partial refund of the tax deducted.</p></reply>

There are currently about 58% of all credit unions subject to lending restrictions.  Almost all credit unions with a lending restriction in place have a maximum individual loan size restriction.  Of the credit unions with lending restrictions, over 71% can lend &euro;20,000 or more to an individual member, which is a sizeable amount and should cover most circumstances.</p><p>  Fewer than 2.5% of credit unions are restricted to issuing loans of less than &euro;10,000 to an individual member, and fewer than 1% of credit unions are restricted to issuing loans of less than &euro;5,000 per member.

However NAMA provides a breakdown, by value and classification, of properties securing its loans in its 2011 Annual Report, which is available on its website, <i><font color="#0000FF">www.nama.ie</font></i>.   NAMA has indicated that it expects to advance, on a commercial basis, at least &#8364;2 billion in development capital over the next four years in Ireland to facilitate the completion of existing residential and commercial development projects and to facilitate new development for which demand has been confirmed.  Reflecting both the existing breakdown of properties securing NAMA&#8217;s loans and the expected demand over the medium-term for new office accommodation within the Dublin Central Business District, as indicated, for instance, by IDA, NAMA expects that a significant proportion of future development capital advances will relate to commercial development, including new office space.  As the approval and drawdown of development capital are dependent on a range of considerations, including the selection of projects that can generate the best commercial return, the resolution of outstanding issues with local authorities, consideration of the most appropriate funding and delivery models, and engagement with external parties, including prospective end users, it is not possible at this juncture in NAMA&#8217;s project planning to provide a breakdown of likely additional development by asset class.</p></reply>

Relatively lower price inflation in recent years means that Irish price levels have fallen relative to our major trading partners. For instance, in 2012 HICP inflation for Ireland was 2.0 per cent, lower than the euro area average of 2.5 per cent. This trend looks set to continue into this year, with HICP for January at 1.5 per cent in Ireland compared with a rate of 2.0 per cent for the euro area as a whole. Indeed Ireland&rsquo;s HICP inflation rate has now been below or on par with the euro area average for every month since May 2008.</p><p>  At the same time there has been a significant improvement in economy-wide cost competitiveness. Indeed, the European Commission recently forecast that our nominal unit labour costs will improve by 23 per cent relative to those in the euro area over the period 2008 - 2014.  The recent appreciation of the exchange rate against both sterling and the dollar is unhelpful. However, it must be seen in the context of the relative improvement in prices and costs - in other words, variables that we can exert some influence over.</p></reply>

One of the key priorities of the Programme for Government is to ensure that an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs in the real economy during the restructuring and downsizing programme.  Details of lending by the individual banks are commercially sensitive but the Central Bank does publish information on Credit Advanced to Irish Resident Small and Medium Sized Enterprises. This is available at <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i>. </p><p>  The Government has imposed SME lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &#8364;3 billion in 2011, &#8364;3.5 billion in 2012 and &#8364;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. As the Deputy may be aware, the Credit Reviewer said in his most recent quarterly report that &#8220;Both banks have achieved their &#8364;3.5bn SME loan sanction targets. Over &#8364;8bn was sanctioned in 2012; of which approx. &#8364;2.5bn (27%) is new lending drawn down.&#8221;  According to the Credit Review Office, the balance of the sanctioned lending represented restructured or refinanced credit to SMEs. The Credit Review Office in the past has noted that this is important in terms of sustaining the businesses and the associated jobs.  </p><p>  One of the most powerful ways of ensuring that the pillar banks provide credit to viable SMEs is through access to the Credit Review process. The Credit Review Office can review decisions by the pillar banks to refuse, reduce or withdraw credit facilities, including applications for restructured credit facilities, from &#8364;1,000 up to &#8364;500,000. The Credit Review Office is currently overturning 55% of the refusal decisions referred to them and anyone eligible who has been refused credit by the banks should avail of the services of the Credit Review Office.</p><p>  In addition to the lending targets imposed on the banks,<b></b>the pillar banks are required to submit their lending plans to the Department and the Credit Review Office (CRO) at the beginning of each year, outlining how they intend to achieve their lending targets. The banks have submitted their lending plans for 2013 to my Department. My Department, in conjunction with the CRO, has analysed the plans and we have begun our meetings with the banks to discuss the plans. The banks also meet with the Department of Finance and the CRO on a quarterly basis to discuss progress. The monthly management meetings with the pillar banks also provide a forum for the issue of SME lending to be raised by the Department.</p></reply>

There are some slight changes to the location of these base posts for the 2013/14 school year to further improve the efficiency of these arrangements.  The schools that were affected by these changes were those where the posts were not fully utilised for NCSE approved resource hours or where the teacher in the post was predominantly based in a neighbouring school.  The full criteria used is set out in the Department's Staffing Circular 0013/2013 which was recently published on the Department website.  Base schools are required to co-operate with their neighbouring schools to ensure that any surplus capacity in the (25 hour) resource posts is made available to neighbouring schools to meet their NCSE approved resource hour requirements.

In the 2004/05 school year, approximately 1,850 Traveller pupils aged between thirteen and eighteen (inclusive) were recorded as enrolled in post-primary schools and this increased to 2,698 in 2011/12 school year.  The majority of Traveller students transfer from primary to post-primary education.  Participation rates in the junior cycle have steadily improved from 1,598 Traveller students recorded in 2004/05 to 1,898 in the 2011/12 school year.  The number of Travellers progressing to senior cycle has consistently improved in recent years from 260 in 2004/05 to 800 in 2011/12.  Some 25% of young Travellers leave mainstream post-primary education, before completion of the senior cycle.  A number of contributory factors affecting low levels of attendance, attainment, and retention among Traveller students in post primary education have been identified, including:</p><p>- negative school experiences and low expectations by some schools, parents, and pupils</p><p>- a lack of understanding of the post-primary curriculum, concerns about the content of the curriculum and the availability of different courses, the variety of post-primary personnel and the number of subjects available, different levels on offer in each subject</p><p>- a lack of understanding of the role of different types of teachers and other educational professionals,</p><p>- a lack of inclusion policies,</p><p>- a lack of positive recognition of Traveller culture and life- Peer pressure</p><p>- the cost of post-primary education and homework difficulties</p><p>- traditions of early school leaving within the Traveller community, where young girls leave school to prepare for marriage while young teenage boys leave to work, and</p><p>- the availability of training allowances for sixteen to eighteen year olds in the Youthreach programme may result in some students, including Traveller students, leaving mainstream post-primary education early.</p><p>  The principle of inclusion is at the core of my Department's policy document on Traveller education - the Report and Recommendations for a Traveller Education Strategy.  The focus of both current and future provision is on the development of a more inclusive school environment through the whole school planning process, teaching practice, admissions policies, codes of behaviour and whole school evaluation.  In keeping with this principle, additional resources provided in the education system are allocated on the basis of individual educational need rather than that of ethnic or cultural background.  The Traveller Education Advisory and Consultative Forum, which has responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Strategy is currently working to a thematic approach to address the core issues of attendance, attainment, and retention of young Travellers in education.  The recently launched Action Plan on Bullying sets out twelve actions to help prevent and tackle bullying in primary and second level schools, including measures to address the type of bullying that might be experienced by members of the Travelling community and may be a factor in non-attendance and early school leaving.  In addition, the Intercultural Education Strategy which was launched in September 2010 is being implemented to assist in the creation of an intercultural, integrated, and inclusive learning environment in all sectors of education.  Emphasis is placed on the need for school communities need to continue to adopt and implement inclusive school policies to cater for societal diversity where all participants develop an openness to change in the inclusive school model.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that in 2011, I launched a discussion paper on school enrolment.  The &quot;Discussion Paper on a Regulatory Framework for School Enrolment&quot; contains suggestions on how to make the process of enrolling in schools more open, equitable and consistent and is available on my Department's website.  I also invited education partners and interested parties to submit their views to my Department.  The feedback from this consultation has helped inform the nature and scope of a new regulatory framework for school enrolment.

The impact of the moratorium is therefore limited to the Director of Adult Education, Assistant Principal and Special Duties posts of responsibility. Vacancies at this level arise due to retirements in the specific grades and typically also from the knock on effect of filling Principal and Deputy Principal posts.</p><p>Limited alleviation was introduced for schools that are acutely affected by the impact of the moratorium at Assistant Principal level. This alleviation is mainly focused on post-primary schools. The detailed information requested by the Deputy would take some time to compile by staff in my Department. I do not therefore propose to divert them from their work on the staffing allocations for the 2013/14 school year. I have already provided summary information to the Deputy on the overall impact of the moratorium since it was first introduced in March 2009. At that time about 53% of teachers had posts of responsibility. This has since reduced to about 39%.

Following intensive engagement in recent days between the parties, which was facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission (LRC), the LRC has developed and recommended a set of proposals for consideration and agreement. Public servants will be able to consider the full set of proposals by the LRC which have been published and the public service staff representatives who remained in negotiations have indicated that these proposals will be subject to ballot by members.</p><p>  Both the Government and I are acutely aware of the very significant contributions made to date by all public servants by way of pay reductions, imposition of the pension related deduction, non payment of pay increases and the significant productivity arising over recent years facilitated by the Public Service Agreement. Regrettably, the scale of the fiscal crisis inherited by the current Government and the absolute requirement to address and reduce the current deficit of 8% to less than 3% in 2015, requires a further contribution of &euro;1bn from the public service pay and pensions bill which accounts for some 35% of current expenditure. Undoubtedly the impact of the proposals made by the Labour Relations Commission will add to the financial pressures on public servants who also carry the burden of increased taxes which apply to all workers, but they represent a balanced set of proposals to secure the savings required by the Exchequer while ameliorating the impacts on public service staff particularly those on low and middle incomes to the greatest extent possible.</p></reply>

Dissatisfaction with the level or type of assistance offered by a CEB should, in the first instance, be brought to the attention of the Board, usually through the Chief Executive Officer.  Any complaint against a CEB can be investigated under the formal complaints procedure by which each Board operates.  By bringing this matter to the attention of the CEB, it will enable the CEB to initiate a formal investigation, in accordance with their agreed procedures, into all relevant aspects of the case. If a client is dissatisfied with the response to the initial investigation, then the complainant may bring the matter to the attention of the Chairman of the Board. The Board of Directors will then review the matter and make a decision within a set timeframe, typically seven working days.</p><p>  Until last year, the Ombudsman had no function in relation to the CEBs. However, the Government has extended the Ombudsman Act to encompass a wider range of public bodies, including the CEBs. The Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012 was signed into law by the President on 31st October 2012 and provides that the additional public bodies coming under the Ombudsman&rsquo;s remit will do so six months from the date of enactment, i.e., on 1 May 2013, unless the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform specifies an earlier date by Order.</p><p>  Accordingly, with effect from 1st May 2013, the Ombudsman will have the power to examine the administrative actions of the CEBs in respect of complaints about actions which occur on or after that date, once the complaint has progressed through the procedures implemented by the CEB.</p><p>  I trust this clarifies the matter and clears up any confusion that may have arisen.</p></reply>

For instance, in 2012, the number of jobs created by IDA companies was up to 50% greater than the numbers of jobs formally announced as companies do not always wish to publicise increases in employment that are progressive and incremental in nature.</p><p>The number of people currently employed by each of the other companies mentioned above - Allergan, Paypal, Diaceutics, National Pen and Yapstone - is confidential to the companies. In relation to each of these announcements it should be noted that jobs announced are typically created over a three year to five year period and grants are only paid in respect of jobs which have been created.</p><p>The grant agreement provides for the jobs to be created over a specific period of time. Until such time as grants are paid, no liability exists.  Jobs must remain in place for the duration of the liability i.e. for 5 years from the date of final payment of the grant.  IDA Ireland monitors the level of employment so as to ensure compliance with the agreement.</p><p>The temporary jobs at National Pen Dundalk have been created.  The duration of these temporary jobs is at the discretion of the company and these jobs were not grant assisted.</p><p>A  more wide ranging measure of how many jobs are filled in the period in question can be ascertained by using the Forf&aacute;s Employment Survey which is presented below for Louth and Mayo for the last five years.</p><p>The Forf&aacute;s Employment Survey does not track employment data by nationality.  However it should be noted that there is free movement of labour within the EU and persons recruited from outside the EU must comply with Employment Permit legislation.</p><p>IDA will continue to compete vigorously for projects for these regions.</p><p>In relation to the proposed Nextag operation in Drogheda, due to recent changes in their specialist business sector, Nextag have unfortunately decided not to proceed with their international HQ operation in Drogheda, as the company now no longer foresee a need for an international HQ operation.  Changes in the market for online shopping services prompted the company to review its global expansion plans, in Ireland and other locations. No financial support from the Irish Government has been drawn down by the company.  I am assured that Nextag will continue to monitor future opportunities in Ireland as circumstances change.</p><p><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Employment Data</th><th><div>          2008</div></th><th><div>2009</div></th><th><div>2010</div></th><th><div>2011</div></th><th><div>2012</div></th></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>No. of Companies</td><td><div>18</div></td><td><div>20</div></td><td><div>20</div></td><td><div>20</div></td><td><div>23</div></td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>Permanent Employment</td><td><div>1,529</div></td><td><div>1,317</div></td><td><div>1,024</div></td><td><div>1,075</div></td><td><div>1,416</div></td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>Gross Gains (New Jobs)</td><td><div>75</div></td><td><div>33</div></td><td><div>43</div></td><td><div>109</div></td><td><div>386</div></td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>Job Losses</td><td><div>-212</div></td><td><div>-245</div></td><td><div>-336</div></td><td><div>-58</div></td><td><div>-45</div></td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Employment Data</th><th><div>          2008</div></th><th><div>2009</div></th><th><div>2010</div></th><th><div>2011</div></th><th><div>2012</div></th></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>No. of Companies</td><td><div>19</div></td><td><div>18</div></td><td><div>18</div></td><td><div>18</div></td><td><div>19</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>Permanent Employment</td><td><div>3,010</div></td><td><div>2,948</div></td><td><div>3,112</div></td><td><div>3,094</div></td><td><div>3,162</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>Gross Gains (New Jobs)</td><td><div>132</div></td><td><div>97</div></td><td><div>183</div></td><td><div>69</div></td><td><div>126</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>Job Losses</td><td><div>-126</div></td><td><div>-159</div></td><td><div>-19</div></td><td><div>-87</div></td><td><div>-58</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

IDA is making good progress in achieving this particular target and, by the end of 2012, the agency had delivered 36,000 gross jobs, slightly ahead of target. During 2012 alone, 12,722 new jobs were created in IDA client companies. Furthermore, there were 88 investment announcements by IDA client companies with the potential to create in the region of 8,000 jobs.</p><p>  IDA Ireland has explained that there is usually a time lag of between three to five years between the announcement of an investment and the jobs coming on stream as a result of that investment, and, that some investment and job creation projects are not announced in accordance with the company&rsquo;s wishes.  The Agency has also confirmed that grant payments are not made until critical project milestones relating to jobs coming on stream are reached. </p><p>  In order to ensure that Ireland can continue to compete globally for foreign direct investment (FDI), it will be necessary to undertake an in depth analysis of our FDI strategy with a view to informing the formulation of an appropriate strategy for the period post 2014. This analysis, which will be undertaken later this year, will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI, any changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid rules that may be introduced in the near future and our agreed approach to regional development. </p><p>  In the meantime, IDA Ireland has assured me that it will in 2013, in accordance with the Government&rsquo;s 2013 Action Plan for Jobs, seek to target more than 130 new investments, secure &euro;500 million of R&amp;D expenditure and create 13,000 new jobs in its client companies.</p></reply>

Information is provided by companies on a confidential basis for statistical purposes only. It is not possible, therefore, to provide information at company level or for individual locations throughout a particular country.  It should be noted, also, that there is usually a time lag of between three and five years between the announcement of an investment and the jobs coming on stream as a result of that investment and that some investment and job creation projects are not announced.</p><p>I am informed by IDA Ireland that its client companies created a total of 739 new jobs in Donegal in the five year period from 2008 to 2012.  Details of the number of new jobs created in each year are set out in the attached tabular statement.  At present, there are 14 IDA Ireland client companies in Co. Donegal employing 2,228 people in full and part-time positions.</p><p>IDA Ireland has indicated that the challenge it faces is to continue to win top quality foreign direct investment (FDI) for Ireland in a very challenging global environment.  International competition for FDI has become extremely intense and continues to increase.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world class physical and digital infrastructure as well as the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services.  IDA Ireland, however, tries to influence these choices by prioritising the marketing of Gateway locations within each Region as the locations of critical mass with sufficient scale of population, skills, infrastructure, companies, business services, etc. and highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.</p><p>With continuing enhancement and improvements in physical and digital infrastructure, an FDI project secured for one Gateway can have a positive impact on other Gateways and their surrounding areas. It must be acknowledged, however, that the decision on where a client company will locate a new FDI investment is ultimately made by the senior managers of the companies involved.</p><p>I am mindful of the concerns that have been expressed by Deputies on all sides of the House about the relatively low level of site visits to certain regional locations and I have raised this matter with the CEO of IDA Ireland with a view to exploring what further initiatives can be taken to influence potential investors to invest in such locations.</p><p>I am mindful, also, that in order to ensure that Ireland can continue to compete globally for FDI, it will be necessary to undertake an in depth analysis of our FDI strategy with a view to informing the formulation of an appropriate strategy for the period post 2014.

Where the above requirements are met the assessment of the claim for Rent Supplement from a Springboard participant may proceed in the normal way. </p></reply>

His last payment was on 15 February 2012, the date of his death. </p><p>  The person in question was not being paid as an adult dependent on the disability allowance application since November 2011.  The person in question applied for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance on 15 November 2011 and she stated on her application form that she was single. Prior to that she had been living with her partner, who is now deceased, who had been in receipt of disability allowance and who had been paid a qualified adult allowance for her and an increase in respect of their two children. </p><p>  When the person&rsquo;s jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance claim was being investigated she informed the social welfare investigator that she was separated from her partner and that he was living at a different address and she supplied the investigator with evidence to support this contention. She was awarded jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance at the maximum rate plus an increase in respect of her two qualified children. </p><p>  In these circumstances, it is considered that the person in question cannot be considered to have been cohabiting with her former partner (now deceased) at the time of his death and, consequently, that she is not entitled to 6 weeks payment of disability allowance after the date of his death.</p><p>  In the absence of any instruction to the contrary from the former partner of the person in question, she remained as the agent appointed to collect the disability allowance payment.  It is considered that this is a matter between the person in question and her former partner (R.I.P.) and that it has no material bearing on the status of the person in question or the alleged entitlement to 6 weeks payment after death.</p></reply>

Special Areas of Conservation have been designated around our coasts for these species and a robust programme of scientific monitoring is in place, both for our seal species and for cetaceans.  Furthermore, dolphins and porpoises have very strict protection under Article 12 of the EU Habitats Directive.</p><p>  In recent months, officials of my Department have conducted wildlife law enforcement operations regarding dead seals on the Waterford and Wexford coasts.  These cases were investigated and, following a necropsy examination in one case, foul play was not considered to be involved.  Officials working in coastal areas will remain particularly vigilant during the seal breeding season and will continue to work closely with other law enforcement authorities in such situations. </p><p>  Officials of my Department also work closely with the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group.  This group operates a Cetacean Stranding Scheme, with funding from my Department, all around the Irish coastline.  The scheme monitors the strandings of whales, dolphins and porpoises.  While most mortality is due to natural causes, where strandings occur in unusual or suspicious circumstances my Department is in a position to carry out further investigations.  For example, in response to the recent strandings of 15 common dolphins over a short period of time in Mayo, my Department organised for post mortems to be carried out on five of these animals.  The final results of these tests are expected in March.</p></reply>

The North-South transmission line is vital infrastructure for the island.  The lack of sufficient interconnection between the North and South is preventing the full benefits of the all-island market being realised for consumers.</p><p>  Meaningful and effective public consultation is a central tenet to all of EirGrid&rsquo;s infrastructure development projects, including the North South 400kV Interconnection Development.</p><p>  The North South project was launched five years ago and has involved comprehensive public and stakeholder consultation activities, including the opening of dedicated project offices by EirGrid in Navan and Carrickmacross.</p><p>  Following the withdrawal of the original planning application for the North South 400kV Interconnection Development in 2010, EirGrid is conducting a comprehensive re-evaluation of the project, which will ensure that the new application follows a project development and consultation roadmap in a manner similar to projects such as Grid Link and Grid West.</p><p>  As part of its Grid25 national transmission development programme, EirGrid has produced the project development and consultation roadmap as a framework for its larger infrastructure projects, such as the Grid Link and Grid West projects.  The roadmap provides a clear and structured process, with public and stakeholder consultation occurring from the earliest stage of project development.</p><p>  Stage one includes identification of a study area to meet the needs of that particular project; the identification of environmental and other constraints within that study area; and the identification of potential route corridors which seek to avoid those identified constraints to the greatest extent practicable or feasible.  Each of these elements is subject to public consultation.</p><p>  Stage two involves further review of previous options, endorsement of a preferred route corridor, and identification of a potentially feasible indicative line route within that preferred route corridor. </p><p>  Again, these steps are subject to ongoing public and stakeholder consultation and landowner engagement along the identified indicative line route. </p><p>  Stages 3 and 4 are primarily concerned with confirmation of the final line route, and associated preparation of technical and environmental assessments, with ongoing engagement with the public and landowners, seeking agreement where possible for the location of structures on landholdings. </p><p>  The final proposal is then submitted to the appropriate authority &ndash; usually An Bord Plean&aacute;la - for development consent.</p><p>  The re-evaluation of the North South 400 kV Interconnection Development has comprised a review of all issues and submissions concerning the previous application, as well as information received and issues arising since June 2010.  A Re-evaluation Report will be published shortly.</p><p>  In this context, the overall re-evaluation process, including the publication of preliminary findings in 2011 and related public and stakeholder consultation, effectively constitute stages one and two of EirGrid&rsquo;s Project Development and Consultation Roadmap.</p><p>  I understand from EirGrid has assured me that it is satisfied that the re-evaluation process is consistent with the framework, particularly as it will continue to be subject to public and stakeholder consultation and input </p><p>  In addition, the latter stages of route identification, environmental assessment, and preparation of a new application for development consent will also occur in accordance with the framework of the roadmap.</p><p>  The project will enter stage three of the EirGrid project roadmap within the next few months.  The objective of this stage will be to confirm the preferred project solution.</p><p>  The goals of this phase of consultation will be to:-</p><p>- Engage with landowners on the preferred project solution;</p><p>- Conduct environmental studies and surveys;</p><p>- Consult with members of the public and other stakeholders on matters to be addressed in the Environmental Impact Statement;</p><p>- Consult with members of the public and other stakeholders on the Re-evaluation Report and the preferred project solution;</p><p>- Provide members of the public, landowners and other stakeholders with information on the project and the progression towards a planning application.</p><p>  As part of the public consultation and engagement activities a further round of consultation will be held.  In particular, landowners will be encouraged to participate in this consultation.</p><p>  Completion of the North South project will further consolidate the all-island electricity market established in 2007, providing for the seamless transfer of electricity across the island, delivering greater competition, reducing the need for further investment in thermal generation and ensuring the availability of low cost generation to the market.</p></reply>

My Department is currently liaising with the Council to further develop these proposals for incorporation into an overall Masterplan. As soon as this process is concluded it is expected that the City Council will be in a position to provide projected multi-annual funding requirements for the future regeneration of both areas. Funding for the various constituent elements of these schemes must await approval of the Masterplan. </p><p>  In advance of the completion of detailed Masterplan, my Department approved a programme of social inclusion initiatives for both locations in 2012. In the case of Dolphin House this included funding for a community worker, an extension to the existing CCTV system and, in addition, some &euro;1.5 million to support an interim programme of remedial and improvement works to the flats in order to improve living conditions and address issues relating to insulation, condensation and wastewater drainage. Further works are scheduled for 2013. In relation to St. Teresa&rsquo;s Gardens my Department also approved a programme of social inclusion initiatives in 2012 in addition to funding for demolition works. A number of houses were also purchased by Dublin City Council in 2012 to facilitate the regeneration project.  </p></reply>

Since 1 February 2013 the regulations are fully in force.Article 6 of the Regulations sets out that each rental property must have exclusive access to its own sanitary facilities, and that those facilities are contained within the habitable area of the house.

The merits of a designer overseeing the implementation of their design cannot be overlooked.  Neither is there any intention to constrain the capacity of all-in service delivery models in key sectors of the industry.  Enforcement powers under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2007 continue to be vested in the local building control authorities and it is here that independence is called for and in place.</p></reply>

The position is unchanged since then.  Additionally, the Deputy will appreciate that as the persons concerned have no current right of residency in the State, they would not be in a position to meet the lawful residency criteria applicable to persons applying to my Department for a Certificate of Naturalisation.</p><p><i>The persons concerned comprise a father and a mother and their two children. The father applied for asylum on 4th March, 2008. His asylum claim was refused. Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), he was notified, by letter dated 5th December, 2008, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.</i></p><p><i>The person concerned initiated Judicial Review Proceedings in the High Court, challenging the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal in his case. The Judicial Review proceedings were struck out on 12th October, 2010 meaning that the earlier decisions of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and the then Minister stood.</i><i>The position in the State of the father will now be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  Any representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made.  Once a decision has been made, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</i></p><p><i>The mother also applied for asylum on 4th March, 2008. Her asylum claim was also refused.  Arising from the refusal of her asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), she was notified, by letter dated 15th November, 2010, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her.  In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.</i></p><p><i>The mother submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection. When consideration of this application has been completed, she will be notified in writing of the outcome.</i><i>In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  Any representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made. Once a decision has been made, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the mother concerned.</i></p><p><i>A separate asylum application was lodged on behalf of the couple's eldest child on 13th May, 2008.  This application was also refused. Arising from the refusal of this asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), this child was notified, by letter dated 15th November, 2010, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation order in respect of her. She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her. In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.</i><i>This child lodged an application for Subsidiary Protection. When consideration of this application has been completed, the child concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome. In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the child concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  Any representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made. Once a decision has been made, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the child concerned.</i></p><p><i>An asylum application was lodged in respect of the couple's second child on 10th July, 2012. The Deputy will appreciate that it is not my practice to comment on individual asylum applications where a final decision has not been made.</i><i>It is unlikely that the Zambrano Judgment will have any impact on the cases of the couple in question given that no evidence has been submitted to date to suggest that any of the couple's children can claim an entitlement to Irish citizenship.  The Deputy will appreciate that, in an Irish context, the terms of the Zambrano Judgment can only be applied to third country national parents of an Irish born minor citizen child who are residing in this State with their Irish born minor citizen child or children.</i></p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Other Department approved meat plants are visited regularly. The frequency of the official controls in plants other than slaughter plants, which focus primarily on food safety requirements, is determined by a risk assessment, as required under EU legislation, which is conducted for each plant. The outcomes of such official controls are not published but are conveyed as appropriate to the food business operators concerned. Appropriate enforcement action is taken where necessary. EU official control legislation requires that confidential business information is treated confidentially unless necessary for the protection of public health. Official controls are monitored independently by the EU Food and Veterinary Office and by the FSAI under service contract. </p><p>  Smaller meat processors are approved and supervised by local authorities operating under service contract arrangement with the FSAI. The same legislation applies to both types of meat processor; the difference is one of scale and the larger plants are more focussed on the export market. My Department does not have a direct role in such plants, but local authorities and the FSAI liaise with the Department in relation to the official controls and standards applying, to ensure that they are equivalent to those in the larger plants supervised by the Department. </p><p>  The onus of compliance with EU food safety regulations, including traceability requirements, rests in the first instance with food business operators. Food business operators in Ireland are responsible inter alia for carrying out checks to ensure that their ingredients come from approved plants. In meat plants that operate under the supervision of the Department, official controls are conducted on these checks to verify their effectiveness. An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department approved meat plant. The audit includes physical identity, labelling and documentary checks. This includes product originating both in EU Member States and third countries. Labelling and documentary checks also form part of the routine checks conducted by Department officials. </p><p>  Under the Department&rsquo;s National Residue Programme, and including tests on bovine samples carried out by processors, up to 30,000 samples taken at farm and factory level and covering a wide range of food stuffs are tested annually. These tests relate to microbiological and chemical standards, their primary focus being on food safety. These are fully in accordance with EU testing requirements. In addition the Product Official Sampling and Testing (POST) programme is a microbiological testing programme on samples taken from Department approved ready-to-eat food, meat product, minced meat and meat preparation plants i.e. added value plants. This is part of the official verification of food safety controls in the plants concerned as provided for in Regulations (EC) 852/2004, 854/2004 and 2073/2005. A total of 1,600 samples are taken annually and the sampling and testing is risk based.</p><p>  While compliance with existing food safety and food hygiene requirements was not an issue in relation to the mislabelling of meat products uncovered by the recent FSAI survey, it is clear however that the focus of checks henceforth will also need to include food authenticity. The recently agreed EU wide programme of DNA testing will provide the basis for consideration of future action in this respect.</p><p>  In the meantime, in the light of recent developments, officials from my Department and the FSAI met with the meat processing sector on 14th February to agree a national protocol for DNA testing of meat to be applied at retail, catering and processing level in Ireland. This testing will provide further reassurance to Irish consumers and consumers of Irish food abroad about the authenticity of ingredients in our meat based products. </p></reply>

Current services available include acute hospital services; the National Rehabilitation Hospital; multi-disciplinary community services; long-term assisted living supports; and rehabilitative training services.

Calories on menus help people make healthier more informed choices. </p><p>  I requested the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) to carry out a national consultation, which found that over 95% of consumers in Ireland want calories on menus.  I am very much in favour that the programme of putting calories on menus in Ireland be introduced on a voluntary basis.  Recent monitoring information from the FSAI, found that almost half of those to whom I wrote are currently displaying calories on menus.</p><p>  Nevertheless, if a voluntary approach fails to make the desired impact, I may then have to consider legislation.  The consultation showed that 92% of consumers and 88% of health professionals supported a mandatory approach for large food service businesses, although only 58% of food businesses would support that approach.</p><p>  Following the national consultation, the FSAI has published a step-by-step guide for food businesses on how to achieve this: </p><p>  The FSAI is currently conducting a large telephone survey and quality assessment evaluating the uptake of calorie menu labelling by Food Service Businesses in Ireland.  The final survey results will be ready for publication in March 2013.  The FSAI is also working on a software tool to provide the Food Service Business with an easy method to establish the calorie content in the range of dishes which are on menus for more than 30 days per year.</p></reply>

Licences issued prior to that date can be transferred only once. </p><p>  The Taxi Regulation Bill 2012 provides for a prohibition on the transfer of all SPSV vehicle licences, in line with Action 14 of the Taxi Regulation Review Report 2011. The underlying policy principle for the prohibition on transfer is that a licence should determine a person&rsquo;s suitability to carry out a function and it should not have monetary value or be traded on the open market.</p><p>  The Taxi Regulation Bill also provides for the principles and criteria for licensing and the assessment of the suitability of a person to hold an SPSV licence, which includes a vehicle licence. Such suitability assessment would be the basis upon which a licence application would be refused or an SPSV  licence could be revoked or suspended in the future.</p><p>  I am considering separately the matter of transfer of an SPSV licence the event of the death of an SPSV licence holder, for example where there is a requirement for continuity of a family business. I intend addressing this matter in the current legislation, which will also take into account suitability considerations with regard to future holder the licence.</p></reply>
