    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-12-03a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1046" speakername="Jimmy Deenihan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013120300053#WRA00700"><p>In Ireland, we recognise the potential of the creative industries and particularly their beneficial characteristics. The creative industries now encompass more than the traditional areas of the arts, film, music and literature, and include areas like advertising, as well as the newer industries such as social media, gaming and animation.</p><p>  As Minister with responsibility for arts, culture and heritage for the whole country, I do not want to single out any part of Dublin, or indeed any other part of the country, as requiring branding as a creative quarter. Of course, Dublin 8 has a number of unique historical, cultural and creative characteristics, but so have many other areas in the country. I have no statutory function in the designation of such areas.</p><p>  One of the actions I have prioritised as Minister is in relation to encouraging the fostering of creativity in our children and young people. Initiatives have been introduced in our schools to ensure that they develop this very important skill and that there is a broader appreciation of the value of the arts as an instrument to nurture and develop creativity.  </p><p>The importance of this matter is well recognised internationally. Indeed, during the recent Irish Presidency of the EU, Irish officials worked closely with their EU colleagues on a seven year plan to put in place appropriate policies and a funding framework to drive the <i>Creative Europe</i>   programme for the years 2014 to 2020.</p><p>  In the Irish context, up to relatively recently Ireland may have had a somewhat fragmented approach to the development of the creative industries but, over the last few years, there have been some important initiatives at national and sectoral levels which are fostering a stronger more cohesive approach to this sector. </p><p><i>Innovation Ireland</i>   is a report published in March 2010 by an inter-disciplinary group, as a follow-up to the SMART Economy strategy. The report underscores how the arts can be used to drive jobs in the digital economy and creative industries, as well as the vital role of culture in fostering creativity in the education system. It also identifies the scope for cultural creativity and science to work together to re-position technology and innovation in innovative new ways in the public mind, and help re-position artists, culture and creative minds into the centre of innovative businesses.</p><p>  The report highlights the need amongst employers in innovative industries and businesses for creative thinkers who are culturally aware to drive their business forward. As we shift to a more knowledge-based, services-oriented economy, I believe that Ireland is well placed to lead developments in this area because of its established arts and cultural heritage. </p><p>  The digital economy has tremendous potential to create new jobs and new growth.  Companies in this sector are amongst the fastest growing in the world and have become major brands.  The arts and the creative sector also can play an innovative role in positioning Ireland in a new way, particularly when science and arts are brought together to utilise technology in insightful and original ways.</p></reply>

The then Government agreed to cover the full capital costs of the project, which were estimated at that time to be of the order of &euro;35m.</p><p>  It was always the intention that the Ulster Canal project would be funded from the Waterways Ireland annual allocations, as agreed through the annual estimates processes in this jurisdiction, as well as the deliberations of NSMC in relation to annual budgets.  It was a key consideration throughout the process that the Ulster Canal project would be supported by a significant level of projected income from the commercialisation of certain Waterways Ireland assets.  However, the economic downturn has had a negative impact on those plans.</p><p>I am continuing to explore all possible options to advance this project within the current fiscal constraints. In this regard, I established an Inter-Agency Group on the Ulster Canal to explore ways to advance the project and to examine possible funding options for it, including existing funding streams and the leveraging of funding from other sources. The Inter-Agency Group last met on 9<sup>th</sup> October and will meet again next week, on 9<sup>th</sup>   December.</p><p>  In the meantime, the Ulster Canal project is progressing on an incremental basis. Planning approvals have now been received for the project in both jurisdictions. Compulsory Purchase Order land maps are in preparation and consideration is being given to how the construction work and other technical aspects of the project will be structured once the necessary lands have been secured. The timeline for completion of the project will be determined when these preparatory steps have been completed.</p><p>  I welcome these developments, which, I am sure the Deputy will agree, are a significant milestone for the project.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-12-03a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1046" speakername="Jimmy Deenihan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013120300053#WRA01200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.</p><p>  The aim of the City of Culture initiative is to deliver a programme of cultural events and engagement in a city for one year in such a way as to lead to a permanent increase in the engagement of its citizens with arts and culture in the longer-term. The introduction of a City of Culture initiative in Ireland follows similar initiatives in other countries, and also follows the well-established EU Capitals of Culture Programme, which Ireland has held on two occasions.</p><p>  As Deputies will be aware, Limerick City is undergoing a process of profound change at present and 2014 is an important year for the city as it will be the year in which a new single local authority will be established.  I am confident that the designation of Limerick as the inaugural Irish City of Culture will help to shape, brand and promote a new Limerick city. </p><p>  Funding of &euro;6 million towards the cost of the City of Culture Programme was provided to my Department in Budget 2014 and will be reflected in the Revised Estimates Volume (REV) to be published in the coming weeks. This funding will  support the arts and cultural events which will be taking place in Limerick during 2014. </p><p>  The scheme for disbursal of the allocation to Limerick City and County Council will be grounded in a Service Level Agreement (SLA) currently being prepared by my Department, together with a formal letter of grant approval. The oversight, administration and governance model that will govern the disbursement of funds to the Council will be addressed in that SLA. Disbursal of the approved funding, which will be fully in line with public service financial and accountability requirements, will not commence until 2014.</p><p>  Clearly, the primary relationship in relation to these matters will be between my Department and Limerick City and County Council. Day-to-day operational, administrative and associated matters will reside with the Council and the company - Limerick National City of Culture 2014 Ltd - it has established to manage the City of Culture programme. Matters in relation to the appointment of the CEO of that company are for Limerick City and County Council and I have noted the comments of the City and County Manager in that regard.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-12-03a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1046" speakername="Jimmy Deenihan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013120300053#WRA01400"><p>Following on from discussions between my Department and relevant stakeholders, including F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland, Temple Bar Cultural Trust and St. Patrick's Festival, it was agreed that the commitment in the <i>Programme for Government</i> to expand the Culture Night concept and to consider making it a twice yearly event would be best met by the designation and delivery of an <i>International Week of Irish Culture, </i>  based around the St Patrick's Day Festival.  This would allow for the cultivation and development of the solid foundations already in place to showcase to the world Ireland's rich and varied cultural heritage and to promote Ireland as a destination for cultural tourists.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">2012 was essentially the first year of a 5-year development plan in this regard, with the emphasis on the international launch of the &quot;</font><i><font color="#2F2F2F">International Celebration of Irish Culture</font></i><font color="#2F2F2F">&quot; brand abroad and a series of programme activities based in existing cultural venues around the Merrion Square/Kildare Street areas of Dublin, marketing the message of &quot;</font><i><font color="#2F2F2F">I Love my City</font></i><font color="#2F2F2F">&quot;.  The existing St. Patrick's Festival activity was used to promote Ireland and its culture, both domestically and internationally, and the initiative was well received and supported in both national and international spheres.  </font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">This year, </font>the international element had <i>&quot;Culture Connects&quot;</i> - the international culture programme of Ireland's presidency of the EU - as its key focus.  The domestic element of the celebration took place over an extended 4 day period and featured 16 free headline events <font color="#2F2F2F">staged in the beautiful surroundings of some of our most prestigious cultural institutions and venues. In</font> addition to these specially programmed events, a citywide Cultural Events Programme also took place throughout the city during the St. Patrick's Day Festival. <font color="#2F2F2F">Once again, the initiative was well received and supported and </font>  it is proposed to further expand it in 2014, ultimately building towards linking with the 2016 commemoration celebrations.</p><p>In further recognition of the Culture Night commitment in the<i> Programme for Government</i>  , my Department continues to work with relevant stakeholders to foster and develop the event. Culture Night has grown from a relatively small-scale cultural event, staged only in Dublin in 2006, to the significant national cultural event it now is.</p><p>  Culture Night 2013 took place on 20 September 2013 in 34 locations across the island of Ireland, in 3 UK cities and in Leuven in Belgium.  The feedback from the 2013 event has been overwhelmingly positive with many participating locations reporting larger turnouts than in previous years.  </p><p>Discussions have already commenced with key stakeholders in relation to Culture Night 2014. As it enters its 9<sup>th</sup>   year, the challenge is to keep Culture Night fresh and exciting, whilst building on the platforms and success of previous years to further develop and enhance the event. Clearly, while we want people to really enjoy Culture Night, we also want to use it as a stepping stone to encourage more people to visit cultural venues and experience culture in their locality.</p></reply>

The payments delivered from my Department assisted farmers in delivering Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition  - GAEC - in these sensitive habitats over the period of the scheme.   The recovery was an essential part of Ireland&rsquo;s compliance with a judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union.</p><p>  Supports for farming are principally a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. In terms of future schemes for Natura areas, my Department is engaged in ongoing discussions with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine concerning suitable agri-environment measures under the next Rural Development Plan.</p></reply>

The Deputy can access the recommendations of the report of the Forum on Philanthropy and Fund-raising and associated updates at:   .</p><p>I am however, pleased to avail of the opportunity to give the House information on some initiatives in the area of Philanthropy and the Arts.  The <i>Programme for Government</i>   includes the following commitment:</p><p><i>&quot;We will work with stakeholders in the Arts community to develop new proposals aimed at building private support of the Arts in Ireland exploring philanthropic, sponsorship or endowment fund opportunities&quot;.</i></p><p>Since taking office, I have introduced a number of initiatives to address this commitment. In May 2012, I introduced a new philanthropic initiative for arts and culture organisations.  The initiative - the <i>Philanthropic Leverage Initiative </i>- was designed to encourage philanthropic sponsorship and endowment of the arts from private sources.  The initiative has provided an incentive to arts organisations to proactively seek new funding relationships with sponsors, which deliver private sector financial support, thereby increasing overall funding available to the arts.  The initiative proved very successful with a multiplier of 4.26 in philanthropic donations being leveraged &ndash; giving the arts a boost of over &euro;1 million last year, of which less than one-fifth came from the public purse. A full list of awards under this scheme can be viewed on my Department's website at   .  This year, funding of up to &euro;210,000 has been available to arts organisations under the Initiative.  </p><p>In October 2012, I hosted and chaired a forum on <i>Philanthropy and the Arts </i>  in Smock Alley Theatre.  It featured speakers from key philanthropic organisations and the arts in Ireland.  The conference was very well attended and generated very positive feedback.  There is a full report of the conference on my Department's website.</p><p>Parallel to these initiatives, following my policy initiative, the Arts Council is continuing with another initiative entitled <i>RAISE: Building Fundraising Capacity </i>  - which dovetails with the work in my Department. The initiative consists of a programme, which is providing one-to-one professional support to selected arts organisations for two years to assist in planning and implementing a tailored fundraising programme for each organisation. Eight leading Irish arts organisations are aiming to raise &euro;10 million in private funding over the next five years as part of this Arts Council initiative.  </p><p>  My Department has also provided support to Business to Arts (a not-for-profit organisation working to support resilience and transformation in the cultural sector through research, innovation and partnership) for a number of years and, in each of the last three years, this has been allocated to delivery of the New Stream Programme, which builds fundraising skills in the cultural sector in Ireland. </p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that I will be continuing to avail of every opportunity to promote philanthropy in order to complement Government funding of the arts and to encourage more arts organisations to engage with business to their mutual benefit.</p></reply>

A range of actions that have been taken to support The Gathering were outlined in my previous replies to the Deputy. </p><p>  My Department and its agencies have made a substantial contribution towards ensuring a strong linkage between the cultural area and tourism and, in so doing, to The Gathering. This promotes and enhances the artistic image of Ireland. Indeed, the arts are very much part of our tourism offering. For example, over 1 million tourists visit the National Museum annually, free of charge. The number of people coming to Ireland for the cultural encounter is increasing all the time.</p><p>  My Department's Culture Ireland Programme supports artists to travel abroad and promote this country. Efforts are continuing to maximise the benefits from that funding and, in this regard, I have arranged that other State agencies, such as the IDA and Tourism Ireland, will be enabled to capitalise on the presence of some of our best artists when travelling abroad so as to further promote the country. </p><p>  Throughout 2013, my Department has worked to encourage linkages between arts and culture and The Gathering initiative and these efforts will continue into the future.</p></reply>

The consent is, however, conditional on a revised project design being submitted to me for approval within 9 months of the decision date that takes full account of the elements of the proposal for which consent has been refused and the conditions attached to the approved works.  A further condition requires substantive works to commence on site within 3 months of the approval of the revised proposals.  </p><p>  I have since met the monument owners who have informed me that they are currently preparing proposals for the site which would fit within the terms of my decision on the consent application and that the revised proposals would be submitted for my approval as quickly as possible.  </p><p>  My Department informed the National Asset Management Agency at the outset of the receipt of the consent application in this case and also of my decision in July.  I am aware of recent media reports suggesting that the Agency would provide funding to facilitate the proposed works, which I would welcome, but my Department has not received any formal confirmation to that effect. </p></reply>

The programme reflects the generosity and values of the Irish people and is a concrete expression of our determination to help those less fortunate than ourselves.  Our new policy for International Development &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo; published earlier this year, sets out our vision for a sustainable and just world. It maintains our sharp focus on poverty reduction and hunger eradication though providing much needed assistance and support to some of the world&rsquo;s poorest countries and communities, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa.  Our aid remains untied.

Furthermore, it is the policy of IDA Ireland not to release individual company names in response to questions that will end up in the public arena, as doing so could compromise the Agency&rsquo;s negotiating position with potential new FDI investors and also could be commercially sensitive in dealing with its existing base of clients. </p></reply>

I am pleased to note that payment in respect of the 2012 claims will be made by the customs authorities on 4 December. However, I regret that the position in relation to the pre-2012 claims is less positive and I can fully appreciate the concern of the company to learn that the claims for the years prior to 2012 have been deemed ineligible on the basis that Belgian customs law requires that a company must first be authorised before it is able to claim for reimbursement of excise duty. </p><p>  I note that, as provided for under the relevant legislation, the company is appealing the decision of the Belgian Customs to disallow the pre-2012 claims and I hope that the appeal will be successful.

The programme reflects the generosity and values of the Irish people and is a concrete expression of our determination to help those less fortunate than ourselves.       Since 2005, Ireland has contributed over &euro;6.4 billion to Official Development Assistance (ODA).   Of this total funding approximately 80% was administered by my Department through Vote 27 International Cooperation - while the remainder is made up of ODA eligible contributions from other Government Departments and Ireland&rsquo;s share of the EU Development Cooperation Budget.  A summary of Ireland&rsquo;s total ODA since 2005 years is provided below.<table><tr><th></th><th>Total ODA in &euro; Millions </th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>622.08 </td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>628.90</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>657.04</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>675.83</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>722.20</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>920.66 </td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>870.870</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>813.962</td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>578.460</td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>6,490.00 </td></tr></table></p><p>Detailed analysis of Ireland&rsquo;s ODA is provided in the statistical annexes to the Irish Aid annual report available on the Irish Aid website at   .  </p><p>  Responding to humanitarian emergencies and their aftermath is a central feature of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme. Emergency humanitarian assistance saves lives, alleviates suffering and maintains human dignity.  Recovery assistance provides focused support to countries emerging from conflict or natural disasters, assisting affected populations re-establish their lives.  In responding to emergencies and their aftermath, Irish Aid works with a variety of partners to best meet the needs of affected communities - including host Governments, Irish and international NGOs, the International Red Cross/Red Crescent movement, and multilateral agencies such as the UN.   </p><p>  Given the unpredictable nature of this type of aid, annual funding varies from year to year.  Over the period 2005 to 2013 approximately 12% of total ODA was allocated to emergency response and recovery assistance, although annual allocation levels varied from 10% to 14%.  The detailed analysis for Emergency and Recovery Assistance for each year is included in the statistical annexes to the Irish Aid annual report.</p></reply>

The suffering of their relatives and friends endures to this day.  There is no hierarchy of loss or grief for these families.  However, both Governments accepted at Weston Park that certain cases from the past remained a source of grave public concern, particularly those giving rise to serious allegations of collusion by the security forces in each of our jurisdictions.  Both Governments therefore committed to undertake a thorough investigation of allegations of collusion in the cases, of the murders of Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent Bob Buchanan, Pat Finucane, Lord Justice and Lady Gibson, Robert Hamill, Rosemary Nelson and Billy Wright.  The Government's position continues to be to fulfil the commitments we entered into at Weston Park, most specifically in this jurisdiction to carry out an inquiry into the murders of Chief Superintendent Breen and Superintendent Buchanan.  In line with this approach, we continue to call on the British Government for an independent public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane.  This is an approach which has cross-party support in the House of the Oireachtas.</p><p>  It is clear from my extensive consultations during recent visits to Northern Ireland that the past is having a corrosive effect on political life and on community relations.  The current All-Party talks under the chairmanship of Richard Haass present an opportunity currently to build positive momentum towards finding the right mechanisms to deal with the past.  In the longer term, dealing with the Past will require the ongoing commitment of both Governments, of all the Parties in Ireland, North and South, and also the support of wider society.  </p></reply>

Solid fuel is defined under section 77 of the Finance Act 2010, as amended and means coal or peat.  Coal is further defined to include coal and lignite, solid fuel manufactured from coal and lignite, and any other energy product within the meaning of Article 2.1 of Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 in solid form.  Peat means peat falling within CN Code 2703 of the Combined Nomenclature of the European Communities referred to in Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2658/87 of 23 July 1987, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2031/2001 of 6 August 2001 and includes any solid fuel manufactured from peat.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the Air Pollution Act, 1987 (Marketing, Sale and Distribution of Fuels)(Amendment) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 270 of 2011), made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, specifies the standards for coal placed on the market and extends the regulatory framework in relation to the distribution and sale of coal in the State.  Under the Regulations, all coal suppliers are obliged to register with the Environmental Protection Agency and comply with sulphur content and packaging standards.  In particular, the sulphur content of coal that may be sold in the State, which is not more than 0.7% sulphur by weight, is lower than that in Northern Ireland and therefore coal supplied to Northern Ireland standards for sale on that market may not be sold in the State. Compliance with the Regulations will be enforced by the Local Authorities.  The application of the solid fuel carbon tax on coal is heavily dependant on this regulatory regime.  Suppliers who produce and supply solid fuels in contravention of these regulations are subject to investigation and prosecution by local authorities and other State Agencies charged with enforcing the regulations and preventing such supply. </p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of carbon tax on solid fuels, also advise me that on commencement of the carbon tax provisions under the Finance Act 2010, any Northern Ireland-based wholesaler of solid fuels selling into the market in Ireland will be obliged to register as a supplier and comply with the same regulatory requirements as wholesalers based in the State.  Such suppliers will be obliged to make returns on solid fuels supplied in the State in the accounting period concerned and pay the amount of carbon tax due in respect of that supply. </p><p>  Therefore it is not my intention to defer the second phase of the carbon tax which is due for implementation in May 2014.	</p></reply>

The legislation follows the general law in relation to the ownership of property and applies capital gains tax, where a chargeable gain arises on a disposal, on each tenant-in-common or joint-tenant according to the share of each one in the property.   </p><p>  A joint-tenancy can be severed and replaced by an arrangement in which the former joint-tenants become tenants-in-common.  Where a number of properties are held under tenancies-in-common, these can be partitioned and replaced by an arrangement in which each of the former tenants-in-common becomes the full owner of some of the properties.  Each of the parties concerned in such arrangements is disposing of a lesser interest in part of the properties concerned and is acquiring a full interest in a number of the properties.  The normal capital gains tax rules in relation to part-disposals apply in this situation.</p><p>  Where the owner of property transfers it to joint-tenants there is a disposal of the whole property to the joint tenants collectively even where the original owner becomes a joint-tenant following the transfer.  Any chargeable gain arising on such transfer is subject to capital gains tax in the normal way.</p><p>  The treatment applied to the disponer of, or of an interest in, property is the same whether a tenant-in-common or a joint-tenant.  Whatever interest is disposed of is subject to capital gains tax, if a chargeable gain arises on the disposal, and there are no proposals to change this.	</p></reply>

Defibrillators, other than implantable defibrillators, are liable to VAT at the standard rate of 23%.  Parts or accessories and training are also liable to VAT at the standard rate.  However, training provided in a work setting, for example for the purposes of health and safety in a company or for medical persons who require such training for their profession, would qualify as exempt vocational training for VAT purposes.  There is no provision in the EU VAT Directive that would make it possible to exempt from VAT or apply a zero rate to the supply of defibrillators.  Under the VAT (Refund of Tax) (No.15) Order, 1981 it is possible for individuals to obtain repayment of VAT expended on certain goods and appliances which assist persons with a disability to overcome that disability.   In this context, a defibrillator purchased by or on behalf of an individual may qualify for a VAT refund.  However, a defibrillator purchased for general use by a sports body or charity would not qualify for such a refund. </p></reply>

In this report, KBC stated that, in light of a paper by the European Banking Association on forbearance and non-performing loans as well as the upcoming asset quality review in 2014, they are reassessing their Irish loan book and expect to add additional provisions due to the reclassification of &euro;2 billion worth of restructured mortgage loans.  They are also increasing provisions in the corporate loan book because of the slow recovery of the SME sector in Ireland.  The expected impairment charge in Ireland is now up to 775 million euros in the fourth quarter of this year. </p><p>  Their guidance for loan loss provisions in Ireland is 150 to 200 million euros for 2014 and 50 to 100 million euros for each of 2015 and 2016.</p><p>  I think that it is important to bear in mind that the increased expected impairment charge is as a result of a reassessment of the KBC loan book and therefore the total for 2013 is not directly comparable to previous years.

I will however, introduce an additional levy on pension funds at 0.15% to, among other things, continue to help fund the Jobs Initiative. The additional levy, within the existing legal framework, will apply to pension fund assets in 2014 and 2015.    The chargeable persons for the pension fund levy are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) with responsibility for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans. </p><p>  There are two exceptions to the requirement to pay the levy provided for in the governing legislation (section 125B of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999). </p><p>  The first exception provides that the levy will not apply to the assets of occupational pension schemes in respect of employees whose employment is, or was, wholly exercised outside the State. In other words, the levy does not apply to the extent that a pension scheme is intended to provide retirement benefits outside the State. </p><p>  The second exception provides that the levy will not apply where the trustees of a scheme have passed a resolution to wind-up the scheme and where the business in respect of which the scheme was established is insolvent in accordance with the Protection of Employees (Employers&rsquo; Insolvency) Act 1984.</p><p>  The fact that there are very limited situations where the levy does not have to be paid explains, in part at least, why it was possible to introduce it at a relatively low rate of 0.6% in the first place and to keep the rate of the additional levy as low as 0.15%. Making an exception for the Permanent TSB scheme, notwithstanding that it clearly does not meet all of the existing qualifying conditions for exception, will inevitably give rise to demands for exceptions to be granted in other situations that would be viewed by those seeking them as being equally deserving.  The inevitable result of this course of action would be a narrowing of the levy base which would result in a greater imposition on the non-exempt schemes and I am not prepared to go down that road.</p></reply>

The table contains a distribution of incomes and income tax by reference to ranges of income for the income tax year 2013 which was provided in my reply of 30 April 2013 to Parliamentary Question Number 151 (Reference number 19815/13).  The figures were provisional estimates from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2010 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends in the interim. </p><p>  The Deputy may be interested to know that the figures in question have since been revised on the basis of actual data for the year 2011 and are set out in the following table. </p><p>  As regards the question of the average rate of  income tax on  the highest incomes being lower than the average rate of tax on somewhat lower incomes I should point out that &ldquo;gross income&rdquo;, the basis on which these average tax rates are calculated, is not the basis on which the charge to income tax is applied.  In arriving at taxable income the figure for gross income must be reduced by various deductions and reductions which are legitimately allowable for income tax such as deductions for capital allowances, interest paid, losses, allowable expenses and retirement annuities. </p><p>An examination of the historical data for 2011, the latest available, indicates that the aggregated claims for such deductions by income earners with incomes in excess of one million were almost 4 % of gross income higher<font color="#C20000"> </font>  than the corresponding proportion that applied to income earners with incomes between &euro;500,000 and one million. This means that  the proportion of gross income of  income earners with incomes in excess of one million that was legitimately available for taxation was 4% less than was the case in respect of income earners with incomes between &euro;500,000 and one million.</p><p><b><i>All Income earners for Income Tax Year 2013 (provisional)</i></b></p><p><table><tr><th>Gross Income Range &euro;</th><th>Gross Income &euro;</th><th>Numbers </th><th>Income Tax &euro;</th><th>Average Income &euro;</th><th>Average Tax &euro;</th><th>Tas as % of Income</th></tr><tr><td>10,000 or less</td><td>1,701,125,991</td><td>386,113</td><td>413,033</td><td>4,406</td><td>1</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>10,001 &ndash; 20,000</td><td>5,991,247,957</td><td>394,547</td><td>40,310,708</td><td>15,185</td><td>102</td><td>0.7%</td></tr><tr><td>20,001 &ndash; 30,000</td><td>9,894,189,836</td><td>398,715</td><td>376,689,221</td><td>24,815</td><td>945</td><td>3.8%</td></tr><tr><td>30,001 &ndash; 40,000</td><td>10,526,536,676</td><td>302,643</td><td>761,371,741</td><td>34,782</td><td>2,516</td><td>7.2%</td></tr><tr><td>40,001 &ndash; 50,000</td><td>9,188,240,949</td><td>205,698</td><td>1,014,747,279</td><td>44,669</td><td>5,064</td><td>11.3%</td></tr><tr><td>50,001 &ndash; 60,000</td><td>7,439,955,833</td><td>136,170</td><td>1,058,209,385</td><td>54,637</td><td>7,771</td><td>14.2%</td></tr><tr><td>60,001 &ndash; 70,000</td><td>6,111,257,479</td><td>94,391</td><td>968,351,805</td><td>64,744</td><td>10,259</td><td>15.8%</td></tr><tr><td>70,001 &ndash; 80,000</td><td>4,885,203,793</td><td>65,408</td><td>858,055,522</td><td>74,688</td><td>13,119</td><td>17.6%</td></tr><tr><td>80,001 &ndash; 90,000</td><td>3,791,883,977</td><td>44,761</td><td>726,494,017</td><td>84,714</td><td>16,231</td><td>19.2%</td></tr><tr><td>90,001 &ndash; 100,000</td><td>2,974,203,171</td><td>31,396</td><td>611,283,510</td><td>94,732</td><td>19,470</td><td>20.6%</td></tr><tr><td>100,001 &ndash; 125,000</td><td>5,083,135,796</td><td>45,853</td><td>1,140,444,989</td><td>110,857</td><td>24,872</td><td>22.4%</td></tr><tr><td>125,001 &ndash; 150,000</td><td>2,866,266,063</td><td>21,073</td><td>701,259,789</td><td>136,016</td><td>33,278</td><td>24.5%</td></tr><tr><td>150,001 &ndash; 175,000</td><td>1,871,791,838</td><td>11,601</td><td>482,446,104</td><td>161,347</td><td>41,587</td><td>25.8%</td></tr><tr><td>175,001 &ndash; 200,000</td><td>1,295,536,585</td><td>6,944</td><td>344,645,246</td><td>186,569</td><td>49,632</td><td>26.6%</td></tr><tr><td>200,001 &ndash; 250,000</td><td>1,714,547,953</td><td>7,718</td><td>469,551,354</td><td>222,149</td><td>60,383</td><td>27.4%</td></tr><tr><td>250,001 &ndash; 300,000</td><td>1,155,249,712</td><td>4,327</td><td>324,876,900</td><td>272,657</td><td>76,676</td><td>28.1%</td></tr><tr><td>300,001 -  350,000</td><td>815,682,198</td><td>2,530</td><td>235,605,616</td><td>322,404</td><td>93,125</td><td>28.9%</td></tr><tr><td>350,001 &ndash; 400,000</td><td>591,932,771</td><td>1,585</td><td>171,761,138</td><td>373,459</td><td>108,369</td><td>29.0%</td></tr><tr><td>400,001 &ndash; 450,000</td><td>436,035,890</td><td>1,028</td><td>132,133,368</td><td>424,159</td><td>128,534</td><td>30.3%</td></tr><tr><td>450,001 &ndash; 500,000</td><td>352,328,419</td><td>743</td><td>107,279,137</td><td>474,197</td><td>144,386</td><td>30.4%</td></tr><tr><td>500,001 &ndash; 750,000</td><td>1,157,652,860</td><td>1,927</td><td>350,608,421</td><td>600,754</td><td>181,945</td><td>30.3%</td></tr><tr><td>750,001 &ndash; 1,000,000</td><td>554,709,996</td><td>648</td><td>165,893,488</td><td>856,034</td><td>256,008</td><td>29.3%</td></tr><tr><td>1,000,001 &ndash; 2,000,000</td><td>733,261,467</td><td>549</td><td>214,029,105</td><td>1,335,631</td><td>389,853</td><td>29.2%</td></tr><tr><td>Over 2,000,000</td><td>527,352,863</td><td>130</td><td>150,954,072</td><td>4,056,560</td><td>1,161,185</td><td>28.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Overall Total</td><td>81,659,329,617</td><td>2,166,411</td><td>11,434,414,947</td><td>37,693</td><td>5,278</td><td>14.0%</td></tr></table></p><p>  It should be noted that the income ranges shown in the above table relate to Gross Income as defined in Revenue Statistical Report 2011.</p><p>  The figures are estimates from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2011 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends in the interim.

The process involved consolidating property address data, which was extracted from various Government and non-Government sources, in respect of almost two million records. In some instances the data matching was complicated by different variations in addresses and names held by the different agencies. In some instances, particularly in rural locations, the prevalence of non-unique addresses complicated the automatic upload of data to the Property Register. These relatively small number of cases required manual intervention to match the property to the correct owner.    In this, I am advised that the person in question was not correctly linked to his property at the time of the 2013 LPT general issue.  The required linkage did not take place because the person&rsquo;s PPS number was not active on Revenue&rsquo;s computer system at that time.  As a consequence no correspondence issued to the person in regard to his LPT obligations.</p><p>  Revenue has confirmed that the person&rsquo;s daughter did file the 2013 Return through the online system and paid the tax due on his behalf. However, while the Return and payment were correctly recorded, the person&rsquo;s PPS number did not transfer across to the Property Register and again as a consequence no output issued to him for 2014. </p><p>  Revenue has assured me that the person&rsquo;s details are now correctly linked on the Property Register and his records are fully up to date, in regard to both 2013 and 2014.</p></reply>

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the legislative provisions concerning deduction of LPT from certain Department of Social Protection payments were drafted in consultation with that Department.  The Commissioners have confirmed that LPT can only be deducted from the State Pension (Contributory and Non-Contributory), Widow/Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Contributory and Non-Contributory Pension, State Pension (Transition), One-Parent Family payment, Invalidity Pension, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Disability Allowance and Blind Pension.  It is therefore not possible to facilitate the deduction requested by the Deputy.  </p><p>  I am advised by my colleague the Minister for Social Protection that Deserted Wife&rsquo;s Allowance and Deserted Wife&rsquo;s Benefit are social welfare payments made to women who were deserted by their husbands.  These schemes closed to new applications in January, 1997 when the One-Parent Family payment was introduced.  I am also advised by Minister for Social Protection that given the relatively small numbers of customers involved and the complexity of the amendments to the social welfare legislation which would be required to implement deduction at source of LPT from these closed schemes, such amendments are not justified in the context of social welfare legislation.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners further advise that property owners can choose from a wide range of options for paying the tax and information on these options is available on their website or by calling the LPT helpline on 1890 200 255.  As the e-filing deadline for 2014 has now passed, property owners are advised to submit their Payment Instruction for 2014 to Revenue as soon as possible either by accessing their LPT record online or by calling the LPT helpline. </p></reply>

Within her independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members.   I have been informed that it has been necessary to put lending restrictions in place in credit unions where there are regulatory concerns about the operation of these individual credit unions and the resultant risk to members' savings.</p><p>  The criteria assessed to determine the imposition of lending restrictions includes, but is not limited to the following:</p><p>  -  Prudential returns which are unaudited returns, submitted to the RCU;</p><p>  -  Financial ratios which cover  level of arrears and provision coverage; and</p><p>  -  The governance framework within the credit union.</p><p>  Decisions on regulatory restrictions which are imposed in the form of directions under the Act are made by the Registrar.  Other regulatory restrictions may be imposed as part of on-going supervisory engagement.  These may be dealt with by the Registrar, but they may also be dealt with by a member of the management team, depending on the issue.</p><p>  Credit union lending restrictions currently in place are reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether they are still set at appropriate levels. Lending restrictions are typically given effect by regulatory directions. As from 1 August 2013 regulatory directions are appealable to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal - IFSAT.</p><p>  Overall in the current environment, in relation to lending, all credit unions are required to ensure that they apply enhanced scrutiny to all new loan applications and that all applications are fully assessed to determine the borrower&rsquo;s ability to repay. Credit unions are also required to ensure that they put in place clear limits on the total funds available for granting loans, bearing in mind the need to ensure that a credit union maintains adequate levels of liquidity to support its operations.</p></reply>

Where a liable person sells their residential property between 2 November 2013 and 31 December 2013, provided that they owned the property on 1 November 2013, they will be liable to pay LPT on that property for 2014.  </p><p>  The 1 November liability date has been the subject of a number of previous Parliamentary Questions.  In reply to Questions Nos. 221 (49518/13) and 223 (49556/13) on 19 November 2013 I stated that having a liability date before the year commences is preferable as there is certainty about who the liable person is for the coming year, that person has a reasonable amount of time to make the necessary provisions and they have access to the widest possible range of options for paying the tax.  </p><p>  For a tax such as LPT to function properly, legislation must specify a liability date for the tax to have application for a particular year.  Whatever date is prescribed, the question of liability when there is a change of ownership has to be managed and I expect the LPT liability is likely to be factored in during negotiations between the parties on the sale price and the closing date of a particular contract.  </p><p>  An individual selling a property will often be purchasing another property at around the same time.  While a vendor who owns a property on 1 November 2013 is liable for the 2014 LPT on that property, if they do not purchase another property before 1 November 2013 they will not be liable for the 2014 LPT on that &quot;replacement&quot; property - whoever is the owner as of 1 November 2013 will be liable.</p><p>Detailed guidance on LPT issues arising in the context of the sale or transfer of a residential property was prepared by the Revenue Commissioners in consultation with the Law Society and is available since last August on the Revenue website at <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i>   and on the Law Society&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

The charge for this service is based on local rates and <font color="#2F2F2F">the cost of the call is shared between the calling party and the called party.  </font>The Commissioners use 1890 &ldquo;LoCall&rdquo; numbers for some of their most popular services including their helpline for PAYE taxpayers.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible to advise on the cost to a person of phoning the Local Property Tax 1890 telephone helpline.  The price is dependent on the individual&rsquo;s phone network as well as the type of &lsquo;phone package&rsquo; that the individual has with his/her operator.  Some operators operate on a price per call basis while others charge per minute.    The requirement for owners of multiple properties to file and pay LPT Returns electronically is contained in the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended).  The Commissioners have confirmed that a significant number of multiple property owners are already obliged, by virtue of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, to pay and file electronically other tax returns they complete and this is in keeping with Revenue&rsquo;s strategic objective to encourage the use of electronic channels.  It is also in line with the Government&rsquo;s e-agenda for service delivery.</p><p>  Revenue&rsquo;s on-line system for filing and paying LPT is secure, user friendly and easily accessible on the Revenue website.  From the taxpayer&rsquo;s perspective, using the on-line system is the quickest and most straightforward way to file Returns and pay the tax, particularly so where there are multiple properties involved, as the system automatically calculates the LPT due for the individual properties and makes it easy to select a payment method from the wide range of options available.  In addition, property owners who use the on-line system also benefit from a three-week extended filing deadline.  Providing an extension to filing deadlines is common practice when a taxpayer uses Revenue&rsquo;s online services to meet his/her obligations.  </p><p>  Section 36 of the Act allows a property owner to nominate another person, such as a relative, to file and pay on-line on their behalf.  Furthermore, owners can call the LPT Helpline 1890 200 255, where there is a dedicated service whereby the return may be filed on-line on their behalf.  This particular service has been extensively used by owners of more than one property. </p></reply>

The process involved consolidating property address data, which was extracted from various Government and non-Government sources, in respect of almost two million records.  In some instances the data matching was complicated by different variations in addresses and names held by the different agencies.  In some instances these variations resulted in either duplications on the Property Register or people being incorrectly linked to properties for which they were not the liable person.    In regard to the case referred to by the Deputy, the 2013 LPT 1 Return issued to the address that Revenue previously used when corresponding with the person in question.  The LPT 1 Return was returned to Revenue by the current occupiers of this property but no alternative address was supplied in respect of the person in question.  The person did subsequently fulfill her 2013 LPT obligations through the online system but did so without using the correct property identification number.  This resulted in a &lsquo;mis-match&rsquo; between the person in question and her new property, which resulted in the 2014 payment request notification not issuing. </p><p>  Revenue has confirmed to me that the person in question has now been correctly matched with her new property and her records are fully in order.  Revenue has also confirmed that it will make direct contact with the person in the coming days in this regard and also to offer her any assistance she might require in meeting her 2014 LPT obligations. </p></reply>

LPT is a self-assessed tax so it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property as at 1 May 2013.  For the purposes of LPT, values for properties under &euro;1 million are organised into valuation bands, with an initial band of &euro;0 to &euro;100,000 and 18 bands of &euro;50,000 width from &euro;100,001 to &euro;1 million  As property owners were not required to provide a precise value for their property, it is anticipated that for the most part overpayments of LPT should not happen.   When completing their LPT Return earlier this year, it was expected that property owners would make their best endeavours to self-assess the value of their property at 1 May 2013 and the Revenue Commissioners provided guidance, including an online valuation guidance tool, to assist property owners in making their self-assessment.</p><p>  I am also advised that the initial valuation of a property on 1 May 2013, assuming it was made in good faith, is valid up to and including 2016 and will not be affected by any increase or decrease in property prices or other changes, during this period.  Accordingly where the owner self-assessed the value of their residential property on 1 May 2013 and placed it in a particular valuation band but, due to a general decrease in property prices after that date, the property has sold for an amount less than the self-assessed amount, the owner would not be entitled to a refund of tax.  In the same way, if the property had increased in value in that period, no additional LPT charge would apply.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners have confirmed that if the liable person has genuinely overpaid the tax through an error or mistake concerning the property&rsquo;s value as at 1 May 2013, then they should write to LPT Branch, Government Buildings, Ennis, Co Clare, setting out fully the nature of the error or mistake and explaining the circumstances in which the overpayment arose.  They are required to provide any relevant documentation to support the basis for their self-assessed valuation at 1 May 2013 which may include professional valuations obtained at the time or house price surveys for the area.  They should also indicate whether they relied on Revenue&rsquo;s online valuation guidance tool for the purposes of their self-assessment.</p><p>  I am further advised by the Commissioners that once the relevant documentation is received LPT Branch will make direct contact with the person. Should it transpire that the person did in fact genuinely overpay the 2013 liability, on account of their error or mistake in self-assessing the valuation band at 1 May 2013 for their residential property, it will then be possible to offset some or all of the overpayment to the 2014 liability, if appropriate, or to make a repayment.</p></reply>

This policy area includes pensions adequacy to ensure sufficient income in retirement, the sustainability of the pension system in the light of demographic and investment challenges, the modernity of pension systems and overall equity within the pension system.  The Department of Finance has responsibility for general insurance policy issues and in that regard negotiates and transposes insurance directives the bulk of which underpin how insurance companies can conduct their business in Ireland and elsewhere from a prudential perspective. The Department is also responsible for developing and enacting domestic insurance legislation where appropriate e.g. the Insurance Act 2011.</p><p>  Furthermore the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is responsible for pension&rsquo;s policy in the public sector.</p><p>  While the Department of Social Protection has the lead policy role, there is an integrated whole of Government approach taken towards the issue of Pensions Policy. A Cabinet Committee on Pensions which includes the Departments of Social Protection, Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, as well as the Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation, meets regularly. Where overlaps in policy responsibility exist the Government Departments concerned engage closely to ensure the continued coherency and relevance of public policy.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-12-03a.197.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013120300056#WRD02200"><p>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the encashment option provided for by section 787TA of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which was inserted into that Act by section 18(7)(b) of the Finance Act 2012. In that regard, I would like to clarify that the encashment option confers no rights on public servants to early access to pension benefits.  The encashment option operates in the context of the Standard Fund Threshold (SFT) regime, which places a life-time limit on an individual&rsquo;s tax&ndash;relieved pension benefits. The SFT regime is designed to discourage over-funding of pension savings by such means. It addresses the problem of pension overfunding and excessive pension accrual by imposing a penal tax charge on the value of retirement benefits above set limits when they are drawn down. In this way, it acts to deter the building up of large pension funds in the first place or unwinds the tax advantage of such overfunding by clawing back, through the penal tax charge, the tax relief granted. Among other changes to the SFT regime being introduced by Finance (No.2) Bill 2013, is a reduction in the value of the life-time limit from its current level of &euro;2.3 million to &euro;2 million, with effect from 1 January 2014.</p><p>  The encashment option was introduced to deal with particular difficulties that individuals with both private and public service pension arrangements would otherwise face from the operation of the SFT regime.  An individual in the private sector is generally able to prevent or minimise any breaching of the SFT, or a Personal Fund Threshold (PFT), if he or she has one, by ceasing to contribute to, or accrue benefits under, a pension scheme. However, affected individuals in the public service have no control over their accrual of public service pension entitlements and, as a result, significant chargeable excesses could arise on the public service pension entitlement at retirement in certain circumstances. This is the case where such individuals have built up substantial private sector pension savings before taking up a public service career.</p><p>  Because the SFT regime operates by aggregating the capital value of pension benefits taken over time, where such private sector benefits are drawn down first their capital value would aggregate with the capital value of the public service pension rights when subsequently drawn down, resulting in, as mentioned, very significant chargeable excesses and penal tax charges on the public service pension which the affected individual would be powerless to abate.</p><p>  Concerns were expressed that this could have a significant disincentive effect for some people to remain in the public service or hinder the future recruitment into the public service of exceptionally well-qualified people from the private sector.</p><p>  To deal with this, I introduced a once&ndash;off opportunity for individuals who meet the qualifying conditions, to encash their private sector pension rights, in whole or in part, from age 60, with a view to preventing or minimising the chargeable excess that would otherwise arise when the public service pension crystallises. The private sector pension rights concerned would invariably be personal pensions which would be accessible from age 60 in any event (so there is no issue of early access). The exercise of the option attracts tax at the point of encashment on the full value of the rights at a ring-fenced rate of 41% plus USC of 4%. This is aimed at broadly neutralising the tax relief that such individuals enjoyed when building up their private pension funds. No tax-free lump sum is available from the pension scheme where the encashment option is exercised and it is the pension scheme administrator who is primarily responsible for deducting and remitting the &ldquo;encashment tax&rdquo; to Revenue.</p><p>  The qualifying conditions can be summarised as follows. Firstly, the individual must, on 8 February 2012 (the date of publication of the 2012 Finance Bill), be a &ldquo;relevant individual&rdquo;, meaning that he or she must;</p><p>  - Be a member of both a private sector and public service pension scheme, or</p><p>  - Be a member of a public service pension scheme and have drawn down their private sector pensions in the period 7 December 2005 to 7 February 2012, or</p><p>  - Be a member of a private sector scheme on, or after, 7 February 2012 and subsequently become a member of a public service scheme, and</p><p>  - Remain an active member of the public service scheme until their retirement date.</p><p>  Secondly, the combined capital value of the pension scheme savings, both private and public, must be likely to exceed the SFT, or the individuals PFT, if they have one, in circumstances where the intention is that the public service pension benefits will be crystallised or drawn down last (i.e. after all the private sector pensions benefits have been drawn down). It is this sequence of cashing in the private sector benefits first that would place the individual in a position whereby a chargeable excess would fall mostly, or entirely, on the public service pension. In extreme situations, where an individual, on taking up a pensionable post in the public service, had already built up private sector pension savings equal to the SFT, or the individual&rsquo;s PFT, every euro of public service pension accrued would be subject to chargeable excess tax of 41% in addition to the tax on the pension at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate when paid out.</p><p>  It is important to note, that in no case can the exercise of the encashment option reduce the chargeable excess tax due on an individual&rsquo;s public service pension benefits if the capital value of those benefits on their own exceeds the SFT or the individual&rsquo;s PFT.</p><p>  The option came into effect from 8 February 2012 (the date of publication of Finance Bill 2012) with transitional arrangements for affected individuals who may have drawn down their private sector pensions before that date but remained members of a public service scheme on or after that date.</p></reply>

The chargeable persons for the levy are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) with responsibility for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans. The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled, where they decide to do so, to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy. It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible.</p><p>  I have no plans to develop a tax credit in the manner suggested in the question. The 0.6% levy which has applied since 2011 will end after 2014. The additional levy of 0.15% which I announced in Budget 2014 will apply for 2014 and 2015. I do not consider that the levy applying on this basis will have any significant long-term disincentive effect on pension saving. As I re-iterated in my Budget 2014 speech, tax relief on contributions to pension savings will continue at the marginal income tax rate.</p></reply>

The application of the new age-related valuation factors to Defined Benefit pension rights accrued after 1 January 2014, reflects legal advice which I received to the effect that pension savings and pension rights accrued up to that date should be protected. On foot of that advice, and as occurred on the occasion of the introduction of the SFT regime in 2005 and again when the value of the SFT limit was reduced to &euro;2.3m in 2010, the legislation contained in the Finance Bill provides for an individual who has pension rights on 1 January 2014 in excess of the new lower SFT limit of &euro;2m, to claim a Personal Fund Threshold (PFT) from Revenue in order to protect or &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; the value of those rights on that date. This is subject to a maximum PFT of &euro;2.3m (the level of the current SFT) and individuals with PFTs from 2005 or 2010 retain those PFTs. The ability to claim a PFT applies to affected individuals with Defined Benefit or Defined Contribution pension rights or who have a combination of  both.</p><p>  However, unlike previous occasions, the protection or &ldquo;grandfathering&rdquo; arrangements this time around had to take cognisance not just of the reduction in the absolute level of the SFT from 1 January 2014 from &euro;2.3m to &euro;2m, but also of the increase, from that date, in the valuation factors used for converting Defined Benefit pension rights into capital value equivalents for the purposes of the SFT regime. It is for that reason, lest there be any suggestion that the changes had retrospective application, that such rights accrued up to 1 January 2014 are to be capitalised at the existing valuation factor of 20, both for the purposes of determining if there is a PFT and for placing a capital value on those rights at the time of retirement, where that takes place after 1 January 2014.</p><p>  The estimated yield of &euro;120 million from the proposed changes to the SFT regime is based to a significant degree on assumed behavioural impacts. The yield is expected to arise in two ways. Firstly and mainly, from the cessation of tax-relieved contributions to pension saving from those employees and individuals in the private sector affected in the short to medium term by the changes and secondly by the conversion, to some degree, of employer pension contributions and pension promises in respect of those employed individuals into compensatory current taxable remuneration. In addition, some of the yield will also arise from affected individuals who remain in pension arrangements and continue to contribute to them or accrue benefits under them, and will take the form of chargeable excess tax payable at retirement where their SFT or PFT, as appropriate, is exceeded. This increased tax will effectively claw back any tax subsidy which helped fund the excess over the SFT or PFT. Given the range of variable assumptions on which the estimate of the yield from the current changes is based, I do not consider that a reliable estimate of yield could be provided on foot of the hypothetical assumption contained in the question.</p></reply>

Under Section 42 of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 all designated bodies (including all financial institutions) are required to report to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners all suspicious transactions, including any unusually large cash movements.  Similarly, any solicitors or other practitioners who execute property transfer instruments are also designated persons for the purposes of the money laundering legislation and must satisfy themselves as to the source of purchase monies in drawing up the transfer instrument and report anything untoward to the Garda&iacute; and to Revenue.</p><p>  Cases are selected by Revenue for examination based on the presence of various risk indicators.  The Revenue Commissioners are assisted in that process by their Risk Evaluation Analysis and Profiling (REAP) system that contains various types of information including information relating to the purchase of property and suspicious transactions involving the movement of monies.  In the case selection process, of particular interest to Revenue are those individuals whose funds used to purchase a property appear to have come from hidden or undeclared income or from unexplained wealth.  In such cases, Revenue carry out the necessary &lsquo;checks and balances&rsquo; with a view to determining whether the money used to fund (or part fund) the purchase of a property came from illegal activity, including the shadow economy. Where the explanation as to the source of money used to purchase a property is not creditable, Revenue then carry out further checks, including audits or investigations, which may result in Revenue seeking additional tax, interest on late payment of tax and penalties as well as prosecutions for making false tax returns.</p><p>  I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they do not retain statistics for each separate risk factor used to trigger a case for examination as the case selection of a case for examination generally includes a number of risk factors including the level of income shown in a person&rsquo;s tax returns.  However, I am assured by the Revenue Commissioners that they are very mindful that cash obtained from illegal activities can be used to purchase properties and I am satisfied that their overall compliance programme focusses significant resources on the cash sector which includes examining the use to which undeclared cash amounts have been put.</p><p>  Lastly, cases involving serious criminality and proceeds of crime are investigated by the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB).  CAB is resourced by officials from the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office, the Department of Social Protection &amp;amp; the Revenue Commissioners.

I am doing this to continue to help fund the <i>Jobs Initiative</i>, including the continuation of the reduced 9% VAT rate detailed below and to make provision for potential State liabilities which may emerge from pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties. The additional levy within the existing legal framework will apply to pension fund assets in 2014 and 2015.  The yield from the pension fund levy in 2014 is estimated at &euro;675 million. The yield from the pension fund levy at the reduced rate of 0.15% in 2015 is estimated at &euro;135 million.</p><p>  The revenues arising to the Exchequer from the levy are, in common with Exchequer revenues generally, not hypothecated to any particular item of expenditure or liability but have been used to help fund the various measures introduced by the <i>Jobs Initiative</i>. I have no plans to change this approach. One of the very significant and successful measures introduced by the <i>Jobs Initiative</i> &ndash; the reduced VAT rate of 9% on tourism and certain other services &ndash; was due to end this year. In my Budget speech, I announced the continuation of the reduced 9% VAT rate. I also announced that the Air Travel Tax is being reduced to zero with effect from 1 April 2014.  The combined cost of these initiatives is estimated at close to &euro;400 million in a full year.</p><p>  The <i>Jobs Initiative</i> also included a number of current and capital expenditure measures. While the details of the expenditure on these measures are a matter for my colleagues in Cabinet, I would ask the Deputy to note that the <i>Jobs Initiative</i>   originally provided for 5,000 places under Jobbridge, the National Internship scheme and 5,900 places under the Springboard scheme. Numbers who have participated in Jobbridge have now exceeded 20,000 with an evaluation by Indecon Economic Consultants finding that 61.4% of survey respondents were in employment within 5 months of finishing their internships. The Springboard scheme, now in its third iteration, has expanded to over 16,500 places. The expansion of these schemes, reflective of their success, will require further funding from the Exchequer.</p><p>  The extent of the potential State liabilities from the pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties is a matter primarily for my colleague the Minister for Social Protection. However, I can say that agreement has been secured for these liabilities to be met by the Exchequer, where they arise. As I have already indicated, however, the proceeds from the levy that accrue to the Exchequer are not set aside in the manner suggested in the question and expenditure decisions on the use of those and other funds will be made as they arise in the normal way.</p></reply>

This is most likely due to the expiry of patents on certain &lsquo;blockbuster&rsquo; drugs, an effect known as the &lsquo;patent cliff&rsquo;. The patent cliff has also weighed down on GDP, given the comparatively large weighting of the sector in Irish output and exports.</p><p>  The impact of the patent cliff is likely to result in some shift in Irish pharmaceutical production away from branded blockbuster drugs towards generic drugs. When discussing the statistical treatment, consider the example where, in a given quarter, the patented version leaves the relevant price index and the off-patented version and/or generic equivalent enters.   The Central Statistics Office (CSO) will treat these as a new product, rather than the same product at a lower price. This means that any decline in the value of production would be accounted for as a volume shift rather than a price change as there is no change in the price index <i>per se</i>  . This methodology is in line with current international practice.</p><p>  However the precise impact of the patent cliff on Irish production patterns remains to be seen. It is not certain that production of chemically-identical drugs will always continue in Irish plants in a post-patent environment. Also, residual loyalty for branded drugs can often remain even after patent expiry, implying continued demand for production of the patented variety.</p><p>  My Department, when forecasting the impact of the patent cliff on economic output, does so with consideration of the methodology used by the CSO. </p></reply>

It is general policy and practice  that all such resources are made available online for free download.  </p><p>  The Department's portal for Irish education, Scoilnet.ie, is currently being  redeveloped into a repository for digital learning materials. It will focus on  the sharing of teaching resources and will support and encourage teachers to  share and download resources for use in their classroom. Open licensing will be  a core component of the new repository to facilitate teachers in the reuse and  adaptation of materials for their individual classroom needs. Where possible,  publicly funded materials developed in recent years by Dept of Education  support services will be made available within the repository under open  licences.</p></reply>

QQI assumed responsibility for the functions undertaken by those bodies including those functions, such as ACELS, which are carried out on an administrative basis.</p><p>  Since its establishment, QQI has been undertaking a comprehensive policy development programme, in order to put in place the policies and processes required to perform its functions under the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012. During this process, QQI has prioritised the development of those policies required to allow new applications from providers who wish to have access to the awards of QQI, and those policies were published in October. QQI will continue to roll out its remaining policies over the coming months.</p><p>  The operation of ACELS will be discontinued by QQI when its policies relating to the Code of Practice for the provision of education to international learners, and the related International Education Mark (IEM), are established next year. The Code of Practice and IEM will place the recognition and monitoring of the English Language sector by QQI on a statutory footing.</p><p>  Given the expected timeframe for the establishment of those policies, QQI decided to re-open access to ACELS recognition for a temporary period until 31 January 2014, to accommodate those English Language Training Organisations (ELTOs) who were ready to apply and who had expressed an interest in gaining recognition for 2014. As ACELS recognition is granted on an annual basis, this period is sufficient to allow interested ELTOs to apply and, where appropriate, gain recognition for 2014. Recognition from 2015 onwards will be granted in the context of the Code of Practice and International Education Mark. However, it should be noted that ACELS recognised ELTOs will not have an automatic enititlement to use the International Education Mark, but will have to demonstrate compliance with the Code of Practice and related policies.</p></reply>

The school authority is required to establish a process, record the details and make these available for audit purposes if required.</p><p>  The school authority is also obliged to advise the unsuccessful tenderers, if requested to do so, of the reasons that their tender was unsuccessful. Unsuccessful tenderers can be given information regarding the apparently successful tender but are not generally informed of their specific ranking in the list of unsucessful tenderers.</p><p>  In the interests of transparency and clarity, my Department has now contacted the school authority and advised it to issue all relevant information as feedback to each of the unsuccessful tenderers. </p><p>  For the Deputy's information, I wish to advise that while my Department is governed by the provisions of the Freedom of Information Acts, schools are not included within the ambit of that legislation. </p></reply>

My Department provides for a range of services and supports to ensure that children with Special Educational Needs, including children with Dyspraxia or Developmental Co-ordination Delay, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs. </p><p>  These supports include additional teaching and care support, enhanced capitation, specialist school transport arrangements, assistive technology and/or specialist equipment, adaptations for school buildings where necessary and additional training for teachers of children with special educational needs, including teachers of children with Dyspraxia. Children with Dyspraxia may be entitled to additional teaching provision in school, either under the terms of the general allocation system of teaching supports if the educational psychological assessment places the child in the high incidence disability category or through an allocation of additional resources if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's circular. The precise level of support is determined by the special educational needs of the particular child. </p><p>  Guidance has been provided for schools on the manner in which they should use the resources that have been allocated to them to best effect. My Department's Circular 02/05, which issued to all Primary schools, provides guidelines in relation to the establishment of a staged approach to assessment, identification and learning programme planning for pupils with special educational needs. Guidance for schools is provided in the circular for each step of the staged process.  </p><p>  In addition, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) has produced guidelines for schools entitled 'Special Needs Education &ndash; A Continuum of Support' which describes the graduated problem-solving model of assessment and intervention in schools, which is available on my Department's website www.education.gov.ie. </p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for the provision of a range of educational services at local and national level for students with special educational needs. In particular, its network of Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) co-ordinates special needs education provision at local level and arranges for the delivery of special educational services. The SENOs act as single points of contact for parents of students with special educational needs. </p><p>  Each SENO works in an assigned local area with parents, schools, teachers, psychologists, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services in that area for children with special educational needs. All schools have contact details of their local SENO and it is also open to parents to contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs. The NCSE has recently published an Information Booklet for Parents of Children with Special Educational Needs, which is available on its website www.ncse.ie. </p><p>  Finally, the Department provides for support for teachers with additional training needs in the area of Dyspraxia. The Special Education Support Service (SESS) manages, co-ordinates and develops a range of supports in response to identified teacher training needs. The SESS provides Continuing Professional Development (CPD) support for teachers of pupils with Dyspraxia through an Inclusive Learning Resource Teachers course as well as an online resource facility and an online book borrowing facility.</p></reply>

At the core of these arrangements is reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding. The Department provides funding directly to voluntary secondary schools by way of per capita grants. However, grants for the day-to-day running costs of ETB schools and community colleges are issued to Education and Training Boards, not directly to schools, as part of a block grant. It is important to note that this block grant covers not only the day-to-day costs of schools but also the running costs of ETB head-offices and other activities apart from the second-level programme. Each ETB has a high level of autonomy in the management and appropriation of this grant and may distribute its allocations in line with its priorities and perceptions of need. </p><p>  I am aware that the JMB's Pre-Budget Submission for 2012 suggested a difference of &euro;212 in funding for each student attending a voluntary secondary school, in comparison to an ETB school or college. The Deputy should note that additional funding has been provided to voluntary secondary schools by way of "equalisation" measures since 2001. It is estimated that up to &euro;21m has been provided in equalisation funding between 2001 and 2009. While the current economic situation has slowed progress in that regard, it remains the Department's aim, depending on resource availability, to addressing anomalies in funding between the post-primary sectors. I do not believe that the funding arrangements for schools has any major bearing on decisions made by parents as to which second level school they will enrol their children.</p></reply>

It is used to add new properties to the list, to amend the valuations of altered properties and to remove demolished or defunct properties from the list. The valuations of commercial properties at revision are determined by reference to the net annual values of comparable properties on the same valuation list. That is to say that they are compared with similar type properties in the same local authority area to ensure, in so far as it is possible, that they are all treated equally. While there are some arrears of casework in this area, they are not significant and in any event, revision applications received from the public are disposed of without undue delay. While there has been a marked decrease in the number of applications for revision of valuation in recent years, mainly due to the economic downturn, the vast majority of applications are from the local authorities with whom the Valuation Office is in close liaison, to ensure that priority cases are dealt with as expeditiously as possible and to agree timelines for the delivery of revisions generally. </p><p>  The Valuation Office has also been conducting a National Revaluation Programme. In a revaluation the entire commercial valuation list for a local authority is brought up-to-date by reference to values at a specific valuation date and the entire list is published on one date (usually 31 December) and comes into effect for rating purposes on 1 January the following year.  To-date, revaluations of the commercial list have been completed in South Dublin, Fingal and Dun Laoghaire County Council areas and the revaluation programme for the Dublin City Council area is currently underway and is expected to be completed by 31st December, 2013. Additionally, the revaluation of properties in all the local authority areas of Waterford and Limerick will be completed in 2013 and 2014 respectively.</p><p>  The Commissioner is pursuing a balanced programme of revision and revaluation casework and with the completion of the Dublin City and Waterford revaluation programmes imminent, a concentration of effort is being applied currently to the revision work programme in consultation with the local authorities</p><p>  Conducting a revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties in the State has been the policy of successive Governments since enactment of the Valuation Act 2001. The Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2012 which had its second stage reading in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 11th October, 2012 and is currently awaiting Committee stage, provides for a number of initiatives to accelerate the overall revaluation programme, such as the piloting of a self-assessment scheme of valuation in one local authority area, which if it proves successful could be extended to other areas. There is also provision in the Bill to allow for the assessment of valuations by contract valuers under an external delivery scheme which is also being initiated as a pilot project. The Bill also contains provisions to streamline the overall process of revaluation and the appeal mechanisms available to ratepayers subsequent to the revaluation.</p><p>  Regarding the levying of rates, the position is that under Irish law, there is a distinct separation of function between the determination of valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates. The amount of rates payable by a ratepayer in any calendar year is a product of the valuation of that property determined by the Valuation Office and the annual rate on valuation (ARV) set annually by the elected members of the rating authority. Rates can only be collected by the rating authority on property which has been valued under the Valuation Act, 2001 and there is no mechanism to collect rates, retrospectively or otherwise, pending the determination and issue of the valuation under the Act.</p></reply>

The parties subsequently agreed to extend the ambit of the conciliation to encompass issues relating to other aspects of the scheme.  </p><p>  Several meetings took place between the parties under the auspices of the Conciliator. However, these discussions did not produce a solution that would allow the contract to be fulfilled to the satisfaction of both parties and in a manner that would deliver the level of flood protection the scheme was designed to provide, consistent with the accepted tender sum. </p><p>  In the course of the conciliation process it emerged that the contractor had entered Examinership. Bray Town Council and the OPW entered into discussions with SIAC and the Examiner, under the aegis of the Conciliator. After intensive negotiations, it was agreed last week that the best option available to the parties would be to terminate the contract with SIAC by mutual agreement. Based on this agreement, SIAC has now left the site, and it will be necessary to procure new contractors to carry out the remaining elements of the scheme.</p><p>  I understand that under Bray Town Council's contract with SIAC, the Council is not responsible for payment to sub-contractors or their employees.  </p><p>  Bray Town Council and the OPW remain fully committed to completing the scheme to provide the standard 1-in-100 year level of protection.

Both Bord na Mona and Coillte Teoranta are included in Schedule 1 Part 2.</p><p>  I believe that commercial state bodies should not, in general, be subject to FOI requirements because of the uneven competitive playing field that would be created in circumstances that commercial state bodies operating in a competitive market were subject to FOI but their privately-owned market competitors were not.  This would be expected to have an adverse impact on the commercial position of the state body in question, which would not be in the public interest or consistent with the need to safeguard the State&rsquo;s economic and financial interests.  </p><p>  It is on that basis that both Bord na Mona and Coillte Teoranta are proposed for exclusion from the application of FOI under the new legislation.</p></reply>

Enterprise Ireland has 30 offices worldwide to help Irish firms develop overseas markets. Each year, Enterprise Ireland organises a series of targeted international trade missions. </p><p>  The impact of trade missions together with the many other sales, marketing and trade promotion efforts of Enterprise Ireland are reflected in the growth in exports of Enterprise Ireland clients and the jobs they sustain and create. As announced earlier this year, Irish companies set a new record for level of exports achieved - &euro;16.2bn in 2012.  Exports now account for 54% of clients total sales, up from 51% in 2011. Total sales of client companies of Enterprise Ireland in 2012 exceeded &euro;30bn. Export growth was achieved across all overseas territories and this level of growth is greatly supported by an extensive promotional programme, including trade events, trade fairs and trade missions. The employment and export figures for Enterprise Ireland clients in 2013 will be available following the completion of annual surveys in 2014.</p><p>  There are obviously costs incurred by my Department and its agencies to ensure the success of these missions abroad. The table under shows the costs of the Trade Missions led by myself or Ministers of State in my Department since the Government came to office. It includes the travel and accommodation costs of the travelling Minister, officials from my Department and Enterprise Ireland, along with costs for Enterprise Ireland organised events, such as networking events and showcase events. It also takes account of contributions made by companies on trade missions.</p><p>  Significant business is undertaken on these trade missions and, on occasions, companies work through the agencies to publicise their business successes.  It is only when a company wishes to promote their success that Enterprise Ireland would publicise company activities. Press Releases from the trade missions which outline some of the successes of the Irish companies on these trade missions are included under.  Any other contracts that are signed would be a private matter for a company.  </p><p>  As regards the names of companies participating on trade missions, I am informed that Enterprise Ireland takes the view that, while there may be press activity around a particular trade mission, it is generally for participating companies to disclose their interest in particular markets and not a matter for Government or its agencies. Matters of commercial sensitivity can also be a factor, as I indicated in my reply to Question No. 285. On this basis and in light of advice from Enterprise Ireland concerning the above question, details of specific company participation were not released at that time. However, following further consideration of the matter by Enterprise Ireland, it has been decided, in this instance, to release the names of the participating companies and organisations which are listed below. </p><p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s previous Question, where neither a Minister nor Minister of State led a Trade Mission, I will arrange to have the information forwarded to the Deputy when it is received from Enterprise Ireland. </p><p>  </p></reply>

Based in Moscow, this trade mission was organised with the support of the Irish embassy in Russia and included 20 best-in-class Irish companies from the aviation sector. Russia has become a key export market over the past two years for many of these companies and the mission was aimed at reinforcing the broad range of products and services they offer to Russian airlines and aviation buyers.  The trade mission was built around Russia&rsquo;s leading aviation forum, &lsquo;Wings of Russia&rsquo;, which Minister Kelly addressed. The Minister&rsquo;s schedule during the visit included a series of meetings with representatives of the Russian Federation Government, Moscow City Government, Kaluga region Government, Russian Aviation Authorities, RosKosmos (the Russian Space Agency), meetings with Irish companies and their Russian partners and customers, and a series of events promoting the capabilities and strengths of Irish companies in the aviation sector. </p><p>  Enterprise Ireland does not currently have plans for a further trade mission to Russia in 2014.

The law is clear on the matter of employment of 3rd country nationals - it is illegal for such a 3rd country national to be employed without the State's permission and it is an offence for both the 3rd country national and the employer concerned.  Illegal employment of 3rd country nationals creates a serious problem for the employees concerned in that they do not have a legally binding contract of employment and cannot therefore rely on such a contract in asserting their rights under the contract and under the wide spectrum of employment rights legislation.</p><p>  Migrant workers are a vulnerable class of people and language difficulties, cultural differences, and lack of social networks can disadvantage migrants and increase the potential for abuse by unscrupulous employers. Ireland has a very thorough employment rights legal framework.  Careful consideration is given to the potential for abuse and many of the criteria in evaluating employment permits applications focus on the bona-fides of the employer and the protection of the employee.  This feature of the employment permits regime will be preserved in the new Employment Permits Bill currently being drafted.</p><p>  Following the result of the High Court Judgement of 31st August 2012 concerning Mr. Younis, I committed to amending the legislation in order to provide a defence for the employee which will then give the courts some discretion on the matter. Also, subject to Government approval, I intend to introduce new safeguards in the legislation that will ensure that the situation which arose in the Younis case will be prevented in future in a manner which does not undermine legal principles and ensures that an employer cannot benefit from the fact that a contract of employment is illegal and therefore not legally binding.</p><p>  Another key feature of the new Bill, subject to Government approval, will be the establishment on a statutory footing of an Employment Permit for dealing with 3rd country nationals who have, to use a parlance, &ldquo;fallen out of&rdquo; the Employment Permits regime. I recognise that there can be situations where such a 3rd country national can find themselves falling out of the Employment Permits&rsquo; regime through circumstances beyond their control or even as a result of their omission to keep their Employment Permit up to date.  Such people may have established roots in Ireland and it can be in the public interest to facilitate a reactivation of their inclusion within a legal employment framework through the granting of an Employment Permit.</p><p>  There will be three overriding principles concerning an application for an Employment Permit of this type. Firstly, the application process and administration must be clear and approachable from the perspective of an applicant. Secondly, the employee concerned must have originally entered the labour market legally through the Employment Permits system. I do not want to create a mechanism capable of abuse or considered as an alternative to the normal Employment Permit process. Also, it is logical that an Employment Permits Bill deals only with Employment Permits matters. The third principle will be that the employee must not currently be in employment illegally &ndash; it would be counter-intuitive for an applicant to apply for a permit under one section of the Act whilst at the same time potentially committing an offence under another section of the Act.</p><p>  I should also point out that it continues to be the case that an employer can be prosecuted for breaches of employment law including the Employment Permits Acts and it is the National Employment Rights Authority&rsquo;s policy to pursue such breaches. </p><p>  Finally, in terms of the current status of the Employment Permits Bill, the drafting process is almost concluded and I envisage submitting it to Government for approval at the earliest opportunity.</p></reply>

What is clear from the Forfas report is that social enterprises are not a homogenous group.  There are many different types of social enterprises engaged in a wide variety of activity.  The spectrum ranges from enterprises that are fully dependent on State support, to a small number of commercially trading companies.  </p><p>  The Forfas report shows that supports for social enterprises are provided by a number of Government Departments and agencies.  These include the Department of Social Protection, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Health/HSE.  Social enterprises that are operating commercially and developing self-sustaining business models can currently benefit from advisory supports provided by the City and County Enterprise Boards which come under the remit of my Department.  However, the Forfas report indicates that of 1,400 social enterprises in Ireland in 2009, only one-third generated any trading income.</p><p>  Funding is also available to social enterprises under the new Microenterprise Loan Fund which is administered by Microfinance Ireland.  </p><p>  The Taoiseach has assigned responsibility to Minister of State Sean Sherlock, T.D. on a personal basis for developing the social enterprise sector across Government, with secretariat support provided by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>  Minister Sherlock has established and chairs an Inter-Departmental Group which includes the key Departments of Environment, Community and Local Government, Social Protection, Agriculture, Food and Marine, Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Health, and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. The group held its first meeting in October, and is scheduled to meet again in December. </p></reply>

The Report followed from the establishment in May 2011 of the Copyright Review Committee to examine current Irish copyright legislation to identify any areas that might be perceived as creating barriers to innovation and to make recommendations as to how these barriers might be overcome through changes to legislation.    The Report, published by the Copyright Review Committee, involved an extensive consultation process by the Committee, and contains in excess of 60 recommendations covering a diverse range of copyright issues.  My Department is currently engaged in conducting a detailed analysis of the recommendations in the Report which I expect will take until early 2014 to complete. I would hope thereafter, to be in a position to bring the results of our examination to Government with recommendations, including in relation to proposed legislative amendments.</p><p>  As part of our initial examination of the Report&rsquo;s recommendations, I am very interested in hearing the views of all interested parties so that, as a first step, my Department has arranged for the convening of a public Forum at which the members of the Copyright Review Committee will be present to present on the Report and to respond to issues arising.

The STEA provides immediate access to support where people who have lost their jobs and qualify for jobseekers&rsquo; benefit wish to set up a business.  Payment under the scheme is at the same rate and for the same duration as their entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.</p><p>  The BTWEA is designed to allow the long term unemployed, lone parents, people with disabilities and other social welfare recipients to return to the active labour force by setting up a self-employment business. Participants on this scheme retain a reducing proportion of their qualifying social welfare payment over two years. In general, the qualifying period for the back to work enterprise allowance is twelve months in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment.  Under both schemes, those taking up self-employment must develop a viable and sustainable business plan.  Support for the presentation of business idea and subsequent development of a business plan is available from local development companies and this Department&rsquo;s local employment support/case officers.  My Department also provides further support to people who qualify for the BTWEA through the Technical Assistance and Training Scheme (TATS).  TATS allows access to up to &euro;1,000 of grant support towards certain business start-up expenses.  </p><p>  The Department can also provide support to self-employed persons who experience business downturn and need assistance by way of income support via the jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) provides a basic weekly allowance to eligible people who have little or no income. A person can continue to work in their business and get income support, other conditions having been met</p><p>Details of all schemes and self-employment supports are available on the Department&rsquo;s  website    or by visiting any of the Department&rsquo;s offices or Intreo centres.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-12-03a.393.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013120300060#WRH03100"><p>A key objective of the transfer of the Community Welfare Service from the Health Service Executive to the Department on 1st October 2011 was to provide a streamlined and consistent service to the customer.  As part of this process and to support the Department&rsquo;s activation commitments under the Pathways to Work Programme and the development of Intreo services nationally, it has been necessary to review the administration of all its services across its remit including the community welfare service (CWS). </p><p>  The Pathways to Work Programme includes the provision of opportunities, support and assistance to unemployed people by intensifying the Department&rsquo;s level of engagement with them, in particular, those who are, or become, long-term unemployed.  The Intreo service delivery model offers practical, tailored employment services and supports for jobseekers and this new service model, which is more efficient in its delivery, is currently being rolled out across the country with roll-out due to be completed for all offices by end 2014.  It is expected that three hundred staff will be redeployed to these activities by the end of the year including staff from the CWS.</p><p>  Overall, this is resulting in a rebalancing of resources across the Department&rsquo;s range of activities including the relocation of some staff to main centres, primarily Intreo offices. The introduction of Intreo is not intended to dispense with the CWS service but will provide a full range of services, including the CWS and these will, in general, be available in one location.  </p><p>  The CWS play a vital role within the overall social welfare system in providing a responsive and flexible approach to meeting the needs of the disadvantaged.  The role of the CWS and the objectives of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme which they administer are compatible with the goals and objectives of this Department having regard to income support, social inclusion and integration of services. The need for a flexible and responsive approach to meet the needs of members of the public experiencing disadvantage continues to remain central to the CWS following its integration to the Department.  The service will also continue to provide key information, advice, advocacy and referral links between agencies.</p><p>  To maximise the effectiveness and efficiency of their operation and to ensure continuity of service in the light of reducing resources, some 370 CWS clinics have been re-structured during the last 2 years where the level of demand for a service was low.  This included offices where limited weekly CWS public clinics were held, in some cases for only one to two hours per week.</p><p>  Where a closure has occurred, an increased level of service has been made available to the customers from these areas at alternative locations in the general vicinity.  The change is a move away from the traditional model of one officer serving an individual location and delivering the full range of community welfare services, towards a sustainable team-based approach which is more efficient, effective and economical.  The new arrangements have enhanced service provision, lead to greater value for money in terms of savings in respect of costs such as rent and have facilitated an improved utilisation of staff resources.</p><p>  Where the CWS has been re-structured, alternative arrangements have been put in place to ensure that customers are provided with on-going access to the supports provided by the service.  In general, this means that the frequency of available public clinics has increased, an improved phone service is available and alternative arrangements are in place for those who cannot travel, for example due to illness, including arranging a visit to the client&rsquo;s home if necessary.</p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s services are continually monitored and kept under review by management taking account of the views of staff, public representatives and users of the service to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources with a view to providing an efficient service.  I am very conscious of the need to provide efficient and effective customer facing services at a local level for clients of the Department.  It is therefore essential that the services provided are reconstituted to meet the changing needs of Irish society.</p></reply>

The Table below contains a breakdown by County of internships completed and internships currently undertaken.  The independent evaluation of JobBridge conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants found that 61% of participants progressed into paid employment.  The latest data from the Department indicate that 58% of these progress into employment with their host organisation and 42% do so with another company.</p><p>  In the context of JobBridge, displacement can arise where the internship opportunity being advertised is replacing an existing job vacancy or where a company terminates the employment of a staff member and then seeks to take on an intern to cover the duties previously undertaken by that staff member.  The recent evaluation report found low levels of displacement and deadweight.</p><p>  Where an intern moves directly into employment upon immediately finishing a JobBridge internship the cooling-off period is waived and the host organisation can re-advertise in the same area of activity.  This applies whether the intern finishes early or completes the full term of the internship.  In all other cases, the six-month cooling-off period applies from the point in time when the internship finishes, even if it finishes before the full term. Organisations who release an intern but subsequently recruit that intern a number of months later are still subject to this 6 month rule.</p><p>  A network of officials in the JobBridge team, National Contact Centre and local Divisions are engaged in monitoring compliance with JobBridge criteria.  The Department has conducted over 3,800 on-site monitoring visits to ensure scheme compliance. JobBridge is a voluntary scheme.  Any intern who finds that the internship does not meet their needs is free to leave the internship and may have up to a maximum of 3 internships for a maximum cumulative period of 18 months.  Interns may also report dissatisfaction with, or abuse of, the scheme or a particular internship directly to the JobBridge team via the online form on the &ldquo;contact us&rdquo; section of the JobBridge website.</p><p>  Of the 23,845 placements to-date, 5,192 or 22% of these placements have been in the public sector.  1,557 of these placements are currently active with 3,635 placements completed.</p><p>  The Indecon evaluation also found that there is a very high rate of employment among participants who completed their internships in the public sector with 41% of these interns progressing into paid employment.  </p><p>  In the overall context, 53% of placements are completed in full while 47% of placements are completed early.  However, it is important to highlight that 63% of jobseekers leave their placement early to take up immediate employment, in many cases with their host organisation.</p><p><b>  Table 1. </b><b><i>Breakdown of Internships By County</i></b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Finished</th><th>Current</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>5,982</td><td>2,055</td><td>8,037</td></tr><tr><td>CORK</td><td>1,677</td><td>582</td><td>2,259</td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY</td><td>1,135</td><td>407</td><td>1,542</td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK</td><td>866</td><td>359</td><td>1,225</td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD</td><td>590</td><td>214</td><td>804</td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL              </td><td>556</td><td>246</td><td>802</td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE           </td><td>574</td><td>223</td><td>797</td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY</td><td>532</td><td>225</td><td>757</td></tr><tr><td>KERRY                </td><td>484</td><td>209</td><td>693</td></tr><tr><td>WEXFORD             </td><td>514</td><td>174</td><td>688</td></tr><tr><td>MAYO               </td><td>390</td><td>209</td><td>599</td></tr><tr><td>LOUTH              </td><td>416</td><td>172</td><td>588</td></tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH          </td><td>407</td><td>159</td><td>566</td></tr><tr><td>MEATH                </td><td>371</td><td>172</td><td>543</td></tr><tr><td>CLARE         </td><td>369</td><td>158</td><td>527</td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW           </td><td>384</td><td>111</td><td>495</td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO  </td><td>315</td><td>136</td><td>451</td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN           </td><td>266</td><td>139</td><td>405</td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY             </td><td>257</td><td>87</td><td>344</td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS               </td><td>243</td><td>86</td><td>329</td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN              </td><td>215</td><td>108</td><td>323</td></tr><tr><td>CARLOW               </td><td>226</td><td>86</td><td>312</td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY        </td><td>203</td><td>86</td><td>289</td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON            </td><td>118</td><td>65</td><td>183</td></tr><tr><td>LONGFORD             </td><td>133</td><td>44</td><td>177</td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM  </td><td>79</td><td>31</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>17,302</td><td>6,543</td><td>23,845</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Data as at 28/11/13</b></p></reply>

Both initiatives are designed to bridge the gap between unemployment and re-entering the workforce.  Participants on both schemes are required to work in their placement for an average of 19.5 hours per week which allows for participation in part-time work or education.  Participants are encouraged to engage in part-time work or education outside the time spent working on the respective scheme.  Part-time work or training must not interfere with the participant&rsquo;s work on T&uacute;s or Gateway.  Implementing Bodies are required to provide flexible arrangements to accommodate the participant.

The EAT upheld that 20 of the 22 appellants were entitled to a statutory redundancy payment from their former employer, the organisation to which the Deputy refers.   The appeals of the other two appellants were withdrawn at the hearing.   Following the EAT decision, redundancy lump sum claims in respect of the 20 eligible employees were received by the Department.  The 20 claims have been awarded and payment of their statutory redundancy entitlement, issued directly to those former employees in May 2012.  It should also be noted that when the project closed, F&Aacute;S offered each JI Participant on the scheme alternative employment with other community employers in Tipperary including the retention of accumulated service and pay. These positions were approved by F&Aacute;S, were additional to existing positions and would not have displaced jobs of existing workers. Only one person took up this offer.  In relation to an enhanced severance package, to which the Deputy refers, I am advised that no basis exists to enable payment of an enhanced severance package in this case. </p><p>  The Department has no outstanding statutory redundancy payment claims on hand in respect of the organisation to which the Deputy refers.</p></reply>

It includes the objective of progressively migrating the bulk of the Department&rsquo;s customers to electronic methods of payment, subject to satisfactory arrangements for all of the Department&rsquo;s business and anti-fraud requirements.  This is a key element of the Government&rsquo;s wider National Payments Plan which is aimed at reducing costs and improving the competitiveness of the Irish economy.  The estimated net cost to the Department of issuing a payment in cash is six and a half times more than paying to an account in a financial institution.  Clearly, with some 87 million payments per annum being issued by the Department &ndash; 50% of which are in cash &ndash; every effort should be made to drive efficiencies where they are available within our payments processes. The Payment Strategy will be published in the near future.  </p><p>  The progressive migration of customers to electronic payments will include those in receipt of state pension.  It is anticipated that the majority of welfare payments will eventually be made by EFT into accounts in financial institutions, but it is also expected there will be a sizeable minority that may not be able or wish to use such financial institutions or whom the Department may wish to manage otherwise as part of its control and anti-fraud measures.  Accordingly, the Strategy sets out how an alternative electronic solution will be procured to accommodate such people. </p><p>  The trend towards electronic payments is appreciable. Last year those customers claiming state pension for the first time chose EFT as their preferred payment method by a ratio of two to one despite the cash option being available.  Approximately half of the current customers have already opted to be paid by electronic payment directly into an account in a financial institution.  It appears from research undertaken for the Department that there is some scope for more pensioners to be paid by electronic payments.  In a survey of welfare customers, while 62% of the pensioners interviewed were being paid in cash, 81% of those customers have and use bank accounts, 69% have a credit union account and 40% have a savings account.  </p><p>  The first phase of implementation of the Payment Strategy has commenced with a new contract being put in place with An Post to maintain existing over the counter cash services.  This will ensure that customers, including those in receipt of state pension, can continue to receive their payments in cash at local post offices for the foreseeable future. </p><p>  Moving to electronic payments will require a significant effort to assist and support suitable customers over the coming years.  The Department will work energetically to help customers and their representatives in the transition period.  The Deputy can, however, be assured that customers will not be refused a payment simply because they cannot receive it electronically.</p></reply>

Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in relation to protecting people from poverty.  To allow us to protect these core payments, we have had to look very carefully at other additional payments. While we are ending the telephone allowance the savings that this will provide means that we have been able to keep at the same rates the other elements of the household benefits package, including the free electricity/gas allowance and the free television licence.  We have also retained the fuel allowance, free travel and the living alone increase.  </p><p>  The monthly allowances under the household benefits package are a contribution towards the cost of services; they are not intended to meet those costs in full.  The ending of the telephone allowance of &euro;9.50 per month (or about &euro;2.20 per week) will not result in the automatic removal of any landline service linked to a personal alarm.  Indeed, since the Budget announcement, I am aware that one telephone company has advertised that they will cover the value of the allowance.  I would hope that other telephone companies will consider this.    </p><p>  The telephone allowance was introduced at a time when telephones were expensive and uncommon and a landline service was the only option available to the customer.  The market has changed enormously since the introduction of the allowance, with several companies providing a range of services and rates with bundled services including television, telephone and broadband and pay-as-you-go mobiles. There are also personal security services that use mobile technology rather than land lines.  Accordingly, I have no plans to introduce a supplementary welfare allowance to cover the cost of a telephone line where a person in receipt of a State pension has installed a personal pendant alarm.</p><p>  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government operates the senior&rsquo;s alert scheme which provides grant support for the supply of equipment such as personal alarms, smoke detectors and security lighting to enable older people without sufficient means to continue to live securely in their homes. The budget allocation for 2013 was &euro;2.35 million.  There has been no reduction in this funding in Budget 2014.  </p><p>  It is important to be aware that Ireland&rsquo;s pensioners as a group have the lowest consistent poverty rate and, as a group compared to the rest of the population, are least likely to be at risk of poverty - pointing to the adequacy and importance of the State pension.  Between 2004 and 2011, consistent poverty for older people (those over 65) fell from 3.3% to </p><p>  1.9%.  The &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; rate for people in that age group also reduced from 27.1% to 9.7% over the same period.</p></reply>

Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the office received 35,484 appeals.  In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office. </p><p>  In addition, a major programme of process redesign and modernisation is underway in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.</p><p>  These measures have led to improvements in processing times and a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from 17,787 in 2009 to 32,558 in 2012.  The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012.  Good progress is also now being made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 16,264 currently.  </p><p>The average processing time for appeals peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.  In 2012 processing times improved by 10.3 weeks when the average time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks while the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  This improvement has continued with the average processing time up to October 2013 reducing to 34.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 26.3 weeks for a summary decision.   </p><p>  Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process. While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time.</p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.</p></reply>

There have been a total of 82 JobBridge internships with Donegal ETB, of which 36 are currently active and 46 have been completed.  Of the 46 finishers, the Department&rsquo;s records indicate that 3 of these interns went directly into paid employment with Donegal ETB.  A further 6 finishers immediately progressed into employment with another organisation at the end of their internship.</p><p>  The Department considers that it is important to offer interns public sector internships for four reasons: first, because, despite the recruitment embargo, there are many high-quality, real-workplace positions that can give the intern the new skills and experiences that they can use to bridge the gap to the rest of their working lives; second, because public sector internships continue to be in demand by interns who choose them voluntarily and in the knowledge of the recruitment embargo; third, precisely because of the recruitment embargo, filling those positions is certainly not displacing an employee; and fourth, because of the high rates of progression into employment with other organisations that are still exceptionally high by comparison with the Live Register in general.</p><p>  The independent evaluation of JobBridge conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants found that there is a higher rate of employment among participants who completed their internships in private sector organisations.  Encouragingly, however, 41.2% of all participants who undertook their internship in a public sector organisation progressed into paid employment.</p><p>  A JobBridge intern may undertake up to 3 internships for a maximum cumulative period of 18 months.  Any individual who has not reached those maxima may apply for a further internship.</p><p><b>Table 1.

In that context, my Department seeks to promote the Irish language, to support the Gaeltacht and to assist the sustainable development of island communities.</p><p>  It is vital that we encourage children to both appreciate and participate in Ireland's rich culture and heritage.  In this regard, my Department and the bodies and agencies funded from my Department's Vote Group provide a number of programmes, schemes and exhibitions for children and young people.  For example, in the arts area, the National Cultural Institutions provide educational services for children and young people to encourage them to appreciate the collections and also to develop their own artistic talent.  Details of these educational programmes, workshops, exhibitions and tours can be accessed through the individual web-sites of the National Cultural Institutions.  In addition, the Arts Council identifies children and young people as an important constituency, with a wide range of programmes and supports in place for both &lsquo;in-schools&rsquo; and &lsquo;out-of-schools&rsquo; activity.  Details of these programmes can be found on the Arts Council's web-site.</p><p>  My Department also encourages children to appreciate and explore Ireland's rich built and natural heritage.  For example, my Department's National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service operates a number of education centres around the country that seek to raise awareness of the natural world and of conservation. Such centres typically offer nature awareness programmes to primary schools and ecology and geography fieldwork to secondary schools. They may also offer special events and tours for the public. In addition, the Heritage Council run the Heritage in Schools Scheme which is unique in Ireland and provides a panel of over 165 diverse heritage specialists, who work directly with children in primary schools throughout the country, at the request of the school.  The primary aim of the scheme is to encourage awareness of the natural and cultural world that surrounds us in our daily lives and engage children in a direct experience of their heritage, preferably outside the classroom where possible and appropriate.</p><p>  In recent years, my Department has, in partnership with the Education Centre Network of the Department of Education and Skills, produced bespoke primary and transition year resources under the Archaeology in the Classroom programme.  The programme employs a variety of outreach tools, from continuous professional development courses to a dedicated website (  ), to raise awareness of and increase engagement with our archaeological heritage amongst both teachers and students.</p><p>  In addition, my Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service website,   , is an excellent educational resource and hosts a &lsquo;Monuments to Visit&rsquo; page which provides visitor information on a range of publicly-accessible national monuments.  The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH) website and publications are also used as educational resources by both teachers and students.   A copy of each county or city NIAH book is sent to all the public libraries and second level schools of the area in question. </p><p>  The Deputy may also note that Irish is a vital part of the State&rsquo;s heritage and the Gaeltacht is the primary source of the living language. A core task of my Department is to promote the maintenance of the Irish language in the Gaeltacht, as its most important community resource and its principal means of communication. It has long been recognised that its transmission from one generation to the next is critical for the survival of the Irish language as the predominant household and community language in the Gaeltacht. It is for this reason that my Department and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta operate a number of schemes and initiatives aimed at the maintenance and strengthening of the language in the Gaeltacht.  In this regard, a number of schemes are in operation, which assist families, children and young people to live their lives through the Irish language:</p><p>- Scheme for Irish language Learners</p><p>- Department&rsquo;s Improvement Schemes (capital grants)</p><p>- Summer Camps through Irish for Gaeltacht Youth</p><p>- Language Assistants&rsquo; Scheme</p><p>- Family Language Support Programme</p><p>  In addition, Foras na Gaeilge, an agency of the North South Language Body, is responsible for promoting the Irish language in every aspect of everyday life throughout the island of Ireland. Many of the activities of Foras na Gaeilge are targeted at encouraging young people to use Irish in their daily lives.</p></reply>

Primary responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels, throughout the country is devolved to the Arts Council.  The Council is funded by my Department and is statutorily independent in its day-to-day operations, including funding decisions.</p><p>  In 2014, the Arts Council will receive an allocation of over &euro;56 million in current and capital funding.  Details of all funding provided by the Arts Council to arts practitioners, arts groups and venues, including arts centres, are available on the Council's website at .  In a wider context, the Arts Council support of a range of arts forms is set out in its strategic overview document entitled <i>Developing the Arts in Ireland: Arts Council Strategic Overview 2011-2013</i>.  In this strategy document, which is available on the Council's website, its work and key strategic principles that inform its funding decisions are laid out.</p><p>  I have outlined previously for the Deputy a range of ways in which my Department and relevant bodies within its remit are supporting cultural and heritage initiatives in conjunction with local groups and communities. These include the following cultural tourism initiatives that have been wholly or partly funded by my Department:</p><p>- St. Patrick's Day celebrations,</p><p>- Music Day;</p><p>- Culture Night; </p><p>- Arts Council support of the Arts Festivals and Events scheme, which supports some 150 small arts festivals in towns and villages throughout Ireland each year;</p><p>- Arts Council funding of arts centres and venues around the State, as well as the Council's funding of touring and dissemination of high-quality work in all disciplines through the national network of arts centres and venues;</p><p>- The Arts Council partnership with local authorities and Art Officers throughout the country;</p><p>- Funding of Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann by my Department to support its work in the promotion of Irish traditional music; </p><p>- Cultural and heritage events being held under the auspices of The Gathering; </p><p>- Web-based projects being developed by my Department to promote greater appreciation and understanding of Ireland's heritage for residents and visitors alike;</p><p>- Collaborative work with bodies and groups such as the Arts Council, the Heritage Council, the Irish Heritage Trust, Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann and Music Network.</p><p>My Department also operates a philanthropic initiative for arts and culture organisations. </p><p>  I would also refer the Deputy to my previous replies in relation to these matters. In January last, I provided details of the number of applications received for grant-aid and other forms of support from applicants from County Kildare and the extent to which these applications were approved. My Department's website will be updated with details of grant-aid to organisations after the year end.</p></reply>

The initiative - the <i>Philanthropic Leverage Initiative </i>- was designed to encourage philanthropic sponsorship and endowment of the arts from private sources.  The initiative has provided an incentive to arts organisations to proactively seek new funding relationships with sponsors which deliver private sector financial support, thereby increasing overall funding available to the arts.  The initiative proved very successful with a multiplier of 4.26 in philanthropic donations being leveraged for the arts.  The arts got a boost of over &euro;1 million last year, of which less than one-fifth came from the public purse. A full list of awards under this scheme can be viewed on my Department's website at   .</p><p>  This year, &euro;210,000 is available to arts organisations under the Initiative.  The terms are as follows:</p><p>- Up to &euro;5,000 of funds can be accessed through the scheme if the organisation can match each &euro;1 from the taxpayer with &euro;2 from private sector sources;</p><p>- Up to &euro;10,000 if each &euro;1 from the taxpayer can be matched by &euro;3 from private sector funding; </p><p>- Up to &euro;15,000 if each &euro;1 from the taxpayer can be matched by &euro;4 from private sector funding.</p><p>  In 2013, priority was given to arts and culture organisations seeking support for projects that include an education component. This is to support the <i>Arts in Education Charter,</i>  which I launched in conjunction with Mr Ruairi Quinn, T.D., Minister for Education and Skills. Accordingly, the Initiative, while continuing to provide an incentive to arts organisations to engage in fundraising, will also encourage arts and culture organisations to engage creatively with children and young people and add to their education. In doing so, they will be helping to foster the artists and the audiences of the future.</p><p>  I should mention also that in October 2012 I hosted and chaired a forum on <i>Philanthropy and the Arts </i> in Smock Alley Theatre.  It featured speakers from key philanthropic organisations and the arts in Ireland.  The conference was very well attended and generated very positive feedback.  There is a full report of the conference on my Department's website.</p><p>  Parallel to these initiatives, the Arts Council is undertaking an initiative - <i>RAISE: Building Fundraising Capacity </i>  - which dovetails with the work in my Department. The initiative consists of a programme which is providing one-to-one professional support to selected arts organisations for two years to assist in planning and implementing a tailored fundraising programme for each organisation. Eight leading Irish arts organisations are aiming to raise &euro;10 million in private funding over the next five years as part of this Arts Council initiative.</p></reply>

Under this initiative, of which details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website , a survey of the architectural heritage of Ireland is complete for all counties except Donegal and Dublin.

The National Monuments Acts require that any proposed works at or in relation to a protected monument must be notified in writing to my Department not less than 2 months in advance of the commencement of such works.  Furthermore, any works proposed at or in proximity to a national monument in my ownership or guardianship, or that of a local authority, or which is subject to a Preservation Order or Temporary Preservation Order, cannot proceed without my prior written consent.  All proposed works in relation to protected monuments, as outlined above, are individually scrutinised by my Department.</p></reply>

As in previous years, my Department will also support the annual Culture Night event. Culture Night has grown from a relatively small-scale cultural event, staged only in Dublin, in 2006 to the significant national cultural event it now is. Culture Night 2013 took place on 20 September 2013 in 34 locations across the island of Ireland, in 3 UK cities and in Leuven in Belgium.  The feedback from the 2013 event has been overwhelmingly positive with many participating locations reporting larger turnouts than in previous years. Discussions have already commenced with key stakeholders in relation to Culture Night 2014.</p><p>  My Department will also support the <i>International Week of Irish Culture</i>   initiative, which is based around the St Patrick's Day Festival. This initiative, which commenced in 2012, allows the opportunity to showcase to the world Ireland's rich and varied cultural heritage and to promote Ireland as a destination for cultural tourists.</p><p>  In addition to these festivals, my Department will also be indirectly supporting numerous other cultural events during 2014 through funding provided to the Arts Council, the national cultural institutions and various other cultural organisations throughout the country.</p><p>  Over the course of 2014, more than &euro;2.3 million per week will be invested by my Department in support of arts, culture and film in Ireland. </p></reply>

This is in accordance with the standard approach adopted in relation to the assessment of all ferry service tenders. While the officials in question do not hold technical qualifications of the nature referred to by the Deputy, I am satisfied that they have significant and adequate experience in assessing tenders of this nature. </p><p>  I can also assure the Deputy that I am satisfied that the contract in this case was awarded following an open and fair tendering process, using the scoring system contained in the Request For Tender. It may be noted that the scoring of such tenders entails the assessment of a range of elements, with various marks available for each of those elements. A significant proportion of the available marks is allocated to the tender price - 40% of the overall marks in this instance. I should also point out that the successful tender in this case came in at a cost to the State which was considerably lower than the other tenders received.</p><p>  In relation to docking on Inis Me&aacute;in, my Department&rsquo;s information is that the cargo vessel failed to dock there on 2 days in the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 October 2013. It may also be noted that my Department has not, during this period, received any significant complaints from island representatives with regard to the cargo service that is being provided in this case.</p><p>  In conclusion, I want to emphasise that my Department is dedicated to ensuring that a quality cargo service is in place for the Aran Islands. A number of issues that remain to be addressed have been raised with the operator and I can assure the Deputy that these are currently being pursued. I can also assure the Deputy that my Department will invoke any remedies that are available to it to ensure full compliance with its requirements within a reasonable timeframe.</p></reply>

The aim is to ensure that the sector, valued at &euro;755m annually to the national economy and supporting 10,000 jobs in rural and peripheral areas, is underpinned by a robust and modern legislative code. As part of this review, I organised a series of public information and consultation meetings and attended these meetings accompanied by senior officials from the Inland Fisheries Division of my Department and Inland Fisheries Ireland. Those meetings, which were held on a regional basis in Drogheda, Carrick-on-Shannon, Tuam, Clonmel and Dublin, were well attended and laid out transparently the principal themes to be considered in the context of new legislation.  A range of issues and possible new approaches were outlined at these meetings and there was widespread and broadly positive reaction to the modernisation proposals with a range of views expressed at the public meetings. I have undertaken to carefully consider points made before developing specific legislative proposals and the submissions received in the course of the public consultation sessions are available on the Department's website, </p><p>  I welcome all opportunities to debate the future shape of angling in Ireland and will be keen to continue and ensure full public involvement in this dialogue in the weeks and months ahead.</p></reply>

Specifically, the Act requires RT&Eacute; to provide digital coverage to the same extent as provided over the previous analogue network, i.e. 98% population coverage, and I am advised by RT&Eacute; that this level of coverage is being provided by the SAORVIEW TV network. For the remaining 2% of the population, RT&Eacute; launched SAORSAT in March 2012. The development and provision of SAORSAT, which is a &ldquo;free to air&rdquo; satellite system providing access to the RT&Eacute; channels and TG4, was undertaken by RT&Eacute; on its own initiative and, as in the case of the SAORVIEW DTT network, is not a matter in which I have a function.</p><p>  Ireland is not the only country to have introduced a national TV network on both a terrestrial and satellite platform. Many countries, including the UK, have developed their digital networks on both the traditional terrestrial platform and also over satellite. The reason for this is simple. It is technically and financially impossible to provide 100% coverage using a terrestrial TV platform. However, through SAORVIEW and SAORSAT, Ireland now has 100% &ldquo;free to air&rdquo; coverage of the RT&Eacute; channels and TG4 for the first time in the history of the State. </p><p>  That said, I have noted the specific details of the case raised by the Deputy in this Question and have had them brought to the attention of RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s network company, 2RN. I have requested the company to examine if anything can be done to improve the person&rsquo;s terrestrial TV reception.</p></reply>

Any steps to be taken after 7 January, including any analysis of issues such as costs, environmental impacts and technical efficacy, will be considered then. The period between now and 7 January will, no doubt, be useful in providing EirGrid with an opportunity to reflect further on the valid concerns raised in relation to various aspects of the project. The July 2012 "Government Policy Statement on the Strategic Importance of Transmission and Other Energy Infrastructure", emphasised the imperative for the State Companies, and all developers of energy projects, of early, transparent engagement and consultation with local communities and stakeholders.   The Statement also made clear that public acceptability requires public confidence proposals adhere to the highest international standards of safety, health and environmental and visual impact, and technology choice. The Government affirmed that EirGrid and the other State energy companies are obliged to adhere to all relevant guidelines and standards and they act in the national interest, and on behalf of all electricity consumers. </p><p>  In this regard, the expectation is that those companies in making their choices, of project specific technologies and routing as well as mitigation measures, will take account of all relevant national and international standards, to follow best practice and ensure value for money and be informed by detailed consultation at local level. In addition to undertaking extensive statutory and non statutory public consultation, the State Companies and energy developers must adhere to national and international standards on health, environment, biodiversity, landscape and safety as an intrinsic part of the Planning process. Compliance together with appropriate impact mitigation measures are central to the Environmental Impact Assessments which form the basis of planning applications to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. This includes compliance with EMF exposure limits set in International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection Guidelines and associated EU Recommendations, and Environmental, Habitat and Biodiversity national and EU legislation. The Government in affirming the broad principle of adherence to all standards, underlined the importance of the statutory and non statutory consultation processes in ensuring public and stakeholder confidence that standards are met and where necessary mitigation measures are put in place.</p><p>  I am aware that many people are concerned about the impact that new transmission lines and other energy infrastructure can have on the landscape, the environment and on local communities. Accordingly, it is essential that the GridLink project is taken forward on the basis of the best available knowledge and informed engagement on the impacts and costs of different engineering solutions. EirGrid has stated that it will take account of all the submissions received during the course of the consultation process.</p><p> The Government wants to be able to give a strong consistent message to Irish business and multinationals, and our citizens, that Ireland&rsquo;s electricity networks are robust, modern and safe. This project is a practical illustration of our collective and continuing commitment to large scale investment in electricity infrastructure, while at the same time taking in to account valid concerns and addressing them as appropriate.</p></reply>

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms. Details of broadband services available in each County can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at . The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. ComReg has put in place a new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and for service bundles, both of which are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by service providers. ComReg&rsquo;s multiband spectrum auction, completed in 2012, is also enabling the rollout of advanced mobile broadband services.</p><p>  In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to deliver high speed broadband services over the coming years. The results of this mapping exercise will inform the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014. The actual cost to the State will be determined by the structure and outcome of the procurement process, which will be designed to ensure value for money.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

Ensuring secure reliable and safe supplies of electricity is critical to Ireland&rsquo;s ability to attract inward investment and retain and create jobs.All projects in the Grid25 programme are undertaken in accordance with EirGrid&rsquo;s Project Development and Consultation Roadmap. The Roadmap is a five stage approach to projects; all stages include opportunities for public consultation and feedback including the final stage which is subject to the full planning process of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Currently the Grid Link project is at Stage 1 of the roadmap. Stage 1 is the information gathering stage and the Project Stage 1 Report was published by EirGrid on 3 September 2013. The report identifies a number of route corridor options for the new line, and will inform the public consultation process. EirGrid are encouraging interested parties to make submissions. On 25 November 2013, EirGrid announced its decision to extend the third phase of public consultation on the Grid Link Project until Tuesday, 7 January 2014, so that interested parties will have plenty of time to contribute to the consultation process and express their views in relation to the project. </p><p>  The Grid West project is at Stage 1 of the roadmap (the information gathering stage) and the Project Stage 1 Report was published by EirGrid on 7 October 2013. The report identifies a number of route corridor options for the new line, and will inform a public consultation between now and spring 2014. </p><p>  The North South Interconnector project is entering Stage 3 of the roadmap and has already been the subject of extensive consultation. The objective of this stage is to confirm the preferred project solution. The preferred project solution report, which shows the route of the overhead line in detail, has been published. </p><p>  The planning process affords further opportunity for citizens to raise views regarding these developments.</p></reply>

Each river contains a genetically unique stock, which migrates to sea as juveniles and returns to the same river in adulthood to spawn. The conservation imperative means that exploitation of salmon of each river is only permitted where the independent Standing Scientific Committee (SSC) for salmon determine that the stock in that river is above its conservation limit.Based on the deliberations of the SSC as regards the status of each individual river stock, and in accordance with Section 69 (8) of the Inland Fisheries Act, 2010, I commenced the statutory 30 day public consultation process for the draft Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Tagging Scheme Regulations 2013 for the 2014 season. This consultation process commenced on 8 November 2013 and will end on 7 December 2013. The draft regulations are open for public inspection and are accessible on my Department&rsquo;s website.

The responsibility for control of mergers and acquisitions, including those relating to the media in the State, lies with my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation as provided for in the Competition Act 2002. The Government decided in 2011 to draft a new Consumer and Competition Bill; part of that Decision involved giving effect in legislation to the recommendations of the Report of the Advisory Group on Media Mergers, and to transfer responsibility for public interest considerations from the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. Primary responsibility for promulgating the Bill required to give effect to this Decision rests with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. However, my Department has been heavily engaged with the drafting of this legislation in recent months in tandem with the Department Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, and I gather that a final Bill will be ready for publication shortly.  The critical role of the media in our democracy, and the potentially harmful effects of an over concentration of media ownership, means that this issue is a vitally important one. The Government remains committed to implementing a set of robust measures that allow for a transparent and objective assessment of the public good in media mergers cases, and to do so as quickly as possible.  </p></reply>

The Panel undertook a desktop study, in conjunction with stakeholder consultation, to establish certain facts in relation to the potential exposure to pyrite problems. The information was gathered from a number of sources including local authorities, structural guarantee providers, representatives of homeowners, private builders, construction professionals and public representatives and was cross referenced to verify, as far as practicable, its validity. </p><p>  Seventy four estates were identified to the Pyrite Panel as possibly having pyrite in the sub-floor hardcore of the dwellings therein. All of these estates are located in the five local authority areas of Dublin City, Fingal, Kildare, Meath and Offaly. I understand that the Pyrite Panel was not made aware of any instances of pyrite in hardcore material occurring outside of those five local authority areas at the time of the report&rsquo;s compilation. </p><p>  The Pyrite Panel&rsquo;s report provides the framework for the proposed remediation scheme and the eligibility criteria for the scheme will be reflective of the conclusions and recommendations of the report. The scheme will only apply where a dwelling is affected by significant damage due to pyritic heave and where this is established in accordance with the relevant Irish Standard 398-1:2013 <i>Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material-Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol,</i> published by the National Standards Authority of Ireland. In addition, applicants under the scheme will need to demonstrate that they have no other viable options to seek redress. </p><p>  In general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties, the homeowner, the builder, the supplier and/or their respective insurers and in the event that the parties cannot reach a settlement by negotiation the option of seeking redress in the Courts is available. </p></reply>

This involved the purchaser entering into a shared ownership lease with the local authority on a property at a significant discount from market value. In these cases, as with all affordable housing sales, a clawback was introduced to prevent short-term profit taking on the resale of the house to the detriment of the objectives of the schemes. </p><p>  While it is not appropriate for me to comment on individual cases, I fully recognise that affordable home owners are in many cases impacted by the downturn in the same way as other home owners , for example in consequence of unemployment and possible negative equity.   In such cases borrowers should actively engage with their lenders, whether a commercial financial institution or a local authority, to seek to avail of one of the options available to provide sustainable solutions to distressed mortgages. In this regard the mortgage arrears resolution process already in place in respect of commercial mortgages is now being implemented across all local authorities. In cases of acute mortgage distress homeowners also have the option of seeking to avail of the legal process now also in place to deal with personal insolvency.</p></reply>

Predominantly developer/funder/receiver funded site resolution processes will remain the main vehicle to tackle unfinished developments, and 553 developments have been brought to a resolution point in this way over the past 12 months. I expect such processes will continue to make significant inroads into the remaining 992 inhabited unfinished developments.   </p><p>  Additionally, my Department has available a Special Resolution Fund of &euro;10million, provided in Budget 2014, to address the completion of infrastructure on developments which could not be resolved because of absences of, or inadequacies in, planning securities and other unforeseen cost and risk issues. The detailed criteria for this fund are now being finalised. The fund will be operated by the local authorities and will be carefully targeted mainly to address difficulties in public infrastructure that have arisen on certain developments included in the Department&rsquo;s National Housing Development Survey 2013.</p><p>  It is also necessary to explore resolution of those developments which appear to be commercially unviable due to location, build quality, commercial demand or other factors and where the most prudent course of action may be to seek the agreement of owners/funders to clear all or part of the site. Accordingly, the National Coordinating Committee established a group to oversee the development of a strategy for these residual developments and to work with stakeholders in identifying and agreeing such sites for full or partial clearance, thereby improving the lives of existing residents and removing dangerous structures from public access. Some forty such developments have been initially identified and fall to be addressed by the relevant owners, receivers and funders. The estates identified by the funders have not been identified to my Department for commercially sensitive reasons. The costs associated with this strategy are equally sensitive and I do not hold this information. Responsibility for the clearance of unviable estates remains the responsibility of the funders and I welcome their participation in this pragmatic approach which will further underscore a return to a properly functioning property market.</p></reply>

Within that framework, local returning officers are responsible for all matters in connection with the actual conduct of elections and referendums, including the selection, appointment and training of polling station and count staff in accordance with the relevant provisions of electoral law. </p><p>  My Department issues guidance to Returning Officers in advance of each election and referendum. The guidance emphasises that the smooth conduct of polls is dependent on maintaining a cadre of sufficiently skilled and experienced people. Having regard to that overall objective, returning officers are advised to employ competent and efficient persons as polling staff and asked to give consideration, where possible, to employing suitable persons who are unemployed, particularly when seeking to fill the post of Polling Clerk, where the responsibilities of the post can be fulfilled under the guidance of the Presiding Officer.   </p><p>  As employment in connection with polls taken at elections and referendums is a matter for returning officers, my Department does not compile statistics on the employment provided. However, certain information on employment provided by returning officers at the Childrens Referendum held in November 2012 was compiled by my Department.

The CALF provides a capital equity injection which assists AHBs in securing private finance.  To date over &euro;10 million has been advanced to AHBs using this facility which has supported the provision of 158 social housing units.  It is open to AHBs to consider and put forward proposals to meet housing need under the CALF.  I am not aware of any case where loan finance has been sourced by AHBs from the European Investment Bank (EIB).  It would be a matter for AHBs themselves to approach the EIB with proposals in this regard. </p><p>  Under the EU Structural and Investment Funds 2014 -2020, financial assistance may be provided by way of grant from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) in respect of a number of investment priorities within the thematic objectives set out in the relevant EU Regulation.  In accordance with the investment priority of <i>Supporting the Shift Towards a Low Carbon Economy</i>, my Department submitted a proposal under the South and East Regional Operational Programme 2014-2020 for the deep retrofitting of some 2,000 local authority apartments and flats in Dublin, Cork and Limerick at an estimated cost of &euro;100 million.  It is proposed that 25% of the cost would be met by way of a grant from the ERDF with a further 50% of the cost to be met by way of loan finance from the EIB.  The balance of funding would be provided from my Department's social housing budget.  </p><p>  It is intended that the retrofitting works would be undertaken by a number of AHBs who would subsequently manage and maintain the properties on behalf of the local authority.  My Department held a series of meetings with relevant stakeholders in connection with this application including the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, the Regional Assemblies which act as Managing Authority for the EU Structural and Investment Funds, and the Irish Council for Social Housing (ICSH).  My Department understands the ICSH intend to invite AHBs with an interest in participating in the project to a meeting in the near future. </p><p>  Further social housing proposals of this nature and involving the EIB and the AHBs will be considered in the context of the outcome of this proposal.</p></reply>

However, the Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability provide a range of grants for necessary improvement works or adaptations to houses in order to facilitate the continued independent occupancy of their own homes by older people and people with a disability.  These schemes cover works reasonably necessary for the purposes of rendering a house more suitable for the accommodation of applicants, and can in those circumstances include the removal of asbestos.</p><p>  There is a general ban on the use of asbestos under Directive 76/769/EEC as amended, which was transposed in Ireland through the European Communities (Dangerous Substances and Preparations) (Marketing and Use) Regulations.  The prevention of exposure is the focus of occupational safety and health legislation concerning asbestos in the workplace.  Specific worker protection Regulations regarding the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos fibres while at work have been in place since 1989.  The most up-to-date Regulations are the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Exposure to Asbestos ) Regulations 2006, which are enforced by the Health and Safety Authority.  The Authority comes under the remit of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. </p><p>  Insofar as the management of asbestos as a waste is concerned, the Waste Management Acts 1996-2007 prohibit any person from holding, transporting, recovering or disposing of waste in a manner which causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution, defined in Section 5 to include action which would to a significant extent endanger human health.  It is recommended that expert advice should be sought in dealing with asbestos materials and if removal is necessary it should only be done by a competent contractor with the required training.</p></reply>

My preferred approach was for responsible stakeholders to take ownership of the problem and to work with me to provide a voluntary industry led solution to the problem.  Against this background and following receipt of the pyrite report, I engaged with the stakeholders, which included the banking sector, with the objective of securing a voluntary, industry-led response which would include appropriate funding arrangements.  However, despite protracted discussions, the stakeholders would not commit to putting in place a voluntary scheme.  In the absence of an agreement with the stakeholders the Government approved, in April 2013, the funding of a remediation scheme through the imposition of mandatory levies on the construction and insurance sectors.   </p><p>  Implementation of the remediation scheme was to be supported by a not-for-profit entity, established by the construction stakeholders, who would have operated under the supervision of the Pyrite Resolution Board.  Under that process, it was intended that the entity would have been the borrower of a loan facility, which a number of financial institutions had signalled their willingness to provide, to facilitate the early commencement of pyrite remediation works.  Unfortunately, due to legal difficulties it was not possible to proceed on the basis of those proposals.  The revised arrangements which have recently been approved by Government do not involve a role for the banking sector.  However, I would encourage the banks to respond sympathetically and positively to customers who may have particular financial requirements while their homes are being remediated.</p></reply>

It was therefore necessary to carry out a comprehensive review of the level of commitments and expenditure across the Programme in order to apportion the remaining funds among the Local Development Companies (LDCs), taking into account the level of commitments already entered into.  The redistribution of funding was conducted in as fair and equitable a manner as was possible.</p><p>  On 20 May 2013, Cavan Monaghan LEADER was awarded a revised allocation of RDP funding of &euro;9,923,866.

I am very aware of the great work being done in communities and the need to continue local development initiatives to the greatest extent possible. With that in mind, I have prioritised the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP) and the 2014 provision will be &euro;47.7 million. This will allow some 14,000 people who are distanced from the labour market to receive direct one-to-one labour market training and supports. I also anticipate that in the order of &euro;50 million will become available to carry forward into 2014 to fund LEADER projects.</p><p>  There are some reductions to a number of specific budget lines within the Community vote, reflecting a range of considerations, including the scale of spending in previous years, the maturity of particular programmes, and the balance required to meet EU co-funding needs. For example, there will be reductions of between 5% and 7% to the RAPID and Supports for Community and Voluntary Sector allocations for 2014.  The Interreg programme will be reduced by 8%. The Programme for Peace and Reconciliation will have reduced current funding but its capital funding will be increased by 27%.  I am satisfied that these allocations will fully meet 2014 commitments.</p><p>  In respect of the local development sector, the vision and focus underpinning the Government&rsquo;s decisions is in Putting People First &ndash; Action Plan for Effective Local Government, to achieve a more joined-up approach to service delivery at local level, with responsibility for what is being done &ndash; and being spent &ndash; in the area of local and community development devolved to local level.  This will be underpinned by new local governance arrangements that will seek to enhance involvement by citizens and communities in the design, implementation and targeting of services.  Local Community Development Committees are being established as participative committees which will be tasked with developing a 6 year City/County Local and Community Plan for its local authority area encompassing all state-funded local and community development interventions.</p></reply>

It was against this background that I engaged in protracted discussions with the key stakeholders, including HomeBond, to try and put in place a framework within which those parties could bring about a resolution of the problem; regrettably, this did not prove possible.  However, the Pyrite Resolution Board remains in discussions with HomeBond with a view to agreeing an open and transparent process for them to make a positive contribution to the implementation of a pyrite remediation scheme.</p></reply>

Specifically, under the Kyoto Protocol, Ireland must limit the growth in its GHG emissions to 13 per cent above 1990 levels over the period 2008 to 2012. Under the Effort Sharing Decision, which applies to GHG emissions outside the scope of the European Union&rsquo;s Emissions Trading System, Ireland must limit the growth in its GHG emissions to 20 per cent below 2005 levels over the period 2013 to 2020.

However, I am satisfied that Ireland is on course to comply with the mitigation trajectory in the first half of this compliance period. I will review progress in terms of meeting the compliance challenge in the years 2017 to 2020, having regard to the outcome of the ongoing programme for the development of national climate policy and legislation.  Consistent with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s obligations and its progressive approach to the development of national climate policy, the focus on securing compliance with European Union law in the period to 2020 will be on domestic mitigation rather than the purchase of additional carbon credits.</p></reply>

Such an examination would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.</p><p>  Review meetings take place at regular intervals in each of our prisons where the Governor, other members of senior management and representatives from the professional therapeutic services discuss individual cases and then make recommendations to an official from Prison Service Headquarters as to how the sentence management of a case should proceed. This may at times include a recommendation that the person engage in the school, work with the addiction services, etc but may also at times recommend that a prisoner be considered for a transfer from a closed prison, that they be considered for daily temporary release to attend a training programme or at times that they be granted supervised reviewable temporary release.</p><p>  Prisoners serving short sentences, i.e. under 12 months, may be moved to an open centre shortly after committal. Other longer term prisoners being prepared for the transition back into the community man be considered for moves with about 2 years left in their sentence. Exceptional prisoners who are engaging strongly with the therapeutic services can sometimes be considered for a transfer with up to 4 years left to serve in their sentence.  For prisoners serving sentences in excess of 8 years recommendations on their sentence management including transfers to open centres or temporary release are made to me by the Parole Board.  It is very important to note that it does not necessarily follow that a prisoner will receive a transfer to an Open Centre or temporary release even if the recommendation is to that effect.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that in all cases where prisoners have applied for a transfer to an open centre, early or compassionate release, or other concessions, there are safety, security, operational and logistical considerations that must be taken into account by the Irish Prison Service when deciding whether to approve or refuse the application. There is no automatic entitlement to concessions for prisoners at a specific point in their sentence or in light of specific conduct. Each case is examined on its individual merits.</p></reply>

Where payment cannot be made in person, payment can be made by post to the address provided on the notice, together with the completed and signed declaration.  I understand that the Garda authorities have advised that the fixed charge notice be posted or emailed to the driver in question.</p></reply>

Under the Act it is also an offence to supply such a device to a prisoner.  The penalties for such an offence, on summary conviction, include a fine not exceeding &euro;5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, and on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &euro;10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both. It is Irish Prison Service policy to report and hand over seizures of mobile phones to the Garda&iacute;.</p><p>  Given advances in mobile telecommunications technology, mobile phones are becoming increasingly small in size, which provides the Irish Prison Service with particular challenges in seeking to (i) prevent their entry into prisons and (ii) locate them when smuggled inside. Specialist staff, however, are employed by the Irish Prison Service to combat this problem to the greatest extent possible. Due to improvements in security within our Prisons the number of mobile phones being seized in the previous years has reduced significantly.</p><p>  I wish also to advise the Deputy that between 1 January 2013 and 13 October 2013, 675 mobile phones had been seized by the staff of the Irish Prison Service.   <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Mobile Phones Seized</th></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>2,047</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>2,174</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>1,718</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>1,368</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>1,150</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>675***</td></tr></table></p><p> ***Figures for 2013 are to 13 October 2013</p></reply>

Due to the nature of the application, it cannot be processed by the Embassy under the delegated sanction given by my Department to the Department of Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade to process certain short-stay visas. It was therefore, transferred to the INIS Office in Dublin for consideration. A decision would normally be expected in approximately 8 weeks in a case such as this.  In the interests of fairness, visa applications are dealt with strictly in order of date received.   The applicant will receive a letter informing him of the decision on his application in due course.  It is important to note that the permanent nature of the intended stay in Ireland in this case means that more in-depth consideration of the application will be required. As a consequence the processing will take longer than would be the case for a normal visit visa.</p><p>  Queries in relation to general immigration matters may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The Bill will also establish an independent complaints framework to deal with allegations of professional misconduct to which the public will have direct access - at present such complaints are made through the professional bodies. There will also be an independent Legal Practitioners&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal to deal with allegations of serious misconduct by both solicitors and barristers. This will end the duplication of disciplinary structures between the two professional bodies.</p><p>  These changes are being augmented by a more modern, consumer friendly and transparent legal costs regime under the Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator that will take over the duties of the existing Taxing-Master. The Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a set of Legal Costs Principles, and the determinations of the Legal Costs Adjudicator will be made public. The Bill will also open the legal services sector to new business models that will provide new opportunities for legal services providers while also providing greater choice and competition for the benefit of consumers.  </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Committee Stage of the Bill commenced on 17 July when I successfully introduced a series of key amendments to Part 2 of the Bill. These have further enhanced the independence of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority which will be appointed by nominating bodies.  Detailed work on the Bill continues in my Department in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of Parliamentary Counsel. It is my intention to make the remaining amendments for Committee Stage available before Christmas and, subject to the agreement of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, to resume Committee Stage early in the New Year.</p></reply>

There is a diverse array of exploitative behaviours, ranging from infringement of labour regulations at one end of the spectrum, to human trafficking at the other, that may arise in such situations. Consequently, it is likely that exploitation of this nature could also be prosecuted under a number of other offences, for example, false imprisonment, blackmail, assault, the coercion offence under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, offences under employment law and health and safety legislation, immigration law, etc.</p><p><b><font color="#000080">  </font></b>In addition, the State provides a wide range of support services to victims of human trafficking including accommodation, medical care and planning, psychological assistance, material assistance, legal aid and advice, vocational training and education.  The Anti-Human Trafficking Team in the Health Service Executive develops individual comprehensive Care Plans for persons who are potentially victims of human trafficking addressing all of the support services that are required.  My Department also provides funding to two NGO organisations, Ruhama and the Migrant&rsquo;s Rights Centre of Ireland (MRCI), who work with victims of human trafficking; MRCI have a particular focus on supporting migrant workers.  A detailed Guide to the Procedures for supporting and protecting victims of human trafficking, along with other Guides and leaflets, are accessible on the dedicated anti-trafficking website  .  As ever, I would urge all victims of crime, including persons who believe that they may be victims of human trafficking,  to report the matter to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p></reply>

At this meeting, I tabled a paper for discussion on EU action to protect freedom of movement for EU Citizens and social integration by encouraging effective action and enhancing cooperation between justice systems in countering hate crime, racism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia and homophobia.  At this meeting I raised the need for broad public debate and consultation process with ministries and other public institutions in Member States, human rights and equality bodies and civil society to raise awareness and understanding of the importance of the rule of law, common values and protection of the fundamental rights of all.</p><p>  In May 2013 a conference entitled &quot;A Europe of Equal Citizens - equality, fundamental rights and the rule of law&quot; was organised in the framework of the Irish Presidency in Dublin. This conference played an important part in the debate on how to protect fundamental rights and promote the rule of law in Europe.  The conference outlined the clear links between tackling hate crimes on one hand and promoting equality and fighting discrimination on the other.</p><p>  In June the Justice and Home Affairs Council adopted Council Conclusions on fundamental rights and the rule of law and on the Commission 2012 Report on the application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.  These Council Conclusions drew inspiration from the outcome of the discussions which took place at the Informal Justice and Home Affairs meeting and the Irish Presidency Conference in May. The Conclusions called, inter alia, on the Commission to take forward a debate on the need for &lsquo;a collaborative and systematic method&rsquo; &ndash; i.e. a Rule of Law mechanism or initiative &ndash; to address these important issues.   They suggested guidance to the EU Commission as to how the debate on this important topic should be taken forward, stressing the need to take a holistic approach to all the issues arising.  They also focused on the need to move forward on the basis of consensus, treating Member States on the basis of equality, working together to ensure that we achieve the standards we committed to on joining the EU and on the basis of designing an approach that will make a real difference to protection of those persons whose rights are most vulnerable to attack.</p><p>  Ireland remains an active participant in discussions on this issue.  In recent weeks, I have contributed to a Conference on Hate Crimes organised by the Lithuanian Presidency and in the <i>Assises de la Justice</i>  organised by the Commission.  In addition, my Department is working with a number of other Member States and with the Fundamental Rights Agency to craft a methodology by which appropriate rule of law indicators could be developed.  The intention is to focus on a limited number of fundamental rights issues with a view to developing a methodology that can be applied to the wider range of rule of law questions as a contribution to the ongoing debate.</p></reply>

The position in the State of the person concerned is unchanged since then.<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><i>In April, 2007, the person concerned made an application for residency in the State on the basis of being the spouse of an EU National who was exercising her EU Treaty Rights in this State.  This application was approved and the person concerned was notified to this effect by letter dated 18th August, 2008. The person concerned completed the registration formalities to the extent that his permission to remain was valid to 25th October, 2012. </i><br /><br /><i>Given that the person concerned was no longer residing with his EU National spouse, he was not in a position to apply for the renewal of his permission to remain on the basis of marriage to an EU national. He has, however, sought a right of residency in the State, accompanied by a right to work, based on the principles of the European Court of Justice Judgment in the Zambrano case. Once a decision has been made on this latter application, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</i><br /><br /><i>There is no record of an application for a Certificate of Naturalisation having been received from the person concerned. However, it will be open to him to apply to the Citizenship Division of my Department for a Certificate of Naturalisation when he is in a position to meet the lawful residency criteria applicable to the lodgement of such applications. Details on the criteria to be met by persons lodging such applications are available from the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service Website (www.inis.gov.ie).</i></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

As such they demand rigorous procedures to ensure their integrity and to maintain the highest level of confidence by the public and organisations availing of them. The current Garda vetting system is delivered in a standard format to each organisation registered with the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) for vetting purposes. The methodology used is in line with best practice internationally.</p><p>  A vetting disclosure is made in response to a written request and with the permission of the person who is the subject of that request. Garda vetting disclosures are issued to the organisations registered with the GCVU in respect of a particular post or employment.  The Unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012 and expects to receive in the region of 350,000 applications by the end of 2013. The average processing time for vetting applications is seven weeks. This is a marked improvement on the processing times of 14 weeks which prevailed in July this year.</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that elements of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 are under review at present and a number of amendments are planned to the legislation prior to its commencement early next year.  In that context, I will also be seeking to amend the Act to minimise the extent of duplicate vetting.  In particular, I will be seeking to make explicit in the Act that where more than one organisation shares the services of the same volunteer/employee, they can share a vetting disclosure, with the consent of the person who has been vetted.</p></reply>

Some of these redeployed staff have only recently completed their training in the vetting process and the full impact of their work will be seen in the coming weeks. Furthermore, I have also received sanction for the redeployment of 40 additional staff to the GCVU.

In accordance with this principle, the approach of the Oireachtas has generally been to specify in law a maximum penalty for an offence, so that a court, having considered all the circumstances of the case, may impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.</p><p>  Insofar as penalties are concerned, the crime of rape is an exceptionally serious offence and the criminal law makes provision for rape to be treated with the utmost gravity.  Cases are heard before the Central Criminal Court and a person convicted of rape is liable to a penalty of up to life imprisonment.  The maximum penalty for sexual assault is, generally, 10 years.  However, the maximum penalty increases to 14 years where the victim is a child.  An important safeguard is the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions, under the Criminal Justice Act 1993, to appeal a sentence she considers unduly lenient. That is a decision for the DPP who, by law, is independent in the exercise of her functions.</p><p>  The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Information System (ISIS) website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  ISIS is being developed as a valuable tool not only for members of the judiciary but also for lawyers, researchers and those concerned with the needs of victims and their families, and I very much welcomed the initiative led by the Judiciary through the Judicial Research Office in undertaking the detailed work of gathering and providing information via the website.</p><p>  The Deputy may also be aware that I have established a Penal Policy Review Group to carry out a review incorporating an examination and analysis of all aspects of penal policy including sentencing policies. I expect the Group to report early in the new year and I intend to publish that report.   In addition, the Law Reform Commission has published a report on Mandatory Sentencing and the recommendations contained in the report will be fully considered in my Department together with the report of the Penal Policy Review Group when it has been finalised.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Authority that they published an information document entitled Requirements for the Licensing of Centres Monitoring CCTV and Intruder Alarm Systems in February 2013.  This document outlined proposals for dealing with the introduction of the new European standard for monitoring centres, EN 50518, and the future PSA licensing requirements for CCTV and Intruder Alarm monitoring centres. Legal issues on related issues which impacted on the development of the new standard have recently been resolved.</p><p>  At its November 2013 meeting, the Board of the PSA agreed to the drafting of regulations extending licensing to CCTV Monitoring Centres together with the introduction of a new monitoring centre standard.  Following on from this approval, the PSA is undertaking a public consultation process on the new standard.    It is expected that this consultation process will be completed by the end of January 2014 at which stage the PSA will announce a timeframe for the licensing of CCTV Monitoring Centres and the introduction of the new standard.  The Deputy has previously raised the Firearms (Secure Accommodation) Regulations, S.I. 307 of 2009, which makes reference to alarm standards and back up signalling facilities in the context of the development of the standard. My Department is consulting with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSA regarding  updating the Regulations with a view to addressing in early 2014 the issues previously raised by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Members are paid these allowances on a 28 day roster basis, in arrears, with the payment process commencing at the beginning of each pay roster period in respect of work carried out during the previous period.

In the case of the period which ends on 8 December<b>,</b> this would be due to be paid on 26 December. However, the year-end payrolls are brought forward due to such matters as extra bank holidays which occur during the Christmas and New Year periods, the testing of new computer software to cater for any budgetary changes, inputting of payroll reference data changes for 2014<b></b>and the high volume of payroll administration required at the Financial Year End. This in turn means that the payroll date of 26 December<b></b>  has to be brought forward to 19 December. The payroll data for that pay date must be submitted by 6 December 2013.  The practice outlined above has always been the case and is not a new development. Garda members always have  received and will continue to receive 13 payments each year for 13 four week periods.  It must also be remembered that with regard to normal salary payments, Garda&iacute; are paid on a weekly basis and will receive their pay up to and including the pay day of 26<sup></sup>December before the end of the year.

At a time when the State is facing significant demands on its resources, an increase in contributions allows the Board to achieve its objectives without money being diverted from other programmes. The increased contributions should result in increased funding of up to &euro;700,000 per annum being available to the Board once the increases have full impact.</p><p>  There has been a very significant increase in demand for civil legal aid in the last number of years and while I have sought to protect the Board's budget, waiting times for the Board's non prioritised services have increased due to a major increase in demand for services. I believe this additional resource for the Board will assist it in tackling those waiting times. I am conscious that the increase in the minimum contribution as a percentage is significant.  However I believe the contributions payable still compare favourably with other jurisdictions, many of which require ongoing payments for certain legal aid matters. Provisions remain in place to allow the contribution to be waived in hardship cases. I know that the Board has in place a process for considering applications for waivers or reductions in the contribution and that it does so where not to do so would create undue hardship.</p><p>  I should point out that those Regulations abolished the contribution where a parent is seeking legal services from the Legal Aid Board to defend proceedings instituted by the Health Service Executive in relation to the welfare of the child.  I took this approach on the basis that these cases are public law matters and the parent is facing the might of the State.  I should also point out that all asylum seekers in receipt of civil legal services for asylum related matters will pay a once-off contribution of &euro;10.</p></reply>

The fencing requirement is one of a number of measures provided for to deter fraudulent claims.</p><p>  However, the situation may be different in the case of hill land.  In such situations, if my Department is satisfied that as the lands in question continue to be actively farmed in the traditional manner by hill farmers in compliance with the requirements of the EU Regulations governing the Direct Payment Scheme, the issue does not arise.</p></reply>

The development of a new Rural Development Programme under Pillar 2 will be a key support in enhancing the competitiveness of the agri-food sector, achieving more sustainable management of natural resources and ensuring a more balanced development of rural areas.</p><p>  A general EU co-financing rate of 53% is set out in the draft Rural Development Regulation but this rate may rise to a maximum of 80% for measures such as farm and business development, co-operation activities, and LEADER projects. Environmental type measures may be co-funded up to 75%. The total Exchequer funding that will be required to draw down the available EAFRD funding will depend on the types of measures included in the new Rural Development Programme and on the co-financing rates applied to these measures.</p><p>  There are a number of conditions attached to Ireland&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;313 million per annum.  The draft Regulation provides that at least 5% of EAFRD funding must be reserved for LEADER while the draft Common Provisions Regulation provides that 6% of EAFRD funding must be set aside to a national performance reserve. The funding set aside to the performance reserve will be allocated to each Member State following a performance review in 2019. The draft Rural Development Regulation also sets out that 30% of the total EAFRD amount must be reserved for environmental operations and climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. </p><p>  Work is currently ongoing in my Department to design the new Rural Development Programme (RDP) for the period from 2014 &ndash; 2020. In designing the new RDP, my Department must take account of the range of requirements set out in the draft Rural Development Regulation and the need to support key policy aims for the agri-food sector in the light of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy. In undertaking this work, a number of ex-ante analyses are being undertaken and a public consultation process has also taken place.</p><p>  While final decisions in relation to what measures are to be included in the new RDP have not yet been made, my Department is in ongoing contact with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the overall financing that will be required. I expect to make decisions in relation to the measures to be supported under the new RDP by the end of this year, and to submit a draft programme to the Commission in early 2014.</p></reply>

These services are delivered through a network of agricultural colleges, regional education and local centres and in collaboration with three privately-owned colleges. Within the various colleges and at local level, Teagasc provide an extensive range of courses in agriculture, horticulture, equine studies and forestry. The provision of additional places and courses is an operational matter for Teagasc and its Board. They currently cater for in excess of 2,000 full time college students, some 10,000 adult learners and also provide degree level courses in collaboration with various Institutes of Technology. </p><p>  There has been a large increase in the demand for student places in the agriculture colleges in recent years reflecting the increased positivity towards the agri-food and farming sectors generally. Current trends suggest that demand has peaked and begun to level off in relation to some courses. Teagasc colleges were able to accommodate all student applications in the current academic year. They do not envisage increasing intake in the immediate years ahead and will focus instead on maintaining quality and appropriate student to staff ratios. A small number of VEC colleges have also commenced provision of Green Cert agriculture courses. </p></reply>

There is no evidence of a significant problem in relation to the welfare of horses due to the very good weather during the Summer and well into the Autumn, which has created a very favourable fodder situation.  In addition, the continuing work being undertaken by local authorities in conjunction with the Department via the Control of Horses Act 1996 has reduced the numbers of abandoned horses throughout the country particularly in urban areas.</p><p>  My Department also continues to stress that it is the responsibility of horse owners to ensure the welfare of horses in their ownership, to breed selectively with stallions of higher merit and to dispose of surplus horses as necessary.  In this context, horse owners are reminded of the advice of the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council that, where an owner can no longer adequately provide for their horse or where the horse can no longer fulfil the purpose for which it was bred, he or she should be proactive in seeking to dispose of the animal, including consideration of the option of humane disposal.  The Department is, of course, continuing to deal with any animal welfare issues relating to horses through its existing mechanisms and has indicated that it is in position to provide emergency funding to assist horse owners who cannot afford to pay for their humane disposal.  Farmers who are facing a critical horse welfare issue over coming months can contact the Department helpline for assistance. </p></reply>

The overall 16% target is broken down by sector into 40% renewable electricity, 12% renewable heat and 10% renewable transport.  My Department has been providing support to farmers since 2007 to establish the energy crops willow and miscanthus.  To the end of 2013 some 3,300 hectares of these crops have been established under the Bioenergy Scheme.  It is recognised that the most challenging target to achieve by 2020 will be in the area of renewable heat.  Crops such as miscanthus and willow, in addition to biomass from the forestry sector, have the potential to contribute to achieving the renewable heat target in particular.</p><p>  Officials from my Department have met recently with individuals who have well advanced plans to establish significant areas of willow over the next number of years, beginning in 2014, to be used as a feedstock in large scale Combined Heat and Power plants (CHP).  These are the type of developments that have the potential to underpin the energy crop sector in the coming years and for the longer term.</p><p>  Officials from my Department are also contributing to the development of a Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources National Bioenergy Strategy to be published shortly.  This will take account of the various strands of bioenergy that are dealt with within my Department, including forestry and energy crops, with a view to maximising their potential contribution to achieving renewable energy targets for 2020 and beyond.</p><p>  I am very pleased that Teagasc has installed an excellent example of a biomass boiler operating on a district heating model at Johnstown Castle, Co. Wexford.  The miscanthus fuelled boiler provides heat to the Teagasc buildings, to Johnstown Castle itself, and there are plans to also provide heat to the Agriculture Museum. </p><p>  As regards the use of biomass heating systems in Government buildings, the Deputy will be aware that this is a matter in the first instance for the Office of Public Works.  In this regard, in November 2012 the late Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Shane McEntee T.D., facilitated a meeting between the Irish Bioenergy Association and Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Brian Hayes T.D., with a view to progressing the issue of procurement of renewable heat for public sector buildings.</p></reply>

The ICC has confirmed that it has systems in place to underpin the welfare of animals participating in coursing events. These include mandatory inspections of hares and coursing venues in advance of the commencement of an event. Greyhounds involved in coursing are subject to the provisions of the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 and the Code of Practice for the care and welfare of greyhounds, published by Bord na gCon.</p><p>The ICC has assured the Department that it goes to great lengths to ensure the highest standards are adhered to during coursing. ICC rules and regulations require the postponement of coursing meetings if the weather is unfavourable for example where snowfall or frost could impact negatively on the greyhound or the hare. The ICC has confirmed that a coursing meeting scheduled to take place on November 23   2013 was postponed due to heavy frost. During extreme weather conditions, it is also the practice of ICC clubs to provide additional food for the hares living in the wild, within hare preserves protected by the ICC.  </p><p>  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, under the Wildlife Acts 1976 to 2012, has responsibility for the issue of an annual licence to the ICC and its affiliated clubs to capture live hares. These licences currently have a total of 26 conditions attached to them.  The conditions of these licences cover a range of items, including veterinary supervision at coursing meetings and a number of requirements attaching to the welfare of hares.</p><p>  The ICC ensures that a veterinary surgeon and a control steward are present at all coursing meetings.  In addition to this, veterinary staff from my Department and rangers from the National Parks and Wildlife Service (part of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht) carry out random monitoring inspections during the coursing season to verify compliance with the licences and the rules governing animal welfare.  </p><p>  As a further control, a Monitoring Committee on Coursing was established during the 1993/94 coursing season and is comprised of officials from my Department and representatives from both the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the ICC to monitor developments in coursing and in that regard the situation is kept under constant review to ensure that coursing is run in a well controlled and responsible manner in the interests of  hares and greyhounds alike.</p><p>  A very high proportion (98.09%) of the hares captured for hare coursing were returned to the wild at the end of the 2012/2013 season. </p><p>  The systems that are in place are, in my view, effective, proportionate and are working well. The ICC has demonstrated its willingness in recent weeks to postpone an event due poor weather. Accordingly I see no need for any unilateral intervention on my part to suspend hare coursing during adverse weather conditions.</p></reply>

During the drafting of the Act a considered and detailed transitional process to deal with the change from previous legislation to the new Act was put in place. The transitional measure contained in Section 63 of the Adoption Act, 2010, allows those who held a valid declaration of eligibility and suitability to adopt before the commencement of the Act to continue with an adoption, from a non-Hague, non-bilateral country for a maximum period of three years.  Such applicants were thus afforded an additional three year period to complete these particular adoptions from non-Hague countries, and must have completed the process by the 31 October 2013. </p><p>   One particular concern that has coincided with the expiry of the transitional provisions provided for in Section 63 of the Adoption Act 2010, is the position of a  small number of applicants who were at a late stage in adopting from Russia when changes to Russian legislation were enacted which meant that they were unable to complete the adoption of identified children before 31 October, 2013.  I have been contacted by four sets of prospective adopters who were affected by this change and who sought my assistance in this regard.</p><p>  It is my understanding that in order to adopt from Russia it is necessary to have a valid declaration of eligibility and suitability to adopt on the date of the court hearing to finalise the adoption, and for a specified period thereafter before the Court order takes effect. In order that these adoptions, which were stopped by this change in Russian law, could continue an amendment to the Adoption Act, 2010, would be necessary to extend the validity of the declarations of eligibility and suitability. </p><p>  The advice of the Attorney General was sought and my Department is currently examining legislative options that might assist,  possibly through the retrospective extension of the declarations of eligibility and suitability concerned. As the Adoption Act, 2010, is drafted on the basis of the incorporation of the Hague Convention, and the minimum set of standards outlined therein, the implications of amending the Act must be carefully examined before the Government is in a position to consider any proposed amendment of the legislation.  My Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, is examining if it is possible to address this situation within the parameters of Irish law and our obligations under the Hague Convention.

The HSE accepted all of these recommendations  and has been undertaking a country-wide process to improve practice in relation to such cases across the country. Most recently this process has involved the convening of a series of workshops for social work staff and managers nationwide. A minimum of two workshops were held  in each region presented by Ms Helen Buckley, Chair of the National Review Panel and Ms Lynne Peyton, Consultant in Children&rsquo;s Services and Social Care.

The latest published report shows that there were 6,465 children in the care of the HSE in September 2013, of which 1,888 (29.2%) were placed with relative foster carers.</p><p>  All prospective foster carers or applicants undergo an assessment and training process to establish their suitability and competence as future foster carers. The assessment  is undertaken by a social worker from the local fostering team and includes Garda vetting, internal HSE checks to establish previous involvement with child protection services, a medical assessment, personal interviews in the applicant&rsquo;s home and if the applicant(s) have children, the social worker will also talk to them about being part of a foster family.   The social worker's  report is then presented to the Foster Care committee for approval, including a recommendation as to the age of the child and type of foster care suitable to the applicant(s).  All approved foster carers are entered on a panel of approved foster carers.</p><p>  When a child is being placed in foster care, the suitability of a placement with relatives is explored in the first instance. Where the HSE is satisfied that an immediate placement with relatives is in the interests of the child, such placement may occur before full approval of the committee is in place. Such emergency placements are provided for in the regulations. Prior to placement, the relative is assessed by a principal social worker, including early Garda vetting. This is followed by a full assessment and approval by the foster care committee as outlined above. </p><p>  The HSE has advised me that they do not collect information on the numbers of relative foster carers who receive training before children are placed with them.

The Health Service Executive (HSE) has been provided with funding in the order of &euro;1.4 billion this year to fund its 2013 disability services programme for children and adults with disabilities.  This represents approximately 11.5% of overall health expenditure this year.  The majority of this funding is distributed through non-statutory agencies who deliver over 80% of all disability services.  There are in the region of 300 such agencies at present across the country that provide a significant and broad range of services for children and adults with disabilities in partnership with and on behalf of the HSE.</p><p>  It is important to note that many children and adults with a disability can be very effectively supported within mainstream child and adult health services.  Dyspraxia is a developmental co-ordination disorder that affects movement and co-ordination.  For some children, dyspraxia can affect their learning capacity.  For this reason they may require additional supports in the school setting to keep up with their classmates.  A comprehensive range of supports is in place in our school system to supports these children.  </p><p>  From a health perspective, there are a number of therapies that can make it easier for people with dyspraxia to cope.  These include speech and language therapy, to improve speech and communication skills, and occupational therapy to find ways to remain independent and complete everyday tasks.  Such therapy services do not necessarily have to be delivered through specialist disability providers and are frequently accessed through Primary Care Teams and community therapy services.</p><p>  The Dyspraxia Association is just one of a range of organisations around the country at present providing supports to specific diagnostic groups who do not receive HSE funding.  Funding of these types of organisations is an issue that is under active and on-going consideration by the HSE.  Pending approval of the HSE's National Service Plan for 2014, it is not possible to predict the service levels and funding to be provided next year for the disability sector.</p></reply>

The screening service is provided by public health nurses and area medical officers.  Children who are identified as requiring treatment or intervention are referred to the HSE ophthalmic service for follow up. Urgent cases are given priority and less urgent cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.  In Kerry urgent referrals are seen by the ophthalmic service, on average, within a one to six week period and routine referrals have an average waiting time of 31 weeks.  However, the HSE is continually working to improve the service.  The HSE has committed to providing 68,000 treatments in 2013 and it was up to the end of September 2013 4.2% ahead of target with the provision of almost 53,000 treatments to children.  I have asked the HSE to provide details of waiting lists and waiting times directly to the Deputies.</p><p>  The HSE&rsquo;s National Clinical Programme for Ophthalmology aims to move towards the elimination of avoidable sight loss, to re-balance the focus on prevention and early intervention, and to provide equitable access to efficient and high quality care, supports and treatment.  A care pathway has been designed in relation to school screening and paediatric ophthalmic services. This includes the expansion of the orthoptic and optometry input into the school screening service.  This draft model of care is under consideration by the HSE.  In addition, the community ophthalmology services will also be the subject of a review in 2014 in order to ensure that the best possible service is available for patients.  I am not aware of the detail of the Association of Optometrists Ireland's 6 Point Vision Check.

The HSE prioritised those recommendations which relate directly to the safe care of their patients. In July 2013, the HSE published an interim report on the progress on implementation.  As set out in that interim report, in moving to the next stage of implementation, the HSE is widening its approach to address a range of governance issues including the structure, membership, codes of practice, management arrangements and performance management process for hospital groups; management and performance management of non-acute services; and performance management of funded services that can be achieved through the existing service arrangements.</p><p>  The HIQA report and the Higgins report, 'the Establishment of Hospital Groups as a Transition to Independent Hospital Trusts&rsquo; provide a template for hospital governance which will be the foundation for the governance of the new hospital groups.

It is acknowledged that there is a need to review the Board membership provisions of the statutory hospital boards and my Department intends to progress legislative amendments as part of the work underway on governance.

Minimum Benefit Regulations, made under the Health Insurance Acts, require insurers to offer a minimum benefit to every insured person.  The key purpose of the Regulations is to ensure the continued availability of the type of broad hospital cover traditionally held as a minimum by the insured population and to ensure that individuals do not significantly under-insure.  Minimum Benefit Regulations were introduced in 1996, under Section 10 of the Health Insurance Act, 1994 and cover in-patient, out-patient and day-patient services provided by publicly funded hospitals, private hospitals, registered nursing home and hospital consultants.</p><p>  The Minimum Benefit Regulations ensure that all consumers obtain an appropriate minimum level of health insurance cover regardless of what plan they purchase and that every plan available is inclusive of a minimum suite of benefits/procedures, some of which are available to the market as a whole and some of which will be applicable specifically to either men or women.  By way of example, the Regulations include provision for such medical treatments as a prostatectomy or testicular biopsy (in the case of men) and cervical biopsy or maternity services (in the case of women).  Importantly, under Community Rating everybody is charged the same premium for a particular health insurance plan which includes this minimum suite of benefits, irrespective of age, gender and the current or likely future state of their health. Thus, the broad base line of procedures provided by minimum benefit should not be looked at in gender specific terms, but rather as a cohort of procedures that are important to the community of the insured population and thus should be protected and provided as a minimum base to all.</p></reply>

Ordinarily, three months before an individual&rsquo;s existing medical card eligibility expiry date, a review notification issues to the individual (or parents, in the case of a child).  A review notification will indicate the card holder should be complete a self-assessment or request the card holder to return evidence of household income, assessable outgoings and medical circumstances to enable a full review assessment be conducted by the HSE.  A reminder letter is issued a month later if the requested review form details have not been returned at that point. If a person does not return the review form within the time specified, continuing eligibility cannot be confirmed and the medical card cannot be reissued.  In these circumstances, or where the review process establishes that a person no longer holds eligibility, the eligibility ceases.</p><p>  Persons are requested to return their completed review forms, at least one month in advance of the due expiry date of their existing eligibility in order to give the HSE sufficient time to carry out the review and/or to get back to the individuals if the application is incomplete or requires any further details to be furnished.  Where a review form is returned, but not fully completed, by the expiry date, it is HSE policy to extend the eligibility of the client for a reasonable period of time until the review is carried out and a final decision made on the person's continuing eligibility, once there is appropriate communication from the client.  Medical card holders who genuinely engage with the review of their medical card eligibility will not have their eligibility withdrawn before that review is complete.</p><p>  GPs are advised three months in advance of the review dates of their patients&rsquo; GP visit cards/medical cards and subsequently the following month, and the month after that, if the patient has not returned the review form by that time.  GPs have full electronic visibility of the medical card panel of patients available to them and have the facility to electronically allow temporary extension of eligibility for expiring cards where a sensitive renewal is appropriate.  The temporary extension may also be allowed where they are aware that a person is still availing of services but there may be something that prevents them from carrying out a standard review, e.g. a blind person with little family support.  GPs can also add new babies to existing cards.  All GPs have appropriate electronic access to the medical card eligibility database and they do not have to confirm medical card details by contacting HSE PCRS.</p><p>  To ensure the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of resources the HSE also undertakes reviews of medical card/GP visit card eligibility, whereby selected cardholders are asked to confirm that they are ordinarily resident in Ireland.  Being ordinarily resident in Ireland is a prerequisite for medical card/GP visit card eligibility.  Approximately 10,000 letters are issued each month and the cardholder is asked to sign and return a Declaration of Residency to the HSE.  On receipt of this Declaration eligibility to the GMS Scheme continues.  If a person does not return the Declaration of Residency form their eligibility ceases.</p><p>  It should be noted that each person who has eligibility to a medical card/GP visit card receives a plastic card on which a &rsquo;valid to&rsquo; date is printed.  This is the latest date that a review may be conducted in respect of that person.  Notwithstanding the &lsquo;valid to&rsquo; date printed on the card, the HSE reserves the right to review eligibility, at any time, and take appropriate action in circumstances where the cardholder no longer fulfils the criteria for eligibility under the Medical Card / GP Visit Card National Assessment Guidelines.</p></reply>

Any portion of premium paid in excess of these ceilings will no longer qualify for tax relief.  The Minister for Finance has allowed 20% tax relief on policies up to &euro;1000 gross for adults and &euro;500 for children. </p><p>  It is important to note that the measure is projected to save the Exchequer &euro;94m in 2014 and &euro;127m in a full year. Pricing of insurance premiums is a matter for insurers. In terms of potential increases in premia that might arise from this measure, it is up to each insurer to contain its own costs and to compete actively on the basis of price.  </p><p>  The Health (Amendment) Act 2013 provided for new charges for all private in-patients in public hospitals, which will take effect on 1 January 2014.  It is estimated that the rates included in the legislation will raise &euro;560 million in hospital income in 2014 from private patients, which is additional hospital income of approximately &euro;39 million over revenue in 2012.</p><p>  My Department will continue to oversee the maintenance of a competitive and sustainable private health insurance market, under the provisions of the Health Insurance Acts 1994 to 2012, and to monitor developments on an ongoing basis, to ensure that the market is regulated appropriately in the transition to a market-based Universal Health Insurance system.</p></reply>

The body with responsibility for this legislation is the National Consumer Agency.</p><p>  The report of the Tobacco Policy Review Group 'Tobacco Free Ireland' was launched on the 3rd October 2013.  The report recommends the establishment of a regulatory framework for nicotine products in the context of discussions at European  Union level.  Last December, the Commission published a proposal for a new EU Tobacco Products Directive, the ultimate purpose of which is to reduce the numbers of people smoking.  The proposal is being discussed in the European Parliament and Council of Ministers and the Commission hope that it will be adopted in 2014.  Nicotine containing products such as e-cigarettes are being considered in the context of this proposed tobacco products directive.</p><p>  In relation to e-cigarettes the World Health Organisation has noted that the safety has not been established and that not enough scientific evidence exists currently to validate the claim that these products are effective smoking cessation aids. A WHO Study Group on Tobacco Product Regulation , concluded that, as no rigorous, peer-reviewed studies have been conducted to show that electronic cigarettes are a safe, effective nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), there is no evidence to support marketing of these products for tobacco cessation.</p></reply>

In the context of the employment control framework numbers employed in the health service must be further reduced.  While it is a matter for the HSE to determine the composition of its staffing complement, it is important not to underestimate the significant role that management/administrative staff play in the direct support of front line services. </p><p>  Administrative staff ensure that the service runs as smoothly as possible, for example staffing ED reception, organising OPD clinics, processing medical cards, collecting income due, managing the health service budget and paying its staff.  Managers are essential also in such a complex system and those earning over &euro;100,000 have taken the biggest reductions in recent years, while shouldering substantial responsibility for the delivery of essential services and functions at national and regional level.  The HSE has operated a general moratorium on the filling of management/administrative posts in recent years, so as to focus development funds as far as possible on the front-line.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the tools are available to the HSE to ensure that the correct number and mix of staff is available in accordance with its business needs and government policy on public service numbers.  In this regard, 78 management/administrative staff have recently been approved for incentivised career breaks.  The HSE has been asked to review the scheme to establish whether there is potential for more staff to be released, in light of the additional capacity available under the additional working hours provisions of the Haddington Road Agreement.</p><p>  In addition a targeted voluntary redundancy scheme is one of the measures that the HSE will use in order to achieve further numbers reduction and facilitate on-going health sector reform. The HSE will determine the areas and functions to be targeted in the context of the changing health service structures and roles, such as the implementation of the hospital groups model, the introduction of shared service functions etc.</p><p>  There will be no automatic right to redundancy under this scheme as grades and posts targeted will be determined by health service managers, according to plans for future service configuration. </p></reply>

Unfortunately, as a result it has become necessary for the HSE to suspend certain products from its list of items reimbursable under the GMS and other community drug schemes.

Shortly after that, two further EPIRBs from the same manufacturer were identified as defective. Following contacts with the manufacturer by my officials, the three units were sent to the company&rsquo;s plant in Australia. A fourth unit was subsequently identified as being defective and it too was sent to the manufacturer in October 2013.</p><p>  My Department engaged closely with the manufacturer and at the end of October the manufacturer informed my Department that an analysis had shown a micro processor within the unit to be defective. On 4 November the manufacturer then issued a formal safety alert advising all owners of the EPIRBs in question to undertake certain checks to confirm their equipment is working. My Department issued a Marine Notice on 11 November drawing the attention of Irish vessel owners and maritime stakeholders to the existence of the manufacturer&rsquo;s safety notice and advising them to undertake the checks recommended by the manufacturer.</p><p>  The Department also requested the Paris Memorandum of Understanding, the international organisation governing port state control throughout Europe, to promulgate the safety alert to other member states and also informed the European Commission. This represented a precautionary and expeditious approach by the Department, as we were the only country to initiate action regarding these particular EPIRBs.</p><p>  I became aware of concerns regarding EPIRBs on 21 November 2013 and sought, and subsequently received, from my Department officials a detailed report on the matter.  My Department will continue to examine EPIRBs on vessels as part of its normal surveying activities.  Furthermore, as a precautionary measure, I have requested my Department to inform everyone on the EPIRB register of the relevant marine notice to emphasise the importance of undertaking the necessary periodic self-checks in line with manufacturer's recommendations.</p></reply>

Ireland does not have a country profile in the Funding Guide as, in general, Ireland is exempt from EU inland waterways rules and proposals since they relate to waterways of a greater size and carrying a greater capacity of goods than exist in Ireland.  The European Union&rsquo;s inland waterway network spans 20 Member States with about 37,000 kilometres of inland waterways.  Every year, these transport around 500 million tons of cargo, in particular in the densely populated and congested areas of Germany, the Netherlands, France and Belgium. </p><p>  Ireland has no inland waterways within the definition of the EU legislation as Ireland&rsquo;s inland waterways are not navigable for commercial traffic and we do not have any interconnected inland commercial transport for the purposes, or on the scale, envisaged by EU proposals in this area. </p><p>  My Department is responsible for licensing all commercial inland craft in Ireland.  There are no commercial cargo craft on Ireland&rsquo;s inland waterways, apart from some small workboats.  There are a number of domestic passenger boats and ships operating locally as tourist excursion vessels.</p><p>  Ireland keeps a watching brief on EU inland waterways matters, mainly to ensure that any proposals do not conflict with, or overlap, the existing maritime safety regimes.   </p></reply>

The arrangements for commercial vehicle testing in the State were comprehensively reviewed in 2007 and the Government decided that the model for delivery of testing by private operators should continue.  However, the authorisation and supervision of commercial vehicle testing should be centralised under the Road Safety Authority (RSA) to ensure consistency of testing across the country.  The Road Safety Authority (Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness) Act 2012 provides the powers to the RSA to undertake this function.</p><p>  The RSA is in the process of implementing major reforms in the testing system, which will deliver an enhanced service for the customer.  Apart from safer roads for all road users, the reforms are designed to level the competitive playing field for commercial vehicle operators by reducing non-compliance with testing and roadworthiness requirements.  The new system is designed to deliver several administrative benefits for operators, including online booking systems, reducing the vehicle paperwork to be brought to the test and centralised issuing of the Certificate of Roadworthiness (CRW).</p><p>  From 7th October 2013, a new annual fee, which includes a road safety levy, was introduced.  The RSA consulted industry on the reforms and the planned road safety levy in November 2011 and the actual levy is lower than that proposed in the public consultation.  There have been a number of awareness raising measures of the reforms over the summer months and the new fees were advertised in national newspapers on 3rd October 2013 and are available in full on the RSA website.</p><p>  The levy is also funding enhanced supervision, enforcement and compliance measures being introduced at the roadside and at operator premises.  A risk rating system is also being introduced so that roadside enforcement activity is targeted at higher risk operators ensuring that compliant operators are less likely to experience disruption to their daily business.</p></reply>
