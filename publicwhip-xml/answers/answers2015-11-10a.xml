    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-11-10a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111000053#WRA00800"><p>The Building Energy Rating (BER) scheme was established under the European Communities (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2006.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is designated as the issuing authority with responsibility for registering BER assessors, logging BER assessments and managing the BER scheme.</p>  <p>  Since 2007, all new buildings require a BER before occupation. In 2009, this requirement was extended to require a seller or landlord to provide a BER for existing buildings when they are offered for sale or rent.  At the end of October 2015, 586,946 BER certificates for individual dwellings and 34,960 BER certificates for non-residential buildings have been registered with SEAI. This means that around one third of the homes in Ireland now possess a BER certificate. </p>  <p>  SEAI make statistical data on the Building Energy Rating (BER) scheme available online for researchers and other interested parties through the National BER Research Tool.  The Central Statistics Office publish quarterly reports on the analysis of BER data.  Independent studies have shown that the BER system is having a significant effect on the housing market, with higher rated properties attracting a higher sale price than similar properties with a lower rating. </p>  <p>  I have secured a total of just over &euro;68m in capital funding for energy programmes in 2016, a substantial component of which will be devoted to energy efficiency action.  This represents an increase of &euro;13m or almost 24% on the 2015 capital allocation for the energy programmes.  The increased level of funding for energy efficiency in 2016 will provide for an extension of the existing schemes operated under the umbrella of Better Energy scheme and the creation of a new pilot programme to demonstrate the potential of energy efficiency to achieve better health outcomes. A detailed breakdown of expected expenditure on each programme will be published in the revised estimates in December. </p>  <p>  Looking beyond 2016, it is clear that very significant levels of investment, both public and private, will be needed to realise the potential of energy efficiency in the built environment for achieving our overarching energy and climate goals cost effectively.  This is both a challenge and an opportunity and will be a central element to the White Paper on Energy Policy, which I intend to publish before the end of the year.</p></reply>

The primary objective in introducing such a charge is to secure a more stable funding stream for public service broadcasting than the current TV Licence system provides. I believe that this is particularly necessary in light of the current high level of evasion and the impact that technological developments are having on the way that media is consumed.  The Government is committed to providing adequate funding for public service broadcasting in a time of stretched family budgets and limited exchequer funds.  I believe a public service broadcasting charge could contribute to this, while reflecting the changing ways that viewers now access public service broadcasting  .In terms of the introduction of such a charge, in my statement on 21 April 2015 regarding the publication of the NewERA and Indecon reports, I indicated that I had advised Government that it would not be possible to replace the TV licence fee with a public service broadcasting charge within the lifetime of this Government on the basis that there is a need to build public understanding and support for the introduction of such a charge before it could be introduced.</p></reply>

This funding supports the development of test sites in counties Mayo, Galway and Cork, and supports marine research activities at the Integrated Maritime Energy Resource Cluster at Ringaskiddy. </p>  <p>  Last June, An Taoiseach officially opened the University College Cork Beaufort Building in Ringaskiddy, which is a world-class facility for renewable energy and maritime research which includes state-of-the-art wave simulators, test tanks, workshops and offices. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s budget also supports the Prototype Development Fund operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  The Authority supports and grant aids ocean wave energy companies from this fund, helping projects progress up the technology readiness level development path. In line with the approach taken internationally, the emphasis is on industry-led projects as the best way of supporting innovation.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan further proposes an initial market support scheme for wave and tidal energy from 2016. </p>  <p>  Implementation of the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan continues with the aim of unlocking of the economic growth and job creation opportunities offered by ocean energy development.</p></reply>

In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources, 12% renewables in the heating sector and 10% in transport. Provisional figures provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland for 2014 show that 22.7% of electricity was met from renewable sources. </p>  <p>  Ireland is making good progress with regard to renewable energy deployment.  It is estimated that a total of between 3,500 MW and 4,000 MW of onshore renewables generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its electricity target.  As the most cost effective of the technologies available to Ireland, wind energy will make the largest contribution to bridging the gap to meeting the electricity target.</p>  <p>  In December 2013, the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government began a review of the existing Wind Energy Development Guidelines.  The review focused on the specific issues of noise, proximity, and shadow flicker. Submissions were received from around 7,500 organisations and members of the public during the public consultation period. </p>  <p>  This is a very technical area and the engagement between the two departments is ongoing. Technical studies have been obtained on various aspects of the issues, particularly noise - including separation distance - and detailed assessments of various options have been undertaken by the two Departments.</p>  <p>  Any revisions to the guidelines following the conclusion of deliberations, will be introduced by issuing the revised guidelines to planning authorities under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. </p></reply>

TG4 also currently receives &euro;9.245m from the gross receipts. Following these deductions, 7% of the net revenue is paid to the Broadcasting Fund Scheme.  The Scheme, which is operated by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, was established to provide funding in support of the production of high quality programmes by independent producers and broadcasters on Irish culture, heritage and experience, and programmes to improve adult literacy.  The scheme also supports certain archiving projects being undertaken by broadcasters. </p>  <p>  Any revenues remaining following these payments are provided to RT&Eacute;.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the TV licence revenues paid to RT&Eacute; and TG4 is to facilitate the pursuit of each broadcaster's public service objectives, which are set out in the 2009 Act.</p>  <p>  Statutorily mandated annual and five yearly reviews are conducted by the BAI which must consider whether each broadcaster has fulfilled the commitments set out in its annual statement and make a recommendation as to whether there should be an adjustment to the level of public funding.  The first 5 year review was undertaken in 2013 and this work included a wide-ranging process of stakeholder engagement with market players and other interested parties, involving both face to face interviews and written submissions.</p></reply>

Wood Mackenzie furnished their Final Report to my Department in May 2014.</p>  <p>  Government approval was received in June 2014 to publish the Final Report and to revise Ireland&rsquo;s oil and gas fiscal terms along the lines recommended by Wood Mackenzie. </p>  <p>  Subsequently, a Steering Group comprising representation from the Department of Finance, my Department and the Revenue Commissioners, was tasked with preparing legislative proposals to give effect to the revised terms.  The work of this Group has concluded and the resulting legislative proposals, which fully implement the Wood Mackenzie recommendations, are contained in Finance Bill 2015. </p>  <p>  Section 18 of the Bill amends the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to insert a Chapter introducing the new field based Petroleum Production Tax which will apply in the case of any petroleum authorisation first awarded after 18 June 2014.  The new regime will result in a minimum tax payment at a rate of 5% of gross revenues in every year that a field is selling production and an increase in the maximum marginal tax take on a producing field from 40% to 55%.</p>  <p>  For future prospective licence holders a clear fiscal regime is being set out and the rationale for that regime has been explained.  This should further engender industry confidence in the stability and predictability of Ireland&rsquo;s oil and gas fiscal terms and allow the industry to focus on effective and timely exploration effort.</p></reply>

I am constrained, therefore, in what I can say in relation to the project other than the provision of factual information.</p>  <p>  The North South Transmission Link project is part of EirGrid&rsquo;s Grid25 plan to upgrade the national electricity transmission system between now and 2025.  It is a strategically urgent project that will remove restrictions limiting cross-border power flows between Ireland and Northern Ireland thus strengthening security of electricity supply throughout the island of Ireland. </p>  <p>  In discharging its duties as operator and developer of the national transmission grid, EirGrid engages with communities and citizens on an ongoing basis.  In December 2014 it completed a comprehensive review of its existing consultation process and has been working since then to implement the commitments arising from the review including: developing a participative, more community based approach; changing fundamentally its culture and processes so as to develop stronger engagement and relationships with stakeholders; and encouraging more effective discussion on energy and critical infrastructure. </p>  <p>  EirGrid has opened offices in Navan, Cootehill and Carrickmacross and has appointed Community Liaison Officers and Agricultural Liaison Officers who are all involved in outreach to the local communities along the intended route of the North South Transmission Link project.  There has been extensive public consultation on the North South Transmission Link project including statutory consultation as required under Regulation (EU) No. 347/2013 on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure and Section 182A of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, as amended.</p></reply>

The recommendations are in the following areas:</p>  <p>  -	improved governance structures on projects;</p>  <p>  -	the inclusion of all costs when preparing cost benefit analyses and when presenting proposals to Government;</p>  <p>  -	improved processes around procurement. </p>  <p>  The recommendations were accepted by the Secretary General of my Department, in his capacity as Accounting Officer.</p>  <p>  The findings, the detailed recommendations, and the response of the Accounting Officer, are set out at Chapter 13 of the C&amp;AG's Report. </p>  <p>  Taking the key areas identified in the report, the position is as follows:</p>  <p>  -	the Department aims to ensure that robust governance arrangements are in place for all large projects that it funds.  A formal project management approach was used during the implementation of the postcodes project with all milestones, deliverables, costs, issues and risks tracked and actively managed.  The concern of the C&amp;AG related primarily to the pre-implementation stages of the project and the Department is taking those lessons into account in the management of other major projects it is currently dealing with:</p>  <p>  -	In relation to costs, my Department will include all costs that can be estimated when seeking Government approval for a project.  The report made a number of recommendations in relation to the cost benefit analyses that were carried out on the project.  The Department is satisfied that the approach taken in developing the cost benefit analyses complied with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines in this area.  The report did raise a specifc issue around the appropriate discount factor to be used.  The Postcode Project used a higher discount factor which was deemed a conservative approach to take at the time given that it resulted in a reduced net present value.  However, in the interest of comparability, my Department will ensure that the recommended discount rate is used in all future projects.</p>  <p>  -	In relation to Procurement, my Department has established a dedicated procurement unit which assists in the planning and delivery of procurement.  All proposed procurements must be forwarded to the procurement unit prior to the commencement of the process.  A comprehensive procurement training course has also been rolled out in the Department this year.  This will help ensure that all procurement activity is fully compliant with best practice.</p></reply>

The primary objective in introducing such a charge is to secure a more stable funding stream for public service broadcasting than the current TV Licence system provides.  I believe that this is particularly necessary in light of the current high level of evasion and the impact that technological developments are having on the way that media is consumed.  The Government is committed to providing adequate funding for public service broadcasting in a time of stretched family budgets and limited exchequer funds.  I believe a public service broadcasting charge could contribute to this, while reflecting the changing ways that viewers now access public service broadcasting.   In terms of the introduction of such a charge, in my statement on 21 April 2015 regarding the publication of the NewERA and Indecon reports, I indicated that I had advised Government that it would not be possible to replace the TV licence fee with a public service broadcasting charge within the lifetime of this Government on the basis that there is a need to build public understanding and support for the introduction of such a charge before it could be introduced.</p></reply>

In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources, 12% renewables in the heating sector and 10% in transport.  Provisional figures provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland for 2014 show that 22.7% of electricity was met from renewable sources. </p>  <p>  Ireland is making good progress with regard to renewable energy deployment.  It is estimated that a total of between 3,500 MW and 4,000 MW of onshore renewables generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its electricity target.  As the most cost effective of the technologies available to Ireland, wind energy will make the largest contribution to bridging the gap to meeting the electricity target.</p>  <p>  In December 2013, the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government began a review of the existing Wind Energy Development Guidelines.  The review focused on the specific issues of noise, proximity, and shadow flicker.  Submissions were received from around 7,500 organisations and members of the public during the public consultation period. </p>  <p>  This is a very technical area and the engagement between the two departments is ongoing.  Technical studies have been obtained on various aspects of the issues, particularly noise - including separation distance - and detailed assessments of various options have been undertaken by the two Departments.</p>  <p>  Any revisions to the guidelines following the conclusion of deliberations, will be introduced by issuing the revised guidelines to planning authorities under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.</p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.</p>  <p>  In July last I published a detailed draft Intervention Strategy for public consultation. </p>  <p>  That strategy proposes that the State-funded network must be capable of delivering high-quality high speed broadband of at least 30mbps download and 6mbps upload.  It must also be capable of catering for higher performance in the future so as to keep pace with consumer demand.  This will be a specific requirement of the tender and it will be a matter for bidders to select the technology they consider will best deliver the service.</p>  <p>  As I have repeatedly stated, we must observe a strict policy of technology neutrality in any procurement process and therefore I am not in a position to promise connectivity through any one particular technology platform.  We will set out a detailed service specification, including a requirement to scale up services over the lifetime of the contract, and allow bidders show how they propose to meet these contractual requirements.</p>  <p>  However, given the quality of the services we wish to see delivered, and based on the current absence of significant fibre networks in many parts of Ireland it is likely that fibre will play a major role in any proposed solution.  However, the technology platforms that will provide the final connectivity to the premise will be a matter for commercial operators to decide on.</p>  <p>  The Government is determined to ensure that the network is built out as quickly as possible and engagement with industry stakeholders has indicated that this could be achieved within 3-5 years of the contract award. </p>  <p>  In this context, the NBP proposes that through the combination of commercial investment and State intervention, 85% of addresses in Ireland will have access to high speed services by 2018 with all addresses passed by 2020.</p></reply>

The MANs have facilitated large and small retail service providers, operating in a fully liberalised market, in providing high speed broadband services without having to build their own networks.  The MANs provide a link between national backhaul networks and the &ldquo;last mile&rdquo; access networks that deliver telecommunications services to citizens and businesses. The 88 MANs which cover 94 regional cities and towns are managed, maintained, marketed and operated under a concession by a Management Services Entity (MSE). enet is currently the MSE for the MANs and further details relating to the MANs are available at . </p><p>The MSE provides fibre based services and products to licensed telecommunications operators on a wholesale, open access basis. In towns like Clifden, for example, the MSE provides wholesale broadband services to a number of different operators who provide downstream services to end customers.  The decision, however, to avail of the MANs is ultimately based on the operator&rsquo;s own commercial business case. </p><p>The MANs are now used by over 60 licensed telecoms operators and it is estimated that in excess of 600,000 users are benefitting from services provided through the MANs.  The SME market has also benefitted from the MANs, with enhanced services on different platforms available from a range of service providers.  Other end customers served by service providers availing of the MANs infrastructure include industrial estates, multinationals, State entities, educational institutions, as well as fixed and mobile customers outside Dublin. </p><p>enet, in its private capacity, has developed a model to construct wholesale Fibre to the Building (FTTB) networks, aimed at meeting the needs of the SME market, in four pilot towns, namely Claremorris, Loughrea, Ardee and Kilkenny.  These networks provide a fibre connection from the MAN to business premises in these towns.</p><p>Under EU State Aid rules, the State can only intervene in cases of clear market failure. Any question of subsidising connections to the MANs would come within the area of State Aid. </p><p>The current focus of policy is to deliver high speed broadband services through the National Broadband Plan (NBP).  The Plan aims to deliver high speed broadband to every citizen and business in Ireland.  This is being achieved through a combination of accelerated commercial investment by telecoms operators, and a proposed State intervention to provide high speed broadband to those parts of the country where the commercial sector will not invest. The State-led intervention will deliver services where through an open and competitive process in which all operators can bid to provide services. </p><p>The NBP proposed Intervention Strategy document, which I published on 15 July last, sets out a series of detailed proposals by Government in respect of the proposed State intervention.  It sets out the key elements of the intervention - what services are proposed and how they will be delivered. It outlines various aspects of the proposed intervention including the type of network envisaged, the minimum speeds being demanded, the length of the contract for services, and whether the network should be public or privately owned.</p><p>My Department is currently in the process of updating the high speed broadband coverage Map, published initially in November 2014, taking into consideration any new information received or operator announcements made of any new plans.  I expect to publish an updated version of the Map before the end of this year.</p><p>The Government is determined to ensure that the network is built out as quickly as possible and engagement with industry stakeholders has indicated that this could be achieved within 3-5 years of the contract award.</p><p>In this context, the NBP proposes that through the combination of commercial investment and State intervention, 85% of addresses in Ireland will have access to high speed services by 2018 with all addresses passed by 2020.</p></reply>

Figures provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) for 2014 show that 8.6% of Ireland's overall energy requirement was met from renewable sources.  In addition, SEAI has calculated that, in 2014, 22.7% of electricity, 6.6% of heat and 5.2% of transport were from renewables.  While the progress to date is encouraging, significant challenges remain, particularly in the heat and transport sectors.</p>  <p>  Regarding renewable electricity, the REFIT schemes underpin the development of a range of technologies, including hydro, biomass combustion, biomass combined heat and power, landfill gas and onshore wind.  These schemes will be closed to new applications at the end of this year.  In terms of renewable heat, in addition to existing measures such as Part L of the Building Regulations, the 2014 Draft Bioenergy Plan recommended the introduction of a Renewable Heat Incentive for larger heat users to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources. </p>  <p>  On 31 July 2015, my Department launched two separate consultations on new support schemes, one for renewable electricity and one for a proposed Renewable Heat Incentive.  Two further consultations on each support scheme are planned.  These consultations will be informative regarding the cost effectiveness technologies that can assist in meeting our future renewable energy targets. Subject to Government approval and State Aid clearance from the European Commission, the new schemes would become available in late 2016. </p>  <p>  As regards renewable transport, Ireland aims to meet its target mainly through the use of sustainable biofuels.  Further increases to the obligation rate in the Biofuels Obligation Scheme will be required in the context of achieving our 2020 target.

In May 2014 the Panel approved the Terms of Reference for comprehensive, route specific studies/reports of fully undergrounded and overhead options for each of the Grid West and Grid Link projects, including assessments of potential environmental impacts, technical efficacy and cost factors.</p>  <p>  EirGrid provided its report on the Grid Link project to the Panel on 28 September 2015.  The report set out an analysis of alternative options to meet the needs of the Grid Link project.  The report considered both overhead and underground solutions.  In addition to this, EirGrid set out a new and innovative technical solution, referred to as the &lsquo;regional option&rsquo;, based on technology which is capable of strengthening the existing grid infrastructure in the region. </p>  <p>  The &lsquo;regional option&rsquo; alternative was first published by EirGrid in March 2015, in its &lsquo;Your Grid, Your Views, Your Tomorrow&rsquo; draft strategy document.  The regional option proposes to use the existing 400kv grid infrastructure from Moneypoint to the greater Dublin area instead of constructing any new overhead or underground solutions for Grid Link.  The regional option uses a technology known as &lsquo;series compensation&rsquo;.  This would be the first time it will be deployed on the Irish transmission grid. It is an advanced, smart grid technology that will enable more power to flow through existing lines. EirGrid's Report on Grid Link to the Panel highlights: (i) that many respondents to the Grid Development Strategy Discussion Document welcomed the regional option, and (ii) EirGrid's preference for the regional option as the optimal solution for Grid Link at this time.</p>  <p>  There is now no requirement to proceed with the previously proposed Grid Link 400 kV overhead line.

In May 2014 the Panel approved the Terms of Reference for comprehensive, route specific studies/reports of fully undergrounded and overhead options for each of the Grid West and Grid Link projects, including assessments of potential environmental impacts, technical efficacy and cost factors.</p>  <p>  EirGrid provided its report on the Grid Link project to the Panel on 28 September 2015.  The report set out an analysis of alternative options to meet the needs of the Grid Link project.  The report considered both overhead and underground solutions.  In addition to this, EirGrid set out a new and innovative technical solution, referred to as the &lsquo;regional option&rsquo;, based on technology which is capable of strengthening the existing grid infrastructure in the region. </p>  <p>  The &lsquo;regional option&rsquo; alternative was first published by EirGrid in March 2015, in its &lsquo;Your Grid, Your Views, Your Tomorrow&rsquo; draft strategy document.  The regional option proposes to use the existing 400kv grid infrastructure from Moneypoint to the greater Dublin area instead of constructing any new overhead or underground solutions for Grid Link.  The regional option uses a technology known as &lsquo;series compensation&rsquo;.  This would be the first time it will be deployed on the Irish transmission grid. It is an advanced, smart grid technology that will enable more power to flow through existing lines. EirGrid's Report on Grid Link to the Panel highlights: (i) that many respondents to the Grid Development Strategy Discussion Document welcomed the regional option, and (ii) EirGrid's preference for the regional option as the optimal solution for Grid Link at this time.</p>  <p>  There is now no requirement to proceed with the previously proposed Grid Link 400 kV overhead line.  This represents a good outcome, following a comprehensive and transparent process, which ensures that energy demands for the region can be met at least cost to energy consumers.</p></reply>

That programme allows community and locally based organisations to apply for funding on a competitive basis to support sustainable energy upgrades to existing buildings and facilities.  It also promotes the creation and development of locally based entities that can engage and mobilise community resources to lower energy bills and boost local employment.  &euro;19.6m in grants have been approved under the Better Energy Communities Programme 2015.</p>  <p>  One of the central themes in the Green Paper on Energy Policy, published in May 2014, is citizen empowerment.  Since its publication, the Department undertook a public consultation process which included analysis of over 1,200 written submissions and thirteen stakeholder seminars on the various priority areas highlighted in the Green Paper.  A recurring message coming from both the written submissions and the seminars was the role that community energy could play in our future energy systems.  The views submitted on this and other matters are being considered in the formulation of the Energy White Paper, which will be published before the end of the year.</p></reply>

Ireland participates in the KPCS as a Member State of the EU.  The EU as a whole is a single Participant in the KPCS, and Council Regulation (EC) 2368/2002 implementing the KPCS for the international trade in rough diamonds applies common rules in all Member States. </p>  <p>  Ireland is fully engaged in the KPCS at EU level and supports efforts to ensure that all trade in rough diamonds potentially used to finance armed conflicts aimed at undermining legitimate governments is prevented.

However, the postal sector is undergoing systemic change, with migration towards electronic communications resulting in significant core mail volume decline year-on-year.  In recognition of the changing commercial environment I established the Post Office Network Business Development Group earlier this year.  The group&rsquo;s remit is to examine the potential from existing and new Government and commercial business that could be transacted through the post office network.  The group presented its initial report to me in May 2015 and, in summary, the report outlined that the future of the post office network would be best secured by seeking out opportunities in the following areas: financial services, including basic banking for the unbanked, Government services, social capital and enterprise, and white labelling of financial and other products.</p>  <p>  To gain further insight into these areas, a public consultation exercise was held from 16 June to 28 July.  Interested parties were invited to submit their views on the initial report.  It is clear from the responses received that there is a strong public desire to maintain the nationwide network of post offices.  The consultation responses are assisting the group in identifying opportunities that can benefit the post office network and will inform the final report, which I expect to receive presently.</p>  <p>  It is premature to speculate, in advance of the final report, on what the next steps will be until I have had the opportunity to consider in detail the findings of the group.</p></reply>

The provision for 2015 represents a transfer of funding in excess of &euro;20 million to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to support the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). </p>  <p>  In local authority areas where HAP is in place, new applicants assessed as requiring social housing support will be considered for HAP rather than rent supplement.  HAP is operational in 15 local authority areas and there are currently over 4,600 HAP tenancies in place.</p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s strategic direction is to transfer responsibility of persons with long term housing needs to the local authorities under HAP.  Of the 4,600 HAP tenancies in place, some 1,650 have transferred from rent supplement, having been in receipt of the scheme for a period of over 18 months.  Failure of a landlord to participate in HAP does not affect a recipient&rsquo;s continued entitlement to rent supplement.  I can assure the Deputy that Departmental officers make every effort to ensure that persons in receipt of rent supplement are supported in the transfer to HAP. </p>  <p>  Officials in the Department continue to work closely with those in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the local authorities to further roll out HAP and to ensure that customers are supported in the transition from rent supplement.</p></reply>

In July 2006, they were re-named guardian&rsquo;s payments (contributory and non-contributory) in recognition of the fact that the original remit of the schemes had been extended to include children other than those who had lost both parents through bereavement.</p>  <p>  Guardian&rsquo;s payment (both contributory and non-contributory) is payable in respect of a child who satisfies the definition of an &ldquo;orphan&rdquo; under social welfare legislation, where the qualifying conditions are satisfied.</p>  <p>  Social welfare law defines a &ldquo;guardian&rdquo; as &ldquo;the person in whose care an orphan normally resides&rdquo;.  There is no requirement under social welfare legislation for a person applying for a guardian&rsquo;s payment to be appointed the legal guardian of the child concerned.</p>  <p>  Equally, the fact that a person has applied to the Courts to be appointed as the child&rsquo;s legal guardian does not automatically imply that they are entitled to guardian&rsquo;s payment from the Department of Social Protection.  That fact, along with all of the other evidence in the case, will be considered by the Deciding Officer when making their decision as to whether or not the qualifying conditions for guardian&rsquo;s payment are satisfied.</p>  <p>  The Department does not collect or retain statistics on the number of applicants for guardian&rsquo;s payments who have been appointed as legal guardians by the Courts and so the information sought by the Deputy is not available.</p></reply>

The jobseeker schemes are paid weekly in arrears with the customer certifying that they did satisfy the conditions of the scheme.  Where a customer avails of the holiday option, payment continues to be in arrears, with the customer presenting to their Intreo Centre on return from holidays to have their payment for the holiday period issued.  If a person goes on holiday for longer than 2 weeks, they may be paid in respect of the first two weeks, but are disqualified for any payment for time spent abroad in excess of this.</p>  <p>  Recipients of certain schemes, for example Illness Benefit and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance can continue to receive their payment during an absence from the State for the purpose of receiving medical treatment (or accompanying a person receiving medical treatment).

Following the completion of a rigorous public procurement process, two companies were selected to provide the JobPath service - Turas Nua Limited and Seetec Limited.  The companies will deliver services directly and will also engage a range of local subcontractors, including local training and employment service providers. </p>  <p>  JobPath was designed having regard to international experience of contracted out employment services and taking account of inputs received at a number of open information fora and advice received from Irish and International experts.  Significant safeguards have been built into JobPath.  These include a service guarantee to ensure that all participants receive a baseline level of service as well as penalties for the companies if service performance or service quality does not meet standards.  Both companies will be subject to regular on-site inspections and audits to ensure that JobPath is delivered in accordance with contractual obligations.  It is also the case that decisions regarding a person&rsquo;s welfare entitlements while on JobPath will be taken only by Department officials and not by the JobPath companies while the sanction process for clients on JobPath is exactly the same as the process for clients who engage with the Department&rsquo;s own activation service. </p>  <p>  In relation to the experience of the person in Longford, I have been advised that a letter was sent to the person concerned on 13 October inviting her to attend a JobPath group information session on 20 October.</p>  <p>  The person concerned received a follow up phone call on 14 October to confirm the appointment but she said that was unable to attend the scheduled group information session.  She was offered an alternative appointment on 27 October but again she said she was unable to attend.  Arrangements were then made for her to attend an individual information session on 28 October which she duly attended. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, the person concerned was interviewed on 19 October for a place on a local Community Employment (CE) Scheme following which she was provisionally offered a position for 19 &frac12; hours a week for one year.</p>  <p>  While CE schemes are intended to help long-term unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce, by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine for a limited duration, they are not full-time sustainable jobs.  A key objective of JobPath is however to assist jobseekers to secure full-time sustainable employment. </p>  <p>  Participants on JobPath receive intensive individual support to help them address barriers to employment and to assist them in finding jobs.  They will spend a year on the programme and if they are placed into a job they may continue to receive support for the first year of employment.  During their time on JobPath they may also be referred for further education and training opportunities.  Jobseekers retain their existing social welfare payment while on JobPath. </p>  <p>  Given the circumstances of this case I have asked a senior official of the Department to review the person&rsquo;s case with a view to assessing the validity of the complaint received and determining the best outcome for the person concerned.  This review is currently underway.</p></reply>

The Review covers a 55 year period and builds on the findings of previous Actuarial Reviews, taking account of the policy, economic and demographic changes with particular reference to income and expenditure projections as well as value for money and break-even contribution rates issues.    </p>  <p>  The Review found that the self-employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  The report also found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), which is the benefit currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15% at national average earnings level. This is compared favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  While the Review did not examine the cost of extending cover for illness benefit to the self-employed it did examine the cost of extending invalidity pension to that group.  The Review found that an incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to approximately 17% would be required. </p>  <p>  In June 2011, I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare to examine a number of specific issues including the issues involved in providing social insurance cover for the self-employed. </p>  <p>  In its 2013 report, the Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  In this regard the Group recommended that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points, payable on a compulsory basis only.  </p>  <p>  Any changes to the PRSI system for the self-employed would have to be considered in a budgetary context and, in particular, the funding position of additional entitlements.</p></reply>

Expenditure on pensions at approximately &euro;6.675 billion is the largest block of expenditure in the Department in the Estimate for 2015, representing almost 34.4% of overall expenditure.  Because of demographic changes, the Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  The Department has had to make provision for an additional &euro;168 million this year for the increasing number of pensioners.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. </p>  <p>  While the decision to discontinue the telephone allowance was a difficult one it provided annual savings of &euro;48 million and meant that the Department was able to retain the other valuable elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence.  The Department will spend approx. &euro;227 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 416,000 customers. </p>  <p>  I am keenly aware of the impact on the Department&rsquo;s clients and particularly those who are living alone.  In Budget 2016, I was able to announce the first increase in the basic rate of the State pension in seven years, by &euro;3 per week.  This will increase the personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;222, and that of the contributory pension to &euro;233.30.  I was also pleased to announce a &euro;2.50 increase in the rate of the Fuel Allowance, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week.  I believe that, taken together with other changes, such as increasing the Christmas Bonus to 75% of weekly rate and increasing the Living Alone Allowance in 2015, the impact of this Budget will be very positive for older people. </p></reply>

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and maintain revenue to reduce the budget deficit. It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced, and is applied at a low rate on a wide base.  </p><p>The USC, like the Income Levy before it, does not apply to social welfare payments, such as the contributory and non-contributory State pensions, or payments of a similar nature.  However occupational pensions, including occupational pensions of retired civil servants, are liable to the USC if the payment is greater than the exemption threshold, which for 2015 is &euro;12,012.</p><p>As you are aware, delivering on a commitment in the Programme for Government, the USC was reviewed by my Department in the lead up to Budget 2012. The report is available on my Department's website at .  The issue of USC applying to occupational pensions of retired public servants who entered the public service before April 1995 was examined as part of that review.  Such individuals are (or were) liable to modified rate PRSI, which does not generate an entitlement to the State Pension.</p><p>The Government decided not to exempt the occupational pensions of these individuals from the USC charge as it would be very costly and difficult to achieve, and it would involve all income earners with the equivalent income benefitting from the exemption.  In addition, it would also undermine the principle of the USC being applied to income with few exceptions. </p><p>However, as a result of the review of the USC, the Government decided in Budget 2012 to increase the entry point to the Universal Social Charge from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum. Budget 2015 provided for an increase in the exemption threshold to &euro;12,012 and I announced in my recent Budget speech that this threshold will increase to &euro;13,000 per annum from 1 January 2016. It is estimated that over 700,000 income earners will not be liable to USC at all from next year.  </p><p>This exemption threshold equalises the position for single individuals whose sole source of income is the State Contributory Pension with Public Service pensioners whose pension is at an equivalent level. Furthermore, I intend to continue to reform the tax system in future budgets, subject to having the required fiscal space.  </p><p>I would point out that the changes to the income tax system included in Budget 2015 mean that individuals who paid Income Tax and /or USC in 2014, including pensioners, are seeing a reduction in their tax bill this year where incomes are equal. Budget 2016 is now continuing this process of reducing the tax burden on low and middle income earners including, among other changes, a decrease in the three lowest rates of USC announced to take effect from January 2016.</p></reply>

The imposition of lending restrictions is a matter for the Central Bank who have informed me   that there are no credit unions with lending restrictions on loans of &euro;1,000 or less.</p>  <p>  Under the European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations 2010 (S.I. No 281 of 2010) transposed into Irish law on 11 June 2010, before concluding a credit agreement with a consumer, a creditor shall assess the consumer's creditworthiness on the basis of sufficient information. The scope of these regulations includes credit agreements where the loan amounts are between &euro;200 and &euro;75,000. </p>  <p>  I have also been informed by the Central Bank that while the important role of credit unions within their communities and, of course, that many members have a demand for credit is fully accepted, from a regulatory perspective it is important that credit unions are prudent in how they lend money, particularly as it is the money of the saving members of credit unions that is ultimately lent to borrowing members. Ensuring that those borrowers can repay is paramount in the protection of those savings. Accordingly, the Central Bank expects credit unions to apply prudent lending standards to the granting of all new loans or top-ups of existing loans and to have systems in place to ensure that such applications are fully assessed to confirm the member's creditworthiness. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has further informed me that it has been necessary to put lending restrictions in place in credit unions where there are regulatory concerns and resultant risk to members' savings. The majority of lending restrictions in place enable credit unions to lend amounts in the range of &euro;10,000 to &euro;30,000 and these are reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether or not they are still set at appropriate levels. </p>  <p>  In February 2015 the Central Bank commenced a lending restriction review initiative, whereby credit unions that are subject to a lending restriction, but are satisfied that they have made the necessary improvements and have embedded these improvements in robust risk sensitive lending practices, could apply for a review of their lending restriction. The closing date for receipt of applications to review lending restrictions under this initiative was 30 September 2015. 59% of those applications received have been reviewed by the Central Bank.  Of the applications which have been fully reviewed, 83% have had their lending restriction lifted and are now operating under the board's stated credit risk appetite. Approximately 40% of credit unions that applied, submitted their application in September. These applications are currently under review.</p>  <p>  Currently approximately 39% of credit unions have a lending restriction compared with 52% at the start of the review process.</p>  <p>  Separately, a pilot to test the effectiveness of a microloan scheme is soon to be launched and will run for six months.  The scheme involves offering people receiving social welfare payments small affordable loans from credit unions as an alternative to moneylenders.  A Personal Microcredit Implementation Group under the Department of Social Protection is progressing this initiative and over 30 credit unions from around the country are expected to participate.  The Department of Finance is represented on this group.  Loans will range from &euro;500 - &euro;2,000 in value and will be repayable over 6-24 months with loan repayments deducted automatically from the household budget scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection in conjunction with An Post.  The interest rate will be a maximum of 12% a year. </p>  <p>  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is absolutely determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement. </p></reply>

The publication of the regulations marks another important step in the development of a strengthened regulatory framework for credit unions. It is considered that the commencement of the remaining sections of the 2012 Act and implementation of   these regulations, combined with and the prudential and governance requirements already in place, provide an appropriate regulatory framework for the credit union sector at this time.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that the draft regulations set out in Consultation Paper 88 (CP88), will be introduced at end December 2015. I have asked the Registrar of Credit Unions to consider the views of the credit union movement as regards the draft regulations and their implementation and report back to me before I commence the remaining sections of the 2012 Act on 31 December 2015, in line with the introduction of the regulations. These sections of the 2012 Act, when commenced, will replace, amend or supplement existing sections of the  Credit Union Act 1997.</p>  <p>  The provision of regulation making powers to the Central Bank on commencement of the remaining sections of the 2012 Act provides flexibility where the Central Bank can, in the future, review and update the regulations as appropriate on a timely basis following consultation. The Central Bank is keen to ensure that the regulations remain appropriate for the credit union sector and in the future, where credit unions set out a clear path on how they wish to develop, the Central Bank will consider any amendments to the regulations that may be appropriate.</p>  <p>  The need for credit unions to grow income has been recognised as a requirement for sector viability. While developing new products and services is a necessary element of this, the Central Bank has highlighted the importance of credit unions ensuring that they are in a position to grow their income from their traditional lending business. It is also recognised that there is a level of change in the sector arising from the voluntary restructuring programme.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has informed me that since 2010 it has received less than 10 applications for approval of additional services under sections 48 to 52 of the Credit Union Act 1997. These applications have all been received in recent months and are currently at a various stages of the approval process. The e Central Bank further informed me that it is open to working with the credit union sector to ensure that prudent and appropriate development can be facilitated within the regulatory framework. In supporting the sustainable and prudent development of the sector, the Central Bank is working to ensure that proposed changes to the business model are prudently structured and implemented. To that effect the Central Bank has invited a number of interested parties in the credit union sector to participate in focused dialogue in November 2015 with a view to gaining a better understanding of how credit unions want to develop their business model and to identify changes that may be required to the regulatory framework to facilitate prudent development. </p>  <p>  I am aware of the concerns highlighted by the credit union sector in relation to the cap on savings of &euro;100,000 and I have requested that the Central Bank provides a clear process for credit unions to follow regarding the application process. I am satisfied that the Central Bank is developing a clear application process with detailed information being made available before end 2015. </p>  <p>  Regarding lending restrictions placed on certain credit unions by the Central Bank,  the  Registrar of Credit Unions announced a review of lending restrictions in February 2015 with a closing date for applications of 30 September 2015. The Central Bank has informed me that 59% of applications received have been reviewed. Of the applications which have been fully reviewed, 83% have had their lending restriction lifted and are now operating under the board s stated credit risk appetite. As of this week c. 40% of credit unions are now subject to a lending restriction. The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is absolutely determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.  </p></reply>

Officials from my Department are currently assessing the proposal. I am not aware of any proposal having been received by my Department from the ILCU in relation to credit unions lending to small and medium enterprises.</p>  <p>  I have not met with the ILCU regarding these matters. However, officials from my Department  are in regular contact with the credit union representative bodies and are always available should the ILCU wish to discuss such matters. </p>  <p>  In relation to credit unions establishing such a fund, section 44 of the Credit Union Act, 1997 provides that a credit union may establish a special fund to be used by the credit union for, social, cultural or charitable purposes by a resolution passed by a majority of its members present and voting at a general meeting. Where individual credit unions intend to establish such a fund the Central Bank would expect the credit union to take account of the need to ensure the protection of the funds of its members'.</p>  <p>  Commencement of the remaining sections of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 (2012 Act) will replace, amend or supplement existing sections of the 1997 Act and will, in effect, remove some of the requirements (including limits) that currently exist in certain sections and will provide regulation making powers to the Central Bank.  </p>  <p>  The power to make regulations in relation to investments in projects of a public nature is specifically referenced in legislation and therefore such investments could be facilitated by future regulations, where appropriate, when there are specific proposals put forward by the credit union sector. The Central Bank has informed me that, while to date no specific proposals regarding investment projects of a public nature have been received, the Central Bank is willing to consider such proposals including the type of regulations that would be required to facilitate such proposals.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has further informed me that it is open to working with the credit union sector to ensure that prudent and appropriate development can be facilitated within the regulatory framework. In its role of supporting the sustainable and prudent development of the sector, the Central Bank wants to ensure that any proposed changes to the business models of credit unions are prudently structured and implemented. In relation to development of the business model, as set out in the feedback statement on CP88 the Central Bank will be engaging interested parties in the credit union sector to participate in focused dialogue in the coming months with a view to gaining a better understanding of how credit unions want to develop their business model and to identify whether any changes are required to the regulatory framework to facilitate prudent development. </p>  <p>  Given the areas identified in feedback received on CP88 and through other engagements with sector stakeholders the Central Bank proposes that this dialogue will initially focus on the following areas: </p>  <p>  - the services credit unions wish to develop in the areas of card services and payment accounts; and </p>  <p>  - credit unions' aims regarding longer term lending including further developments on the provision of mortgages to members. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has informed me that it is also open to considering other areas of business model development.</p>  <p>  An initial meeting with a number of credit union stakeholders, including the representative bodies and a number of credit union has been scheduled by the Central Bank. The Annual Information Seminars for 2015 will also take place from mid to late November and these will also provide an opportunity for the Central Bank to engage with individual credit unions and hear their views on business development.</p></reply>

It is not therefore possible to extend the application of the zero rate by raising the age limit of children to whom the zero rate could apply in respect of articles of clothing and footwear.  If there were satisfactory evidence that average shoe and clothing sizes for 10 year olds have changed since 1984, then the Revenue Commissioners could review the matter and adjust them if warranted.</p><p>Furthermore, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible to furnish precise figures of the amount of VAT received from the sale of footwear as outlined in the Deputy's question. This is due to the fact the information provided to Revenue on VAT returns does not require the yield from individual products or activities to be identified. While Revenue on occasion uses detailed Central Statistics Office consumption or expenditure information for VAT estimates, neither is this sufficiently detailed for the purpose requested by the Deputy.</p></reply>

This was just part of the reason for the very strong over-performance recorded in October. </p>  <p>  There were also unexpected payments amounting to &euro;350 million from a number of large companies due to better trading conditions and a number of early payments which were expected in November and December totalling &euro;200 million.   </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, corporation tax receipts are highly concentrated in the multinational sector.  However, it is important to point out that strong performance recorded in corporation tax receipts this year is relatively broad based.  For example, there has been an increase of over 20 per cent in the number of companies paying between &euro;100,000 and &euro;1 million.  In addition, there has been an increase of over 20 per cent in the amount of tax paid by medium sized companies.   </p>  <p>  In terms of the sustainability of the current strong corporation tax receipts, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the level of corporation tax payments in 2015 are primarily not one-off.  That is, they enter the revenue base for 2016 and beyond.   Importantly, from a fiscal perspective, the corporation tax forecasts for 2016 contained in Budget 2016 shows a reversion towards growth in line with gross operating surplus, at about 8 per cent. This lends confidence to the achievement of the corporation tax forecast for 2016.</p></reply>

Having given due consideration to the representations made by residential mortgage holders of IBRC and the professional advice received, the Special Liquidators divided the remaining residential mortgages into two tranches (Pearl Tranche 1 and Pearl Tranche 2). These two tranches were sold to The Governor and Company of the Bank of Ireland, Mars Capital No. 3 Limited and Mars Capital No. 4 Limited. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Special Liquidators that principal dwelling mortgages accounted for 83% of the IBRC mortgages sold in the Special Liquidation while buy to let mortgages accounted for 17% of the IBRC mortgages sold in the Special Liquidation.</p></reply>

This second target represented an increase of around 150% in the number of &euro;10 notes dispensed from ATMs previously. These targets were met by the banks on the dates set, as part of their commitment to the broader goal of improving the efficiency of payments in the National Payments Plan.</p>  <p>  Building on the recommendations in the National Payments Plan, the Central Bank has now set targets for the banks to achieve in terms of issuance of &euro;10, &euro;20 and &euro;50 notes from ATMs by 2018. These targets were calculated following a study of the requirements of consumers given patterns of cash usage. </p>  <p>  The targets are that 6-10% of all notes by volume are to be &euro;10 notes by the end of 2018, 40-45% of all notes by volume are to be &euro;20 notes and 45-50% of all notes by volume are to be &euro;50 notes.  The latest available data, for Q3 2015, on amounts actually dispensed shows that 6% of all notes are &euro;10 notes, 36% of all notes are &euro;20 notes and 58% of all notes are &euro;50 notes.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank is working, in co-operation with the commercial banks, towards these targets.

The application was refused on 23 September 2015 on the basis that the organisation was deemed not to be chiefly engaged in the care and transport of severely and permanently disabled persons in accordance with the requirements set out in Regulation 3 of S.I. 353 of 1994.</p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that the organisation concerned lodged an appeal against the refusal decision on 8 October 2015 under Section 145 of Finance Act 2001. The first stage of the appeals process consists of the re-examination of the matter by a senior manager within Revenue who was not involved in the original decision and this is currently underway, with further medical verification having been requested from the organisation. If the organisation is dissatisfied with the outcome of this stage of the appeals process, it may apply, within 30 days of being notified of the appeal decision, to have the case heard by the Appeal Commissioners.</p></reply>

Following a judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Union of April 2013, the repayment of excise element of the Scheme was found to be incompatible with the Energy Tax Directive. Following negotiations with the European Commission it was agreed that the repayment of excise duty should be discontinued as of 31 December 2014.</p>  <p>  As a result of this, the Revenue Commissioners did not have the necessary legal authority to make repayments in respect of fuel used on and after 1 January 2015. Accordingly, if a beneficiary of the Scheme made a twelve month claim which started in 2014 and concluded in 2015, the portion of the claim in respect of 2014 was repaid.</p>  <p>  As I stated in March 2014, to ensure that no beneficiary of the Scheme lost out as a result of the Court's ruling, I decided to introduce a new fuel grant effective from 1 January 2015. This fuel grant will maintain the current practice of paying the sum 12 months in arrears, so that my Department shall make the first payments of the fuel grant from 1 January 2016 in respect of all fuel used during 2015.</p>  <p>  The Fuel Grant will be paid at the same rate as the rates for repayment of excise duty on fuel. Accordingly, the rate for petrol will remain at &euro;0.59 per litre, the rate for diesel will remain at &euro;0.48 per litre, and the rate for liquefied petroleum gas will remain at &euro;0.10 per litres.</p>  <p>  My officials and officials from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners have been preparing the necessary administrative and legislative measures to ensure the fuel grant is paid from 1 January 2016. With the assistance of the Revenue Commissioners, a number of improvements have been made to the administration of the Scheme. Beneficiaries will now be able to apply for the fuel grant online on the Revenue website through the 'my Account' feature. Revenue will process the applications for my Department, and my Department shall make the payment directly to the beneficiaries bank or credit union account.</p>  <p>  My Department cannot make payments by cheque. Accordingly, payments must be made to an account at a financial institution through the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) mechanism. I understand that many credit union accounts are capable of taking SEPA payments. </p>  <p>  On 14 October 2015, my Department wrote to beneficiaries of the Scheme informing them of the changes to the fuel grant, and informing them that they can log on to the 'my Account' feature of the Revenue website from 1 January 2016 and claim the grant. My Department also informed beneficiaries that they may continue to receive the grant using a paper form if required. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department and officials from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners are in regular contact with the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Disabled Drivers Association, who represent many of the beneficiaries of the Scheme. Both organisations have been kept informed of developments as regards the fuel grant, including the necessity to make payments from 1 January 2016 with respect to all fuel used during 2015.</p>  <p>  I have made provision in sections 77, 78, 79, and 80 of the Finance Bill 2015 (as published) to provide the necessary legislative underpinning for the fuel grant. Following the enactment of the Finance Bill 2015, I shall made regulations providing for the payment of the fuel grant.</p>  <p>  I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that on 23 July 2015, a repayment claim was received by the Revenue Commissioners from the person (details supplied). This claim was in respect of diesel covering the period 22 July 2014 to 21 July 2015. A repayment was made on 4 August 2015 in respect of the fuel used up to 31 December 2014. The balance due can be included in the person's claim under the new Fuel Grant scheme  for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2015. </p></reply>

The allowable loss is the capital loss equivalent to the amount incurred by the person when the milk quota was acquired.

The key requirement is that a body must be representative of a particular sector or group of employees.  The regime whereby representative bodies may submit a claim in respect of a large number of employees has been developed over many years by the Revenue Commissioners in order to reduce the administrative burden on employees, employers and Revenue.  I would emphasise that for an expense to qualify as a deduction against income from an office or employment, the expense must be wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of the office or employment.  Where a flat rate allowance is agreed, it may then be applied to all employees of the class or group in question.</p></reply>

This includes the subsidies which are currently provided towards the pay of CE Supervisors.  However the Department of Social Protection is not the employer of CE Supervisors and CE Supervisors are not public servants.</p>  <p>  Unions representing CE Supervisors have sought the provision of funding to implement a range of Labour Court recommendations for enhanced severance arrangements in respect of employees in the Community Sector.  However it was not possible for the State to provide funding for enhanced severance arrangements to employees of private companies in these cases even if those companies are or were reliant on State funding.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this the matter has remained under review and I recently held a constructive meeting with SIPTU and IMPACT trade unions in relation to the position of CE Supervisors.

These concerns have also been articulated by the Alliance of Retired Public Servants and both I and my officials have met with representatives of the Alliance on a regular basis.  In response to concerns raised in 2013, I undertook <font color="#2F2F2F">to ease the burden of the PSPR as early as economic and fiscal circumstances allowed me to do so, with a focus on benefitting impacted lower-income pensions proportionately more.  T</font>he PSPR amelioration proposals outlined in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest 2015 Bill deliver on this commitment to address the continuing burden of PSPR on public service pensioners.</p><p>Under measures announced in mid-2015, and as contained in the <font color="#2F2F2F">Financial Emergency in the Public Interest Bill 2015, the Government is now proposing, to commence on 1 January 2016, a phased and partial restoration of the public service pay and pension cuts imposed under the financial emergency legislation. </font>In specific terms, the Bill's PSPR provisions will deliver part-restoration of the PSPR cuts in three stages effective from 1 January 2016, 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018.  When fully rolled-out from 1 January 2018, this means that all public service pensions in payment with pre-PSPR values of up to &euro;34,132 will be fully exempt from PSPR, while those pensioners not fully removed from the reach of PSPR will, in general, benefit by &euro;1,680 per year.  This represents a major amelioration of the PSPR burden over a multi-year time horizon, at the end of which the great majority of public service pensioners, with the exception of those on the higher levels of pension income, will no longer be affected by PSPR.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">The eventual full-year estimated cost of these proposals with respect to public service pensions is about &euro;90 million, which represents a restoration of approximately two-third's of the impact on pensions of PSPR.  This  significant level of restoration compares very favourably, in proportionate terms, with the proposed salary and PRD restoration to serving public servants.</font></p></reply>

In my most recent annual review of the legislation, I indicated in my report that I would bring forward the necessary legislative amendments to the Financial Emergency Measures Acts to enable the terms of the Lansdowne Road Agreement <font color="#2F2F2F">which would extend the terms of the Haddington Road Agreement to September 2018</font>to be implemented from 1 January 2016.  As the terms of the Lansdowne Road Agreement have now been accepted by the Public Services Committee of ICTU and by Government, the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Bill 2015, which is currently before the Oireachtas, contains these provisions.  The Agreement is significantly weighted in favour of the lower paid and applies to all public servants including teachers.  It makes provision for increases in gross pay in 2016 for those on pay up to &euro;31,000 and in 2017 for lower and middle income public servants, namely those on pay up to &euro;65,000.  For any public servant whose annualised salary is below &euro;24,001 there will be an increase in gross pay of 2.5% from 1 January 2016.  For those on annualised salaries between &euro;24,001 and &euro;31,000 there will be an increase in gross pay of 1% from 1 January 2016.  For all those on annualised salaries up to &euro;65,000 there will be an increase in gross pay of &euro;1,000 from 1 September 2017.  Additionally, all public servants will benefit from the Pension Related Deduction (PRD) measures contained in the Lansdowne Road Agreement which will benefit all affected public servants by up to &euro;733 in 2016 and &euro;1,000 in 2017.</p><p>When in 2013 Unions and Associations representing public servants, including teachers, signed up to the Haddington Road Agreement they agreed to the introduction of significant productivity measures and also additional pay cuts for public servants earning over &euro;65,000.  There was a commitment given in that Agreement, for the restoration of the 2013 pay cuts in two equal phases in April 2017 and January 2018 (for those on annualised remuneration in excess of &euro;110,000 restoration will be in three equal phases).  The FEMPI Bill 2015 also includes the necessary legislative provisions to give effect to these commitments.  Additionally, the Bill enables effect to be given to the commitment under the terms of the Haddington Road Agreement for the restoration of certain specific reductions to terms and conditions affected by the terms of the Haddington Road Agreement, which in particular will benefit teachers who are encompassed by the terms of the Lansdowne Road Agreement.</p><p>Accordingly, I do not consider that the provisions of the FEMPI Bill  are disadvantageous to teachers over any other group of public servants.</p></reply>

I note that my proposals to Government earlier this year in respect of the amelioration of the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) burden on pensioners, and which now form part of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2015, were welcomed at that time by representatives of the Alliance.  These proposals deliver on my commitment to <font color="#2F2F2F"> ease the burden of the PSPR as early as economic and fiscal circumstances allowed me to do so, with a focus on benefitting impacted lower-income pensions proportionately more.</font></p><p>Under the <font color="#2F2F2F">Financial Emergency in the Public Interest Bill 2015, the Government intends, by 2018, to achieve a phased restoration of most of the public service pension cuts imposed under the financial emergency legislation. </font>In specific terms, the Bill will deliver part-restoration of the PSPR cuts in three stages effective from 1 January 2016, 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018.  When fully rolled-out from 1 January 2018, this means that all public service pensions in payment with pre-PSPR values of up to &euro;34,132 will be fully exempt from PSPR, while those pensioners not fully removed from the reach of PSPR will, in general, benefit by &euro;1,680 per year.  This represents a major amelioration of the PSPR burden over a short time horizon, at the end of which the great majority of public service pensioners, with the exception of those on the higher levels of pension income, will no longer be affected by PSPR.  This  significant level of restoration is more beneficial, in terms of both timing and proportion, compared with the proposed salary and PRD restoration to serving public servants.</p></reply>

Longford and 22 site visits to Co. Westmeath in 2015 so far.  The numbers of site visits to both counties for the years 2011 to 2014 are set out in the tabular statement.  It is important to note that data on site visits is not a true measure of the level of FDI activity in a region or county.  Approximately 70% of all FDI investment won by IDA Ireland comes from its existing client base.</p><p>Currently, IDA Ireland positions the Midlands Region, comprising Longford, Westmeath, Laois and Offaly, as having a strong cluster in medical technology and life sciences.  The Midlands is home to key clients such as Abbott, Covidien, Integra, GeneMedix, Freund, Utah, KCI, and AMS.  All of these international brands are an attraction for potential clients to locate in the Midlands and provide employment opportunities for people living in County Longford.  Examples of where the cluster effect benefits investment decisions include the announcements in 2014 by Jazz Pharmaceuticals in Athlone and American Medical Systems, who are already seeking planning permission to expand after only two years in Athlone.</p><p>As well as the FDI sector, this cluster is supported by over 600 people employed in medical technology-related industries from the indigenous sector, in areas such as manufacturing to delivery of elements of the supply chain.</p><p>The arrival of Jazz Pharmaceuticals to Athlone and the announcement of investment by Alexion Pharma combined with the existing presence of Alkermes, employing c. 400 staff identifies a new cluster in the Midlands in bio pharmaceuticals and this will be presented to potential new name companies in the market place.</p><p>The Regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative was launched in February of this year and aims to identify a range of actions which will help each region to achieve its economic potential.  The Action Plan for Jobs &ndash; Midland Region was launched on the 29th June.  This plan sets out over 120 actions aimed to deliver enhanced employment growth in the region over the coming years with a target of increasing employment in the region by 10-15 % by 2020.  The overall ambition of the Action Plan for Jobs &ndash; Midland Region is to increase employment by approximately 14,000 by 2020.</p><p>IDA Ireland launched its new strategy entitled &lsquo;Winning &ndash; Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019&rsquo; earlier this year.  As part of this strategy, IDA Ireland will roll out a &euro;150m property investment plan over five years, which will support the achievement of the organisation's regional goals.  The funding will be used to upgrade its business and technology parks, strategically invest in utility-intensive sites and build new advanced technology buildings in a number of regional locations.  An advanced office building is planned for 2017 for Co. Westmeath as part of the programme.</p><p>Competition for FDI is intense globally with virtually every country in the world actively seeking new FDI investments.  Investors have many attractive location options to choose from but IDA Ireland has a long and credible track record of presenting potential investors with the best location options throughout Ireland for each client.  The agency actively incentivises and encourages investors to consider a range of potential locations in Ireland.

The Low Pay Commission structure is designed to ensure a balanced statutory minimum pay rate that is fair and will assist low-paid and vulnerable workers.</p><p>The Report submitted to me on July 17<sup>th</sup>recommends a rate of &euro;9.15 as the national minimum hourly rate of pay for experienced adult workers.

The most significant of these factors is the prevalence in the industry of the &ldquo;share fishermen&rdquo; model, under which the fishermen are categorised as self-employed.  The Irish employment permits system is predicated on the existence of an employment relationship between an identifiable employer in the State and his/her employee.  As there would appear to be a genuine model in the sector of self-employed share fishermen, such individuals would be outside the scope of the Employment Permits system.</p>  <p>  A second relevant factor is the lack of evidence to date pointing to a skills shortage in the sector that cannot be filled from within the EEA.  As a result, all fishing occupations are currently specified as ineligible occupations for the purposes of the employment permits system on the &ldquo;Ineligible Categories of Employment&rdquo; List (ICEL). This List is reviewed twice yearly with input from relevant Government Departments, Agencies, Trades Unions and industry.  In the context of the review currently underway, I have invited fish producers&rsquo; organisations to make a submission on the case for removing fishermen from the list.</p>  <p>  In order to examine wide range of issues facing the Irish fishing sector and workers within that sector, the Government decided last week to immediately establish an Inter-Departmental Taskforce chaired by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Simon Coveney. The Taskforce had its first  meeting on the fifth of November and will meet again this week. It has set itself a very tight timeframe in which to come up with proposals for Government and I look forward to considering these, together with my Cabinet colleagues.</p></reply>

Following a decision taken at Cabinet on Tuesday 3rd November, it was decided to immediately establish an inter-departmental Task Force to examine the wide range of issues identified in the recent Guardian newspaper report and make recommendations on appropriate actions, based on a cross Governmental approach. I chaired the first meeting of the Task Force on Thursday 5th November and my colleague Minister of State , Ged Nash, from the Department of Jobs, Employment and Innovation also attended the meeting.   </p>  <p>  Due to the complex nature of the issues arising, the Task Force includes high level representatives from the Departments of, Justice and Equality, Jobs Enterprise &amp;amp; Innovation, Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, BIM, the Naval Service, Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and my own Department.</p>  <p>  In order to formulate the most appropriate and effective response, it is necessary to first establish a full understanding of the complex issues involved. At the first meeting of the Task Force, the State Authorities shared information on their individual remits and experiences and committed to producing a co-ordinated response. The meeting considered the complex issues arising from the Guardian article and among the key issues also discussed were information sharing, enforcement, permitting, licensing, exploitation, and trafficking.</p>  <p>  As Minister with responsibility for chairing this cross Departmental Task Force, my main focus will be, to bring forward to Government a joined up State response in relation to the issues identified. Where appropriate, I consider that we need to take robust and proportionate immediate actions including any medium term changes to the regulatory and enforcement frameworks of the State.</p>  <p>  The next meeting has been arranged for Thursday 12th   November and I have invited a number of stakeholders to address the Taskforce.</p></reply>

The survey for 2015 will be published in the first quarter of 2016 and will contain the specific information requested by the Deputy in the normal way.</p><p>All treatments used for the control of sea lice on salmon farms in Ireland, with the exception of the use of Cleaner Fish, are licensed animal remedies. The European Communities (Animal Remedies) (No. 2) Regulations 2007 (SI 786/2007) provides the legislative basis for licensing of veterinary medicines.  Under this regime, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) acts as the main national licensing authority for veterinary medicines (animal remedies), while my Department licenses premises engaged in the commercial distribution of veterinary medicines. All animal remedies intended for use are required to be authorised in the State and may only be used in accordance with the conditions attached to the product authorisation.  The treatments are used under the control and direction of veterinary surgeons, as provided for under the animal remedies legislation. The sea lice management and control protocols and in particular the Pest Management Strategy introduced in 2008 lay down conditions for the compulsory control of sea lice infestation levels on marine salmon farms. As part of this control strategy farm operators are required to undertake treatments to control lice infestation levels once certain trigger levels are reached. In certain circumstances treatments alone may not be the most appropriate strategy and in a number of limited circumstances an accelerated harvest may be required. In 2015 accelerated harvests were undertaken in two instances to date.</p></reply>

This letter requested the submission of alternative verifiable proof to support one of the invoices that was included in the claim for expenditure incurred.

In the reply the person named-above lists payments that he claims were made by both cheque and cash, a number of which were not made until January 2012.</p>  <p>  My Department officials carefully examined the application in light of this reply; this examination indicated that the amount claimed had not been satisfactorily verified and that the amounts claimed were greater than   the costs in verified cases.

This letter also offered the applicant an opportunity to have the determination reviewed within the Department and to submit additional information if he wished. </p>  <p>  A request to have the determination reviewed was received from the person named on 28 October.

I also provided that such farmers would be automatically approved for GLAS Plus, should they be farming sufficient area of habitat. I would strongly encourage all farmers with Hen Harrier land to take up this measure under GLAS, which offers a payment rate of &euro;370 per hectare. Farmers can earn up to &euro;7,000 per annum through a combination of GLAS and GLAS Plus payments and some 1,400 hen harrier farmers have already been approved into the new scheme.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have recently announced that I intend to introduce a further scheme of assistance under the Locally Led Agri-Environment measure, to cater for farmers who are farming large tracts of hen-harrier land. One of the principles of the planned locally-led measure is to explore new ways of managing farming effort for the benefit of the environment, and in this case for the benefit of the hen-harrier. When the new scheme is designed, it has then to be negotiated with the EU Commission and formally introduced by amendment to the Rural Development Programme. I expect that this process will be concluded early next year. Only one amendment of the RDP is allowed annually, which means that a number of items will be bundled together and presented for approval at the same time. The proposed amendment is necessary to get EU approval not alone for the new hen harrier scheme, but also for the various other locally-led schemes that I intend to introduce.</p></reply>

This is because they require complete control of the land in question and the ability of the farmer to deliver quite complex actions independently. Under the European Union regulations GLAS payments must be justified based on income foregone and the cost of compliance. In the case of hen harrier payment, the bulk of the &euro;370 payment is based on income foregone, resulting from reduced productivity as a result of reduced application of fertiliser.</p>  <p>  None of this would be relevant to commonage land, which is not systematically fertilised or expected to yield a crop. On commonage land the payment is based on the cost of having a commonage management plan prepared and on the implementation of that plan, largely through a controlled grazing regime. The plan is expected to take account of important habitats present on the commonage and to provide for their conservation. Because of the additional requirement for groups of farmers to work together to deliver a successful commonage management plan, the payment rate under GLAS for commonage land increased significantly to &euro;120 per hectare from the &euro;75 per hectare previously paid under AEOS.</p></reply>

Decisions regarding course delivery in particular locations are solely an operational matter for Teagasc to determine. I understand that an issue arose in relation to delivery of the Green Cert in the Killarney local office. I have been informed by Teagasc that they very much appreciate the concerns raised locally and regret that some applicants were inconvenienced due to the late cancellation of a scheduled course. It arose, in part, due to the current unprecedented demand for the Green Cert. Two part time Green Cert courses are commencing in Killarney this week catering for approx. 60 applicants. Teagasc recognise the challenges attendance poses for part-time farmers and every effort is being made to accommodate them.</p>  <p>  The exceptional demand for the Green Cert is largely attributable to the higher payments provided for trained young farmers in the Young Farmers Scheme and the National Reserve. To ensure that the benefits of the &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant&rsquo; categories are targeted at those who have a genuine interest in farming as a career, successful applicants must have completed, or commit to undertaking, a recognised course of education in agriculture giving rise to an award at FETAC level 6 (Green Cert) or its equivalent. It has contributed to an almost five-fold increase in Green Cert enrolments from 500 in a typical year to 2,300 since late 2014. </p>  <p>  I was pleased to be able to approve the recruitment of 40 new temporary teachers in Teagasc in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in order to specifically meet the demand for the Green Cert. Additionally, new arrangements have recently been finalised to provide Teagasc, with greater discretion to fill vacancies in specified, designated grades, subject to compliance with multi-annual pay ceilings.</p></reply>

Issues arose in respect of the Capital Investment element of the contract, resulting in a lower payment for the scheme years 2011 and 2012. Two supplementary payments in the amount of &euro;965.69 issued on 25/6/12 and 11/3/13 respectively,   restoring full payments for 2011 and 2012. Full payment then issued as normal for the 2013 and 2014 scheme years. </p>  <p>  In relation to 2015, payments in any calendar year cannot be made until after 15 October at the earliest.  Also, under the EU Regulations governing the Scheme and other area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, must be completed before any payment can issue. The cross-checks for the 2015 AEOS scheme year could only take place following the finalisation of the BPS applications for 2015 and the issuing of BPS payments. It is expected that AEOS payments for the 2015 scheme year will commence towards the end of November for those that have successfully come through the administrative checks and where there are no outstanding issues for those who had on-the-spot inspections in 2015.</p></reply>

The person named declared 69.42 hectares of eligible land in 2013 and, in 2015 declared 86.29 which includes 27.34 hectares declared in relation to a Private Contract Clause application, therefore he will be allocated 58.95 entitlements. </p>  <p>  In 2014, the person named submitted two Transfer of Entitlements application forms and applied to purchase 7.00 entitlements with a total value of &euro;2082.71 from another farmer and also an Inheritance of 7.6 entitlements with a total value of &euro;1436.40 from another farmer. These applications were successful and payment issued accordingly. This increased the total value of entitlements held by the person named in 2014 to &euro;20,524.92. </p>  <p>  The 2015 value of entitlements is based on a fixed percentage of the total value of entitlements owned by the farmer in 2014 plus the value of any payment received under the Grassland Sheep Scheme in that year. As with all farmers, a person&rsquo;s direct payment in 2015 is no longer based solely on entitlements but is divided between the Basic Payment Scheme and the Greening payment. </p>  <p>  In 2015 the person named has established 58.95 entitlements with an estimated unit value of &euro;226.34. As this unit value is above the National Average, his entitlements will be subject to gradual reduction from 2015 to 2019. For 2015, the total value of his Basic Payment Scheme entitlements and greening is &euro;19,234.80.   </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department received a 2015 Private Contract Clause application from the person named.

Following an inspection on 14 August 2013, issues arose in relation to the Tree Planting and Planting New Hedgerow actions. AEOS applicants are required to undertake one mandatory and one complementary action and as the Inspector deemed the complementary Tree Planting action ineligible, the AEOS contract was terminated.  The person named appealed the termination and following an oral hearing on the 12 December 2014 with the Agriculture Appeals Office his appeal was allowed and his contract was reinstated.   </p>  <p>  However, issues still remained, separate to the issue that was appealed, in relation to the Planting New Hedgerow action, and the 2013 scheme year payment was reduced following the application of a penalty of &euro;593.22 and a reduction in the payable length of hedgerows from 515m to 458m, resulting in a monetary reduction of &euro;324.33. This reduction in payment was applied to the 2014 scheme year and will apply to all full scheme year payments.

It is known that in some cases the invoices submitted were for amounts different to those actually paid by the participants.    Funding provided under the scheme comes partly from the EU and partly from the National Exchequer. There is a requirement and obligation to ensure that the expenditure claimed by scheme participants reflects the reality of what took place. For that reason my Department wrote to participants requesting alternative proof that the amounts claimed were in fact the amounts paid. </p>  <p>  The person named above was written to on 11 June 2015 regarding the non-productive capital investment claim that he had submitted. This letter requested the submission of alternative verifiable proof to support one of the invoices that was included in the claim of expenditure that he had incurred. A reply to this letter was received on 19 August last. </p>  <p>  My Department officials carefully examined the application in light of this reply; this examination indicated that the amounts claimed had not been satisfactorily verified and that they were greater than the costs in verified cases. A letter informing the applicant of this determination, and of the proposed penalty, was issued on 6 November. This letter also offered the applicant an opportunity to have the determination reviewed within the Department and to submit additional information if he wished, not later than 20 November.   </p>  <p>  As soon as may be after a request for a review is received,or after 20 November,   if a request for review is not received, a final decision will be made in this case and a further letter will then issue to the person named informing him of the decision. </p></reply>

The working group was a cross Departmental, multi-agency group which also included members from the fishing Industry.</p>  <p>  The working group chaired by Lt. Cdr. John Leech, Chief Executive, Irish Water Safety, was set up to examine a range of important issues for Ireland&rsquo;s fishing industry such as safety standards and training on board vessels, compliance with regulations, recent technical innovations and the fishing sector&rsquo;s approach to personal safety. The group were also charged with looking at options for making the fishing industry safer and more attractive, economically, as a career option for potential new entrants. </p>  <p>  Central to the working group's recommendations on improving safety in the industry, is the need for significant culture change across the fisheries sector.   I made an additional &euro;5.6m available to the fisheries catching sector for training and skills development under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) 2014-2020 Operational Programme. This extra funding will be instrumental in addressing recommendations in the report and driving the culture change required to enhance safety across the fisheries sector. </p>  <p>  I am happy to inform the deputy that Bord Iascaigh Mhara(BIM) are progressing the Safety Training aspects of the report, including the enhanced training programme which provides Personal Flotation Devices (PFDs) to those who complete the course. The group identified the wearing of PFDs as being critical to reducing fatalities at sea. </p>  <p>  BIM have also progressed recommendations regarding career structures and some of these developments were showcased at Seafest 2015 (Cork), Irelands National Annual Maritime Festival. Seafest 2016 which will take place in Galway will also showcase further such developments. In addition they are working with relevant stakeholders on developments in Technical Innovation in Safety Procedures and Equipment, in particular work is progressing to develop a fit-for-purpose First Aid kit for fishers on under 15 metre fishing vessels.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and the Marine Survey Office who were represented on the group have advised me that they are working towards the implementation of the recommendations which are within their remit.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy should also be aware that the Minister of Finance, published a review of taxation matters as they pertain to the maritime sector including the fishing industry as part of his budget announcement in October 2015, which was an area recommended for attention in the report. </p>  <p>  Finally I am satisfied that in the short time since the publication of the report, progress is being made to implement the recommendations contained.  </p></reply>

The vast majority of participants in the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) will easily meet and exceed the land requirements necessary to receive full payment.</p><p>For example, a farmer with 10 calved cows and a stocking density of 0.5 will have access to 20 hectares but will only require 6.66 hectares for the purposes of payment under the Programme. This herdowner would then have to ensure that they submitted each year, on their SPS form, eligible forage hectares to cover at least 80% of 6.66 hectares (5.33) to ensure that they are compliant with the land requirement of the BDGP and remained within the scheme. Even if this farmer had a stocking density of 1 calved cow per hectare, they would have 50% more land than they require. </p><p>Based on numbers from the 2014 Beef Genomics Scheme, nearly half of farmers (46%) will have a stocking density of less than 0.5 calved cows per hectare whereas 90% of farmers have a stocking density below 1 calved cow per hectare. The vast majority of farmers come under a stocking density of 1 calved cow per hectare and I believe the relatively high stocking density of 1.5 established under the BDGP should provide a sufficient buffer for situations arising on most farms. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has established procedures to deal with appeals and force majeure for the BDGP. Any participant who may fall into difficulty in renting the required hectarage can rest assured that their situation will be considered on a case-by-case basis. </p></reply>

Under the Act, a child is defined as a person under the age of 18 years and it is further provided in section 52 that a child under 12 years of age shall not be charged with an offence except where certain stated charges apply.  </p>  <p>  The latest available information in relation youth offending and re-offending is set out in the 2013 Report of the Committee Appointed to Monitor the Effectiveness of the Diversion Programme which I recently laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  As the Deputy may know, before any young person is brought before the courts, he or she must first be referred for consideration of a caution and inclusion in the Garda Diversion Programme by the Director of the Programme.  In 2013, 10,420 young people were referred for such consideration.</p>  <p>  With regard to the &ldquo;estimated number of young offenders who enter the criminal justice system annually&rdquo;, if by this the Deputy means the number of young people who are brought before the courts and the number of convictions involved, the Courts Service has advised that their statistical information is not compiled in a way which identifies new offenders.  The Courts Service points out that figures in relation to the Children Court are published in the Courts Service Annual Report which provides details of offences and outcomes.  In this regard, the 2014 Annual Report on page 56, sets out extensive details in relation to &ldquo;juvenile crime&rdquo; and the range of offences and their outcomes.   </p>  <p>  With regard to the number of &ldquo;school age adolescents that engage with Garda Diversion Programmes annually&rdquo;, the 2013 Report of the Monitoring Committee which I refer to above states on page 16, that 7,732 young people were deemed suitable for inclusion in the Diversion Programme.  In this context, I should mention Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) which my Department funds.  In 2013, some 5,065 young people were engaged with GYDPs.  GYDPs are youth justice crime reduction/crime prevention community programmes which are specifically targeted at young offenders and those at serious risk of offending. They provide essential support to the Garda Diversion Programme and to the effectiveness of the Garda Juvenile Liaison Officer system operated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding support for youth justice community interventions is based on evidence that diversion programmes in the form of high quality preventative intervention can do more to reduce crime than more costly custodial options. Just over &euro;11.5 million was allocated to GYDPs (and 5 Local Drugs Task Force projects working alongside GYDP) in 2014.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the information sought by the Deputy in relation to the percentage of young offenders who are unemployed 12 months after their release or who are released at 21 years of age with no qualifications is not maintained by the Children Detention Schools or the Irish Prison Service.  However, the Deputy may wish to note that Young Persons Probation (YPP), a specialised Division of the Probation Service, in the context of its supervision of community based sanctions, utilises a number of community based organisations with dedicated resources to work with young offenders.   A number of the YPP projects provide education courses (such as FETAC levels 3, 4 and 5) through the Educational Trust Boards  which result in the young person/offender obtaining an academic qualification. Other YPP projects provide various training or skills programmes and initiatives (such as IT skills) which assist young offenders subsequently seeking employment.  The provision of these services enhance the young offender&rsquo;s personal development and life outcomes, thereby reducing their risk of re-offending and leading to safer communities.  </p></reply>

Section 35 of the 2009 Act, as amended by the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011, provides, inter alia, that a right of way which has not been reserved or granted may be acquired by prescription, i.e.acquired on the basis of long enjoyment of the easement concerned, on registration of a court order under that section or in accordance with section 49A of the Registration of Title Act 1964. </p>  <p>  Section 49A of the 1964 Act permits the Property Registration Authority (PRA) to register such an easement  where it is satisfied that there is an entitlement to the easement concerned. Where, however, the PRA is not satisfied that there is such an entitlement, such as where there is disagreement between the parties concerned, a court order under section 35 of the 2009 Act is required.</p>  <p>  Section 38 of the 2009 Act (as amended by the 2011 Act) sets out the rules that apply where a claim based on prescription commenced or completed the user period before 1 December 2009. In order to avail of these transitional provisions, a claim to an easement must be made within 12 years of that date. Any claims made after that period must be based entirely on the 2009 Act.</p>  <p>  The rules applicable to the registration of easements are set out in the Land Registration Rules 2012 (S.I. No. 483 of 2012) and 2013 (S.I. No. 389 of 2013) which are available on the PRA website (www.pra.ie).</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, has brought forward the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2015 to give effect to the Lansdowne Road Agreement. The Bill starts the process of the phased restoration of remuneration to public servants, including members of An Garda Sioch&aacute;na.The Bill also provides for the suspension of the operation of incremental pay scales in respect of any public servant who is not encompassed by a registered agreement. </p>  <p>  The LRA is not, of course, solely about beginning the process of restoring remuneration, it is also about securing the enhanced efficiencies and performance delivered by the earlier Haddington Road and Croke Park Agreements. Specifically in relation to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the LRA provides for the continuation of the obligation under the Haddingtion Road Agreement to work an additional 30 hours per year. As the Agreement identifies 10 of these hours as overtime which is to taken as compulsory time-off in lieu, the actual additional hours per member are 15. The Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors have informed me that their members have rejected the LRA, as is their right. I met representatives of both Associations last week and it was agreed that a useful next step would be to tease out the implications of their position. Arrangements are in train for meetings to take place with officials of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform  for this purpose. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy suggests, in the event that the Associations do not become party to the LRA, there will be a loss of hours available to the Garda Commissioner from 1 January 2016, although not of the order suggested by the Deputy. It will, of course, be a matter for the Garda Commissioner who has responsibility for the distribution of resources to manage this. I would, however, draw the Government's commitment to the ongoing recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; to the Deputy's attention. The Budget provision for 2016 provides for the recruitment of an additional 600 Garda&iacute; and these positions will be advertised shortly. This will bring to 1150 the total recruitment of Garda Trainees since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.</p></reply>

In that regard, any persons deemed to be unaccompanied minors by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) are referred to T&uacute;sla under Section 8 of the Refugee Act, 1996.</p>  <p>  On referral by the ORAC, T&uacute;sla determines whether it is in the child's interest to have an application for asylum made on their behalf. In the event that an application is made, I am advised that T&uacute;sla then assists the minor throughout the asylum process, including accompanying the minor during the course of their asylum interview. I am also advised that as a matter of policy T&uacute;sla generally places younger children  with families although some older children are placed in regulated residential facilities that cater for small numbers.  Any further information in this regard may be sought from my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Dr. James Reilly, T.D.</p>  <p>  In relation to the  way in which individual families can support, in a concrete way, families seeking refuge here from the Syrian conflict, the Deputy may be aware that the Government has established a cross-Departmental and inter-Agency Irish Refugee Protection Programme Taskforce (IRPP), chaired by my Department, to deal with the operational and logistical aspects of the EU Resettlement and Relocation Programmes. The Taskforce is adopting a whole of Government approach and includes representatives of Government Departments, the HSE, the local authorities, the Red Cross and UNHCR in order to implement the Government's response to this crisis.</p>  <p>  The Irish Red Cross has been specifically appointed to the Taskforce in its capacity as an auxiliary to the State in times of war and conflict, a role the Red Cross are undertaking all over the European Union and further afield. The Irish Red Cross have been asked by Government to coordinate non-commercial offers of accommodation, goods and services for refugees due to join our communities over the next two years. They have created an Irish Red Cross Register of Pledges which is an on-line system of recording solidarity by pledging accommodation, goods and services.</p>  <p>  If a person has previously made a pledge elsewhere or wishes to make a  pledge for the first time, I am advised that they simply log on to redcross.ie/solidaritypledges, fill in their  personal details and an outline of their offer or they can directly contact the Irish Red Cross at 01 6424600. I understand that the Red Cross will hold individual pledges on the Irish Red Cross Register of Pledges and they will follow up to establish a suitable match. </p>  <p>  I might add that the crisis is still developing and while it is anticipated that up to 20 asylum seekers may be relocated to Ireland before Christmas, it is likely to be early in the New Year before Ireland receives large numbers of persons under the relevant programmes. However, in the meantime, tangible offers of solidarity and support may be made to the Irish Red Cross as set out above or indeed other domestic charities who have responded to this unprecedented migration crisis.</p></reply>

My announcement followed an extensive consultation process with key stakeholders and hearings by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence on a report from a Joint Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na/Department of Justice and Equality Working Group published in November 2014. The changes announced will address issues in the short term but also map out the longer term future for a licensing system which balances the rights of those who wish to pursue their interests with public safety, which has to be the paramount consideration.  I understand the Sports Coalition (of which the National Association of Regional Games Council is a member) has welcomed and fully endorsed my announcement. </p>  <p>  My intention is to make fundamental long term reforms in this area by proposing legislation for a Firearms Assessment and Appeals Authority. The primary function of the Authority will be to determine, on the basis of an objective assessment of all the issues, with safety of the public being paramount, whether particular forms of firearms may be licensed in the State, whether there should be any limit on the number of such firearms and what safety conditions might properly be applied to their licensing.  The functions of the Authority will be subject to further consultation with key stakeholders in advance of the preparation of the necessary enabling legislation, which will be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence.</p>  <p>  As part of the review process, I announced my intention to re-establish the Firearms Consultative Panel. The re-established panel had their first meeting on 29 October 2015. It is made up of key stakeholders, including the Sports Coalition. This panel provides a valuable forum for contact and discussion between my Department and representatives of shooting organisations, An Garda Siochana and other interested parties.  I have sought submissions from the Firearms Consultative Panel on a number of issues affecting licensed gun owners including the proposed Firearms Assessment and Appeals Authority.  I look forward to building on the positive relationships developed between representative organisations and my Department during the review of firearms licensing and I look forward to continued open and positive dialogue with all representative organisations.</p>  <p>  I have notified the Garda Inspectorate that I intend to ask them to review the administration of firearms licensing by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when the Firearms Assessment and Appeals Authority is in place for a period of 12 months. </p>  <p>  I have introduced  an immediate temporary cap on the licensing of any new centre-fire semi-automatic rifles pending the establishment and determination of the Authority. Legislation will provide for the revocation of any licenses issued before the enactment of the legislation and it is intended that anyone applying for licenses of this nature will be informed of that fact.</p>  <p>  I have signed secondary legislation re-defining what constitutes a non-restricted handgun. The purpose of this legislation is to ensure persons who currently hold licences for handguns will be able to reapply for a license in the current licensing round. This legislation clarifies for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na what firearms may be considered by them for licensing. </p>  <p>  In line with my commitment to prevent any proliferation of handgun availability in Ireland, I am continuing to monitor the number of 0.22 inch rim fire calibre handguns being licensed. If there is a significant increase in the number of applications for new certificates or import licence applications for these handguns, I will introduce priority legislation for a future cap. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Garda Commissioner intends to establish a centralised licensing system for restricted firearms, pending the establishment and determination of the Firearms Assessment and Appeals Authority. The Garda Commissioner is preparing a detailed outline of the proposed work of the centralised licensing system for my consideration.</p></reply>

There are no words to describe the suffering and grief that the families have endured.</p>  <p>  The bombing and two murders in Belturbet were the subject of a thorough investigation at the time by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with expert assistance provided to the investigation by the Army. The investigation also involved close liaison with the authorities in Northern Ireland in an effort to bring the perpetrators to justice. Although every avenue of inquiry which was open to the investigation was pursued at that time there was no evidence to bring those responsible to justice. It remains a source of disappointment that no one has yet been brought to justice for these murders. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the investigation into these murders remains open and should any new or additional evidence emerge from any source, it will be pursued fully by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that dealing with the legacy of the troubles on this island is difficult and complex challenge. The Stormont House Agreement provides for a number of initiatives that will establish an overarching framework to address the past. The Government is fully committed to playing its part in implementing those measures and I hope they may provide an opportunity for the families of persons killed during the troubles to access further information.</p></reply>

The education welfare services of Tusla, comprising the statutory Education Welfare Officers, the School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison Scheme are key supports for children at risk of educational disadvantage. Prior to the establishment of Tusla, these functions were carried out by the former National Educational Welfare Board.</p><p>Under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, schools are required to notify Tusla, where a student is absent from a recognised school for twenty days or more, where a student is not attending a recognised school regularly and where a student is suspended from a recognised school for six days or more. Schools also provide annual returns to Tusla on the levels of attendance. </p><p>The most recent Annual Attendance Report published by Tusla covers the 2012-2013 academic year. The report shows that expulsions are rare. There were twenty three expulsions at primary level education out of 523,036 students and two hundred and eleven expulsions at secondary level out of 321,940 students in the 2012-13 academic year. </p><p>The information sought by the Deputy regarding the age of pupils or permanent exclusions is not readily available. </p><p>I am advised that when a Board of Management of a school forms the opinion that a student should be expelled it is required to notify the local Education Welfare Officer in writing. Schools cannot expel the student before the passing of 20 school days from the receipt of this notification. During this period the Education Welfare Officer will contact and consult with all parties concerned to try and ensure that there is a continuum of education put in place for the student. If parties are agreeable, a meeting may be facilitated by the Education Welfare Officer in an effort to get the student returned to the school in which he/ she is registered. </p><p>If this proves unsuccessful and the pupil is expelled, the Board of Management of a school must advise the parents of their right to appeal. The Education Welfare Officer will provide advice and assistance in relation to this process as well as advising them with regard to making applications to other schools should their appeal be unsuccessful. </p><p>If a student who has been expelled is unable to find an alternative school placement in the short term the Education Welfare Officer will assist parents in applying for Home Tuition as an interim solution and will continue to assist them is sourcing a placement in a recognised school or a place in an alternative education provision. Details of the annual school attendance reports for the 2012-13 academic year and earlier years are available on Tusla's website at <i></i>.</p></reply>

This additional investment provides for a considerable expansion of the ECCE programme with children qualifying when they reach 3 years of age and remaining in the programme until they make the transition to primary school.  The extended free pre-school provision will be introduced from September 2016.</p>  <p>  Following the introduction of this new measure, services that are presently providing the free pre-school provision will continue to do so if they renew their contract with my Department.  Pre-school services applying as new entrants to the ECCE programme will be considered if they satisfy the ECCE programme requirements.</p>  <p>  In relation to the provision of the ECCE programme from primary school facilities, the issue of school ownership impacts on the extent to which the State can influence how primary schools use any additional facilities or space they may have.  The vast majority of primary school buildings in the country are in private ownership. Of the 3,278 primary schools in 2014, only 190 (6%) were in the ownership of the Minister for Education and Skills.  The remaining 94% of primary schools were in private ownership.  The State has no authority to compel Patrons who are the owners of primary school sites to accommodate pre-school services on their own property or to direct them in relation to the selection of suitable pre-school providers to deliver these services.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the Minister for Education and Skills is, however, supportive of coherent measures that facilitate greater community use of schools while respecting the core role of schools. In relation to use of existing school premises, my colleague is of the view that, in the first instance, the core role of a school in delivering education to its student body has to be paramount and any additional activities have to adhere to that core role.  There are also a number of practical issues, such as lease terms, insurance, etc., that need to be properly examined for schools considering additional activities on their premises.</p></reply>

Each qualifying child is entitled to one free pre-school year only.  As this child has received the full free pre-school complement in the 2014-2015 academic year, no additional provision can be made. </p>  <p>  The recent Budget decisions, which introduced an extended provision under the ECCE programme that allows children to access the free pre-school programme from the time they are three years of age until they start primary school, come into effect from September 2016. This extended provision, when fully rolled out, will mean that children will have access to free education - either in pre-school or primary school - from the age of three.  The start up date for the introduction of this new measure was decided so as to allow pre-school providers an adequate timeframe to make any necessary infrastructural or service changes and to put in place extra staff resources to accommodate the additional numbers benefitting from the programme, which are estimated to increase to approximately 127,000 per year from the current average of around 67,000 per year.</p></reply>

Those that are not provided with accommodation under Section 5 are returned home, received into care or are placed in Supported Lodgings.

This funding, which is in addition to the direct support provided to all parents in the form of Child Benefit, provided support to more than 100,000 children each year.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2016, I announced an &euro;85 million package of additional investment for the childcare sector which will provide for a range of significant enhancements to the childcare support programmes. These include an expansion of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme and increased provision under the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme that supports low income and disadvantaged families.</p>  <p>  The question of tax allowances for parents was considered prior to the introduction of the childcare support programmes.  A number of issues emerged at that time which did not favour the introduction of a childcare tax credit.  For example, the introduction of a tax credit would not help to support quality improvements within the sector and would not help those families on low pay who may not have any tax liability. There was also concern at that time that the application of tax credits could lead to increased prices and therefore have limited impact in terms of savings to parents.</p>  <p>  Experience in other countries has shown that demand side supports such as subsidies and tax relief can result in increasing cost for parents. This was the case in both Australia and the Netherlands, where childcare costs continued to rise despite the introduction of tax reliefs and/or subsidies.  The policy trend in most European countries is to provide support through supply side measures such as those, which have been implemented in Ireland over the last number of years.</p>  <p>  The Inter-Departmental Group, which I established earlier this year to consider options for future investment in childcare, did examine both supply and demand side measures. The report of the Group, which included an evaluation of the value of the introduction of tax relief measures, outlined concerns that the value of the tax credit would be capitalised into the cost of childcare and that little or no benefit would accrue to the parent.  The Group concluded that investment in supply side measures was strategically optimal in achieving the combined objectives of affordability, accessibility and quality.</p>  <p>  The additional investment in the childcare sector which I announced will have a significant impact on the affordability of childcare services with the extended provision under the free pre-school year programme reducing parent's average annual childcare costs by a further &euro;1,500 approximately.</p></reply>

This means, for example, that children born between 2 February 2011 and 30 June 2012 qualified for free pre-school from September 2015. Children who turn 3 from 1 July  2012 are below the age range for eligibility for ECCE in the 2015/2016 programme year but will qualify for the 2016/17 programme year.</p>  <p>  The recent Budget decisions, which introduced an extended provision under the ECCE programme that allows children to access the free pre-school programme from the time they are 3 years of age until they start primary school, come into effect from September 2016. This extended provision, when fully rolled out, will mean that children will have access to free education - either in pre-school or primary school - from the age of three.  The start up date for the introduction of this new measure was decided so as to allow pre-school providers an adequate timeframe to make any necessary infrastructural or service changes and to put in place extra staff resources to accommodate the additional numbers benefitting from the programme, which are estimated to increase to approximately 127,000 per year from the current average of around 67,000 per year.</p>  <p>  I am conscious that, depending on their date of birth, some children enrolling in the ECCE programme in September 2016 will not benefit from this extended free pre-school provision. I am also aware that, when the programme is fully in place (i.e. from 2017), there will be some children who will benefit for a shorter extra period of free pre-school than others. Again, this will depend on the child's date of birth and the age at which they make the transition to primary school. Ultimately however, when this extended programme is fully in place, all children will be better off than in the present programme. Indeed, the net effect of the improvements for children overall will be an increase of an average of 23 weeks over the current programme.  I think that this is a significant step forward for children and their families.</p></reply>

Work is continuing on the preparation of the legislation and it is expected that the Bill will be published shortly.

An advance healthcare directive (AHD) is a statement made by an individual with capacity setting out his or her will and preferences regarding treatment decisions that may arise in the future when he or she no longer has capacity. The guiding principle underpinning the AHD provisions is that an adult with capacity is entitled to refuse treatment, including resuscitation, for any reason. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill was passed by the D&aacute;il in October and has been referred to the Seanad for consideration. It is anticipated that the Bill will be enacted during the current Oireachtas term. </p>  <p>  The HSE National Consent Policy was launched with immediate effect in May 2013. The policy deals specifically with the issues of Do Not Attempt Resuscitate (DNAR) orders (Part 4). This document discusses issues pertaining to cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and DNAR orders within the context of consent. The aim of the national policy is to provide a decision‐making framework that will facilitate the advance discussion of personal preferences regarding CPR and DNAR orders and to ensure that decisions relating to CPR and DNAR orders are made consistently, transparently and in line with best practice.</p>  <p>  The policy states that decisions about CPR must always be made on a case-by-case basis and not, for example, on the basis of age, disability, the subjective views of healthcare professionals regarding the individual&rsquo;s quality of life or whether he/she lives in the community or in long-term care. In addition, it states that such decisions should be made in the context of the individual&rsquo;s overall goals and preferences for his/her treatment and care as well as the likelihood of success and potential risks.  </p>  <p>  An implementation guide to support Part Four of the HSE National Consent Policy is in the final stages of development and will be aligned with recent and forthcoming legislation and will be rolled out to the system when finalised.</p></reply>

The NIDD, established in 1995, provides a comprehensive database for decision-making in relation to the planning, funding and management of services for people with an intellectual disability. It provides a set of information which outlines the specialised health services currently used or needed by people with an intellectual disability.  Participation in the database is voluntary and not every individual in Ireland with an intellectual disability is availing of or requiring a specialised disability health and personal social service. </p>  <p>  A key recommendation of the report of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services related to the need for integrated management and information systems to support the business and service needs of the disability sector and service users.  A Working Group established under this programme of reform is involved in the development of a new information system which seeks to build on existing databases, with a view to overcoming their limitations.  The experience of stakeholders and their contribution to the consultation process, will be vital to the development of a robust information system, to support those business and service needs into the future.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to establish a database for children born with any specific condition, as services are provided based on identified needs, not on the basis of a diagnosed condition. </p></reply>

Disability services are provided in a variety of community and residential settings in partnership with service users, their families and carers and a range of statutory, non-statutory, voluntary and community groups. Voluntary agencies provide the majority of services in partnership with or on behalf of the HSE.</p><p>The Health Service Executive has recognised the need to increase the level of consistency and standardisation in the way both early intervention services and services for school-aged children with disabilities, including autism, are delivered.</p><p>The HSE is currently engaged in a major reconfiguration of its existing therapy resources for children with disabilities into multi-disciplinary geographically based teams, as part of its National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years)<i>.</i></p><p>The key objective of this Programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of the individual child&rsquo;s difficulties (with effective service teams working in partnership with parents and the Education sector to support children in achieving their potential). The implementation of the Programme has been supported not only by my Department but also by the Department of Education and Skills and the education sector. </p><p>An additional &euro;4m was allocated in 2014 to assist in implementing the Progressing Disability Services Programme, equating to approximately 80 additional therapy posts. Further investment of &euro;4 million (equating to &euro;6 million in a full year) has been provided this year to support its ongoing implementation. Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government. Within this context, funding is being provided in 2016 to support, inter alia,  the implementation of the Progressing Disability Services Programme.  </p><p>The Progressing Disabilities Services Programme is a key part of the implementation of the Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Review of Disability Services in Ireland, which emphasised the importance of the collection and analysis of information to underpin the planning, monitoring and delivery of services to children and adults with disabilities. Working Groups established to progress the implementation of the recommendations in the Review are addressing relevant issues including the development of an information framework to support service planning, the development of a quality and outcome measurement framework, and the assessment of future need. These measures will support planning for the provision of person-centred supports and services for children and adults with disabilities.  </p><p>Finally, while the planning and provision of services in the education sector, referred to by the Deputy, is a matter for the Department of Education and Skills and bodies such as the National Council for Special Education, intersectoral collaboration at national level  on children's disability issues is facilitated by a Cross Sectoral Team structure comprising representatives of the Departments of Health, Education and Skills  and Children and Youth Affairs and of the HSE and other agencies that is in place.</p></reply>

The main contractor is on site since October 2014.  The HSE is projecting that the construction works will be completed in January 2016 and that the new ED will be operational in Q1 2016.  The upgrade of existing concourse area forms part of this project. In addition the following projects are included in the 2015 minor capital works for Midlands Regional Hospital Mullingar:</p><p>-Medical Records off site storage facility;</p><p>-Replacement of operating lights in 3 theatres;</p><p>-Provision of access control and automation to main entrance doors to theatre department; </p><p>-Fixtures and fittings for Willow Unit -women&rsquo;s health unit;</p><p>-Relocation of the Radiology Department ultrasound room;</p><p>-Relocation of the Medical Air Plant / fit new compressor units to Endoscopy cabinets; and</p><p>-Upgrade works to CCTV System.</p><p>The HSE is concentrating on applying the funding available for infrastructure development in the most effective way possible to meet current and future needs.  Any future investment at the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar must be considered within the context of the establishment of hospital groups, within the overall acute hospital sector infrastructure programme, and also within the overall capital envelope available to the health service. Each hospital group will be required to develop a strategic plan to describe how it will provide more efficient and effective patient services and reorganise its services to provide optimal care to the populations it serves. Following the announcement in late September of the health capital envelope of &euro;3,061 million for the multi-annual period 2016-2021, the HSE has undertaken preliminary work on the draft Capital Plan.  This Plan, which requires my approval together with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

As of 3rd November (latest figures available) there were 567 delayed discharges nationally, of which 294 were in the Dublin Academic Teaching Hospitals (DATHS).  This figure is down from a high of 830 in December 2014.  The breakdown of delayed discharges in each Dublin hospital is as follows:<table><tr><th>Hospital</th><th>Total delayed discharges<br /><br />3 November 2015</th></tr><tr><td>Beaumont Hospital</td><td>59</td></tr><tr><td>Mater Misericordiae Hospital</td><td>69</td></tr><tr><td>St. James's Hospital</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>St. Vincent's University Hospital</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Tallaght Hospital</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>Connolly Hospital</td><td>28</td></tr></table></p><p>Delayed discharges can arise for a number of reasons.  For example, some patients have yet to apply for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, and others are in the course of having their applications assessed and validated.  Applicants are entitled to choose their own nursing home and in some cases, delays can arise while waiting for a suitable nursing home bed to become available in a location that is acceptable to patients and their families.</p><p>The Government committed an additional &euro;25m in Budget 2015 to address delayed discharges.  Of this:-</p><p>&euro;10m was allocated to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme to provide an additional 300 places;</p><p>- &euro;8m was allocated for the provision of 50 additional short-stay beds, in addition to the establishment of Mount Carmel as a short stay facility for the Dublin area;</p><p>- &euro;5m was allocated for an additional 400 Home Care Packages;</p><p>- &euro;2m was allocated to strengthen community care teams.</p><p>In a further initiative earlier this year, the Government approved additional funding of &euro;74m, of which &euro;44m was allocated to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme to provide an additional 1,600 places.  &euro;30m was used to cover the cost of a range of additional measures including transitional care beds (temporary contract beds) and additional community, convalescent and district hospital beds on a permanent basis.</p><p>The waiting time for approved applicants for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme has been reduced from 11 weeks in early 2015 to 3-4 weeks currently.</p><p>The budget allocation for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme has been increased by &euro;66m for 2016.</p></reply>

These proceeds will be re-invested in delivering much needed health care infrastructure. As there will always be more projects than can be funded by the Exchequer facilities which support the delivery of core health services must be prioritised within the context of the overall capital envelope available to us. Given the limited funding available and our health infrastructure needs priority for funding must be based on verified service needs and all capital funding must be directed to supporting these core services. The HSE is concentrating on applying the   limited funding available for capital works in the most effective way possible to meet health care needs now and in the future.</p>  <p>  In addition consideration must be given to Government's Reform Plan which sets out commitments relating to property asset use and management. These commitments include ensuring that optimal value for money is achieved in the management of the State's property portfolio. The development and implementation of the Property Management Delivery Plan has been one of the outcomes of the reform process. This plan aims to improve the planning and management of the public service property portfolio by improving co-ordination of strategies and activities, processes for strategic planning, projects and property management, standards for accommodation fit-out and data capture, accountability for decision making and deployment of resources. </p>  <p>  The HSE has been requested to respond to the proposal.

It faces internal and external challenges. </p>  <p>  The fact that elections were held in an open manner is, I believe, important. The joint assessment of the OSCE, ODHIR and Council of Europe found that the elections in Turkey offered voters variety of choices, but that the process was hindered by challenging security environment, incidents of violence and restrictions against media. According to their assessment, the election was generally peaceful. However, they agreed that, while there were positive elements, there were also shortcomings. </p>  <p>  There are also serious and legitimate concerns about freedom of the media, and not only in the context of the election. Along with our European partners, we will be continuing our dialogue on these issues with Turkey, including in the context of the annual enlargement Progress Reports, which we expect to issue today.  </p>  <p>   I look forward to working with the new Government in an open and constructive manner on the many issues of mutual concern, both bilaterally and in the context of Turkey&rsquo;s importance as an EU partner.</p></reply>

The limits will apply to all work and residency permits issued to foreign nationals, including cross-border commuters and asylum seekers. The referendum text did not specify at what levels the quotas on migrants should be set. </p>  <p>  The referendum outcome is a worrying development, with far-reaching implications for EU-Switzerland relations, not least because any new Swiss legislation introducing quotas on immigration by EU citizens would be incompatible with the existing EU-Switzerland Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons which has been in place since 2002. The free movement of people is a cornerstone of the construction of the European Union. It is integral to many of the 100 plus bilateral agreements between the EU and Switzerland and is a key basis on which Switzerland is able to access the EU single market. </p>  <p>  On 11 February 2015, the Swiss Federal Council (Cabinet) published draft legislation aimed at implementing the mandate it had been given to restrict immigration, including immigration by EU nationals. Since then, there has been a General Election in Switzerland. The populist Swiss People&rsquo;s Party (SVP) - which wants strict controls on immigration - won 29.4% of the vote and is now the largest party in Switzerland. The Swiss parliament will vote next month on the composition of the Federal Council. Present indications are that the SVP will take two of the seven seats, up from one at present. It remains to be seen what approach the new Swiss Government will take in response to the mandate given in the referendum. Our understanding is that the government has until 2017 implement the mandate. </p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s position remains that it refuses to entertain any negotiation on the principle of the Free Movement of Persons, a position Ireland fully supports.</p>  <p>  Ireland welcomed the signature of the tax transparency agreement between Switzerland and the EU in May 2015 under which EU Member States and Switzerland agreed to exchange information on the financial accounts of each other&rsquo;s residents from 2018.</p></reply>

It has already served to deepen our understanding of the various and complex issues that arise for Ireland in connection with a potential change in the nature of the UK&rsquo;s relationship with the EU. </p>  <p>  The findings of the study are clear: there are significant risks for Ireland if the UK were to leave the EU. Key areas of our economy could be adversely affected and there would also be implications for migration and in regard to the border between both parts of the island. Particular difficulties might arise as well in the energy sector. </p>  <p>  The report reinforces our conviction that a British withdrawal from the Union would be very negative for Ireland. That is why we are already working hard, across Government, to help ensure that scenario does not come to pass. This means working with all our EU partners, and especially the UK, to find a solution that will allow for continued British membership of the Union. My Department is naturally heavily involved in that process, as is our Embassy in London and all our diplomatic missions.</p>  <p>  The Government has also raised our concerns about any change in the nature of the EU-UK relationship with the British Government. In a number of meetings this year, I have stressed to the British Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, how much we value the UK&rsquo;s continuing presence in the Union. I have also emphasized the important role our common membership has played in strengthening our bilateral ties and in supporting peace and political stability in Northern Ireland. The Taoiseach has made similar points in discussions with Prime Minister Cameron.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to make its voice heard in the debate ahead in the UK on its membership of the Union. Just yesterday in London, the Taoiseach highlighted again how important continued British membership of the EU is to Ireland in a speech at the annual conference of the Confederation of British Industry. He also reconfirmed the Government&rsquo;s commitment to work with the UK on areas of common interest within the British reform agenda.</p>  <p>  Our approach continues to be guided by the belief that the best way to mitigate the risks of a British departure from the Union is to ensure it does not happen in the first place. At the same time, we recognize that we must be prepared for any scenario. </p></reply>

It is a matter for individual schools to use their professional judgment to identify pupils who will receive this support and to use the resources available to the school to intervene at the appropriate level with such pupils. </p><p>Schools are supported in this regard by the National Educational Psychological Services.</p><p>Schools are not required to apply directly to my Department for learning support for SLDs such as dyslexia.  Schools should monitor and utilise their allocation of additional teaching support to best support the needs of identified pupils, in accordance with my Department's guidance.  The teaching time afforded to each individual pupil is decided and managed by schools, taking into account each child's individual learning needs. My Departments Circulars SP ED 02/05 and 70/2014 provide guidelines for primary and post </p><p>primary schools respectively in relation to the utilisation of additional teaching resources which have been allocated to them for pupils with special educational needs.</p><p>As the allocation of support for pupils with SLDs is managed locally by schools, a parent who feels that their child requires additional learning support in school should raise this matter directly with their school Principal in the first instance, or with the Board of Management of the school. My Department does not provide funding for additional teaching, or tutor support, procured by parents outside of school time, or outside of the criteria set out in my Departments Home Tuition scheme.</p><p>In addition to support in mainstream schools, my Department provides funding for a number of special schools and special classes attached to mainstream primary schools which have been sanctioned to meet the needs of children with SLDs.  There are 4 Special Schools and 12 Special Classes attached to mainstream Primary schools catering for pupils with SLD.</p><p>Further supports which are provided to support pupils with Dyslexia include funding for schools for the purchase of specialised equipment; an information resource pack on Dyslexia which has been made available to all primary and post-primary schools as well as provision for continuing professional development for teachers with additional training needs in the area of Dyslexia through the Special Education Support Service (SESS).</p><p>Primary schools also have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA).</p><p>Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department also provides funding to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland at national level which helps the organisation operate an information service for members and the public as well as assisting in meeting the costs associated with the attendance of some children from disadvantaged backgrounds at workshops and programmes organised </p><p>by the association.  Fees charged by the organisation to its service users are a matter between the organisation and its membership.</p></reply>

The basic principle of public procurement is that there should be a competitive process and this approach applies to procurement by all public sector bodies, and includes school transport services performed by contractors under the School Transport Scheme. The tendering process is a competitive process which allows Bus &Eacute;ireann to achieve the procurement objectives in terms of value for money, access to the contracts for all interested parties, transparency on how the contracts are awarded, and equality of treatment.  The rules of the competition and the selection and award criteria were clearly outlined as to how the contracts would be awarded and all interested parties were provided with the same opportunity and the same information.  In this way the procurement process is carried out in an fair, open and transparent manner complying with all applicable EU Procurement Law, domestic legislation and government regulations.</p>  <p>  The contractual obligations that contractors are obliged to satisfy provide assurance that school transport services provided under the School Transport Scheme continue to meet the highest safety standards, and are neither unfair nor unreasonable.  This includes an obligation to keep and provide evidence that all statutory vehicle, driver and company certificates and licences are kept current and in order.  Nominated drivers are obliged to satisfy medical examination, must be licensed to drive the size of vehicle used, and are subject to vetting procedures arranged by Bus &Eacute;ireann and conducted by the Garda Central Vetting Unit.  Vehicles and maintenance systems are subject to random inspection conducted by leading independent experts in this field on behalf of Bus &Eacute;ireann in addition to satisfying statutory obligations outlined by the RSA, and service performance is monitored by School Bus Inspectors with support from the local Bus &Eacute;ireann school transport office.</p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann is very conscious of the specialised nature of transport provision for pupils with special educational needs under the School Transport Scheme.  This is reflected in the standard of service provided and by Bus &Eacute;ireann factoring the individual requirements of the children concerned into the planning of these services which generally operate on a door-to-door basis.  They remain very conscious of the disruption in service provision occasioned by a potential change of driver arising from the tendering process they are obliged to conduct but the award of a five-year contract to the successful tenderer provides security for the duration of the contract to the contractor as well as stability, in terms of familiarity with transport arrangements, for the families, schools, and children concerned.  Bus &Eacute;ireann does not tender for the work that it subcontracts to private operators.</p></reply>

The acquisition of the site in question is currently being progressed. Given the commercial sensitivities associated with land acquisitions generally I am not in a position to comment further at this time. I can, however, assure the Deputy that the acquisition of a new site for the school is a priority for my Department and the patron body Educate Together will be informed of the location for the school as soon as it is possible to do so.</p>  <p>  The school will open in suitable temporary accommodation in September 2016, pending delivery of the permanent accommodation.

With an overall programme value of &euro;4.15 m, the EU contribution is &euro;2.49 m, representing 60% of the total.  As the programme will run until next September and most public beneficiary bodies are funding the cost of EGF measures from their own budgets and will subsequently submit declarations at programme end for the final report and statement of eligible expenditure due to be submitted to the European Commission by 19 March 2017, it is difficult to accurately forecast the final expenditure.  No final expenditure declarations or payment claims have yet been received in my Department and I am not currently in a position to indicate the level of EGF programme expenditure.</p>  <p>  However, I understand that take-up of EGF support measures offered to date is less than anticipated. The total number of redundant workers who were potentially eligible under the EGF Programme was 424, with a further 200 young persons under the age of 25 not in employment, education or training (NEET persons) also being targeted under a new option introduced under EU Regulation 1309/2013 governing the EGF Fund.  Based on previous experience the targeted number of redundant workers under the Programme is set at 250 plus the 200 NEET persons.  While the Deputy refers to May 2015 figures, the recently published 2nd Implementation Report sets out that at end August 2015, 193 former workers and 76 NEETs had participated in EGF related programme measures; this equates to 77% and 38% of those targeted cohorts respectively. Engagement with the NEET persons is proving more challenging in the time limited context of EGF programmes.</p>  <p>  At end August, 256 of the 424 former workers were in employment (60.3%).  While positive, this re-employment rate may be mitigating against a higher programme participation rate.</p>  <p>  The local EGF Coordination Unit office established by SOLAS and located in Tallaght is coordinating EGF programme supports. All potential beneficiaries have been contacted by the Unit on a number of occasions.  The Unit and my Department met with the South Dublin County Partnership) earlier this year in the context of the LTAI EGF Programme and Ms Anna Lee, former CEO of  the Partnership subsequently took up the Chairperson of the LTAI EGF Consultative Forum set up to assist in the implementation of, and to maximise participation in the EGF programme.</p>  <p>  An information and advocacy event, arranged by worker and NEET representatives on the consultative forum and supported by the EGF Coordination Unit, will take place this week to encourage those eligible to avail of EGF programme support measures.  This includes a second tailored 10-week 'Dealing with Change and Opportunity, Mindfully' programme which will commence later this month.  My Department continues to liaise with the EGF Coordination Unit and other partners to maximise engagement with the programme.  The potential for wider engagement with the community sector in the Tallaght area to maximise participation, particularly of the NEET cohort, is being considered in that context.</p>  <p>  Final uptake of an EGF support measure is dependent on the individual choice of each eligible beneficiary and may be influenced ultimately by a range of factors including reintegration into part-time or full-time employment or a focus on job searching.</p></reply>

As part of this, a thorough reform of the Irish curriculum and the way Irish is taught at primary and second level is being undertaken. The priority is to take steps to improve the quality and effectiveness of the teaching of Irish.</p>  <p>  The priority at primary level is to provide high-quality language learning in our two languages, Irish and English.  A new Integrated Primary Languages Curriculum, incorporating Irish and English, is being developed by the NCCA.  The first phase will be introduced for Junior Infants to 2nd classes from September 2016.  It will be accompanied by dedicated CPD for principals and teachers.  Work on the language curriculum for 3rd to 6th classes has commenced and will be introduced later.  The curriculum aims to ensure that students acquire transferable language skills which will assist them in learning not only Irish and English during their primary education but through gaining transferable language skills, additional languages at second level.</p>  <p>  The NCCA is currently conducting an in-depth analysis of the outcomes of a wide consultation with stakeholders on a draft specification for the new Junior Cycle Irish curriculum.  The consultation process has been very informative but there is a need to further explore how the curriculum can best meet the needs of students in both English medium and Irish medium schools.  I look forward to the outcomes of this comprehensive consultation and to the implementation of the revised Junior Cycle Irish curriculum, commencing in September 2017.</p>  <p>  A revised Leaving Certificate curriculum in Irish began in all schools in September 2010, and was examined for the first time in 2012.  The revised programme provides for an increase in the proportion of marks available for oral assessment to 40%, and is aimed at promoting a significant shift in emphasis towards Irish as a spoken language, where students can communicate and interact in a spontaneous way, and where Irish is spoken every day in schools.  A review is currently underway of the oral component of Irish in the Leaving Certificate, and it is expected that a report will be published on this in the next number of months.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to note that an in-depth review of Education Provision in the Gaeltacht is nearing completion.  I look forward to a report in the coming months. </p></reply>

Regulations concerning the micro-chipping of dogs were introduced by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on 1 June 2015 and provide for the roll-out of a micro-chipping programme on a phased basis, beginning with pups in September 2015, and all dogs from March 2016.

Local authorities are responsible for monitoring compliance with these standards and are empowered to issue improvement notices where appropriate.

In discussions prior to the adoption of the 2007 Tyre Regulations, it was made clear that this was the last opportunity for the tyre industry to embrace environmental compliance and take responsibility for the waste it produces.  If the required improvement did not happen, it was made clear to the tyre industry that the system would be reviewed and replaced with a full Producer Responsibility Initiative (PRI) model. </p>  <p>  As part of a wider review of producer responsibility arrangements completed in 2014, the structural and environmental effectiveness of all aspects of the current system for managing waste tyres was assessed. The results of this examination were stark. The report, published for consultation in November 2013 and in final form in April 2014, found:   </p>  <p>-  A non-compliance rate with the Tyre Regulations of 46%,   </p>  <p>-  A lack of consistent and accurate data,   </p>  <p>-  That the current system was not tracking data flows well, and   </p>  <p>  -  Between 25% and 50% of waste tyres were not accounted for with widespread illegal dumping. </p>  <p>  In summary, this system, which has resulted in between 15 - 30 million tyres being dumped illegally, is clearly failing to provide a proper waste management system for tyres and can not be allowed to continue. </p>  <p>  Following extensive discussions with the tyre industry, I announced my decision to establish a full PRI scheme for Tyres and Waste Tyres in Ireland on 30 January 2015. Since my decision, significant progress has been made in discussions with the tyre industry.     </p>  <p>  The new scheme will be operated by Repak with a registration and reporting role for the WEEE Register Society. Both organisations have long and successful track records under existing producer responsibility arrangements in the packaging, battery and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) areas and have been instrumental in making Ireland a top EU per former in these waste streams. The new system will provide a sustainable and environmentally focussed system for the management of waste tyres. Like existing systems for waste tyres elsewhere in the EU and for all other waste streams in Ireland, this system will respect the producer responsibility approach and be based on the polluter pays principle. These are long-standing environmental principles which are reflected in both European and domestic legislation. </p>  <p>  There will be no new tyre tax or levy under the new system. Consumers already pay a disposal fee to their tyre retailer whenever they buy a new tyre. The model that I am introducing will formalise a charge that tyre retailers already apply but which does not currently go towards the cost of managing the waste in all cases, as it is supposed to. It is absolutely right and fair to provide a system that ensures it is properly directed in the future so that the consumer does not pay twice: once at the point of purchase and again when the taxpayer has to meet costs incurred by local authorities for the clean-up of illegally dumped tyres. </p>  <p>  Repak ELT, which has already replaced TRACS as the sole compliance scheme for tyres as of 1 November 2015, already has over 90 members and the model that I am developing, which mirrors those arrangements which are in place in 20 other Member States, will, I am confident, enjoy the full support of all members of the European Tyre and Rubber Manufacturers Association who make up approximately 50% of the Irish tyre market. </p>  <p>  As I have previously stated, I urge both the Irish Tyre Industry Association (ITIA) and the Irish Tyre Wholesalers &amp;amp; Retailers Association (ITWRA) to re-join the process and re-engage with my Department in finalising the details for the new regulatory regime.  In addition, my Department and Repak ELT continue to engage with representatives from the farming, construction and haulage sectors on the new arrangements. </p></reply>

This ineligibility does not apply in the case of separated persons where the alternative accommodation is occupied by a spouse, from whom the household member is separated or divorced. Under the regulations, a deed of separation is sufficient to set aside this ineligibility and it is not necessary for the couple to be judicially separated or divorced. </p>  <p>  In order to provide more flexibility to housing authorities to deal with cases where the ownership of the family home had not yet been finalised the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 amended section 20 of the 2009 Act. Housing authorities may now provide such households with social housing support under the Rental Accommodation Scheme or the new Housing Assistance Payment scheme until ownership of the family home is resolved in a formal separation or divorce settlement. </p>  <p>  The 2014 Act amendment provides that support in these circumstances will be reviewed by the housing authority at prescribed intervals and the household will not be able to transfer to other forms of social housing support while ownership of the family home remains to be determined. However, where the household ultimately qualifies for the full range of social housing supports, the length of time the household was supported under RAS or HAP will be reckonable for the purposes of determining the household&rsquo;s relative priority for a transfer. </p></reply>

This is one of the methods for the delivery of social housing by both local authorities and by approved housing bodies.  The Exchequer funding drawn down by local authorities in the delivery of new social housing units through construction for the period January 2015 to 6 November 2015 is outlined in the following table; this does not include Exchequer funding drawn down for other capital purposes, such as acquisitions and the refurbishment of void units, nor does it include self-funding for housing purposes provided by certain local authorities from Local Property Tax proceeds.</p><p>Under the Social Housing Strategy, I have made announcements in relation to projects to deliver new social housing to the value of almost a half a billion euro, with the result that social housing construction has been reactivated to a level that has not been seen for many years. Obviously there is a time-lag between approval and delivery for construction projects and in that context, the acquisition by local authorities of properties through turn-key developments and other purchases, and the remediation of vacant units, are very important actions which are delivering social housing this year for those on the housing waiting list. </p><p>In addition, it is a common feature of housing programmes over the years to be back-loaded towards the final quarter of the year, given the very nature of such expenditure. It is important from a value for money perspective that work is evaluated and certified adequately before public funds are spent and further expenditure will happen by year end on social housing programmes areas.</p><p>My Department is working with local authorities to support them in advancing the social housing construction projects that have been sanctioned and I have assured the authorities that funding resources to deliver these new units is not an obstacle.</p><p>Under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) units can be delivered in a variety of ways and local authorities are encouraged to explore and use all of these mechanisms. These mechanisms include units purchased, leased or constructed by approved housing bodies and both multi-unit developments and individual units leased or acquired through rental arrangements directly by local authorities. Units leased by local authorities or approved housing bodies can be for periods up to 20 years. The accommodation provided is made available to persons on local authority waiting lists, persons with long term housing needs in receipt of rent supplement (i.e. households eligible under the Rental Accommodation Scheme) or persons who are homeless. My Department recoups moneys to local authorities and approved housing bodies in respect of these units in order to facilitate their use for social housing purposes. A breakdown of the current expenditure drawn down this year to 6 November, by local authority, is also in the following table.<table><tr><th>Local Authority </th><th>Construction <br /><br />of Social <br /><br />Housing Units <br /><br /></th><th>Rental <br /><br />Accommodation <br /><br />Scheme <br /><br /></th><th>Social <br /><br />Housing <br /><br />Current Expenditure <br /><br />Programme <br /><br /></th></tr><tr><td>Carlow County Council </td><td><div>&euro;125,000 </div></td><td><div>&euro;2,579,777 </div></td><td><div>&euro;396,837 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Cavan County Council </td><td><div>&euro;448,292 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,859,399 </div></td><td><div>&euro;42,872 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Clare County Council </td><td><div>&euro;0 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,656,212 </div></td><td><div>&euro;635,003 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork City Council </td><td><div>&euro;108,719 </div></td><td><div>&euro;4,540,481 </div></td><td><div>&euro;826,509 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork County Council </td><td><div>&euro;0 </div></td><td><div>&euro;4,719,949 </div></td><td><div>&euro;2,685,066 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Donegal County Council </td><td><div>&euro;0 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,654,830 </div></td><td><div>&euro;872,463 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council </td><td><div>&euro;2,067,073 </div></td><td><div>&euro;4,835,621 </div></td><td><div>&euro;330,083 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoire -Rathdown County Co </td><td><div>&euro;0 </div></td><td><div>&euro;4,624,157 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,317,695 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Fingal County Council </td><td><div>&euro;0 </div></td><td><div>&euro;6,003,553 </div></td><td><div>&euro;2,472,744 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway City Council </td><td><div>&euro;0 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,024,582 </div></td><td><div>&euro;12,710 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway County Council </td><td><div>&euro;0 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,623,609 </div></td><td><div>&euro;248,739 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Kerry County Council </td><td><div>&euro;75,112 </div></td><td><div>&euro;0 </div></td><td><div>&euro;0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Kildare County Council </td><td><div>&euro;302,957 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,579,474 </div></td><td><div>&euro;44,570 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County Council </td><td><div>&euro;755,258.80 </div></td><td><div>&euro;3,231,468 </div></td><td><div>&euro;358,594 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Laois County Council </td><td><div>&euro;573,321 </div></td><td><div>&euro;801,546 </div></td><td><div>&euro;569,588 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim County Council </td><td><div>&euro;0 </div></td><td><div>&euro;247,242 </div></td><td><div>&euro;9,093 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City &amp;amp; County </td><td><div>&euro;0 </div></td><td><div>&euro;0 </div></td><td><div>&euro;0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Longford County Council </td><td><div>&euro;0 </div></td><td><div>&euro;618,782 </div></td><td><div>&euro;84,424 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Louth County Council </td><td><div>&euro;308,977 </div></td><td><div>&euro;944,967 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,980,522 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo County Council </td><td><div>&euro;144,509 </div></td><td><div>&euro;3,321,537 </div></td><td><div>&euro;250,965 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Meath County Council </td><td><div>&euro;419,608 </div></td><td><div>&euro;2,059,400 </div></td><td><div>&euro;965,377 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan County Council </td><td><div>&euro;1,069,889 </div></td><td><div>&euro;914,464 </div></td><td><div>&euro;2,262 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Offaly County Council </td><td><div>&euro;1,090,268 </div></td><td><div>&euro;850,824 </div></td><td><div>&euro;943,158 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon County Council </td><td><div>&euro;51,544 </div></td><td><div>&euro;565,309 </div></td><td><div>&euro;0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo County Council </td><td><div>&euro;46,184 </div></td><td><div>&euro;2,100,834 </div></td><td><div>&euro;195,793 </div></td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin County Council </td><td><div>&euro;0 </div></td><td><div>&euro;4,253,331 </div></td><td><div>&euro;72,678 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary County Council </td><td><div>&euro;0 </div></td><td><div>&euro;5,073,792 </div></td><td><div>&euro;80,189 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City &amp;amp; County </td><td><div>&euro;0 </div></td><td><div>&euro;2,959,921 </div></td><td><div>&euro;493,982 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath County Council </td><td><div>&euro;604,917 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,710,339 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,115,581 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Wexford County Council </td><td><div>&euro;1,111,101 </div></td><td><div>&euro;3,198,712 </div></td><td><div>&euro;514,668 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow County Council </td><td><div>&euro;0 </div></td><td><div>&euro;28,818 </div></td><td><div>&euro;16,183 </div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

To facilitate this agenda, I established the CEDRA Interdepartmental Group (IDG), comprising senior representatives of all relevant Government Departments. The purpose of the IDG is to ensure that each Department&rsquo;s policy development and implementation fully considers the needs of rural communities. In this context, it is about maximising the financial resources already available for rural development and ensuring that these resources are directed in a way that best supports the sustainable economic development of rural areas. In this regard, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible or practical to quantify the cross Government funding of CEDRA projects in 2015 on a county basis. </p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that &euro;1 million was allocated in the Budget for 2015 to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine to establish a Rural Innovation and Development fund in line with CEDRA recommendations to support innovative, small scale pilot initiatives and I am advised by that Department that this funding will be expended on a range of projects by end 2015. </p>  <p>  The LEADER element of the Rural Development Programme 2014&ndash;2020 will provide &euro;250 million in financial resources to support the development of sustainable rural communities.  This includes a provision of &euro;5 million to support the Rural Economic Development Zones (REDZ) identified in the report of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas (CEDRA). The approach to investing this &euro;5 million in these rural areas, through LEADER, will be informed by the outcome of the REDZ pilot scheme that is currently being implemented by my Department.</p>  <p>  Under the REDZ pilot scheme, my Department has recently allocated over &euro;3.7 million to some 51 initiatives.  Furthermore, and in line with the objectives of the CEDRA report, I recently announced an additional &euro;30 million investment package for rural Ireland, which will be rolled over the coming months. This funding will also support the revitalisation of towns and villages with a view to improving the living and working environment in these communities and increase their potential to support increased economic activity into the future.</p></reply>

The level of contribution, and the types of development to which development contributions should apply, is therefore determined at local authority level in accordance with the powers vested in elected members in this connection.</p><p>The charging of development contributions is intended to allow local authorities to recoup some of the costs to public funds of servicing land for private development. Without such contributions, this servicing would not proceed or the full cost would have to be borne by the taxpayer. Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, income from development levies must be ring-fenced to pay for facilities servicing new development, for example, for roads, footpaths, public lighting and open spaces. My Department issued statutory guidelines on development contributions to all planning authorities in January 2013. These guidelines emphasise the importance of promoting development through the application, where feasible, of reduced development contributions to facilitate development and promote economic activity and job creation in local areas. </p><p>Further to the 2013 guidelines, 20 of the 31 local authorities have responded positively by adopting revised development contribution schemes - encompassing reduced charges &ndash; which have been notified to my Department subsequent to their adoption. </p><p>This information is set out in the Table below:<table><tr><th>Local Authority </th><th>Scheme revised since January 2013 Guidance </th><th>Scheme predates January 2013 Guidance </th></tr><tr><td>Carlow County </td><td><div>_ </div></td><td><div>X </div></td></tr><tr><td>Ca van County </td><td><div>X </div></td><td><div>_ </div></td></tr><tr><td>Clare County </td><td><div>X </div></td><td><div>_ </div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork City </td><td><div>X </div></td><td><div>_ </div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork County </td><td><div>_ </div></td><td><div>X </div></td></tr><tr><td>Donegal County </td><td><div>_ </div></td><td><div>X </div></td></tr><tr><td>Local Authority </td><td>Scheme revised since January 2013 Guidance </td><td>Scheme predates January 2013 Guidance </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City </td><td><div>X </div></td><td><div>- </div></td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown County </td><td><div>X </div></td><td><div>- </div></td></tr><tr><td>Fingal County </td><td><div>X </div></td><td><div>- </div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway City </td><td><div>- </div></td><td><div>X </div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway County </td><td><div>- </div></td><td><div>X </div></td></tr><tr><td>Kerry County </td><td><div>- </div></td><td><div>X </div></td></tr><tr><td>Kildare County </td><td><div>- </div></td><td><div>X </div></td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County </td><td><div>X </div></td><td><div>- </div></td></tr><tr><td>Laois County </td><td><div>X </div></td><td><div>_ </div></td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim County </td><td><div>- </div></td><td><div>X </div></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City &amp;amp; County </td><td><div>X </div></td><td><div>_ </div></td></tr><tr><td>Longford County </td><td><div>X </div></td><td><div>_ </div></td></tr><tr><td>Louth County </td><td><div>- </div></td><td><div>X </div></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo County </td><td><div>- </div></td><td><div>X </div></td></tr><tr><td>Meath County </td><td><div>X </div></td><td><div>- </div></td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan County </td><td><div>X </div></td><td><div>- </div></td></tr><tr><td>Offaly County </td><td><div>X </div></td><td><div>- </div></td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon County </td><td><div>X </div></td><td><div>- </div></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo County </td><td><div>- </div></td><td><div>X </div></td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin County </td><td><div>X </div></td><td><div>- </div></td></tr><tr><td>Local Authority </td><td>Scheme revised since January 2013 Guidance </td><td>Scheme predates January 2013 Guidance </td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary County </td><td><div>X </div></td><td><div>- </div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City &amp;amp; County </td><td><div>X </div></td><td><div>- </div></td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath County </td><td><div>X </div></td><td><div>- </div></td></tr><tr><td>Wexford County </td><td><div>X </div></td><td><div>- </div></td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow County </td><td><div>X </div></td><td><div>- </div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

Funding is available under the scheme towards the purchase of equipment by a registered organisation i.e. personal alarm and/or pendant and the associated monitoring and service charges are paid by the participant.  Following a review in 2010 , one of the recommendations was that a centralised procurement proc ess would simplify the scheme. By decreasing the level of administration for groups, this would allow them to spend more time on the key aim of the scheme, which is enhanced engagement with older members of the community, and would also achieve value for money through economies of scale.</p>  <p>  My Department undertook to consider new approaches to the Seniors Alert Scheme in 2014 and arising from this, it was decided that the scheme should be managed by Pobal, given that organisation&rsquo;s significant experience delivering programmes on behalf of Government. The management and administration of the Scheme transferred from the Department to Pobal on 7 September 2015. </p>  <p>  The community based organisations that wish to support older people with the supply of personal monitored alarms are required to register with Pobal before operating the scheme. Paper-based forms are also available to these community based organisations to facilitate those that are not able to register online.  In addition, Pobal have a helpdesk facility to assist with any queries, which can be contacted at 01 5117222. Once registered, these organisations can then submit participant applications on behalf of elderly people living in their defined area of operation. There is no closing date for receipt of registrations. </p>  <p>  This new approach will reduce the administrative burden for the many hundreds of community and voluntary groups registered under the Scheme, who provide an excellent service for the elderly. It will enable the groups to concentrate on the main purpose of the Scheme, namely to support and interact with the elderly in the local community.</p></reply>

In April last, I issued social housing t argets and provisional funding allocations to all local authorities, to be invested in a combination of building, buying and leasing schemes designed to accommodate 25% of those currently on the housing waiting lists. Galway City Council and Galway County Council have a combined target of 1,126 units, supported by &euro;58.5m of investment, broken down as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th>-</th><th><b><font face="Arial">Local Authority Housing/</font></b><br /><br /><b><font face="Arial">AHB delivery via CAS/</font></b><br /><br /><b><font face="Arial">Return of vacant properties</font></b></th><th></th><th><b><font face="Arial">Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme</font></b></th><th></th><th><b><font face="Arial">Rental Accommodation Scheme</font></b></th></tr><tr><td></td><td><b><font face="Arial">2015-17</font></b></td><td><b><font face="Arial">2015</font></b></td><td><b><font face="Arial">2016/7</font></b></td><td><b><font face="Arial">2015</font></b></td><td><b><font face="Arial">2016/7</font></b></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Arial">Galway City Council</font></td><td><font face="Arial">136</font></td><td><font face="Arial">90</font></td><td><font face="Arial">251</font></td><td><font face="Arial">20</font></td><td><font face="Arial">21</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Arial">Galway County Council</font></td><td><font face="Arial">144</font></td><td><font face="Arial">80</font></td><td><font face="Arial">230</font></td><td><font face="Arial">80</font></td><td><font face="Arial">74</font></td></tr></table></p><p>As the housing authorities for their areas, the Galway authorities are responsible for the detailed planning of social housing provision based on the local need. This includes working with approved housing bodies to assist in meeting the needs of those on the social housing waiting list in their administrative areas.</p><p>However, the funding I have allocated also supports local authorities&rsquo; own work in th e provision of social housing . I have announced new social housing construction projects to the value of approximately half a billion euros, including 155 new units for the Galway local authorities at a cost estimate of &euro;25 million. Details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links: </p><p>.</p><p>Given the time-lag between approval and delivery in terms of construction projects, a successful programme to remediate vacant units, as well as the acquisition by local authorities of properties through turn-key developments and other purchases, are important parts of social housing delivery this year. The Galway authorities inform me they aim to deliver around 70 new acquisitions this year, while I am providing funding support to them to return 90 vacant social housing units to productive use.</p><p>The projects and programmes to deliver new social housing are being advanced strongly by local authorities. I am confident that by utilising all delivery mechanisms under these programmes, local authorities will continue to deliver on the ir social housing targets in line with the Social Housing Strategy.</p></reply>

One of the conditions of the scheme, which is a group policy, is that it is obligatory for all local authority borrowers who meet the eligibility criteria to join the scheme. Altering this condition would have a negative impact on the scheme and increase the cost for all existing borrowers.</p>  <p>  The provision requiring that mortgage protection insurance is held by mortgage holders is contained in the Consumer Credit Act 1995. This legislation is the responsibility of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p>  <p>  In terms of comparison to other schemes of mortgage protection, it is important to note that it covers disability as well as death and that the disability cover is for the full period of the disability and not just 12 months as is the case in the majority of MPI policies available. The MPI premium paid by borrowers is not broken down between life assurance and disability insurance cover.</p>  <p>  The Mortgage Protection Committee which oversees the scheme endeavours to achieve a balance between the most economic rate to be charged for the scheme and the benefits provided. In negotiating a renewal of the scheme, which came into effect from 1 January 2012, the Committee were able to harness the downward pressure on pricing in the economy and secure an average 19% reduction on the rate which applied to the previous scheme. As part of the upcoming re-tendering process, the Committee which includes representation from my Department will seek to secure with effect from 1 January 2017, the most appropriate Mortgage Protection Insurance cover at the best value for money for local authority borrowers.</p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water shall collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.  Any business connected to a public water supply is liable for charges as a non-domestic customer. If the premises is also used for domestic purposes it is termed a mixed - use customer. Mixed - use customers will be billed separately for their domestic and non-domestic water services and will have a separate account number for each. Mixed-use customers will be charged for the domestic component of their usage based on occupancy. For the domestic component, single adult households will pay a maximum of &euro;160 per year; multi-adult households will pay a maximum of &euro;260 a year. Mixed-use dwellings that register with Irish Water are eligible for the annual   &euro;100 water conservation grant.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the existing arrangements for all non-domestic customers are remaining in place with no changes for the time being. On this basis, the local authorities will continue to bill for non-domestic water services as agents of Irish Water and the non-domestic component of their consumption will continue to be charged according to the current non-domestic tariff arrangement. In the case of a metered customer, the volume to be charged at the non-domestic rate will continue to be the metered volume in excess of the current local authority domestic allowance.   As part of the water pricing policy which provided for non-domestic water charges, local authorities were required to provide mixed-use customers with an allowance in respect of their domestic consumption.</p>  <p>  The CER will be reviewing all aspects of non-domestic water tariffs under a series of public consultations and will shortly publish the time-line for this process.</p></reply>

As local authorities exited the waste collection market, some required the private operators which took on the Councils&rsquo; customers to provide a level of discount for existing waiver customers only, and even then for a limited time. The vast majority of contractual commitments for private operators to provide a waiver have now expired. In that context, the number of households in receipt of waiver discounts is likely to decline over time, especially as some householders were able to take advantage of special reduced offers elsewhere which actually undercut the waiver price. However, selected private operators still offer some level of discount to former waiver customers on a voluntary basis.  In addition, a very limited number of local authorities make financial contributions towards the cost of, or pay for, the collection of waste from certain households. Again, the qualification criteria and level of support differ from area to area. Such expenditure means that these local authorities divert funding from other areas to support these waiver provisions. </p>  <p>  The vast majority of local authorities no longer collect waste and that the market is now serviced by a diverse range of private operators, where the fees charged are a matter between service provider and customer and the services offered vary across the country. In that regard, it is becoming increasingly apparent that a national waiver scheme could not be imposed in the context of an open market for waste collection.   </p></reply>

Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy. In 2014, 8.6% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall energy requirements were met from renewable sources, with energy from biomass accounting for 3.2%. Bioenergy is expected to contribute up to half of the 2020 renewable energy targets, both here in Ireland and in the EU as a whole. In 2014, I published a Draft Bioenergy Plan which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. The draft Plan is currently undergoing Strategic Environmental and Appropriate Assessments which will inform the content of the finalised Plan.   The draft Plan recognises that demand for solid biomass to 2020 could be met from indigenous sources. However, Ireland will remain a net importer of liquid biofuels in the transport sector. </p>  <p>  Biofuels must meet certain strict sustainability criteria, as set out in the Renewable Energy Directive, in order to be counted towards each Member State&rsquo;s 2020 renewable energy targets. All biofuels supported under the Biofuels Obligation Scheme must meet these criteria. In addition, the European Commission recently adopted a Directive which will limit the amount of certain crop based biofuels, where use could lead to Indirect Land-Use Change, that Member States can count towards their targets.</p>  <p>  Details on origins and types of biofuels supported is published each year in the Biofuels Obligation Scheme Annual Report which is available from the National Oil Reserves Agency&rsquo;s website, www.nora.ie.  </p></reply>

This is being achieved through a combination of accelerated commercial investment by telecoms operators, and a proposed State intervention to provide high speed broadband to those parts of the country where the commercial sector will not invest.  Last November I published a national high speed coverage map for 2016. This map is available at . The map shows Ireland with two colours, BLUE and AMBER and was developed based on the most up to date information available at the time of publication. The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services by the end of 2016.</p><p>The areas marked AMBER represent those areas where the State intends to intervene to ensure those areas will have access to high speed broadband services and includes Ashford, Co Limerick.</p><p>I would encourage members of the public to consult both my Department's map and the information being provided by the commercial operators on their respective websites to establish the precise situation regarding their individual premises.</p><p>It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30 Mbps will be also delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.</p><p>More generally I can confirm that next generation broadband services have been rolled out to over 48,800 premises to date in Co Limerick with over 14,800 more expected to be served by commercial investment. Approximately 33,900 premises in Limerick will be covered either by further commercial investment or the proposed State intervention.</p><p>40 responses were received following the publication of the NBP proposed Intervention Strategy in July last. Non-confidential versions of these submissions have been published since last week and can be accessed at . </p><p>Meanwhile, my Department continues to review the technical and financial detail relating to potential new commercial investment proposals with a view to updating the intervention area Map. I expect to publish an updated version of the Map and to proceed to formal procurement before the end of the year.</p><p>The Government is determined to ensure that the network is built out as quickly as possible and engagement with industry stakeholders has indicated that this could be achieved within 3-5 years of the contract award.</p><p>In this context, the NBP proposes that through the combination of commercial investment and State intervention, 85% of addresses in Ireland will have access to high speed services by 2018 with all addresses passed by 2020.</p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.</p><p>On 29 September the Government agreed and published its 6 year Capital Plan, <i>Building on Recovery</i>, which included an allocation of &euro;275m for the National Broadband Plan. This will provide the initial stimulus required to deliver the Government's intervention. </p><p>Funding of &euro;75m is also committed through the European Regional Development Fund but this can only be drawn down after Exchequer expenditure is first incurred.</p><p>Combined with commercial investment, this will ensure that 85% of Ireland's premises have high speed broadband by 2018, with 100% coverage by 2020.</p><p>Because a competitive procurement process is anticipated, it would be neither advisable nor appropriate to speculate about the potential overall cost of the NBP at this stage. Ultimately, the outcome of the procurement process will determine the final cost of the intervention. I hope to commence the procurement process before the end of this year. Progress on the project and the outcome of the procurement process will influence the quantum of exchequer funding that will be expended on the NBP in 2016.</p></reply>

These measures are focused on addressing the barriers identified to undertaking energy efficiency activity in the commercial sector rather than providing direct grant assistance to business.</p>  <p>  The Government has committed &euro;35 million to an Energy Efficiency Fund (EEF), which makes commercial financing available to businesses who want to boost their energy efficiency. In addition, a dedicated support programme for small to medium energy users has also been operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) since 2008. The programme offers free energy management advice, mentoring, training and other support services to any business willing to show a commitment to becoming more energy-efficient. This service delivery includes the provision of an initial energy audit and offers a structured approach to energy management, in a form that can be adapted and tailored to the level of energy costs in the company. </p>  <p>  The Accelerated Capital Allowances (ACA) scheme is a tax incentive whereby businesses can write off the full cost of investment in energy efficient equipment in the year of purchase. This assists in cash flow and in the financing of energy efficiency projects. There are now 52 technologies covered in 10 product categories (which includes a catering and hospitality equipment category), comprising over 10,000 products registered.</p>  <p>  SEAI promotes the provision of high quality energy efficiency audits for businesses through supports for industry and SMEs including assistance with implementation of certified Energy Management Systems and the provision of energy audits to business through the Advice and Mentoring Scheme. Over 2,000 businesses, representing an annual energy expenditure of over &euro;400 million, have already availed of this programme, with 10% energy savings routinely found in the first year and energy cost savings of up to 30% achieved in many cases. </p>  <p>  An energy efficiency obligation scheme commenced in 2014. Under the scheme, energy suppliers are required to deliver mandatory energy savings. The obligation scheme encourages energy suppliers to work collaboratively with customers to identify potential savings and to share the benefits that these savings could deliver.</p>  <p>  In 2012, the Government introduced a support scheme to incentivise the use of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) generation in the commercial and industrial sector. This support for CHP is in the form of feed-in tariffs for electricity produced from biomass CHP plants. A further support scheme that covers renewable heat is expected to be introduced in 2016.</p></reply>

The EU aims to deliver a 20% improvement in energy efficiency, a 20% reduction in Green House Gas emissions and 20% of energy from renewable sources by 2020.</p>  <p>  In addition, the 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources, 12% renewables in the heating sector and 10% in transport. Policies and schemes are in place to incentivise the use of renewable energy. The REFIT schemes underpin the development of a range of renewable energy technologies. As regards energy efficiency, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is continuing to implement policy with the roll out of efficiency measures in homes and businesses throughout the country supported by substantial exchequer funding for energy efficiency.</p>  <p>  The overarching objective of the Government's energy policy is to ensure secure and sustainable supplies of competitively priced energy to all consumers. A well balanced fuel mix that provides reliable energy, minimises costs and protects against supply disruptions and volatility, is essential to Irish consumers. While fossil fuels will remain part of the energy mix as we transit to a largely decarbonised energy system by 2050, significant progress is being made in increasing the share of renewables in that mix.</p>  <p>  Provisional figures provided by the SEAI for 2014 show that 8.6% of Ireland's overall energy requirements were met by renewable energy. In addition, the SEAI has calculated that 22.7% of electricity, 6.6% of heat and 5.2% of transport demand was met from renewable sources.  </p></reply>

A number of research initiatives are underway to facilitate the use of different types of renewable technologies on the system and are worth noting.    First, a Smart Grid Working Group comprising representation from my Department, EirGrid, the ESB, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the development agencies has drawn up a Smart Grid Roadmap setting out how a smart grid can contribute to increasing the amount of renewable energy on the electricity system, improving our security of energy supply and meeting Ireland&rsquo;s emissions reductions targets. </p>  <p>  Second, a number of major studies have been carried out by EirGrid in recent years to investigate the levels of renewable generation that can be securely accommodated on the power system of Ireland and Northern Ireland. These studies have considered the implications for both transmission infrastructure, and grid operation, of managing a power system with large amounts of variable renewable generation sources. </p>  <p>  On foot of this work, EirGrid has developed a range of secure operational tools and system management policies to manage the power system with increasing amounts of variable renewable generation. These operational tools and polices are subject to on-going review and development to ensure security of supply is always maintained.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, EirGrid continues through its Grid 25 strategy and its "DS3" programme (Delivering a Secure, Sustainable Electricity System) to develop and operate the electricity network to meet the challenges of the deployment of increasing levels of renewable generation in order to maintain high quality, secure and competitive power supplies in line with best international practice, for the benefit of all electricity consumers.</p>  <p>  Separately, analysis of the potential of microgeneration technologies has been carried out by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). The SEAI's findings, along with responses to the recent consultation on the Green Paper on Energy Policy, will inform future policy on the provision of any market support for microgeneration, and will be taken into consideration in preparation of the Energy Policy White Paper which will be published before the end of this year.</p>  <p>  Finally, as regards ocean energy, Exchequer support is provided by my Department for ocean research, development and demonstration and my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual ocean energy development budget supports the development of test sites and of marine research activities at the Integrated Maritime Energy Resource Cluster in Cork. My Department&rsquo;s budget also supports the Prototype Development Fund operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland which supports and grant aids ocean wave energy companies, helping projects progress up the technology readiness level development path.   </p></reply>

Two further consultations on each support scheme are planned. These consultations will be informative regarding the cost effectiveness of technologies that can assist in meeting both our 2020 target and our contribution to the EU's 2030 renewable energy target of 27%. Subject to Government approval and State Aid clearance from the European Commission, the new schemes would become available in late 2016.</p>  <p>  As regards renewable transport, Ireland aims to meet its target mainly through the use of sustainable biofuels. Further increases to the obligation rate in the Biofuels Obligation Scheme will be required in the context of achieving our 2020 target. In this regard, a public consultation on the Biofuels Obligation Scheme was completed recently.</p></reply>

The State itself is not a player in this market and will only intervene in the broadband market in cases of clear market failure - the recent National Broadband Scheme and the proposed intervention under the National Broadband Plan are examples of such interventions. </p>  <p>  The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising both fixed and mobile networks. This includes some &euro;850m invested in acquiring spectrum under the 2012 Multi-Band Spectrum Auction run by ComReg. Since then, the mobile operators have all continued to invest in rolling out 4G and enhanced 3G services nationwide. These investments are improving both the coverage and quality of voice and data services throughout the country.</p>  <p>  In 2012 when the National Broadband Plan was first published, industry committed to providing high speed broadband to 1 million addresses in Ireland by 2015, with top speeds ranging from 100 Mbps for cable and 70 Mbps for eFibre services. </p>  <p>  Today, cable is delivering speeds of up to 240 Mbps to over 700,000 addresses and fibre-to-the-cabinet services of up to 100 Mbps are available to approximately 1.3 million addresses. By the end of 2016, it is envisaged that high speed broadband will be available to 1.6 million addresses in Ireland. That compares to only 300,000 addresses five years ago. </p>  <p>  However, as the National Broadband Plan acknowledges, much of this investment is focussed on urban centres and towns and many rural areas are not likely to benefit in any meaningful way. Consequently, the Government has made significant commitments under the National Broadband Plan to ensure that all premises, irrespective of location, will have access to high-speed, high-quality future proofed broadband services by 2020. </p>  <p>  The combination of significant commercial investment plus the strong commitments for public funding for non-commercial areas will mean that Ireland's telecommunications and broadband networks will be among the best and most modern in the EU and beyond, capable of meeting both current and anticipated future growth in bandwidth demand.</p></reply>

This consent is required by the developer before production of gas can commence.    A public consultation process in relation to the application was initiated on 25 August and closed on 25 September. 11 submissions were received and these are currently being considered as part of the application which will inform the evaluation and decision process.</p>  <p>  As previously advised, I understand that the bulk of the gas produced from the Corrib field will be supplied to the national grid via the 149 km pipeline constructed by Bord G&aacute;is Networks, which runs from the gas terminal in Bellanaboy Co Mayo to Ballymoneen outside of Galway.The economic benefits of the Corrib gas field include the direct return to the Exchequer, the significant economic activity generated from the development stage of the project together with a strengthening of Ireland&rsquo;s security of energy supply. It is estimated that Corrib will have an operating life span of between 15 to 20 years and gas production will on average meet 42% of all island gas demand over the first two years of operation, declining thereafter.</p></reply>

However, post offices, having being fully computerised some years ago, also stand well positioned to become the front office provider of choice for Government and the financial services sector for both electronic transactions as well as the more traditional over the counter transactions.</p>  <p>  The Post Office Network Business Development Group, whose remit is to examine the potential from existing and new Government and commercial business that could be transacted through the post office network, presented its initial report to me in May 2015. In summary, the initial report outlined that the future of the post office network would be best secured by seeking out opportunities in the following areas: financial services, including services delivered by the Department of Social Protection ,and basic banking for the unbanked, Government services, social capital and enterprise, and white labelling of financial and other products.</p>  <p>  In advance of receiving the final report, it is premature to speculate on future products or services and how they will integrate into the existing An Post technology infrastructure.</p></reply>

Ireland, however, has witnessed a positive upswing in the level of petroleum exploration activity in recent years, in particular acquisition of new seismic data and the record number of applications received in the 2015 Atlantic Margin Licensing Round. We need to see this translate into an increased level of exploration drilling in the coming years, if Ireland&rsquo;s true petroleum potential is to be realised </p><p>In a similar manner, while the number of active mineral prospecting licences, currently in excess of 550 licences, indicates the positive prevailing state of mineral exploration in Ireland, no new commercially viable deposits of minerals have been discovered during this period. While there have been some encouraging results, particularly in Counties Limerick and Clare, it is too early to determine whether these results will lead to identification of commercially viable deposits.</p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.</p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services. These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>Last November I published a national high speed coverage map for 2016. This map is available at . The areas marked BLUE represent those areas that will have access to commercial high speed broadband services.</p><p>The AMBER areas show the target areas for the State intervention. All premises within the AMBER areas will be included in the State's intervention.</p><p>The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises / home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention. </p><p>It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30 Mbps will be also delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.</p><p>I would encourage consumers to consult the websites of the various commercial operators to ascertain details of current and planned future deployment plans. </p><p>I can confirm that next generation broadband services have been rolled out to over 55,000 premises to date in Co Kildare with over 12,500 more expected to be served by commercial investment. Approximately 20,500 remaining premises in Kildare will be covered either by further commercial investment or the proposed State intervention.</p><p>40 responses were received following the publication of the NBP proposed Intervention Strategy in July last. Non-confidential versions of these submissions are being published and can be accessed at . </p><p>Meanwhile, my Department continues to review the technical and financial detail relating to potential new commercial investment proposals with a view to updating the intervention area Map. I expect to publish an updated version of the Map and to proceed to formal procurement before the end of the year.</p><p>The Government is determined to ensure that the network is built out as quickly as possible and engagement with industry stakeholders has indicated that this could be achieved within 3-5 years of the contract award.</p><p>In this context, the NBP proposes that through the combination of commercial investment and State intervention, 85% of addresses in Ireland will have access to high speed services by 2018 with 100% coverage by 2020.</p></reply>

With regard to Killarney National Park, every year, as part of the ongoing management of deer populations within the Park, deer numbers may need to be reduced.  It is intended to commence culling later this month, once the rut has finished.  This work will be undertaken by qualified and competent National Parks and Wildlife Service personnel of my Department.  The proposed cull is no different to what has happened in previous years.</p>  <p>  I recognise that the red deer of Killarney National Park and the surrounding area are of national conservation significance and that the subject of culling is quite emotive.  There is a significant challenge in attempting to balance the demands of agriculture, forestry and conservation with the need to ensure that deer populations occupying the same land resources are managed at sustainable levels, and in a responsible and ethical manner.  My Department carries out localised annual deer counts on State lands such as in Wicklow and Killarney National Parks and I am aware that deer species are increasing in range and numbers.  Where appropriate, and depending on the annual count and instances of damage caused by deer to habitats, especially woodland, culls need to be carried out to ensure that deer populations do not reach levels that would have negative ecological consequences.</p></reply>

Both designations occur within the Shannon Callows.  </p>  <p>  A habitat enhancement scheme (known as the National Parks and Wildlife Service Farm Plan Scheme) was previously available to farmers in designated sites to undertake proactive measures for the conservations interests in question.  These measures were not a condition of the designation, nor were they compensation for designation.  These commitments were voluntary in nature and lasted for the period of the farm plan.  This scheme was closed to new applicants in April 2010.  My Department will enter into new farm plan contracts only in specific cases where pro-active measures are required by or overseen by the Department to protect/restore an important species or habitat.  </p>  <p>  Instead, significant funding is provided now through the Rural Development Programme (operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine) to assist farmers in meeting the requirements of the Birds and Habitats Directives.  It is wise in my view that the Programme, co-funded with the EU, is used for such purposes.  Farmers such as those in the Shannon Callows have been given priority access to the GLAS scheme.  My Department has also supports an EU-funded pilot project to test Result-based Agri-environment Payment Schemes (RBAPS) in the Shannon Callows and this will run from January 2015 to June 2018.  This will hopefully inform future agri-environment schemes in the Shannon Callows.</p>  <p>  Staff of my Department are available to discuss these issues and the Designated Area Monitoring Committee may be the appropriate forum to do this.</p></reply>

It should be noted that while the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department does licence hunting of Deer, my Department does not own the deer population.  They roam freely throughout the countryside and are present in many parts of the country.  My Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine published Deer Management in Ireland &ndash; A Framework for Action in March this year which recommends a series of actions on deer management and conservation in a number of areas including addressing the impact of deer in places where they are widespread.  An Irish Deer Management Forum has been established to implement the various actions listed in the Report.  The Forum itself comprises representatives from the main stakeholder areas such as landowners, forestry, hunting and conservation organisations as well as representatives from both Departments.  </p>  <p>  With regard to calls for increased fencing in relation to incidents of deer presence on public roads in Kerry, my Department has no plans to fence the National Park.  Deer, albeit larger, are like other wild animals in this country and it is not part of the remit of my Department to cordon them onto specific areas of land.  Moreover, fencing the National Park would not be a viable solution and would not achieve the desired results for a number of reasons:</p>  <p>  - 	The presence of deer is not confined to the National Parks and so fencing of these properties would serve no practical purpose in terms of wild deer control or management.</p>  <p>  -	The Park is over 10,000 ha in size including some rugged terrain.  Fencing this area would be an enormous task which is unlikely to result in the desired objective.</p>  <p>  -	Sika deer are capable of going under fencing that is 8 inches off the ground while Red deer are capable of knocking fences that are preventing them from reaching traditional feeding and shelter grounds.</p>  <p>  -	The erection of a fence this size could also impact on the sensitive habitats within the Park.</p>  <p>  -	There are many deer outside the Park boundaries which would still be capable of running into the path of motorists.</p>  <p>  -	I am of the view that improving sight lines for motorists as well as improved (possibly larger) signage is likely to be the most effective measure to assist motorists in remaining vigilant when driving through areas where populations of deer can be expected.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department have discussed this with Kerry County Council and I understand that Kerry County Council have prepared a scheme of works (which includes a number of measures including trimming back of overhanging tree branches, enhancement/relocation of road-side signs, etc.) in this regard.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the Library will also benefit from additional funding under the <i>Ireland 2016</i>Centenary Programme next year. </p><p>In relation to the security of the collection, I am aware that the Library gives this issue the highest priority and, where incidents have arisen, they have brought in appropriate expert advice to assist them.  I was also pleased to recently approve a new post in the National Library for a security and facilities manager, which will be key to managing and planning the storage and security of the Library&rsquo;s collection.</p><p>It is widely acknowledged that the Library holds a significant amount of its collection in an historic Victorian era building, which would not meet modern standards in terms of environmental and other controls.  </p><p>I will shortly be making a positive announcement about the development of a capital investment plan for the Library's Kildare Street building.  I am confident that those plans will allow the Library to continue to deliver on its core objectives, including the protection and conservation of its collections.</p></reply>

I understand that this cemetery, which was attached to Mount St Joseph Seminary or Monastery, catered for burials from 1825 to 1965.  On that basis it does not quality for entry into the Record of Monuments and Places.  For a monument to be taken into my ownership or guardianship under the National Monuments Acts 1930 to 2004, or made subject to a preservation order, I must be satisfied that it is a national monument within the meaning of those Acts, and that its preservation is a matter of national importance.  This can only ever be an option in a very small number of especially important cases and, while I appreciate fully the significance the local community undoubtedly attaches to this cemetery, I am afraid that it does not meet the statutory criteria for national monument purposes. </p><p>Funding is provided by my Department for heritage conservation projects via a number of schemes, which are either directly administered or delivered through local authorities and certain agencies.  On 9 February last, I announced an allocation of &euro;624,000 for the Structures at Risk Fund 2015,<i></i>to enable conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000, as amended, and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  This Fund, which is being administered through the local authorities, encourages the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and helps to secure the preservation of protected structures, which might otherwise be lost.  The Fund, which is now closed, was open to two applications per local authority, of which only one application may be in respect of a publicly-owned building.  It is primarily a matter for the local authority to nominate its two applications.  Since 2011, over 100 structures have been safeguarded for the future as a result of the Structures at Risk Fund.  The operation of a similar scheme in the future would be contingent on dedicated funding being made available to my Department.</p><p>The remainder of my Department&rsquo;s built heritage capital budget for 2015 is focused on the conservation and presentation of the State's heritage portfolio, which is managed by the Office of Public Works.</p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  For 2015, the Council administered a community based heritage grants scheme with funding of &euro;547,000 available for projects that contribute to particular heritage themes.  While I understand that applications have closed for their 2015 scheme, the Council may be able to advise if the structure would be eligible for funding now or in the future.

The policy places an emphasis on sustainable development of the environment and urban design, incorporates architectural heritage in a holistic integrated manner, and encourages and supports high quality modern architecture.  The policy complements and supports the Government&rsquo;s wider economic strategy within the Programme for Government in areas such as built environment research and qualitative place-making.  My Department has provided grant assistance to organisations that support the Government policy on Architecture.  The focus on awarded grant aid is to support activities that relate directly to the objectives and 45 direct actions within the policy but which are independently run through other organisations/stakeholder groups and which may be assisted by a financial contribution.  These include initiatives such as:</p>  <p>  -	Research, surveys, reviews including those which could contribute to architectural or policy development;</p>  <p>  -	Promoting an increased appreciation and public awareness of architecture/urban design in Ireland or the rich and unique built heritage environment (exhibitions, conferences, lectures, specific initiatives etc.);</p>  <p>  -	Increasing awareness and public understanding of the challenges confronting the built environment.</p>  <p>  The actions set out in the Government Policy on Architecture 2009-2015 cover a broad spectrum and involve many participants in addition to Government departments and State agencies where applicable.  </p>  <p>  I have no immediate plans for a new policy.  However, my Department will be conducting a &ldquo;taking stock&rdquo; exercise on actions completed to date on conclusion of the current policy with a view to having a review carried out which will involve consultation with key stakeholders including educational institutions, professional bodies and organisations devoted to the promotion of architecture.  The outcome of such a review will contribute to the determining of any further policies as and when applicable.</p></reply>

These are significant challenges which will not be fixed overnight, and will most likely take a number of years to address.  In addition Government Departments and other Agencies have also faced significant reductions in resources and this has had a negative impact on their ability to process and prepare records for transfer to the National Archives.</p><p>The Government recently agreed to reduce the time period for the transfer of records from 30 years to 20 and, in line with that, it was also agreed that the National Archives would undertake a pilot study, with the Department of Education and Skills, to ascertain the cost to Departments of storing records which should have been transferred to the National Archives.</p><p>It is widely acknowledged that the Archives headquarters in Bishop Street are at capacity in terms of the amount of storage available, and the building is also limited by a lack of exhibition space for the important historic documents which the National Archives holds in its collection. </p><p>In response to these issues, and as part of the Commemorations programme, the Government agreed to provide funding for the first phase in a capital development plan at the National Archives.  I was delighted to be in a position to make &euro;8m available for the purposes of this capital development, which will shortly go to tender, and construction is expected to start in 2016.  This development will address many of the longstanding issues with the National Archives headquarters.</p></reply>
