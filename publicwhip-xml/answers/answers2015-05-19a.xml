At that session, Ireland made a statement characterising the situation as follows: &quot;Ireland condemns both the firing of missiles from Gaza into Israel, by Hamas and other militant groups, and the killing of hundreds of civilians in military attacks by Israel on targets in Gaza which fail to respect the requirement under international law for any military action to be proportionate and discriminate. <i>It is clear to us that neither side is paying adequate regard to the cost of their actions on innocent civilians</i>.&quot;The statement continued: &quot;Ireland fully accepts that the Government of Israel has the right to defend its people, but this right does not negate the rights of others.  Any use of military force in self defence must be in accordance with international humanitarian law, and in particular must be both discriminate and proportionate. <i>In view of the casualty figures, we are not convinced this has been the case</i>.&quot;</p><p>The recent report by <i>Breaking the Silence</i>supports the assessment which we delivered at the time. <i>Breaking the Silence</i>is an important and internationally highly regarded organisation, with which my Department has frequent contact, and through which Israeli soldiers themselves speak out courageously about troubling aspects of the use of force.</p><p>The testimonies in the report seem to corroborate the picture of how it was that such dreadful level of civilian casualties occurred during the fighting.  At the heart of the international rules regulating the use of force is the need to distinguish, at all times, between civilians and combatants and to ensure the proportionality of any activity aimed at a military objective, so as to minimise civilian casualties.  Political leaders must accept responsibility for ordering military action on a scale that makes widespread, disproportionate civilian suffering unavoidable.</p><p>The Commission of Inquiry set up by the Human Rights Council, into the events of the Gaza conflict, is expected to submit its report to the HRC at the June session.</p><p>Finally, it is essential also, in any consideration of the terrible events in Gaza last summer, to stress again, as Ireland did in our statement to the Human Rights Council, that &quot;the firing of missiles against Israeli civilian targets is without doubt contrary to international law.&quot;</p></reply>

We are very concerned about the situation, both at the events of the weekend of 9<sup>th</sup>and 10<sup>th</sup>May, and the wider political instability facing the country.  Ministers agreed to monitor the situation closely, and the High Representative indicated that the matter will be discussed again by the Council in the near future.</p><p>The protracted crisis in Macedonia was highlighted by the violent clashes which occurred ten days ago (9-10 May) during a police operation against an alleged terrorist group.  Kumanovo, where these appalling events occurred, is close to Macedonia&rsquo;s border with Kosovo and Serbia.  During the two-day shoot-out, 22 people were killed, and some 40 were injured.  I extend my condolences to the families of all those who died.</p><p>In the immediate aftermath of these events, EU Commissioner Hahn issued a statement calling on &lsquo;the authorities and all political and community leaders to co-operate, to restore calm and fully investigate the events in an objective and transparent manner&rsquo;.  I fully support that call.  In the interests of the country and the stability of the region as a whole, I urge all parties to exercise restraint and avoid any further escalation of violence. </p><p>This incident took place against a backdrop of wider political instability, which has been of concern for some time.  The difficulties caused by the ongoing boycott of Parliament by the opposition since late 2012 were further compounded by the recent wire-tapping scandal, with the opposition accusing the main government party of engaging in an illegal surveillance programme of over 20,000 people.  Ireland supports calls for a prompt and rigorous investigation into all allegations of wrongdoing, with full respect for the principles of due process and freedom of expression.</p><p>Last month, the EU General Affairs Council expressed grave concern regarding the deteriorating situation in the country and urged all sides to focus on finding solutions to the ongoing political crisis. </p><p>We welcome all efforts to redress the situation and restore stability.  We believe that continued EU engagement is even more necessary than ever in view of the events in Kumanovo.  </p><p>It is important to continue work to restore trust in the institutions of Macedonia in order to avoid further instability, and we welcome all efforts in this regard, including those of the European Parliament, which has been facilitating talks between the government and opposition parties.  I hope that the talks in recent days between the four largest political parties in Macedonia can find a way out of the current political crisis.</p></reply>

Irrespective of any views regarding the fairness or appropriateness of any arrest abroad, the reality is that where an Irish citizen is charged with an offence under the law of a foreign country, it is the foreign law that applies and it is the relevant foreign court which decides matters such as bail and release.  The decision to release this person will be a decision that is made solely by the Egyptian authorities.</p><p>The considered approach and sustained action that I and my officials have taken in this case has been to further these objectives, and most importantly to avoid any action that could be counterproductive or detrimental to this citizen&rsquo;s best interests.</p><p>Given that the trial is under way, the Irish Government must exercise restraint in its public comment. This is entirely consistent with our approach in other consular cases, in line with our clear objectives in this case and what we firmly believe to be in the citizen&rsquo;s best interests and to be most likely to contribute to a positive outcome for him. </p><p>Our Embassy in Cairo undertook a further consular visit to the individual on 19 May.  Separately officials in my Department discussed the case with the Egyptian Ambassador on 20 May.  My Department will remain in ongoing contact with the Egyptian authorities and will continue to provide consular support in the run up to the next scheduled hearing on 3 June, and to take all appropriate action that is in this citizen&rsquo;s best interests.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-19a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051900054#WRA01700"><p>This is a repeat of my reply to Question No.  8 (19497/15).  The commitment of Ireland to the promotion and protection of human rights is an underlying principle of Ireland's foreign policy and is a priority for the Government.  Ireland is currently a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council and we pursue our human rights priorities in many international fora.  Ireland is a firm supporter of the European Court of Human Rights and the European Convention of Human Rights system and liaises regularly with the UK in relation to the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers' supervision of states' implementation of Court judgments.   </p>  <p>  I should note clearly at the outset there is not at this time any legislation before the British Parliament at Westminster to repeal the 1998 UK Human Rights Act.  Indeed the new British Government has not yet published its legislative programme for this parliamentary term, although it is expected to do so later this month.  In the absence of any detailed proposal it is difficult to speculate on potential consequences.  Obviously were any proposal to be made it would have to be carefully analysed.</p>  <p>  On the broad question of human rights and the Good Friday Agreement, the views of the Government are clear and unchanged.  The protection of human rights in Northern Ireland law, predicated on the European Convention of Human Rights, is one of the key principles underpinning the Agreement.  As a guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government takes very seriously its responsibility to safeguard its institutions and principles.  The fundamental role of human rights in guaranteeing peace and stability in Northern Ireland cannot be taken for granted and must be fully respected.  The Good Friday Agreement is clear that there is an obligation to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into Northern Ireland law and this is an ongoing obligation.</p>  <p>  Placing human rights at the heart of the peace process in Northern Ireland has helped to ensure the participation and trust of all communities.  A shared emphasis on human rights and all that this implies is part of what makes the peace process credible and effective.  The Government will work closely with the UK Government and with the power-sharing Executive in Belfast to ensure that the protection of human rights remains at the heart of civic life, politics and ongoing societal change in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  We will follow closely all developments in this regard.  I plan to raise this matter with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland when I next meet with her.</p></reply>

In March I co-signed a letter with 15 other EU Foreign Ministers urging the High Representative to push this proposal forward again, and following yesterday&rsquo;s discussion at the Foreign Affairs Council I am confident of early progress on this issue.</p><p>In 2014, Ireland and many other EU members published advice warning citizens against investing in settlements.</p></reply>

Solutions must be found jointly to address a crisis on this scale and to prevent further loss of life.</p>  <p>  The EU High Representative recently visited the Headquarters of the United Nations in New York to discuss aspects of the EU's response to the crisis, including the possibility of a CSDP operation.  In her address to the Security Council, the High Representative made clear that the priority must be to prevent the loss of lives at sea and that this requires a comprehensive approach which must be undertaken in close partnership with countries in the region, with regional organisations, the wider international community and in particular with the UN Security Council.  She recalled the EU's firm intention "to always respect international law, international humanitarian law and human rights".  While reference was made to ongoing preparations for a possible naval operation in the framework of the CSDP, no request was made to the UN Security Council to sanction military action.   </p>  <p>  On 20 April, I attended a joint meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs and Justice and Home Affairs Councils to discuss migration issues, and in particular the situation in the Mediterranean.  At that meeting, Minister Frances Fitzgerald and I, together with our EU partners, confirmed our strong commitment to act to prevent recurrence of such tragedies.  We agreed that work would be taken forward along three strands: reinforcing Frontex activities to save lives at sea, a fairer sharing of responsibilities regarding resettlement and relocation projects within the EU and a range of options to combat organized crime networks and human traffickers.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach attended a special meeting of the European Council on 23 April at which Heads of State and Government agreed that the immediate priority is to prevent more people from dying at sea.  They undertook to use all tools at the EU's disposal and to work with countries of origin and transit of migrants to tackle the root causes of the current human emergency.</p>  <p>  A comprehensive range of commitments were agreed under four broad headings: strengthening the EU&rsquo;s presence at sea, countering traffickers in accordance with international law, preventing illegal migration flows and reinforcing internal solidarity and responsibility.</p>  <p>  This comprehensive strategy included a commitment to undertake systematic efforts to identify, capture and destroy vessels before they are used by traffickers, who exploit vulnerable people for profit and put their lives at risk.  The Council invited High Representative Mogherini to begin preparations for a possible EU CSDP operation to this effect.</p>  <p>  At the Foreign Affairs Council which I attended yesterday, EU Foreign Ministers adopted a Council Decision to establish a European Union military operation in the Southern Central Mediterranean.  The Mission will be called EUNAVFOR MED and will implement its mandate in several phases.  The first phase will focus on the detection and monitoring of migration networks through information gathering and patrolling on the high seas and in accordance with international law.  A second phase will involve the boarding, search seizure and diversion of vessels of human traffickers who drive this trade in human misery and exploit people for profit.  A third phase provides for taking measures against the vessels including through disposing of them or rendering them inoperable.</p>  <p>  The Political and Security Committee, acting under the responsibility of the Council of Ministers, will decide on when to make the transition between the different phases, taking into account any applicable UN Security Council Resolution and consent by the coastal states concerned.</p>  <p>  In discussions to date Ireland has insisted that the EUNAVFOR MED operation should be carried out in full accordance with international law.   We have also placed particular emphasis on ensuring that any vessels assigned to the CSDP operation will be ready and equipped to perform Search and Rescue tasks as necessary.</p>  <p>  Separately, in line with the Taoiseach's commitment at the European Council, the Government has despatched a naval service vessel and crew to assist in humanitarian search and rescue tasks in the Mediterranean.</p></reply>

This includes tackling the root causes through continued provision of development assistance as well as supporting conflict resolution and capacity building in source countries in sub-Saharan Africa; preventing further loss of life at sea by countering the criminal activities of smugglers who drive this trade in human misery and exploit vulnerable people for profit; as well as performing search and rescue tasks as necessary.

The recent steps taken by the United States are intended to impose financial and travel restrictions on seven named individuals in leadership positions in Venezuela whom the United States has identified as being involved in human rights violations.  The accompanying Executive Order signed by President Obama provides the legal basis for the sanctions in accordance with US law. </p>  <p>  The measures invoked by the United States have given rise to diplomatic tensions between the US and Venezuela and have been commented on widely.  I am pleased that the US has advised that the measures in question are not directed against the Venezuelan people as a whole, only against the named individuals.  Official sources have clarified that the US does not consider Venezuela to be a threat to its national security and Venezuela is not listed by the US State Department as a state sponsor of terrorism.  President Obama and President Maduro discussed their countries' bilateral relations at the Summit of the Americas in Panama on 10 April in what was described as a candid, serious and frank manner.  Since then, a team from the US State Department has returned to Caracas, at President Maduro&rsquo;s invitation, for official discussions.   </p>  <p>  I am following the situation in Venezuela closely and with concern.  Increasing internal tensions, political polarisation, and a severe economic crisis have led to serious shortages in medical supplies and daily goods.  I am concerned that a severe humanitarian crisis may develop if the situation is not resolved soon.  The deaths, casualties and detentions arising from the unrest in Venezuela require full, impartial investigation in accordance with due legal process.  The apparently high levels of impunity in the case of serious crimes are a matter of further concern.</p>  <p>  I share the view expressed by EU High Representative Mogherini, and by Venezuela&rsquo;s regional partners, that the government there must work with all parties and with civil society to overcome the difficult situation in the country.  I encourage all sides to enter into inclusive and open negotiations to meet the legitimate concerns of the people of Venezuela.  I remain of the view that the best hope for progress is an inclusive dialogue to address the challenges facing the country, fully respecting the democratic rights of people on all sides. </p>  <p>  I welcome the recent report that Venezuela&rsquo;s National Electoral Commission have confirmed that legislative elections will be held by the end of the current year.  It is essential that the elections, and the campaign preceding it, be held in a manner that is fully free and fair and in accordance with international standards.</p></reply>

This Statement identifies certain issues which give grounds for serious concern, including the lack of genuine choice for voters between political alternatives.  The Statement also notes that President Nazarbayev and his political party dominate politics in Kazakhstan and the Statement expresses concern that there is a lack of credible opposition, with several prominent critics of the government either imprisoned or living in exile.   At the UN Human Rights Council last October, Ireland spoke at the Universal Periodic Review of Kazakhstan and expressed the hope that Kazakhstan would receive a visit from Mr. Maina Kiai, the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association.</p>  <p>  We welcome the fact that this visit took place in January and we look forward to discussing the Special Rapporteur&rsquo;s report of his visit next month at the Human Rights Council.

In some situations of protracted conflict where Ireland has limited ability to affect real change on the ground, we focus on the humanitarian relief effort to alleviate suffering, in those areas where we can make a difference.</p>  <p>  I believe that the Security Council must be better equipped to respond to the many security crises that confront us.  Ireland has taken a lead role in calling for Security Council reform, arguing for a more representative Council, improving its working methods and reform of the veto.  Such reforms would better equip the Council to deal with conflicts such as those in Syria and Libya.   </p>  <p>  While the immediate prospects for a political resolution in Syria remain bleak, it is incumbent on all in the international community to support the new UN Special Envoy, Steffan di Mistura, in his efforts to progress a solution based on the Geneva principles which provide for transition to a new, agreed form of government within Syria.  It also remains important that all regional stakeholders who are in a position to exert influence are fully engaged in UN-led peace efforts.  Ireland continues to support a referral by the UN Security Council of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court, and of the need for accountability for the multiple war crimes committed during the conflict.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been strongly supportive of the efforts of the UN to facilitate an inclusive talks process aimed at reaching a political solution to the Libyan crisis.  Libya is a country which, since the outbreak of violence last year, has been sorely lacking in the rule of law.  The vacuum of effective state authority which has accompanied Libya&rsquo;s descent toward civil war in recent times has been cruelly exploited by terrorist groups including groups affiliated with ISIS.  I would restate my hope that the progress made in the UN brokered talks on Libya heretofore can soon be translated into an agreement which can guarantee a better future for the people of Libya.</p>  <p>  It is my hope that in the immediate to short term progress can be made on resolving these conflicts and the many other conflicts that confront us.  In the medium term I hope that the ongoing intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform will bear fruit and better equip the UN Security Council to respond to future crises.</p></reply>

In the case of Argentina, where a minority of creditors have withheld their agreement to a proposed restructuring, a particularly bitter dispute has developed involving adjudication by a United States Court.  We greatly regret that it has not proved possible to resolve this dispute thus far.</p>  <p>  Ireland attaches considerable importance to the resolution of sovereign debt issues and, in common with our EU Partners, supports the recent and ongoing analytical work by the IMF on sovereign debt restructuring.  We recognise the importance of an appropriate international agreement, built upon a market-based voluntary contractual approach regarding sovereign debt restructuring, taking account also of  the significant economic, social and financial issues, including those relating to activities by so-called &ldquo;vulture funds&rdquo;, which this entails.    </p>  <p>  We support efforts to resolve global debt issues through dialogue, in the most appropriate fora and using the most appropriate and effective mechanisms, to best support those countries most seriously affected. </p>  <p>  I addressed the issue of debt restructuring processes in my reply to a Question on 6 May.  As I indicated then, Ireland is actively engaged in ongoing global processes to address the issue of sovereign debt restructuring.  Work being undertaken at a number of levels, including in the IMF and at the Third International Conference on Financing for Development to be held in Addis Ababa in July this year, offers the means for meaningful dialogue on the matter. </p>  <p>  In partnership with our EU colleagues, we are working for the success of the Addis conference, which is central to the ongoing negotiations on a new framework for global development to follow on from the Millennium Development Goals.  These major international negotiations at the UN are being co-chaired by Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representative to the UN, with Kenya.</p></reply>

In terms of the eurozone as a whole and wider implications, the Department of Finance&rsquo;s Stability Programme Update of 6 May 2015 states "While there has been no significant contagion to date, financial stress has the potential to re-emerge with the uncertainty surrounding developments in Greece.  The risks of a return to global financial market turbulence could also possibly increase". </p>  <p>  Regarding the debate around the UK&rsquo;s membership of the EU, that is an issue with which I am very closely engaged.  Following his re-election earlier this month, Prime Minister Cameron has reiterated his commitment to holding a referendum on the country's EU membership by 2017.  </p>  <p>  Any such vote would, of course, be a matter for the UK people to decide.  That said, my Government colleagues and I have been clear in voicing our view that joint British-Irish membership has been hugely beneficial to our country and our relationship with the UK.  The important role the EU has played in the context of Northern Ireland should also not be forgotten, as the Taoiseach emphasised recently in a speech in Belfast.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I am also very conscious of the contribution of the UK in terms of the EU's work in the foreign policy and development aid spheres.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s unique relationship with the UK &ndash; in economic, social, cultural and historical terms &ndash; means we have a deep interest in the outcome of this debate about that country&rsquo;s future in Europe.  We also value the contribution the UK has made to the EU during the four decades we have been members together and we share a similar approach on many key policy areas.  Given the importance we attach to their ongoing membership, a key priority will be ensuring that our UK partners remain fully aware of the potential consequences for Ireland and Irish-British links of any fundamental change in the nature of their membership of the EU.</p>  <p>  I have addressed many of these points directly with Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond.  I have also written to him following his recent re-appointment and will remain in close contact with him in the time ahead. </p></reply>

At least 66 people were killed in a further strong earthquake on 12 May.</p>  <p>  On 27 April, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and I announced initial assistance of up to &euro;1 million in Irish Aid funding for life-saving assistance for affected communities in Nepal.  This included food, shelter, water, hygiene and basic medical supplies for affected communities.  The funding has been provided to Irish NGOs who are working with partners on the ground in Nepal and through Ireland's Rapid Response Initiative.    </p>  <p>  We have airlifted 63 tonnes of life-saving humanitarian supplies which are most needed in this crisis, including tents, blankets, and tarpaulins, and water and sanitation equipment.</p>  <p>  Irish Aid is now arranging further airlifts of 50 tonnes of supplies in the coming days.  These items are being directed to our NGO partners, Concern, Goal and Christian Aid, who are assisting communities in the worst-affected areas.  This will bring Ireland's assistance following the disaster to over &euro;1.5 million.  A highly-skilled member of Ireland's Rapid Response Corps was also deployed to Kathmandu on 1 May to assist UNICEF in the water and sanitation area.</p>  <p>  My officials will continue to work with our UN, NGO and Red Cross partners in Nepal on this tragic humanitarian situation, and to review what further assistance Ireland can provide for the people most seriously affected.</p></reply>

Already this year more than 1,800 people are known to have drowned attempting the crossing to Europe, compared to just over 400 over the same period in 2014.  It is essential that the European Union play its part in tackling this humanitarian challenge, in all its dimensions.</p>  <p>  The Foreign Affairs Council, which I attended in Brussels on 20 April, focused on the situation, including in an emergency joint meeting with the Justice and Home Affairs Council.  The meetings took place just after the tragedy off Lampedusa in which over 800 people died.  The Council addressed the crisis again yesterday, 18 May, following up on the Special Meeting of the European Council which the Taoiseach attended on 23 April, and adopted a Council Decision to establish a European Union military operation in the Southern Central Mediterranean.  The Mission will be called EUNAVFOR MED and will implement its mandate in several phases.  In discussions to date Ireland has insisted that the EUNAVFOR MED operation should be carried out in full accordance with international law.   </p>  <p>  Given the origins of this crisis, it is clear that there needs to be an immediate response at sea, to which Ireland is contributing directly by providing a naval vessel to participate in search and rescue operations.  However we also need to respond in the wider region by addressing root causes.  Political solutions are essential.  In the meantime, there is a huge need for increased humanitarian assistance, which Ireland is providing.  In recent weeks, we have provided funding of &euro;1 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross for its work with migrants in Libya.</p>  <p>  More broadly, Ireland's support for people affected by the Syrian crisis will total &euro;41 million for the four years to the end of 2015.  We have also provided almost &euro;36 million in humanitarian funding to Somalia since 2008.  To date in 2015, &euro;1 million has been approved for the UN's Common Humanitarian Fund in Somalia, with a further &euro;1.7 million to be provided to our NGO partners for their lifesaving work on the ground.</p>  <p>  We are continuing to review the assistance which Ireland can provide in terms of the immediate humanitarian effort and long-term development needs.</p></reply>

The European Council in June 2014 acknowledged that the UK&rsquo;s concerns need to be addressed.</p>  <p>  The new British Government is now committed to holding a referendum on the UK&rsquo;s membership of the Union before the end of 2017. Our hope is that the British people will vote to remain in the European Union.</p>  <p>  The EU is stronger with the UK as a fully committed member. Furthermore, as I have said before on several occasions, joint Irish-British membership of the EU has played an instrumental role in bringing our economies, peoples, and countries closer together. It has also played a significant part in supporting the peace process in Northern Ireland. A UK withdrawal from the EU would therefore be harmful to our interests and the strong relationship between our two Governments.</p>  <p>  The challenge now is for the British Government to work together with all Member States and the EU institutions to help find a consensual basis for continued British membership of the EU. This is in everyone&rsquo;s interests, including those of the EU itself. It is my intention that Ireland will play an active and constructive role in any negotiation process.</p>  <p>  Much will depend on the detail of the UK&rsquo;s proposals for EU reform and we look forward to soon learning more about what the British Government has in mind. Ireland has made it very clear that we are ready to consider the merits of sensible reform proposals that could improve the functioning of our Union. At the same time, we will be equally clear if we believe a proposal is undesirable or unachievable. We want to avoid any outcome that could undermine or otherwise adversely affect our Union.</p>  <p>  The Government is determined to do all it can to help keep the UK in the EU. But we also recognise that we must be prepared for any scenario.

This situation is long-standing at this stage.  The EEC Equality Directive 79/9 and the subsequent Supreme Court case (Hyland <i>v</i>Minister for Social Welfare, 1989) led to the change in treatment of non-married cohabiting couples in the social welfare code.  The Court ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were not married and cohabiting.  The current treatment of married and cohabiting couples in the welfare system is in line with this judgement.</p><p>The treatment of cohabiting couples for the purposes of taxation is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</p></reply>

In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.</p>  <p>  In September 2013, the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed was published.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral.</p>  <p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.</p>  <p>  The Advisory Group also considered that it would not be appropriate to extend social insurance to the self-employed for short-term illness supports, such as illness benefit. In making this determination the Advisory Group acknowledged that some self-employed people could continue to obtain an income while suffering an illness whereas an employee, experiencing a similar illness, might not.  Furthermore, control difficulties might arise with a self-employed person self-certifying their non-participation in their business. On the other hand, the Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed is warranted for cases related to long term sickness or injuries and recommended that Class S benefits should include the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit for an additional mandatory contribution.</p>  <p>  Any decision to change these provisions in relation to self-employed persons would be a matter for Government to consider in a Budgetary context.</p></reply>
