At that session, Ireland made a statement characterising the situation as follows: &quot;Ireland condemns both the firing of missiles from Gaza into Israel, by Hamas and other militant groups, and the killing of hundreds of civilians in military attacks by Israel on targets in Gaza which fail to respect the requirement under international law for any military action to be proportionate and discriminate. <i>It is clear to us that neither side is paying adequate regard to the cost of their actions on innocent civilians</i>.&quot;The statement continued: &quot;Ireland fully accepts that the Government of Israel has the right to defend its people, but this right does not negate the rights of others.  Any use of military force in self defence must be in accordance with international humanitarian law, and in particular must be both discriminate and proportionate. <i>In view of the casualty figures, we are not convinced this has been the case</i>.&quot;</p><p>The recent report by <i>Breaking the Silence</i>supports the assessment which we delivered at the time. <i>Breaking the Silence</i>is an important and internationally highly regarded organisation, with which my Department has frequent contact, and through which Israeli soldiers themselves speak out courageously about troubling aspects of the use of force.</p><p>The testimonies in the report seem to corroborate the picture of how it was that such dreadful level of civilian casualties occurred during the fighting.  At the heart of the international rules regulating the use of force is the need to distinguish, at all times, between civilians and combatants and to ensure the proportionality of any activity aimed at a military objective, so as to minimise civilian casualties.  Political leaders must accept responsibility for ordering military action on a scale that makes widespread, disproportionate civilian suffering unavoidable.</p><p>The Commission of Inquiry set up by the Human Rights Council, into the events of the Gaza conflict, is expected to submit its report to the HRC at the June session.</p><p>Finally, it is essential also, in any consideration of the terrible events in Gaza last summer, to stress again, as Ireland did in our statement to the Human Rights Council, that &quot;the firing of missiles against Israeli civilian targets is without doubt contrary to international law.&quot;</p></reply>

We are very concerned about the situation, both at the events of the weekend of 9<sup>th</sup>and 10<sup>th</sup>May, and the wider political instability facing the country.  Ministers agreed to monitor the situation closely, and the High Representative indicated that the matter will be discussed again by the Council in the near future.</p><p>The protracted crisis in Macedonia was highlighted by the violent clashes which occurred ten days ago (9-10 May) during a police operation against an alleged terrorist group.  Kumanovo, where these appalling events occurred, is close to Macedonia&rsquo;s border with Kosovo and Serbia.  During the two-day shoot-out, 22 people were killed, and some 40 were injured.  I extend my condolences to the families of all those who died.</p><p>In the immediate aftermath of these events, EU Commissioner Hahn issued a statement calling on &lsquo;the authorities and all political and community leaders to co-operate, to restore calm and fully investigate the events in an objective and transparent manner&rsquo;.  I fully support that call.  In the interests of the country and the stability of the region as a whole, I urge all parties to exercise restraint and avoid any further escalation of violence. </p><p>This incident took place against a backdrop of wider political instability, which has been of concern for some time.  The difficulties caused by the ongoing boycott of Parliament by the opposition since late 2012 were further compounded by the recent wire-tapping scandal, with the opposition accusing the main government party of engaging in an illegal surveillance programme of over 20,000 people.  Ireland supports calls for a prompt and rigorous investigation into all allegations of wrongdoing, with full respect for the principles of due process and freedom of expression.</p><p>Last month, the EU General Affairs Council expressed grave concern regarding the deteriorating situation in the country and urged all sides to focus on finding solutions to the ongoing political crisis. </p><p>We welcome all efforts to redress the situation and restore stability.  We believe that continued EU engagement is even more necessary than ever in view of the events in Kumanovo.  </p><p>It is important to continue work to restore trust in the institutions of Macedonia in order to avoid further instability, and we welcome all efforts in this regard, including those of the European Parliament, which has been facilitating talks between the government and opposition parties.  I hope that the talks in recent days between the four largest political parties in Macedonia can find a way out of the current political crisis.</p></reply>

Irrespective of any views regarding the fairness or appropriateness of any arrest abroad, the reality is that where an Irish citizen is charged with an offence under the law of a foreign country, it is the foreign law that applies and it is the relevant foreign court which decides matters such as bail and release.  The decision to release this person will be a decision that is made solely by the Egyptian authorities.</p><p>The considered approach and sustained action that I and my officials have taken in this case has been to further these objectives, and most importantly to avoid any action that could be counterproductive or detrimental to this citizen&rsquo;s best interests.</p><p>Given that the trial is under way, the Irish Government must exercise restraint in its public comment. This is entirely consistent with our approach in other consular cases, in line with our clear objectives in this case and what we firmly believe to be in the citizen&rsquo;s best interests and to be most likely to contribute to a positive outcome for him. </p><p>Our Embassy in Cairo undertook a further consular visit to the individual on 19 May.  Separately officials in my Department discussed the case with the Egyptian Ambassador on 20 May.  My Department will remain in ongoing contact with the Egyptian authorities and will continue to provide consular support in the run up to the next scheduled hearing on 3 June, and to take all appropriate action that is in this citizen&rsquo;s best interests.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-19a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051900054#WRA01700"><p>This is a repeat of my reply to Question No.  8 (19497/15).  The commitment of Ireland to the promotion and protection of human rights is an underlying principle of Ireland's foreign policy and is a priority for the Government.  Ireland is currently a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council and we pursue our human rights priorities in many international fora.  Ireland is a firm supporter of the European Court of Human Rights and the European Convention of Human Rights system and liaises regularly with the UK in relation to the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers' supervision of states' implementation of Court judgments.   </p>  <p>  I should note clearly at the outset there is not at this time any legislation before the British Parliament at Westminster to repeal the 1998 UK Human Rights Act.  Indeed the new British Government has not yet published its legislative programme for this parliamentary term, although it is expected to do so later this month.  In the absence of any detailed proposal it is difficult to speculate on potential consequences.  Obviously were any proposal to be made it would have to be carefully analysed.</p>  <p>  On the broad question of human rights and the Good Friday Agreement, the views of the Government are clear and unchanged.  The protection of human rights in Northern Ireland law, predicated on the European Convention of Human Rights, is one of the key principles underpinning the Agreement.  As a guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government takes very seriously its responsibility to safeguard its institutions and principles.  The fundamental role of human rights in guaranteeing peace and stability in Northern Ireland cannot be taken for granted and must be fully respected.  The Good Friday Agreement is clear that there is an obligation to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into Northern Ireland law and this is an ongoing obligation.</p>  <p>  Placing human rights at the heart of the peace process in Northern Ireland has helped to ensure the participation and trust of all communities.  A shared emphasis on human rights and all that this implies is part of what makes the peace process credible and effective.  The Government will work closely with the UK Government and with the power-sharing Executive in Belfast to ensure that the protection of human rights remains at the heart of civic life, politics and ongoing societal change in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  We will follow closely all developments in this regard.  I plan to raise this matter with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland when I next meet with her.</p></reply>

In March I co-signed a letter with 15 other EU Foreign Ministers urging the High Representative to push this proposal forward again, and following yesterday&rsquo;s discussion at the Foreign Affairs Council I am confident of early progress on this issue.</p><p>In 2014, Ireland and many other EU members published advice warning citizens against investing in settlements.</p></reply>

Solutions must be found jointly to address a crisis on this scale and to prevent further loss of life.</p>  <p>  The EU High Representative recently visited the Headquarters of the United Nations in New York to discuss aspects of the EU's response to the crisis, including the possibility of a CSDP operation.  In her address to the Security Council, the High Representative made clear that the priority must be to prevent the loss of lives at sea and that this requires a comprehensive approach which must be undertaken in close partnership with countries in the region, with regional organisations, the wider international community and in particular with the UN Security Council.  She recalled the EU's firm intention "to always respect international law, international humanitarian law and human rights".  While reference was made to ongoing preparations for a possible naval operation in the framework of the CSDP, no request was made to the UN Security Council to sanction military action.   </p>  <p>  On 20 April, I attended a joint meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs and Justice and Home Affairs Councils to discuss migration issues, and in particular the situation in the Mediterranean.  At that meeting, Minister Frances Fitzgerald and I, together with our EU partners, confirmed our strong commitment to act to prevent recurrence of such tragedies.  We agreed that work would be taken forward along three strands: reinforcing Frontex activities to save lives at sea, a fairer sharing of responsibilities regarding resettlement and relocation projects within the EU and a range of options to combat organized crime networks and human traffickers.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach attended a special meeting of the European Council on 23 April at which Heads of State and Government agreed that the immediate priority is to prevent more people from dying at sea.  They undertook to use all tools at the EU's disposal and to work with countries of origin and transit of migrants to tackle the root causes of the current human emergency.</p>  <p>  A comprehensive range of commitments were agreed under four broad headings: strengthening the EU&rsquo;s presence at sea, countering traffickers in accordance with international law, preventing illegal migration flows and reinforcing internal solidarity and responsibility.</p>  <p>  This comprehensive strategy included a commitment to undertake systematic efforts to identify, capture and destroy vessels before they are used by traffickers, who exploit vulnerable people for profit and put their lives at risk.  The Council invited High Representative Mogherini to begin preparations for a possible EU CSDP operation to this effect.</p>  <p>  At the Foreign Affairs Council which I attended yesterday, EU Foreign Ministers adopted a Council Decision to establish a European Union military operation in the Southern Central Mediterranean.  The Mission will be called EUNAVFOR MED and will implement its mandate in several phases.  The first phase will focus on the detection and monitoring of migration networks through information gathering and patrolling on the high seas and in accordance with international law.  A second phase will involve the boarding, search seizure and diversion of vessels of human traffickers who drive this trade in human misery and exploit people for profit.  A third phase provides for taking measures against the vessels including through disposing of them or rendering them inoperable.</p>  <p>  The Political and Security Committee, acting under the responsibility of the Council of Ministers, will decide on when to make the transition between the different phases, taking into account any applicable UN Security Council Resolution and consent by the coastal states concerned.</p>  <p>  In discussions to date Ireland has insisted that the EUNAVFOR MED operation should be carried out in full accordance with international law.   We have also placed particular emphasis on ensuring that any vessels assigned to the CSDP operation will be ready and equipped to perform Search and Rescue tasks as necessary.</p>  <p>  Separately, in line with the Taoiseach's commitment at the European Council, the Government has despatched a naval service vessel and crew to assist in humanitarian search and rescue tasks in the Mediterranean.</p></reply>

This includes tackling the root causes through continued provision of development assistance as well as supporting conflict resolution and capacity building in source countries in sub-Saharan Africa; preventing further loss of life at sea by countering the criminal activities of smugglers who drive this trade in human misery and exploit vulnerable people for profit; as well as performing search and rescue tasks as necessary.

The recent steps taken by the United States are intended to impose financial and travel restrictions on seven named individuals in leadership positions in Venezuela whom the United States has identified as being involved in human rights violations.  The accompanying Executive Order signed by President Obama provides the legal basis for the sanctions in accordance with US law. </p>  <p>  The measures invoked by the United States have given rise to diplomatic tensions between the US and Venezuela and have been commented on widely.  I am pleased that the US has advised that the measures in question are not directed against the Venezuelan people as a whole, only against the named individuals.  Official sources have clarified that the US does not consider Venezuela to be a threat to its national security and Venezuela is not listed by the US State Department as a state sponsor of terrorism.  President Obama and President Maduro discussed their countries' bilateral relations at the Summit of the Americas in Panama on 10 April in what was described as a candid, serious and frank manner.  Since then, a team from the US State Department has returned to Caracas, at President Maduro&rsquo;s invitation, for official discussions.   </p>  <p>  I am following the situation in Venezuela closely and with concern.  Increasing internal tensions, political polarisation, and a severe economic crisis have led to serious shortages in medical supplies and daily goods.  I am concerned that a severe humanitarian crisis may develop if the situation is not resolved soon.  The deaths, casualties and detentions arising from the unrest in Venezuela require full, impartial investigation in accordance with due legal process.  The apparently high levels of impunity in the case of serious crimes are a matter of further concern.</p>  <p>  I share the view expressed by EU High Representative Mogherini, and by Venezuela&rsquo;s regional partners, that the government there must work with all parties and with civil society to overcome the difficult situation in the country.  I encourage all sides to enter into inclusive and open negotiations to meet the legitimate concerns of the people of Venezuela.  I remain of the view that the best hope for progress is an inclusive dialogue to address the challenges facing the country, fully respecting the democratic rights of people on all sides. </p>  <p>  I welcome the recent report that Venezuela&rsquo;s National Electoral Commission have confirmed that legislative elections will be held by the end of the current year.  It is essential that the elections, and the campaign preceding it, be held in a manner that is fully free and fair and in accordance with international standards.</p></reply>

This Statement identifies certain issues which give grounds for serious concern, including the lack of genuine choice for voters between political alternatives.  The Statement also notes that President Nazarbayev and his political party dominate politics in Kazakhstan and the Statement expresses concern that there is a lack of credible opposition, with several prominent critics of the government either imprisoned or living in exile.   At the UN Human Rights Council last October, Ireland spoke at the Universal Periodic Review of Kazakhstan and expressed the hope that Kazakhstan would receive a visit from Mr. Maina Kiai, the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association.</p>  <p>  We welcome the fact that this visit took place in January and we look forward to discussing the Special Rapporteur&rsquo;s report of his visit next month at the Human Rights Council.

In some situations of protracted conflict where Ireland has limited ability to affect real change on the ground, we focus on the humanitarian relief effort to alleviate suffering, in those areas where we can make a difference.</p>  <p>  I believe that the Security Council must be better equipped to respond to the many security crises that confront us.  Ireland has taken a lead role in calling for Security Council reform, arguing for a more representative Council, improving its working methods and reform of the veto.  Such reforms would better equip the Council to deal with conflicts such as those in Syria and Libya.   </p>  <p>  While the immediate prospects for a political resolution in Syria remain bleak, it is incumbent on all in the international community to support the new UN Special Envoy, Steffan di Mistura, in his efforts to progress a solution based on the Geneva principles which provide for transition to a new, agreed form of government within Syria.  It also remains important that all regional stakeholders who are in a position to exert influence are fully engaged in UN-led peace efforts.  Ireland continues to support a referral by the UN Security Council of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court, and of the need for accountability for the multiple war crimes committed during the conflict.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been strongly supportive of the efforts of the UN to facilitate an inclusive talks process aimed at reaching a political solution to the Libyan crisis.  Libya is a country which, since the outbreak of violence last year, has been sorely lacking in the rule of law.  The vacuum of effective state authority which has accompanied Libya&rsquo;s descent toward civil war in recent times has been cruelly exploited by terrorist groups including groups affiliated with ISIS.  I would restate my hope that the progress made in the UN brokered talks on Libya heretofore can soon be translated into an agreement which can guarantee a better future for the people of Libya.</p>  <p>  It is my hope that in the immediate to short term progress can be made on resolving these conflicts and the many other conflicts that confront us.  In the medium term I hope that the ongoing intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform will bear fruit and better equip the UN Security Council to respond to future crises.</p></reply>

In the case of Argentina, where a minority of creditors have withheld their agreement to a proposed restructuring, a particularly bitter dispute has developed involving adjudication by a United States Court.  We greatly regret that it has not proved possible to resolve this dispute thus far.</p>  <p>  Ireland attaches considerable importance to the resolution of sovereign debt issues and, in common with our EU Partners, supports the recent and ongoing analytical work by the IMF on sovereign debt restructuring.  We recognise the importance of an appropriate international agreement, built upon a market-based voluntary contractual approach regarding sovereign debt restructuring, taking account also of  the significant economic, social and financial issues, including those relating to activities by so-called &ldquo;vulture funds&rdquo;, which this entails.    </p>  <p>  We support efforts to resolve global debt issues through dialogue, in the most appropriate fora and using the most appropriate and effective mechanisms, to best support those countries most seriously affected. </p>  <p>  I addressed the issue of debt restructuring processes in my reply to a Question on 6 May.  As I indicated then, Ireland is actively engaged in ongoing global processes to address the issue of sovereign debt restructuring.  Work being undertaken at a number of levels, including in the IMF and at the Third International Conference on Financing for Development to be held in Addis Ababa in July this year, offers the means for meaningful dialogue on the matter. </p>  <p>  In partnership with our EU colleagues, we are working for the success of the Addis conference, which is central to the ongoing negotiations on a new framework for global development to follow on from the Millennium Development Goals.  These major international negotiations at the UN are being co-chaired by Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representative to the UN, with Kenya.</p></reply>

In terms of the eurozone as a whole and wider implications, the Department of Finance&rsquo;s Stability Programme Update of 6 May 2015 states "While there has been no significant contagion to date, financial stress has the potential to re-emerge with the uncertainty surrounding developments in Greece.  The risks of a return to global financial market turbulence could also possibly increase". </p>  <p>  Regarding the debate around the UK&rsquo;s membership of the EU, that is an issue with which I am very closely engaged.  Following his re-election earlier this month, Prime Minister Cameron has reiterated his commitment to holding a referendum on the country's EU membership by 2017.  </p>  <p>  Any such vote would, of course, be a matter for the UK people to decide.  That said, my Government colleagues and I have been clear in voicing our view that joint British-Irish membership has been hugely beneficial to our country and our relationship with the UK.  The important role the EU has played in the context of Northern Ireland should also not be forgotten, as the Taoiseach emphasised recently in a speech in Belfast.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I am also very conscious of the contribution of the UK in terms of the EU's work in the foreign policy and development aid spheres.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s unique relationship with the UK &ndash; in economic, social, cultural and historical terms &ndash; means we have a deep interest in the outcome of this debate about that country&rsquo;s future in Europe.  We also value the contribution the UK has made to the EU during the four decades we have been members together and we share a similar approach on many key policy areas.  Given the importance we attach to their ongoing membership, a key priority will be ensuring that our UK partners remain fully aware of the potential consequences for Ireland and Irish-British links of any fundamental change in the nature of their membership of the EU.</p>  <p>  I have addressed many of these points directly with Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond.  I have also written to him following his recent re-appointment and will remain in close contact with him in the time ahead. </p></reply>

At least 66 people were killed in a further strong earthquake on 12 May.</p>  <p>  On 27 April, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and I announced initial assistance of up to &euro;1 million in Irish Aid funding for life-saving assistance for affected communities in Nepal.  This included food, shelter, water, hygiene and basic medical supplies for affected communities.  The funding has been provided to Irish NGOs who are working with partners on the ground in Nepal and through Ireland's Rapid Response Initiative.    </p>  <p>  We have airlifted 63 tonnes of life-saving humanitarian supplies which are most needed in this crisis, including tents, blankets, and tarpaulins, and water and sanitation equipment.</p>  <p>  Irish Aid is now arranging further airlifts of 50 tonnes of supplies in the coming days.  These items are being directed to our NGO partners, Concern, Goal and Christian Aid, who are assisting communities in the worst-affected areas.  This will bring Ireland's assistance following the disaster to over &euro;1.5 million.  A highly-skilled member of Ireland's Rapid Response Corps was also deployed to Kathmandu on 1 May to assist UNICEF in the water and sanitation area.</p>  <p>  My officials will continue to work with our UN, NGO and Red Cross partners in Nepal on this tragic humanitarian situation, and to review what further assistance Ireland can provide for the people most seriously affected.</p></reply>

Already this year more than 1,800 people are known to have drowned attempting the crossing to Europe, compared to just over 400 over the same period in 2014.  It is essential that the European Union play its part in tackling this humanitarian challenge, in all its dimensions.</p>  <p>  The Foreign Affairs Council, which I attended in Brussels on 20 April, focused on the situation, including in an emergency joint meeting with the Justice and Home Affairs Council.  The meetings took place just after the tragedy off Lampedusa in which over 800 people died.  The Council addressed the crisis again yesterday, 18 May, following up on the Special Meeting of the European Council which the Taoiseach attended on 23 April, and adopted a Council Decision to establish a European Union military operation in the Southern Central Mediterranean.  The Mission will be called EUNAVFOR MED and will implement its mandate in several phases.  In discussions to date Ireland has insisted that the EUNAVFOR MED operation should be carried out in full accordance with international law.   </p>  <p>  Given the origins of this crisis, it is clear that there needs to be an immediate response at sea, to which Ireland is contributing directly by providing a naval vessel to participate in search and rescue operations.  However we also need to respond in the wider region by addressing root causes.  Political solutions are essential.  In the meantime, there is a huge need for increased humanitarian assistance, which Ireland is providing.  In recent weeks, we have provided funding of &euro;1 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross for its work with migrants in Libya.</p>  <p>  More broadly, Ireland's support for people affected by the Syrian crisis will total &euro;41 million for the four years to the end of 2015.  We have also provided almost &euro;36 million in humanitarian funding to Somalia since 2008.  To date in 2015, &euro;1 million has been approved for the UN's Common Humanitarian Fund in Somalia, with a further &euro;1.7 million to be provided to our NGO partners for their lifesaving work on the ground.</p>  <p>  We are continuing to review the assistance which Ireland can provide in terms of the immediate humanitarian effort and long-term development needs.</p></reply>

The European Council in June 2014 acknowledged that the UK&rsquo;s concerns need to be addressed.</p>  <p>  The new British Government is now committed to holding a referendum on the UK&rsquo;s membership of the Union before the end of 2017. Our hope is that the British people will vote to remain in the European Union.</p>  <p>  The EU is stronger with the UK as a fully committed member. Furthermore, as I have said before on several occasions, joint Irish-British membership of the EU has played an instrumental role in bringing our economies, peoples, and countries closer together. It has also played a significant part in supporting the peace process in Northern Ireland. A UK withdrawal from the EU would therefore be harmful to our interests and the strong relationship between our two Governments.</p>  <p>  The challenge now is for the British Government to work together with all Member States and the EU institutions to help find a consensual basis for continued British membership of the EU. This is in everyone&rsquo;s interests, including those of the EU itself. It is my intention that Ireland will play an active and constructive role in any negotiation process.</p>  <p>  Much will depend on the detail of the UK&rsquo;s proposals for EU reform and we look forward to soon learning more about what the British Government has in mind. Ireland has made it very clear that we are ready to consider the merits of sensible reform proposals that could improve the functioning of our Union. At the same time, we will be equally clear if we believe a proposal is undesirable or unachievable. We want to avoid any outcome that could undermine or otherwise adversely affect our Union.</p>  <p>  The Government is determined to do all it can to help keep the UK in the EU. But we also recognise that we must be prepared for any scenario.

This situation is long-standing at this stage.  The EEC Equality Directive 79/9 and the subsequent Supreme Court case (Hyland <i>v</i>Minister for Social Welfare, 1989) led to the change in treatment of non-married cohabiting couples in the social welfare code.  The Court ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were not married and cohabiting.

In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.</p>  <p>  In September 2013, the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed was published.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral.</p>  <p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.</p>  <p>  The Advisory Group also considered that it would not be appropriate to extend social insurance to the self-employed for short-term illness supports, such as illness benefit. In making this determination the Advisory Group acknowledged that some self-employed people could continue to obtain an income while suffering an illness whereas an employee, experiencing a similar illness, might not.  Furthermore, control difficulties might arise with a self-employed person self-certifying their non-participation in their business. On the other hand, the Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed is warranted for cases related to long term sickness or injuries and recommended that Class S benefits should include the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit for an additional mandatory contribution.</p>  <p>  Any decision to change these provisions in relation to self-employed persons would be a matter for Government to consider in a Budgetary context.</p></reply>

The 2015 Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes of &euro;3.01 billion.</p>  <p>  It is a fundamental qualifying condition of both schemes that a person must be fully unemployed for four in any period of seven consecutive days, so a person working four or more days a week will not qualify.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that a changing labour market has resulted in a move away from the more traditional work patterns, resulting in an increase in the number of persons employed for less than a full week.</p>  <p>  This is an important policy issue for the Department but any changes to the current criteria could have significant cost implications for the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes. In particular any change to jobseeker's benefit criteria would have implications for jobseeker's allowance and a range of other working age schemes.  In this context the cost associated with moving the jobseeker's benefit scheme to an hours-based system, as outlined, are not available.</p>  <p>  The Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare has examined the issue of the interaction of the tax and social welfare systems to determine how the social welfare system can best achieve its goals of supporting persons through periods of involuntary unemployment, while incentivising work and disincentivising welfare dependency.  I am currently considering the report of the Group.</p></reply>

FIS is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependants and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment.  There are over 50,000 families in receipt of FIS, an increase of 70 per cent since 2011.  The estimated spend on FIS this year is approximately &euro;350 million, an increase of &euro;50 on last year. The average FIS payment per family is &euro;118 per week.</p>  <p>  To qualify for FIS, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria.  The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them or is supported by them.  Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.</p>  <p>  The &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; eligibility criterion has been reduced significantly since the introduction of the scheme in 1984, from 30 hours per week to 19 hours per week in 1996. The costs associated with replacing the 38 hour threshold for FIS qualification with a sliding scale system, as outlined, are not available.  However, reducing the &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; requirement would have implications for a range of other working age schemes and would have expenditure implications.  In addition the proposal set out by the Deputy is significantly more complex than the present scheme and could require additional resources to administer.</p>  <p>  Currently, persons subject to the contingency of unemployment may be supported under the jobseeker's schemes.  Under jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance a person may, subject to scheme criteria, work for up to three days and continue to receive support under the schemes.</p></reply>

There are approximately 69,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;298 million for in 2015.</p>  <p>  The Department recently published a review of the maximum rent limits, &ldquo;Maximum Rent Limit Analysis and Findings&rdquo; and it is available on www.welfare.ie.  The review finds that increasing rent limits at this time could potentially add to further rental inflation in an already distressed market, affecting not alone rent supplement recipients, but lower-income workers and students.  Between the rent supplement scheme and the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) administered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the State accounts for a third of the private rented market.  The State is therefore a very significant player in the sector which has a responsibility not alone to rent supplement recipients but also to the market as a whole, including all those in private accommodation.</p>  <p>  In light of the review&rsquo;s findings, the Department will instead continue to allow for flexibility in assessing customers&rsquo; accommodation needs through the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework.  Under this approach, each tenant&rsquo;s circumstances throughout the country, including those in the Meath area, are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents can be increased above prescribed limits as appropriate.  I am satisfied that this is the appropriate response at this time which has assisted in excess of 1,500 rent supplement recipients throughout the country to retain their rented accommodation.</p>  <p>  The review clearly points out that the main cause of difficulty for persons renting or seeking to rent at this time is the much reduced availability of affordable private rented accommodation, which is representative of the position in Meath.  The issue of supply is being addressed by Government through the Construction 2020 Strategy and the Social Housing Strategy.  My Government colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, is also considering a number of policy options in relation to achieving greater rent certainty.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am keeping this matter under close review to ensure that the appropriate supports continue to be provided for rent supplement recipients.</p></reply>

In line with the commitments in the Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy 2014&ndash;2018, the Department aims to minimise risks of fraud and eliminate incorrect payments.  This involves appropriate checks at the point of claiming, strengthened by systematic reviews of claims in payment and verification that the conditions for entitlement continue to be met.  </p><p>Control activity is focused on prevention of fraud and error at claim application stage.  Savings made from the prevention of fraud and error at application stage cannot be estimated as the claim will not go into payment.  Reviews of claims in payment are also an essential element of the control programme of the Department. Control savings are used as a performance indicator for year-on-year control review activity and represent an estimate of the value of prevented future expenditure that would have been incurred had this control work not been carried out.  </p><p>Control savings are calculated by applying validated multipliers to the difference in the rate of payment before and after the control activity.  The multipliers for Child Benefit (CB) are as follows: <table><tr><th>CHILD BENEFIT (applies to monthly rate of payment)</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Termination</td><td>X 34</td></tr><tr><td>Reduction in Payment</td><td>X 12</td></tr></table></p><p>Multipliers used in assessing control savings estimate the total future savings to the Department of a revocation or reduction resulting from a control action.  The multiplier used is based on the average amount of time the person who ceases to claim will remain off the books before returning.</p><p>Overpayments, on the other hand, arise in relation to past events where a Deciding Officer has sufficient evidence that a person has been paid an amount in excess of their entitlement for a given period, either through payment at a rate above that which they should receive or where they are paid beyond the relevant date.</p><p>The following table provides details regarding CB control activity and overpayments:<table><tr><th>Child Benefit</th><th>Control Reviews</th><th>Control Savings Recorded - &euro;M</th><th>No. of Overpayments Assessed</th><th>Value of Overpayments Assessed - &euro;M</th><th>Recoveries&euro;M</th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>421,144</td><td>&euro;83.2</td><td>3,723</td><td>&euro;4.9</td><td>&euro;3.9</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>375,332</td><td>&euro;76.6</td><td>4,269</td><td>&euro;5.5</td><td>&euro;4.2</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>409,917</td><td>&euro;72.7</td><td>Not Available</td><td>Not Available</td><td>Not Available</td></tr></table></p><p><i>Note: Overpayment recoveries recorded in any given year can be proper to overpayments relevant to other years.  Overpayments recorded in 2014 form part of the statutory accounts of the Department and are currently the subject of an audit by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</i></p><p>The Department is committed to ensuring that social welfare payments are available to those who are entitled to them.  In this regard, the control programme of the Department is carefully monitored and the various measures are refined to ensure that they remain effective.</p></reply>

At present the tax treatment of tobacco products is provided for in Directive 2011/64/EU (the 'Tobacco Products Tax Directive'), which harmonises the structures and definitions of tobacco products. Ireland has implemented this Directive through Chapter 3 of Part 2 of the Finance Act 2005.  The Tobacco Products Tax Directive does not, at this time, explicitly provide for heated tobacco products, given these products are relatively new.</p>  <p>  I am aware that products such as these products have been placed on the market in continental Europe, and that the tax authorities of our fellow Member States have taken different approaches towards taxing such products, reflecting their view of which product definition such products fall under.  These products have yet to enter the Irish market, and as such have not been presented to the Revenue Commissioners by importers for the payment of duty.  While a determination has yet to be made by the Commissioners as to which product definition such products would fall under in our excise law, I am confident that the Tobacco Products Tax Directive and our own legislation will allow these products to be subject to a duty of excise.</p>  <p>  Overall, I am of the opinion that the best way forward in dealing with this matter is at a EU level by providing a definition of heated tobacco products in the Tobacco Products Tax Directive.  I can inform the Deputy that the matter has been raised at EU level and officials from the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners are currently engaged in technical discussions with our European partners to examine the best possible way forward with regards to a harmonised definitions and tax treatment of these types of tobacco products.</p></reply>

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and maintain revenue to reduce the budget deficit. It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced, and is applied at a low rate on a wide base.</p>  <p>  The USC, like the Income Levy before it, does not apply to social welfare payments or payments of a similar nature.  However, occupational pensions are liable to the USC, if the payment is greater than the exemption threshold, which from 1 January 2015 is &euro;12,012 per annum.  At that income point the application of the USC would result in a charge of &euro;180 approximately per annum.</p>  <p>  As you are aware, delivering on a commitment in the Programme for Government, the USC was reviewed by my Department in the lead up to Budget 2012.  The report is available at my Department's website at www.finance.gov.ie.  The issue of USC applying to occupational pensions of retired public servants who entered the public service before April 1995 was examined as part of that review.  However, the Government decided not to exempt the occupational pensions of these individuals from the USC charge as it would be very costly and difficult to achieve, and it would involve all income earners with the equivalent income benefiting from the exemption.  In addition, it would also undermine the principle of the USC being applied to income with few exceptions.</p>  <p>  However, as a result of the review of the USC, the Government decided in Budget 2012 to increase the entry point to the Universal Social Charge from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum.  It is estimated that this removed almost 330,000 individuals from the charge.  An estimated further 87,000 individuals have been exempted from the charge as a result of the extended exemption threshold introduced in Budget 2015.  This latter extension equalises the position for single individuals whose sole source of income is the State Contributory Pension with Public Service pensioners whose pension is at an equivalent level.  Furthermore, I intend to continue to reform the tax system in this manner in future budgets, subject to having the required fiscal space.  I would point out however, that the changes to the income tax system included in Budget 2015 mean that all those who paid Income Tax and/or USC in 2014, including pensioners, will see a reduction in their tax bill this year where income is equal.</p>  <p>  Any review of public service pay is primarily a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Notwithstanding this and the foregoing, I can assure you that the points raised have been noted and will be considered in future policy decisions on the USC.</p></reply>

The tax is charged on the amount gifted to, or inherited by, the beneficiary of the gift or inheritance.</p><p>For the purposes of CAT, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary), determines the maximum life-time tax-free threshold known as the &quot;Group threshold&quot; below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.</p><p>There are, in all, three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer.</p><p><b>The Group A tax free threshold of &euro;225,000, </b>applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer.  Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.</p><p><b>The Group B tax free threshold of &euro;30,150, </b>applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.</p><p><b>The Group C tax free threshold &euro;15,075, </b>applies in all other cases.</p><p>Where a person receives gifts or inheritances in excess of their relevant tax free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax free threshold.  In recent years these thresholds were reduced and the rate has been increased in order to maintain the yield from capital taxes in the face of falling asset prices and as part of our fiscal consolidation efforts.  In addition, taxes on capital are less harmful from an economic perspective than taxes on employment.</p><p>I am aware that the property market continues to improve, with positive developments which had been restricted to the Dublin area now manifesting in other areas of the country, though not to the same extent in terms of price rises, and I recognise that this has a bearing on taxation of the inheritance and gifting of property with respect to CAT thresholds.  In this light, I will be keeping Capital Acquisitions Tax thresholds and other aspects of the tax under review, particularly in the context of preparations for Budget 2016 and the consequent Finance Bill. I do not, however, have any plans to modify an individual's threshold based on the number of his or her siblings.</p></reply>

In this regard, VAT in Ireland is not purely treated as a revenue collecting mechanism.  Ireland's VAT rate structure has clear social (e.g. 0% on food etc.) and economic (e.g. 9% on tourism related activities) goals which are in line with the EU VAT Directive.</p><p>The cost associated with abolishing exemptions and reduced rates of VAT would depend on the level at which the standard rate is fixed.  At present the standard rate is 23%. However, it would in theory be possible to radically reduce the VAT policy gap on a revenue neutral basis - e.g. the Tax Strategy Group paper on VAT prepared in advance of Budget 2015 (available on the Department's website at ) estimated that a standard rate of 15% (the lowest level permitted under the VAT Directive) could be achieved on a broadly revenue neutral basis by merging the zero, 9%, 13.5% and 23% rates.  However, this would involve applying VAT to food, children's clothes and oral medicines as well as raising the VAT rate on a range of other areas of consumption such as fuel and hospitality services.</p><p>The cost of maintaining zero and reduced rates in the context of leaving the standard rate at its current level of 23% is set out below.  This is a straight line calculation and takes no account of changes to spending behaviours.<table><tr><th>Rates</th><th>Amount</th></tr><tr><td>Zero rate items </td><td>&euro;2.1 billion</td></tr><tr><td>9%</td><td>&euro;1.8 billion</td></tr><tr><td>13.5% </td><td>&euro;2.7 billion</td></tr></table></p><p>These figures are the most recent figures provided by the Revenue Commissioners which are available in its online ready reckoner (available at ). </p><p>Costings related to exempted services such as transport, education and charities are not available.</p></reply>

The residential element of the relief was initially targeted at Georgian houses but the scope was later extended to buildings which were constructed before 1915 for use as a dwelling, following an independent ex ante cost benefit analysis by Indecon Economic Consultants.</p>  <p>  Previous owner occupier and section 23 type schemes had a maximum floor area limit of 125 square metres.  The Living City Initiative limit of 210 square metres is larger than previous schemes to take account of the fact that some pre-1915 houses tended to be constructed on a grander scale.</p>  <p>  In addition, it is important to note that "house" includes any building or part of a building used or suitable for use as a dwelling.  Many of the larger houses in the Special Regeneration Areas have been split into units, for example, there may be a commercial premises on the ground floor with a residential premises on the upper floors, or a house may be divided into a number of residential apartments.  In that case, expenditure incurred on the unit that the owner occupies as his sole or main residence should qualify for relief where the necessary conditions are met.</p>  <p>  As the scheme rolls out over the coming months, all aspects of it will be kept under review.  It is important to note that I do not see this as a wide-spread initiative, as it is targeted at regenerating those areas which are most in need of attention.</p></reply>

Up until 2018 however, tax relief continues to be available for interest paid on all qualifying home loans taken out on or after 1 January 2004 and on or before 31 December 2012, regardless of whether the individuals concerned are first-time buyers or non-first-time buyers.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to helping address the particular problems faced by those that bought homes at the height of the property boom between 2004 and 2008.  In this regard, in Budget 2012, I fulfilled the commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the rate of mortgage interest relief to 30 per cent for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage in that period.  This was the period during which house prices peaked.  This 30% rate will continue to be applicable to these first-time buyers for the remaining years that mortgage interest relief continues to be available.  In the absence of this change the mortgage interest relief available would have gradually reduced to a rate of 15%.</p>  <p>  Single individuals, married couples and civil partners that are first-time buyers, qualify for mortgage interest relief for the first seven years of their mortgage up to a maximum ceiling of &euro;10,000 and &euro;20,000 respectively.  Thereafter relief is restricted to ceilings of &euro;3,000 and &euro;6,000 respectively.</p>  <p>  The system of mortgage interest relief is designed and targeted in such a way that the relief is of greater value in the early years of a qualifying loan where the interest represents a greater proportion of the repayment.  Mortgage interest relief is of lesser value to individuals whose repayments are made up of a higher proportion of principal than interest, as would generally be the case for those who move in to the eighth and subsequent years of their loans.  It is worth noting that the application of the ceilings already work to reduce the relief available in a gradual manner.  In addition, as the amount of interest payable reduces as a mortgage is paid down, the level of mortgage interest relief also reduces in tandem.</p>  <p>  Given the additional relief already available to those that purchased their homes between 2004 and 2008, over and above that available to other qualifying homeowners and given that mortgage interest relief has now lapsed in terms of new qualifying loans, I am not convinced of the merits of revisiting the provisions at this stage.</p></reply>

Significant progress has been made to date in winding up the affairs of IBRC but further work remains.</p><p>A progress update report published in March 2015, which is available on the Department of Finance website, highlights the progress which has been made since the liquidation of IBRC in February 2013 while also highlighting the key tasks remaining in the liquidation.</p><p>The liquidation of IBRC can only be concluded once all assets are realised, all creditor claims have been resolved (including those subject to litigation) and all surplus funds have been distributed to creditors.</p><p>There are a number of challenges given the volume of litigation involving IBRC and the length of time it takes for each case to be heard and determined. IBRC is currently party to over 700 legal cases which are at various stages in the litigation process.</p><p>A number of significant pieces of litigation have been delayed as a result of applications by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions requesting that criminal cases relating to individuals in IBRC take precedence over civil cases.  This has resulted in the civil actions relating to liquidation issues being delayed until 2017/2018.</p><p>In addition, and while this is not expected to prolong the liquidation, the Special Liquidators have also been issued with a Direction to investigate various transactions and to report to me by 31 August 2015.</p></reply>

While the Central Bank has certain protections in place for SMEs, for example the Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises, the Central Bank does not place any requirements on SMEs.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank's risk-based framework for the supervision of regulated firms is proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of a regulated financial services provider while, at the same time, ensuring an adequate level of protection for consumers who avail of the financial service.  In that regard, the most significant firms - those with the ability to have the greatest impact on financial stability and the consumer - receive a high level of supervision.  Conversely, smaller financial service providers that pose a much lower risk are supervised accordingly.</p>  <p>  Other regulatory requirements for this sector are primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  However I can advise the Deputy of the following changes which I have implemented in order to assist small to medium enterprises in lessening the administrative and financial burden.</p>  <p>  Small businesses with a low turnover can opt to be exempt from VAT thereby avoiding the administrative burden that VAT registration entails.  The current thresholds are &euro;37,500 for services and &euro;75,000 for goods, in a 12 month period, these thresholds increased in 2008 from &euro;35,000 and &euro;70,000 for services and goods respectively.  Any increase in the thresholds above the level of inflation would require a derogation from EU VAT law and agreement by all 28 Member States before it could be introduced.</p>  <p>  Businesses with an annual turnover of &euro;2 million or less can opt to account for VAT on a cash receipts basis, where VAT is not required to be paid until payment for the supply is received. </p>  <p>  VAT returns are generally made bi-monthly, but in order to reduce administrative burdens Revenue allow half-yearly filing to taxpayers with an annual VAT liability of under &euro;3,000, and filing three times a year to taxpayers with an annual VAT liability of between &euro;3,001 and &euro;14,400.</p>  <p>  In Finance Act 2014 the special relief reducing the standard rate of Alcohol Products Tax by 50% on beer produced in small independent breweries which produce not more than 20,000 hectolitres per annum was extended to apply to small independent breweries which produce not more than 30,000 hectolitres per annum.</p>  <p>  I would also refer the Deputy to my written reply today to his question regarding the provisions exempting small and medium enterprises from corporation tax and exempting the investors in such enterprises from capital gains tax.</p></reply>

The first &euro;1,270 of gains made by an individual in any year is exempt from CGT.</p><p>A relief from CGT, known as retirement relief, is available where an individual aged 55 or over is disposing of business or agricultural assets.  In order to qualify for the relief, those assets must have been owned and used for business or farming purposes for a period of 10 years prior to the disposal.  Retirement relief has been available since the introduction of CGT in 1975.</p><p>In the case of disposals outside the family, full relief applies where the consideration for the disposal is &euro;750,000 or less.  The threshold is reduced to &euro;500,000 where the person disposing of qualifying assets is aged 66 or over and the disposal takes place on or after 1 January 2014.  Marginal relief applies where the consideration slightly exceeds the relevant thresholds.</p><p>Where the disposal is within the family, for example, a disposal by a parent to a son or daughter, there is no upper limit on the relief except where the person who is disposing of the qualifying assets is aged 66 or over and the disposal takes place on or after 1 January 2014.  In such a case, the relief is capped at &euro;3m.</p><p><b>Capital Acquisitions Tax</b></p><p>Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) is the overall name for both Gift and Inheritance tax.  The tax is charged on the amount gifted to, or inherited by, the beneficiary of the gift or inheritance.</p><p>For the purposes of CAT, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary), determines the maximum life-time tax-free threshold known as the &quot; Group threshold&quot;- below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.</p><p>There are, in all, three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer.</p><p><b>Group A: tax free threshold &euro;225,000</b>applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild, and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer.  Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.</p><p><b>Group B: tax free threshold &euro;30,150 </b>applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.</p><p><b>Group C: tax free threshold &euro;15,075 </b>applies in all other cases.</p><p>Where a gift or inheritance consists of business property (such as land, buildings, plant and machinery), the value of the business may be reduced by 90% for CAT purposes provided certain conditions are met, for example, minimum periods of business usage of the property both before and after the gift or inheritance.  This specific relief from CAT on the transfer of businesses by way of gift or inheritance was introduced in 1994 and is known as CAT Business Relief.</p><p>The introduction of business relief was an acknowledgement by the government of the day that it wished to encourage entrepreneurial activity and also prevent the forced sale of trading entities to pay significant CAT liabilities.</p><p>As stated, business relief reduces the taxable value of qualifying business property by 90% when calculating CAT.</p><p>Therefore, when business relief applies in full, business property with a market value of, say, &euro;1m, would be treated as worth only &euro;100,000 when calculating CAT.  This can have the effect of reducing the effective rate of CAT from 33% to 3.3% on the transfer of a business.  Business relief or CAT agricultural relief may also be availed of in the farming sector</p><p>It would be inappropriate for me to discuss specific potential measures which may be reviewed as part of the Budget process.  However, I am open to the consideration of proposals the Deputy or others may wish to put forward as part of the pre-Budget consultation process.</p></reply>

The relief is granted in respect of the profits of a new trade and chargeable gains on the disposal of any assets used for the purposes of the new trade. The relief is granted by reducing the corporation tax on profits relating to the trade to nil where the total amount of corporation tax payable by the company for an accounting period does not exceed &euro;40,000. Marginal relief is granted on a tapering basis where the total amount of corporation tax liability for the accounting period is between &euro;40,000 and &euro;60,000. </p><p>The qualifying period has been extended in subsequent Finance Acts, and the relief is now available to qualifying companies commencing to trade up to and including 2015.  As part of one of the early extensions of the relief, in Finance Act 2011, the basis on which relief is computed was changed to link the reduction in corporation tax to the amount of employers' PRSI paid in an accounting period, subject to a limit of &euro;5,000 per employee and an aggregate limit of &euro;40,000. The purpose of this change was to better target the relief at companies generating employment. </p><p>Subsequent amendments have also extended the relief to provide that, where a start-up company does not have sufficient profits to claim the relief in a given year, any relief unclaimed in the first three years can be carried forward into future years for use against future corporation tax liabilities.</p><p>The total annual cost of the relief is &euro;6m, and it was due to expire at the end of 2014. However in last year's Finance Bill it was extended to the end of 2015, in order to allow for a review of the operation of this measure to take place in 2015 to ensure that it meets the policy objectives of creating jobs and activity in Ireland and provides value for money for the Irish taxpayer.</p><p>I would also mention that certain small enterprise grants made under section 10(5) of the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta Act, 1979 and section 21(5)(a) (as amended by the Industrial Development (Amendment) Act, 1991) of the Industrial Development Act, 1986 are not liable to corporation tax under TCA, section 223.</p><p><b>Capital Gains Tax </b></p><p>Capital Gains Tax (CGT) is charged at the rate of 33% in respect of gains on the disposal of assets. The first &euro;1,270 of gains made by an individual in any year is exempt from CGT. </p><p>The Finance Act 2014 provides relief from a future CGT liability for entrepreneurs who, on or after 1 January 2014 and on or before 31 December 2018, invest the proceeds of an earlier disposal in respect of which CGT was paid in new business ventures, which are subsequently sold. </p><p>A qualifying enterprise for the purpose of the relief is defined as an enterprise which, at the time of the making of the initial risk finance investment, is a micro, small or medium-sized enterprise, as defined in Article 2 of the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC of 6 May 2003 and which:</p><p>- has not been carrying on any business, trade or profession, or</p><p>-  has been carrying on a trade, business or profession for less than 7 years.  </p><p>The relief is in the form of a tax credit against any capital gains tax liability on the future disposal of chargeable business assets of the qualifying enterprise made more than 3 years after they were acquired. The tax credit will be the<b></b>lower of:</p><p>- the CGT paid on the earlier disposal where all the consideration on the disposal, apart from any CGT paid, is invested in chargeable business assets (or a proportionate amount where less than the full amount is reinvested), and</p><p>- 50 per cent of the CGT payable on the disposal of chargeable business assets.</p><p>Chargeable business assets are assets used wholly for the purposes of a new business carried on by an individual or new ordinary shares issued on or after 1 January 2014 in a qualifying company in which the shareholder is a full-time working director. The assets must have been acquired at a cost of not less than &euro;10,000. In the case of investment through a company, each shareholder must own not less than 15% of the shares in the qualifying company carrying on the new business (or in a holding company which owns 100% of the ordinary share capital of a qualifying company carrying on a new business) and must be a full-time working director in the qualifying company. Assets held as passive investments do not qualify for the relief.</p><p>If the proceeds of a disposal of chargeable business assets are in turn reinvested in another new business, CGT relief can be claimed on the same basis as outlined above. At the time of its introduction, the CGT entrepreneur relief was estimated to cost &euro;20m in a full year.</p><p>I have no plans to introduce full exemptions on the lines of those referred to by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Part of that review included a public consultation process. A report on this review was published on Budget Day and is available on the Budget website.</p><p>One of the options considered in the review was the introduction of a scheme similar to the UK EIS as there is a perception that the UK scheme is far more generous than the EII. However, the level of relief available under the UK scheme of 30% is less than the EII which provides up to 40% relief. The main advantage of the UK scheme appears to be the availability of CGT relief. </p><p>I would point out that I have introduced a scheme for entrepreneurs where CGT liability is deferred if they re-invest qualifying gains made in a company into another company. </p><p>As a result of the review carried out on the EII and SCS, I decided to make some amendments to the schemes. The EII will be amended as follows:</p><p>- The annual company limit is being increased from &euro;2.5 million to &euro;5 million and the lifetime limit from &euro;10 million to &euro;15 million;</p><p>- The minimum holding period for shares is being increased by 1 year to 4 years;</p><p>- Medium-sized companies in non-assisted areas will be included;</p><p>- Internationally traded financial services where certified by Enterprise Ireland will qualify;</p><p>- Hotels, guest houses and self-catering accommodation will remain eligible for a further 3 years; and</p><p>- The operating and managing of nursing homes will be included for 3 years.</p><p>These measures are subject to approval from the European Commission. </p><p>The SCS has been re-branded as &quot;Start-Up Relief for Entrepreneurs&quot; (SURE), which Minister Bruton and I launched last week. The scheme has been simplified and will be advertised and marketed by Local Enterprise Offices.</p></reply>

Dealing with the consumer is credit servicing and the definition of credit servicing is broad. Owners of loan books who deal directly with consumers, that is, who are servicing their own loan books, will be regulated. Otherwise they can have the loan book serviced by a regulated credit servicing firm. </p>  <p>  The Bill was published in January and second stage of the Bill was taken in the D&aacute;il on 4 February.

Their service can be contacted at (01) 676 1914 or by email at <i>.  </i></p></reply>

Specific criteria were set down in respect of the areas which should be included within the remit of the Living City Initiative which were required to be taken into account by the relevant city council in putting forward the proposed Special Regeneration Area for each city. </p>  <p>  In particular, it was stated that the Special Regeneration Areas should be inner city areas which are largely comprised of dwellings built before 1915, where there is above average unemployment and which demonstrate clear evidence of neglect, dereliction and under-use. It was specified that areas which are generally regarded as affluent, which have high occupancy rates and which do not require regeneration should not be included in the Special Regeneration Areas. The Living City Initiative is a very targeted urban regeneration incentive. The criteria to be met for the inclusion of an area in the scheme are more stringent than simply being in one of the relevant cities, and being constructed pre 1915. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that I do not see this as a wide-spread Initiative, as it is targeted at those areas which are most in need of attention. However, it is a newly launched scheme, and it will be kept under review. </p></reply>

The main deductible expenses are:</p><p>- any rent payable by the landlord in the case of a sub-lease;</p><p>- the cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant;</p><p>- the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property;</p><p>- the interest on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair the property (which, in the case of residential property, is restricted to 75% of the interest and is subject to compliance with Private Residential Tenancies Board registration requirements for all tenancies that existed in relation to the property in the relevant year); and</p><p>- the payment of local authority rates.</p><p>In addition, capital allowances in respect of wear and tear are available in relation to capital expenditure incurred on fixtures and fittings provided by a landlord for the purposes of furnishing rented residential accommodation.  These allowances are granted at the rate of 12.5% per annum of the actual cost of the fixtures and fittings over a period of 8 years.</p><p>I am aware of course that recent reports on the private rental sector have stated that, among other things, the restriction on the amount of interest that is deductible from gross rents from residential property and the lack of a deduction for local property tax (LPT) are impediments to securing long term investment in good quality rental homes. </p><p>As regards the former issue, the Deputy is no doubt aware that this measure was introduced in the April 2009 supplementary budget in respect of all residential lettings as part of an urgent revenue-raising package aimed at stabilising the public finances.  </p><p>The Deputy will also be aware from responses to previous Parliamentary Questions that the Government agreed in principle to accept the recommendation of the Inter-Departmental Group on the design of a local property tax that LPT be treated as a deductible expense in calculation of a landlord's taxable income, but has not, as yet, decided on the manner in which this will happen or its timing.</p></reply>

OPW is engaged in negotiations with affected landowners about the prospect of relocating an existing back drain to allow the construction of a more substantial designed flood defence to defend against the extreme events experienced at this location and to account for the very poor adjoining geology.  The substantially stronger flood defence at this location requires an increase in land mass to support the greater footprint.  This in turn requires the back filling of the existing back drain and the construction of a new offset back drain with associated sluice structures. </p>  <p>  OPW is also in ongoing discussions with the National Parks and Wildlife Service as the location of the proposed works is within a designated Special Area of Conservation.</p></reply>

The number of new permits issued in the period represents a yearly average over the five years of 0.16% of the labour market.</p><p><b>Employment Permits granted 2010 - 2014</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>NEW</th><th>RENEWAL</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>3394</td><td>3877</td><td>7271</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>3184</td><td>2016</td><td>5200</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>2919</td><td>1088</td><td>4007</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>3034</td><td>829</td><td>3863</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>4861</td><td>634</td><td>5495</td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-19a.444.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051900061#WRH01900"><p>Agriculture Workers employed in the farm contractor are covered by the Joint Labour Committee for the Agriculture sector.   In 2011, the High Court ruled that certain provision of the Industrial Relations Acts of 1946 and 1990 governing the making of Employment Regulation Orders (EROs) were unconstitutional. The experienced adult rate of pay provided for the Agriculture ERO at the time of the High Court ruling was &euro;9.10 per hour.</p>  <p>  The effect of the ruling was that National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) could not enforce the minimum pay and conditions of employment prescribed in EROs in force at the time of the High Court decision. </p>  <p>  However, existing contractual rights of workers in sectors covered by EROs were unaffected by the ruling. Contractual rights can be altered only by agreement between the parties involved.</p>  <p>  New entrants to employment in JLC sectors after the High Court ruling could be employed on a rate of pay agreed between the worker and the employer, subject only to the terms of the National Minimum Wage.</p>  <p>  On 1 October 2013, I  published the Report of the Labour Court&rsquo;s Review of the Joint Labour Committee (JLC) system. The Report owes its genesis to Section 41A of Industrial Relations Act 1946 (inserted by Section 11 of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012) which provides that reviews of each JLC be carried out by the Labour Court, as soon as practicable after the commencement of the Act, and at least once every 5 years thereafter. The review assisted the Labour Court&rsquo;s  deliberations as to whether any JLC should be abolished, maintained in its current form, amalgamated with another JLC or its establishment order amended and the Labour Court is required to make recommendations to the Minister to this effect.</p>  <p>  The Court&rsquo;s recommendation in relation to the Agriculture sector was that the JLC be retained for that sector with reduced scope. </p>  <p>  With the exception of the Agriculture JLC, implementation of the recommendations, regarding the scope of the other JLCs were given effect by way of Ministerial Order. As the Agricultural Workers JLC was established under primary legislation, and the scope of the JLC is derived from the definition of &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; in section 1 of the 1976 Industrial Relations Act, any amendment to the scope of the existing JLC will require an amendment to this definition to reflect the Labour Court recommendation. I intend to introduce the necessary amendment to the 1976 Act by way of a Committee Stage amendment to the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2015.</p>  <p>  It should be borne in mind that the JLC system provides a framework within which employers and employee representatives can come together voluntarily and negotiate terms and conditions of workers in their respective sector. For vulnerable workers, the advantage of JLCs is that they see fair terms and conditions such as wage rates, sick pay etc. agreed and given effect by ERO, while for some employers, the advantage of the JLC system, based as it is on the principle of self-governance, means that they can agree and set minimum pay and conditions, agree on work practices which are custom-made to their industry &ndash; a flexibility which cannot be achieved by primary legislation. Where both parties to a JLC see commonality of purpose and outcome then an agreement may emerge.</p>  <p>  This process sits very much within the context of Ireland's voluntarist system of industrial relations.</p>  <p>  Making work pay continues to be a cornerstone of this Government&rsquo;s agenda and the setting up of a Low Pay Commission is one of the key commitments in the Statement of Government Priorities agreed in July last year. </p>  <p>  The Commission was launched on the 26th February and it is currently operating on an interim non-statutory basis. Legislation to provide for the establishment of the Commission on a statutory basis has been published and I expect that it will be enacted quickly.  </p>  <p>  The principal function of the Low Pay Commission will be to annually examine and make recommendations on the national minimum wage, with a view to securing that the minimum wage is adjusted incrementally and progressively increased over time, without damage to enterprise or employment.</p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission will also be able to examine any matter generally related to its functions. A work programme will be agreed by Government and presented to the Commission in each February. Nothing relevant will be excluded from its deliberations. </p>  <p>  The Commission sought the views of anyone with an interest in the minimum wage as part of a public consultation process.  I understand that submissions are currently being considered and I expect the first report of the Commission by the middle of July.</p></reply>

The group includes Local Enterprise Offices, IDA Ireland, Solas, Education and Training Boards, Department of Social Protection, MABS and the Citizens Information Bureau. </p>  <p>  The inter-agency group made it clear that it stood ready to meet unions and staff representatives at any stage.  I understand that Enterprise Ireland is meeting with employee representatives this week to discuss in general terms the approach of the agency to supporting restructuring, job protection and job creation. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has had meetings with the company&rsquo;s management on a weekly basis since the announcement of the proposed job losses, and has been in contact with the company on a continuous basis regarding the assistance it could provide for restructuring to minimise job losses. I have also had discussions with Mondelez at senior executive level and the company has committed clearly to me that it will invest in its operation here with the aim of achieving best in class production process.</p>  <p>  The Company and its workers and the union who represent them are engaged in discussions in the company's restructuring proposals. </p>  <p>  The Labour Relations Commission is available, if required, to assist the parties concerned. I know that in similar situations in the past, the parties have facilitated access to commercially sensitive information. It is a matter for the parties in each dispute to decide however.  </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment rights legislation protects all persons legally employed in Ireland on an employer-employee basis. Persons working under a contract of employment, on a full-time or part-time basis, have the same protection under law. </p>  <p>  The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) is mandated to secure compliance with employment rights legislation.  NERA&rsquo;s Workplace Relations Customer Service Section provides information in relation to employment, equality and industrial relations rights and obligations and how to obtain redress where appropriate.  </p>  <p>  Workplace Relations Customer Services staff are available to meet the Cadbury workforce to provide information and answer any questions they may have with regard to their present situation. </p></reply>

The Government through the SME State Bodies Group, chaired by the Department of Finance are keeping the issue of alternative sources of finance under review as to how to best utilise their benefits to promote business development.</p>  <p>  Recognising its potential importance my Department has been examining the crowdfunding model and has engaged with discussions on it at national and EU level.</p>  <p>  Crowdfunding for business is in 2 forms: equity and lending. There are a range of possible issues associated with both forms. In broad terms the issues of consumer protection and regulation are relevant, as are the tax treatment of money lent or invested by the crowd. These issues are a matter for my Government colleague the Minister for Finance. </p>  <p>  Another issue for Government is whether it should co-invest or co-lend with the crowd. In this regard the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), as controller and manager of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), is currently working on commercial investment opportunities in the SME sector that will meet the strategic objectives and investment strategy of the ISIF. The NTMA has identified that there is a potential opportunity for the ISIF to provide lending support to SMEs through alternative finance lending providers that use a peer to peer model.  </p>  <p>  The NTMA sought proposals on behalf of a fund or funds that could be established to support lending via alternative finance lending providers with a view to assessing the level of interest from parties who might manage such a fund.   The NTMA is now working through a process to see if a dedicated fund or funds can be established which would use ISIF and co-investor capital to support loans to Irish SMEs originated on alternative finance lending platforms.</p></reply>

The manufacturing and internationally traded services companies that Enterprise Ireland (EI) works with are a vital source of employment in every county in Ireland and are spread across a wide range of sectors.</p>  <p>  In January, EI reported that its client companies created 19,705 new jobs in 2014, and when job losses in these companies are taken into account, they created 8,476 net new jobs - the highest net gain in the history of the Agency.  EI supported companies now directly provide employment for 180,072 people, comprising 156,202 full-time and 23,870 part-time workers.</p>  <p>  EI uses a developmental approach across all aspects of clients&rsquo; needs, including business development, sales and marketing capabilities, innovation and R&amp;D activity, technology development, continuous competitiveness and lean improvements, leadership and management development, and access to finance. </p>  <p>  Recognising the diversity of the EI client base, its supports are tailored to reflect each company&rsquo;s stage of development.  This ensures that all of its new and existing clients, from Entrepreneurs and Start-Ups, to exporting SMEs and scaling companies, can access the appropriate supports to help them to create and sustain jobs. </p>  <p>  EI works very closely with its client companies, seeking to proactively address development challenges or to engage before serious financial or other difficulties arise. </p>  <p>  EI engages closely with those client companies reporting difficulties or potential job loses to determine the appropriate action and proactive measures that can be put in place. </p>  <p>  Since the onset of the economic crisis, EI has invested in thousands of client companies with the objective of sustaining and growing their employment. In addition, EI works in close concert with partner development Agencies to respond to incidences with larger companies where a significant number of jobs are at risk.  The objective in these circumstances is to identify all opportunities to maximise the number of jobs maintained, for example, through support for spin-out start-ups, Management Buy Outs, or commercial partnering.  Taskforces comprising relevant personnel from the Development Agencies and other key stakeholders are used in these cases.</p>  <p>  It is also important that in the event that a company in serious financial difficulty downsizes or closes, a range of interventions in other government policy areas can be brought to bear e.g. Redundancy Payments Scheme, Labour Activation/Training etc. which seek to ameliorate the impact of job losses.</p></reply>

Since July 2014 structural steelwork and aluminium now fall under the CPR and therefore must carry CE marking to demonstrate that they comply with the European Commission&rsquo;s harmonised standard EN 1090-1:2009 which relates to the Execution of Steel Structures and Aluminium Structures. </p><p>Under EN standard 1090, there are requirements for conformity assessment of structural components, which requires certification by a third party, known as a 'notified inspection body'.  In Ireland, the certification role is performed by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI).</p><p>In view of the NSAI&rsquo;s final certification role, and given the roles and responsibilities of other Departments and agencies, my Department has discussed the requirements of the CPR with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (DCELG), the Department of Education and Skills, the Local Enterprise Offices (LEO&rsquo;s) network and the NSAI. </p><p>Any difficulty facing the small business sector is of course a concern.  While there is no direct funding available from this Department for companies to upskill or update their processes in order to meet the CE marking requirements, there is information and guidance available through the DCELG website, the LEO&rsquo;s and the NSAI. </p><p>With regard to the role of the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) in providing training support for companies affected by the CPR, the LEOs were established as a first-stop-shop for the provision of advice and supports to the micro and small enterprise sector. </p><p>Five information workshops about the requirements under the CPR have been hosted over recent months by the LEO&rsquo;s in conjunction with the NSAI at various locations throughout the country.  Steel fabricator companies affected by the CPR requirements were advised that they could explore training provision with SOLAS, Education and Training Boards (ETB) or Institutes of Technology (IT) for welding courses, and ultimately, CE marking certification which can be organised through the NSAI for companies who have successfully implemented the requirements of the CPR.</p><p>The provision of the specialist technical training required to achieve certification to an International or European Standard, such as that required by steel fabricators in this instance, is outside of the remit of the LEO services.  However, I understand that the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) in Cork, Dundalk, Galway, Shannon, Tralee and Waterford provide metal fabrication apprenticeship training, which incorporates elements of certification training.</p></reply>

My Department is constrained by law from issuing or renewing aquaculture licences for sites located within these areas until such time as Appropriate Assessments have been conducted for the purpose of environmental compliance with these Directives. </p><p>My Department is working with the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the National Parks and Wildlife Service through a multi-annual work programme for aquaculture sites located within Natura areas.  All of the baseline data on habitats and species for &lsquo;natura&rsquo; areas has been acquired allowing for the Conservation Objectives to be set.  This will enable all new and renewal aquaculture applications to be assessed in accordance with EU legislative requirements.  A key factor of this work programme is the identification of prioritised bays based on the number of aquaculture sites and also the ready availability of scientific data and other factors.  The prioritised list of bays is kept under continuous review by my Department in order to facilitate the optimum use of scientific and other resources. </p><p>The Appropriate Assessment process has now been completed in respect of twelve bays &ndash; Castlemaine Harbour, Roaringwater Bay, Dundalk Bay, Lough Swilly, Donegal Bay, Dungarvan Harbour, Ballycotton Bay, Kenmare Bay, Valentia Harbour/Portmagee Channel, Galway Bay, Clew Bay and Drumcliff Bay.  While these Appropriate Assessments are carried out on a bay by bay basis, each licence application within a bay must be assessed individually.  Factors to be considered include location of the sites within a bay, species, scale and intensity of production, potential visual impact etc. </p><p>A significant number of aquaculture licence determinations have been made in respect of three Natura sites, Castlemaine, Roaringwater and Donegal Bay.  My Department is currently examining the outcome of the remaining Appropriate Assessments which have been received to date, with a view to formulating policy recommendations in respect of individual licences held by operators in those bays.  Such policy recommendations will take account of all national and EU legislative requirements and will reflect full engineering, scientific, environmental, legal and public policy aspects of each licence application.  Work is ongoing in this area and it is anticipated that a significant number of licence determinations will be achieved this year. </p><p>In addition to the Natura requirements, under the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, all licence applications must undergo an Environmental Impact Screening Assessment.  This requires significant input from my Department&rsquo;s scientific and technical advisors.</p></reply>

This group represents farmers under the age of 40, who established their holdings prior to 2008 and who hold low value entitlements.  At this meeting the main request of the group was to increase the value of entitlements for farmers who are under 40 years to the National Average value of entitlements in 2015.  It was estimated that this group would comprise of no more than 300 farmers.  Following the meeting my Department carried out analysis of the group of farmers involved.  It has been established that 3 ,900 farmers fulfil these criteria.  An estimation of the cost of increasing the value of existing entitlements to the National Average for these 3,900 farmers stands at &euro;12.288m.  Under EU Regulations governing the distribution of funding under the National Reserve, priority must be given to young farmers who commenced farming in the past 5 years and new entrants to farming who commenced in the last 2 years.  Given the number of applications received under these two priority categories, it is not envisaged that there will be available resources to cater for this large additional group of farmers who commenced their farming activity prior to 2008.   </p>  <p>  Many of the farmers in this group will benefit from an increase in the value of their entitlements under the convergence process between 2015 and 2019.  Farmers who hold entitlements that have an Initial Unit Value that is below 90% of the Basic Payment Scheme national average will see the value of their entitlements increase gradually over the five years of the scheme.  By 2019, all entitlements for all farmers in Ireland will be at least 60% of the National Average value.   </p>  <p>With regard to access under Pillar 2 to the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) for young farmers who established their holdings prior to 2008, I intend to prioritise their applications under TAMS, with grant-aid payable at 40%.</p></reply>

The rules on origin labelling are determined at EU level and I recently signed into law an SI to give effect to the new European Regulations for country of origin labelling of meat from sheep, pigs, poultry and goats.  These mandatory rules require a label to state the Member State where the animal was reared and slaughtered.  They do not operate on a regional, multi member state or all-island basis. </p>  <p>  The requirement at EU level applies only to pre-packaged meat.  However, I believe this information should also be made available to consumers purchasing meat sold loose through butcher shops and deli counters.  As a result, I have asked my officials to work with the Department of Health to extend these rules to &ldquo;loose meat&rdquo; and work is progressing well in bringing this to fruition. </p>  <p>  With regards to Northern Ireland, I have been in regular contact with my counterpart Minister Michelle O&rsquo;Neill on labelling issues that affect both jurisdictions on the island.  There is also considerable engagement at official level and, only last week, my Department met with officials from DARD Northern Ireland to discuss the practical implementation of the new country of origin labelling requirements, including any impact which these may be having on the trade in lambs from Northern Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Ultimately, these issues are a function of the market and are driven by customer specification.  This is borne out by the fact that live export of beef animals to the North is nearly 50% higher than it was at this time last year and this has been achieved without any change to the beef labelling rules.  This shows that a true picture of the market forces impacting on the market takes time to become apparent and the situation for lamb this year is no different, particularly since the new rules have only been introduced from 1 April. </p>  <p>  Of course, it is important that we continue to monitor the impact of labelling rules carefully.  I will continue to work to ensure that mandatory labelling laws provide clear and transparent information to consumers, are practicable, and do not negatively impact on Ireland&rsquo;s agri food exports.   </p>  <p>  As regards an all-island animal health regime, there is already a substantial degree of harmonisation of the veterinary regimes on the island of Ireland, particularly in view of the fact that the bulk of the animal health and welfare measures implemented on the island are based on EU legislation.  However, the incidence of cattle disease is not uniform on the island, particularly in the case of Bovine TB and Brucellosis, resulting in different eradication programmes on both sides of the Border.  This aside, there is ongoing good co-operation between the veterinary services North and South in the context of delivery of the All-Island Animal Health and Welfare Strategy Action Plan under the North/South Ministerial arrangements.   </p></reply>

The main elements of the proposal are as follows:</p><p>-Introduction of a risk-based control regime and the proposal to remove the requirement for the annual inspection by the Organic Control Bodies.</p><p>-Harmonisation of residue sampling, analysis and action thereby establishing a minimum threshold for pesticide residues above which the product cannot be sold as organic.</p><p><b>-</b>The removal of the current flexibility where a farm can, under very specific conditions of separation, produce both<b></b>organic and non organic products on the same holding.</p><p><b>-</b>Severe restriction in the reduction of the conversion period.</p><p>While, in principle, Ireland is supportive of many aspects of the text we feel that the proposal overall is too ambitious and does not sufficiently reflect the varying stages of development of the organic sector at individual Member State level.  The proposal, as formulated, could curtail the development of the sector in Ireland and may act as an impediment to farmers wishing to convert to organic production.</p><p>Organic farming makes a significant positive contribution to the overall agri-sector in Ireland both from an environmental and economic perspective.  Organic farming involves farming in an environmentally friendly and sustainable fashion within a closed system with very restrictive lists of permitted inputs which include the non-use of soluble fertilizers (synthetic fertilizers) and pesticides. </p><p>Bord Bia research has shown that there is a market demand for Irish organic beef, lamb, fruit, vegetables and cereals and currently the sector is contributing over &euro;100 million to the Irish economy.  However, a significant percentage of the Irish organic food market is comprised of imports.  The organic sector therefore offers real opportunities for Irish farmers and food processors in the form of import substitution in areas where Ireland is under-producing at present, and the large export markets such as the UK and Germany. </p></reply>

It forms part of the country&rsquo;s draft Rural Development Programme and will have a budget of approximately &euro;300m over a period of 6 years.  The BDGP will accelerate improvement in the crucial area of environmental sustainability in the national herd through the application of genomic technology and will bring about long-term strategic improvements to the sector by fundamentally improving the genetic quality of the beef herd.  It will also position Ireland as a global leader in the application of genomics technology and confirm our reputation as one of the most important and renowned export focussed beef producing nations in the world.</p><p>Participants in the programme will receive a payment of &euro;142.50 per hectare for the first 6.66 payable hectares under the scheme, and &euro;120 per payable hectare after that.  Payment to scheme participants is on the basis of costs incurred and income foregone for each of the actions undertaken.  All of the costs to the farmer, including in terms of time and effort, have been factored into the payment for the farmer as agreed with the European Commission.  The payment includes a cost associated with the tissue tag sample and subsequent processing, and this will be deducted at source from the farmer&rsquo;s payment.</p><p>The BDGP builds on the schemes operated by my Department in recent years and all of the actions will already be familiar to most farmers entering the scheme, including the data recording elements and the genotyping requirements.  There has been some concern regarding the requirement to join the scheme for a 6 year period.  This multi-annual approach is required for all EU funded agri-environmental schemes and, in any event, should facilitate long term planning on individual farms.  We have also included force majeure clauses in the Terms and Conditions to deal with situations where a farmer has to withdraw from the programme due to circumstances beyond his or her control.<i></i></p><p>The replacement strategy is the other main new element of the BDGP.  The need for genetic improvement in the Irish suckler herd is widely acknowledged, and the adoption of genomic technology is a critically important tool in increasing production efficiency and ultimately farmer margins.  This scheme is putting &euro;300 million into accelerating genetic improvement and so the requirement for farmers to move towards using 4 and 5 star rated stock bulls and heifers is essential to its objectives.  I am fully aware that these requirements will take time which is why there is a 5 year lead-in time. </p><p>Finally, I would like to add that both my Department and the ICBF have published Questions and Answers documents to address queries being raised by farmers and these will be updated regularly as other queries arise.  I also issued some updated information on the contents of the scheme only yesterday.  In addition, farmer&rsquo;s can consult the Department&rsquo;s website for more information and I would encourage them to contact the Department&rsquo;s helpline if they have any further questions.</p></reply>

The key focus of the plan is on preventing loss of life. The 10-point action plan was considered by the Heads of States and Government at a Special European Council meeting on 23rd April. At the meeting of the Council, the Heads of State and Government committed to a comprehensive range of commitments, including at least tripling financial resources for Operations Triton and Poseidon, thereby enabling an increase in the search and rescue possibilities within the mandate of FRONTEX. EU leaders also committed to actions to prevent illegal migration flows, to reinforce internal EU solidarity and responsibility in relation to the processing of asylum applications and relocation of migrants, and to combat traffickers in accordance with international law. In addition, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy was invited to start preparations for a possible CSDP operation.</p>  <p>  Following the announcement made by An Taoiseach at the meeting on the 23rd April, and Government approval and agreement with the Italian authorities last week, the L.E. EITHNE, with a crew of sixty-eight (68) personnel of the Permanent Defence Forces, departed the Naval Base in Haulbowline on Saturday, 16th   May 2015, to assist the Italian authorities in humanitarian search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean.  The despatch of an Irish naval vessel represents a tangible and valuable Irish national contribution to assisting the Italian authorities in the humanitarian search and rescue operation and highlights our commitment to assist with efforts to prevent further tragedy and loss of life at sea. </p>  <p>At the formal Meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council with Ministers of Defence in Brussels on 18th May, a Council Decision to establish a European Union military operation, EUNAVFOR Med, in the South Central Mediterranean was adopted. The Mission&rsquo;s mandate will be implemented in sequential phases. The first phase of the operation will support the detection and monitoring of migration networks through information gathering and patrolling in accordance with international law. A second phase, involving the targeting, seizure and possible destruction of the vessels and assets of human traffickers will only begin once appropriate UN Security Council authorisation is in place. The third phase is an operational/disruption phase, and the fourth and final phase is a mission withdrawal and completion phase. </p>  <p>  While we are focused on the search and rescue mission, on the basis that the first phase of the CSDP operation will be carried out in full accordance with international law, Ireland has supported this aspect of the operation. In relation to further phases of the CSDP operation, we believe that many elements of the proposed action will require a UN Security Council Resolution. The Permanent Defence Forces will not be participating in the mission in the absence of such a resolution.   </p>  <p>  Ireland supports the actions of the Union to address the major challenge of migration in the Mediterranean. We cannot allow criminal gangs and smugglers to continue to exploit people at risk. </p></reply>

Magee Barracks was one of the barracks identified for closure and disposal. On 1st July 2003 the Government decided the former Magee Barracks in Kildare Town would be among the State lands released to Kildare County Council for inclusion in the Sustaining Progress Affordable Housing Initiative. On foot of this Government decision Kildare County Council prepared a local area plan for the site which encompassed a range of uses including community use. Following discussions between the Department, Kildare County Council and the then Department of Environment, Heritage &amp;amp; Local Government, and in accordance with the terms of the Housing Initiative, it was agreed that the entire site would be transferred to Kildare County Council. A final Contract for transfer was issued to Kildare County Council in January 2009. However, the Council advised the Department that it no longer wished to take possession of the property.</p>  <p>  In September 2011, the Department, in response to a request from the Council seeking submissions for the proposed Local Area Plan for Kildare Town, advised the Council of the intention to sell the site. The Department also advised the Council that it recognised the site provides a unique opportunity for the development of Kildare Town and remains prepared to facilitate this subject to achieving a satisfactory return for the property in order to provide revenue for reinvestment in the Defence Forces. The Kildare Town Local Development Plan 2012-2018 has made provision for substantial community developments on the barracks site which undoubtedly will be reflected in the value of the site to a developer. </p>  <p>  It is now proposed to dispose of the remaining c.54 acres of the Barracks by public auction later this year.

The Bill will provide greater options to address the decision-making needs of a range of vulnerable adults such as persons with Alzheimer&rsquo;s, intellectual disability or mental illness and also persons who have acquired brain injuries through trauma or accident. Its enactment will be a key element in enabling Ireland to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p>  <p>  Where a person is suffering from Alzheimer's disease and lacks the capacity to make decisions without some form of assistance, there will be a number of support options available.  The court will be able to appoint a decision-making representative to take specified decisions on the person's behalf where the court finds that the person lacks capacity to take  such decisions.  A person will also be able voluntarily to appoint a co-decision-maker to take decisions jointly with him or her.  In addition, a person will be able, as at present, to appoint an attorney under an enduring power of attorney to take decisions once the person no longer has capacity.</p>  <p>  Where the court has appointed a decision-making representative or where an enduring power of attorney has been registered, it will no longer be possible for the person with Alzheimer's disease to take decisions or to sign documents in relation to the decisions for which a decision-making representative or an attorney have been appointed.  Similarly, the person will have to take decisions and to sign documents jointly with the co-decision-maker on matters encompassed by the co-decision-making agreement.</p>  <p>  Decision-making representatives, attorneys and co-decision-makers will all be answerable to the Office of the Public Guardian and will be required to submit annual reports, including details of any expenditure made from the person's finances.</p>  <p>  Committee Stage is scheduled for 17 June and it is my expectation that the Bill will be enacted this year.</p></reply>

I understand that around 18,000 candidates completed this stage and fewer than 13,000 candidates reached a satisfactory standard.  Those who did achieve a satisfactory standard were placed in three bands determined by their overall scores.  5,000  candidates (i.e. those in Band 1) were invited to take a subsequent series of tests and of that number, just over 3,000 were successful. To date the top 2,000 approximately from that group have been invited to supervised assessments and interviews. These interviews are ongoing and the details of successful candidates are forwarded to the Garda Commissioner.   Those remaining from Band 1 will be brought forward for further assessment and depending on the Commissioner&rsquo;s recruitment needs, PAS will then move to those in Band 2 and possibly Band 3, if necessary. </p>  <p>  While it is the Government's intention that there will be ongoing seamless recruitment to the force, there are no plans at present for a new recruitment campaign.</p></reply>

Section 4(3) of the 1998 Act provides that the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions, which includes the provision of information on the courts system. I am informed that statistical data on orders for possession is available on the Courts Service website,  www.courts.ie.</p><p>It is important to note that the number of civil bills issued does not reflect either the number of orders for possession granted or necessarily equate with repossessions as it is up to the person or company who obtained the order for possession to pursue its execution.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b>Therefore, relative to the number of civil bills issued, a small portion end up as repossessions since in many cases the civil bill gives rise to engagement of the borrower with the bank resulting in either a mortgage restructuring agreement between the bank and borrower or a Personal Insolvency Arrangement entered into under the Personal Insolvency Act.</p><p>The Central Bank's quarterly Residential Mortgage Arrears and Repossession Statistics have information which may be of interest to the Deputy and they are available at www.centralbank.ie.  The statistics include the number of properties taken into possession by lenders during the relevant quarter including the number which were repossessed on foot of a Court Order.</p><p>Finally, as I am sure the Deputy is aware, the Government recently announced a series of measures to assist people in mortgage distress.  The measures include a major reform of the Personal Insolvency framework in which the Government has agreed to give Courts the power to review and, where appropriate, to approve insolvency deals that have been rejected by banks;  an expansion of the Mortgage to Rent scheme which will be undertaken by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the provision by the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) of additional services to provide assistance in identifying the best options, completing financial statements and considering proposed solutions. </p><p>These measures are aimed at increasing the supports available to people in arrears and to increase the number of people availing of them.  The overall objective of the Government's initiatives in this area is to ensure that a full range of options is available to distressed borrowers and to keep as many people in their homes as possible.</p></reply>

However, the consensus both from the emergency joint meeting of EU Foreign and Interior Affairs Ministers in Luxembourg on Monday, 20 April 2015, attended by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and myself and the special European Council in Brussels on Thursday, 23 April 2015, attended by the Taoiseach, was that the EU and its Member States needed to take urgent action on a broad front, even if there is disagreement on certain individual elements of the solution.</p>  <p>  The Council Conclusions agreed on 23 April 2015 set out broad priorities which focused on strengthening Europe&rsquo;s presence at sea, fighting traffickers in accordance with international law, preventing illegal migration flows and reinforcing internal solidarity and responsibility.</p>  <p>  Last week the European Commission published the European Agenda on Migration (EAM) which has been adapted to reflect the current situation and the need for urgent action.  The EAM outlines the immediate measures agreed in response to the situation in the Mediterranean as well as the longer term measures necessary to re-balance all aspects of Europe's approach to migration.  Included among the measures is funding for Regional Development and Protection Programmes for North Africa and the Horn of Africa.</p>  <p>  In terms of immediate actions the two main proposals relate to resettlement and relocation.  The Commission indicated that they will be recommending an EU resettlement scheme by the end of May for 20,000 places. This number will be distributed among Member States in accordance with several clearly defined criteria (Ireland&rsquo;s proposed share will be 1.36% or 272 persons).  Participation would be voluntary, given that there are no existing powers under EU law to compel Member States to participate, but; depending on the approach adopted by Member States the Commission may bring forward binding and mandatory legislative proposals to cover the period beyond 2016. </p>  <p>  In line with our regular commitment on resettlement, Ireland had already agreed to resettle 220 refugees over the next two years.  However, the Taoiseach had indicated at the special European Council in April 2015 that we would re-examine this commitment in view of the deteriorating situation in the Mediterranean.  Rather than waiting until the proposals announced in the European Agenda on Migration to be discussed formally by Home Affairs Ministers in June 2015, last Wednesday (13 May 2015), I announced that the Government had agreed in principle to resettle an additional 300 vulnerable people as our contribution to this important European initiative.  This brings our total commitment on resettlement to the end of 2016 to five hundred and twenty (520) people, or nearly twice the quota of two hundred and seventy two (272) proposed by the Commission for Ireland. </p>  <p>  This is in addition to support under the Syria Humanitarian Assistance Programme (SHAP) which grants temporary permission, of up to two years duration, to vulnerable close family members of either naturalised Irish citizens of Syrian birth or Syrian nationals already lawfully residing in the State.  By the end of 2014 one hundred and fourteen (114) such family members had been granted permission under this scheme.  In addition, Syrian nationals legally resident in Ireland, for example, students or persons on work permission's may apply for an extension of their permission to remain in the State while the crisis situation continues. </p>  <p>  Relocation is a complicated issue and there are different perspectives among Member States.  To deal with the situation in the Mediterranean the Commission is now proposing to trigger the emergency response mechanism under Article 78.3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU via a proposal to be published by the end of May 2015.  This proposal will include a distribution mechanism for persons in clear need of international protection.  Such persons would have their asylum claim considered in the receiving Member State.  Until we see the details of what the Commission is proposing it would be premature to comment further at this point.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, Ireland has a dualist legal system and therefore does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by them, including the amendment of domestic law as necessary. We are determined to take the steps necessary to meet all the convention's requirements in a constructive, proactive and appropriate manner. I should stress that for Ireland, ratification is the end of the preparation and implementation phase, not the beginning. </p>  <p>  A team within my Department has been charged with examining all outstanding obstacles to ratification, and has nearly completed the first phase of its work, which includes identifying all areas which will need attention to make ratification possible. An Interdepartmental Committee is in place to review issues and the actions and timeframe required to tackle them. Many of these issues involve amending unsuitable and outmoded language and in some cases, archaic legal provisions, in existing legislation. Another key task which is underway involves examining how the important issue of Reasonable Accommodation can be achieved in a meaningful way within our Constitutional framework as interpreted by the Supreme Court.</p>  <p>  Progress towards ratification therefore continues to be made and much has been accomplished. One of the core obstacles to Ireland's ratification of the Convention is the requirement for enactment of capacity legislation.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill, published on 17 July 2013, provides a series of options to support people with impaired capacity to make decisions and exercise their basic rights in line with the principles of the UN Convention. It undertakes a comprehensive reform of existing legislation governing capacity. The Bill is currently awaiting Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  The Committee has identified four main areas where legislative amendment or new legislation will be necessary to meet the requirements of the Convention. As the Deputy is aware, the legislative process takes time and it is important that we get it right in order to ensure the realisation of the rights of people with disabilities in a comprehensive and cohesive way.</p></reply>

Each prison has a number of nurses, and each prison is attended by a prison doctor. Doctors ordinarily attend prisons on week days, and provide on call medical cover outside of normal working hours. In addition, nursing cover is provided on a 24 hour basis in all closed prisons. I can confirm that on the 15th of May there were seven agency nurses assigned to the Irish Prison Service. </p>  <p>  Where vacancies arise in prison medical posts, or where a post holder is absent from work, the Irish Prison Service arranges the assignment of a locum doctor to provide medical services under the provisions of its contract agreement with a locum agency provider. Similarly, where nursing vacancies arise, the Irish Prison Service secures the services of agency nurses under the provisions of its contract agreement with a nurse agency provider.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service recognises that, notwithstanding the fact that locum doctors and agency nurses provide essential and necessary support, the engagement of agency medical staff is generally less cost effective than employing permanent medical staff. In this regard, the Irish Prison Service keeps the staffing levels in medical posts under constant review.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that the Irish Prison Service recently received sanction for the recruitment of 20 prison nurses.  It is expected that a competition to recruit these nurses will be advertised in the near future, and the recruitment of additional nurses will have the effect of reducing the level at which agency nursing staff are being engaged at present.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has confirmed that it will continue to provide an appropriate level of medical and nursing resources to deliver healthcare services in each prison, subject to available resources and competing priorities.</p></reply>

The Deputy may be aware that there is a political commitment among EU Member States against any form of process that would grant residence status to persons present in the State without first examining the merits of their individual cases. Broad regularisation programmes are problematic, in particular as they could give rise to unpredictable and very costly impacts across the full range of public and social services.</p>  <p>  I have previously acknowledged however that the length of time that many applicants spend in the protection process is a matter that needs to be addressed particularly in light of the sharp increase in asylum application volumes in 2014 and so far in 2015. The Deputy may be aware that an Independent Working Group was set up in October 2014 to recommend to Government what improvements should be made to the protection process, including direct provision and supports to asylum seekers. One of the tasks of the Working Group is to identify improvements to existing arrangements for the processing of protection applications taking account of the Government's intention to legislate for a single application procedure.</p>  <p>  The Group began its work in November last under the Chairmanship of retired High Court Judge, Bryan McMahon and its membership is drawn from a range of interests in the international protection area including UNHCR, non-governmental organisations, protection applicants, academia, and relevant Government Departments and Offices. I understand that the Working Group's report to Government will be finalised in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  I have also committed to introducing legislative change in the Protection area to provide for a single application procedure with a view to reducing the length of time applicants spend in the protection process. On 25 March 2015 I published the General Scheme of the International Protection Bill, which has been approved by Government.  This is the first step in delivering the Government's undertaking in the Statement of Priorities 2014-2016 to legislate to reduce the length of time protection applicants spend in the system.  My objective is to reform the current multi-layered and sequential system which can result in applicants being accommodated in the State's system of Direct Provision for indeterminate periods of time. The single procedure will identify at a much earlier stage those who are in need of international protection and should be granted status and those with no entitlement to stay in the State and who can safely return to their country of origin.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the Government decision I have forwarded the General Scheme of the Bill to the Attorney General for the detailed drafting of the legislation which, subject to the approval of the Government at a future time, will be presented to the Oireachtas for enactment into law. My aim is for the legislation to be enacted by the end of this year.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the deliberations of the Working Group on the Protection process and the future publication of the International Protection Bill, a number of measures have already been taken to address the number of cases on hand in the protection system which are yielding significant results. These include the scheduling of interviews of applicants on Saturdays, the transfer of subsidiary protection application processing to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner in late 2013, the establishment of a legal panel set up to assist the Commissioner with this work, and the appointment of additional members to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal to assist with the processing of appeals. </p>  <p>  My Department is also actively considering what other measures can be taken to reduce the number of cases on hand at the leave to remain stage of the process in advance of the introduction of a single application procedure.</p></reply>

The total for items confiscated includes perimeter security searches.  </p>  <p>  The Director General of the Irish Prison Service assures me that preventing the access of contraband into prisons remains a high priority. Efforts are made on a continuous basis to prevent the flow of drugs into our prisons, by for example, the installation of nets over exercise yards, vigilant observation of prisoners by staff, enhanced CCTV monitoring, the stricter control of visits and the use of targeted and random cell searches on a daily basis. As well as this the introduction of passive and active drug detection dogs and the installation of airport style security including scanners and x-ray machines has helped efforts to tackle the problem. Random searches of cells and their occupants have uncovered significant quantities of contraband in recent years.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the Irish Prison Service recognises that constant improvements are required in this area.  The Director General recently announced additional security measures aimed a further enhancing the security of our prisons including:</p>  <p>  The introduction of a new free confidential telephone line  which will be operational in June. Anyone with information on the trafficking of prohibited items into our prisons will be able to pass on that information in confidence. </p>  <p>  The increasing of the number of passive and active dogs which are operational in all prisons. There are currently 8 passive dogs in training with a further 10 active dogs to begin training shortly. This will increase the Canine Unit to 39 dog teams.</p>  <p>  The introduction of standard searching procedures for all persons entering our prisons.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware on 23 April 2015, the prisoner carried out an unprovoked assault with a weapon on prison staff in which they received serious head and other injuries. This assault followed a number of other serious unprovoked attacks on prison staff in recent weeks. These assaults were of a more serious nature than those which would usually occur in our prisons. </p>  <p>  The work of prison staff is challenging and demanding and dealing with offenders, many of whom have been convicted for violent offences or have a history of violence, brings with it a higher degree of risk than most other professions. However, I can assure the Deputy that while the risk might be greater - no act of violence against staff is acceptable or tolerated. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that officials in the Irish Prison Service deal with over 8,500 prisoner transfers annually throughout the prison Estate. In addition, a large number of internal movements of prisoners occur on a daily basis. The Deputy will appreciate that for obvious logistical, operational and security reasons, those individual transfers are not discussed with members of staff.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has successfully introduced a number of measures across the prison estate such as, hand-held metal detectors, netting over prison yards, boss chairs and security screening machines to detect and prevent weapons from entering the prison to limit the scope of acts of violence. In addition, new prisoner programmes have been introduced such as the Incentivised Regimes policy, which provides for a differentiation of privileges between prisoners according to their level of engagement with services and quality of behaviour. The objective is to provide tangible incentives to prisoners to participate in structured activities and to reinforce good behaviour, leading to a safer and more secure prison environment. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that in light of the recent serious incidents, including the incident carried out by the prisoner referred, the Irish Prison Service is implementing a number of additional measures to enhance staff safety including the introduction of personal protective equipment such as stab vest for high risk escorts. In addition further training is to be provided regarding de-escalation, the use of force and the use of safety equipment.</p></reply>

Garda Vetting Disclosures are predicated on the signed authorisation of a vetting subject for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to disclose to the registered organisation &ldquo;details of all prosecutions, successful or not, pending or completed, and/or convictions which may be recorded in respect of them in the State or elsewhere&rdquo;; or alternatively that there are &ldquo;no prosecutions or convictions recorded in respect of them&rdquo;.  The disclosure is made to the requesting, registered organisation of the position at the time when it is issued.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) has no input into any decision by a registered organisation to employ an individual or otherwise.  It is the responsibility of the organisation in question to use the information provided appropriately, fairly and only as one factor in an overall recruitment decision.  Decisions on the suitability for the recruitment/engagement of the person concerned, therefore,  rest at all times with the registered organisation. </p>  <p>  In general, Garda Vetting applications are processed on a first-come, first served basis in chronological order from date of receipt.  This is with a view to observing equity and fairness in respect of all vetting subjects.  The current average processing time for vetting applications is four weeks. However, in some instances additional enquiries may be necessary and this may result in processing times in excess of the average.</p>  <p>  Garda Vetting is presently conducted under policy as opposed to legislation.  Before the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 could be commenced, a 2013 UK Court of Appeal judgment necessitated a review of the disclosure provisions in both the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and the Spent Convictions Bill.  That review has been completed and amendments to the Vetting Act and consequential amendments to the Spent Convictions Bill are currently being drafted. </p>  <p>  Pending the amendment of the Bill, an Administrative Filter for Garda Vetting Disclosures was introduced with effect from 31st March 2014 which provides that certain minor offences that are over 7 years old are no longer disclosed.  In line with that procedure a decision to disclose or not disclose non-conviction data is now made on the basis of an assessment of the relevance and / or the proportionality of disclosing the information in the context of the position of employment in question. This Administrative Filter already gives effect to the main provisions likely to be contained in the amended Act.</p></reply>

Operation Enchant is the ongoing national Garda operation which coordinates investigations into the manufacture, supply and deployment of IEDs.  Operation Enchant incorporates a co-ordination unit comprising personnel from the Special Detective Unit, Organised Crime Unit and Garda National Drugs Unit.  This unit works closely with each Senior Investigating Officer in relation to each IED incident and also with the Garda Technical Bureau.  The unit also works closely with the Garda Analysis Service and the National Criminal Intelligence Unit amongst others and assists local investigators in their investigations including, where appropriate, interviewing arrested persons and conducting searches.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of recorded incidents associated with Operation Enchant for County Leitrim comprises less than one percent of the national total.

These include an exemption from the upper age limit where a child would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.  I know that the HSE does, where possible, provide additional supports to children with special needs to enable them to avail of pre-school services in mainstream pre-school settings.  </p>  <p>  Previous groups chaired by the Office of the Minister for Disability and the Department of Health agreed that the best approach to meeting the needs of children with special needs at pre-school age was through mainstream pre-school services, but no agreement was reached on what the model of provision would be, or, who would lead out on developing this.</p>  <p>  The Secretary General of my Department has recently agreed with his counterparts in the Departments of Health and Education and Skills that my Department will seek to gain agreement, in a relatively short time-frame, between the three sectors (children, education, health) on the most appropriate, workable model for supports to pre-school children with special needs.

The Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to comment, nor would it be appropriate for me to do so, on the specific matters raised that refer to an individual.  My Department has, however, referred this to Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, for attention and asked that they examine what supports they may be able to provide.  As the Deputy may be aware, neither the provision of social protection supports or mental health services are within my remit.</p>  <p>  On a more general point, I would note that an aftercare programme is based on an aftercare plan for a child who has been in care and is about to turn 18 years old.  Based on an assessed need, an aftercare worker can make arrangements for various supports, including support for accommodation, and accessing training and education.  Aftercare workers are provided both by Tusla as well as through services that are commissioned from community, voluntary and private organisations.  The aftercare worker support provided by Focus Ireland, similar to one which you may have seen in the recent television documentary, is an example of such a service.  Funding is also made available to support a person who is to remain on with their foster family as part of their aftercare plan.  In other cases, funding supports are available to facilitate independent living or supported lodgings.  Further, where a jobseeker has been in care during the 12 months prior to reaching 18 years of age then they are exempt from the reduced rates for jobseeker's allowance that would otherwise apply.  However, a person, after turning 18 years of age, is entitled to choose whether or not to avail of planned supports, and this is outside the control of Tusla.  </p>  <p>  The Government has decided to amend the legislative provisions regarding aftercare.  The aim is to create a clear statement of Tusla's duty to satisfy itself as to the child's or young person's need for assistance by preparing a plan that identifies those needs for aftercare supports.  It is anticipated that the Aftercare Bill will be published shortly.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2015, funding of &euro;49.9m has been provided to my Department for these schemes.  There has been no reduction in the overall allocation for youth services in 2015.  This was an important priority for the voluntary youth organisations that have a key role in the provision of quality youth work services for young people. </p><p>Three of the targeted funding schemes, the Special Projects for Youth scheme, the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, and Local Drug Task Force projects scheme, were the subject of a recently completed <i>Value for Money and Policy Review.</i>The schemes support the provision of youth services for young people who are at risk of drugs, alcohol misuse, early school leaving, homelessness or who are living in disadvantaged communities.  In 2012, expenditure on the schemes amounted to &euro;39.7m.  The review involved an in-depth scrutiny of a complex area to do with the impact youth service provision has in young people's lives.  Overall, the review found that the youth programmes can provide a significant contribution to improving outcomes for young people, and should be considered for on-going public funding. </p><p>The review makes a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead.  It recommends that the three schemes be replaced with a single, targeted, evidence-based and outcomes focussed scheme designed to secure the optimal outcomes for young people and their communities.  It sets out guidance as to how services may be developed to better meet the needs of young people in the target cohort and how demographic information and CSO data about local areas should be part of the programme design.  The key role of volunteers and volunteerism is both acknowledged by the report to date and considered a key element of the new programme, going forward.  The review does not include a recommendation that the funding programme should be operated on the basis of a competitive tendering process.  Instead, it recommends that the governance of the programme should be reformed with a greater role for the network of local youth officers throughout the county, employed by the Education and Training Boards, supporting the development of local youth services.</p><p>My Department has undertaken a detailed consultation process with the youth sector and providers of youth services, including volunteers, about the review's findings and recommendations.  The consultation included regional meetings across the country. All local services were invited to participate.  My Department is committed to working collaboratively with the voluntary youth sector, in the development and implementation of the new programme over the next two years.  Support for volunteers engaged in the provision of youth services is a priority for my Department in this context.  Supports in place include training and awareness programmes in child protection matters through the National Youth Council of Ireland, and support programmes for both staff and volunteer led youth services in implementing the quality standards initiatives in local youth services.  I intend that the reforms recommended in the review will be progressed in the context of the new National Youth Strategy, which is nearing completion.  The strategy will be a universal strategy for all young people aged 10 to 24 years.  It will have a particular focus on the needs of young people who are at risk of experiencing the poorest outcomes.  It is anticipated that the new National Youth Strategy will be finalised in early Summer.</p></reply>

The Department of Social Protection have the lead role in co-ordinating government strategies on child poverty and are the Sponsor of outcome 4 of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures - economic security and opportunity.</p><p>To inform the development of this approach, a national seminar on 'Investing in children &ndash; breaking the cycle of disadvantage' was held with the European Commission and attended by national stakeholders in November 2014. </p><p>The whole-of-government approach requires action in respect of the provision of child and family income supports, early childhood care and education and after-school care, prevention and early intervention services for children and parents in disadvantaged areas, a national programme to tackle educational disadvantage, a new physical activity plan and increased provision of school meals.</p><p>As regards my own Department there are a number of areas of focus.  My Department is spending &euro;260 million annually on early childhood care and education and after-school support programmes which provide care to 100,000 children.  A number of these programmes are targeted at those on lowest incomes.  In addition in early 2015, I established an Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and After-School Care and Education.  The work of the group is focused on identifying policy objectives to guide future investment, including:</p><p>-  Improved outcomes for children, including those with special needs, in terms of their learning, wellbeing and development by ensuring access to high quality early years services.</p><p>-  Support for parents to care for their children</p><p>-  Contribution towards improvements in social inclusion and poverty reduction</p><p>-  Support for parents' participation in education, training and employment</p><p>My Department is also leading the implementation of the Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme (2013-2016).  The ABC Programme is being co-funded by Atlantic Philanthropies and will have a total funding allocation of up to &euro;29.7 million.  The ABC Programme draws on best international practice to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched, and improve the outcomes for children and young people and existing services.  Currently 13 areas have identified and communicated the implementation of a number of specific interventions for children and families based on identified need in the local area.</p><p>My Department also provides targeted support for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, Rounds 1 and 2, Local Drugs Task Force Projects.  In addition, some 31 national and major regional youth work organisations are supported under my Department's Youth Service Grant Scheme and other schemes include the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres.  In 2015, current funding of &euro;49.93m will be provided to my Department for these schemes.</p><p>Tusla, the child and family agency is also responsible for the delivery of educational welfare services and I am advised by Tusla that the statutory Educational Welfare Services worked with over 20,000 children in 2013. Some 2,434 cases involved intensive intervention and a multidisciplinary approach and the provision of sustained support by an Education Welfare Officer to address the child's needs and support school attendance.  During this period the School Completion Programme provided targeted support to approximately 36,000 children and young people at risk of early school leaving across 124 community based programmes.</p><p>Tusla also provides a range of services that offer advice and support to families.  This includes over 100 family resource centres.  The aim of the Family Resource Centre Programme is to combat disadvantage and improve the functioning of the family unit.  The Programme emphasises involving local communities in tackling the problems they face, and creating successful partnerships between voluntary and statutory agencies at community level. </p><p>The main focus of these services is on early intervention aiming to promote and protect the health and well-being and rights of all children, young people and their families.  At the same time particular attention is given to those who are vulnerable or at risk.</p></reply>

I am assured by Tusla that existing Family Resource Centres have the capacity to deliver the services in question to an appropriate level.</p>  <p>  In seeking to improve outcomes and wellbeing for children and young people, Tusla must ensure that it makes the most efficient use of its resources in a way that is efficient, equitable, proportionate and sustainable.  Tusla is giving priority in 2015 to the protection of front-line services and those which are best aligned to the priority outcomes as set out in their Corporate Plan.  Tusla values the work of the agency in question and recognises the impact of its work across the Family Resource Centre Programme.

The Centre's budget for 2015 is set at &euro;90,453. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Tusla that representatives met with members of the Voluntary Board of Management last December regarding the provision of funding to the Centre under the Family Resource Centre Programme.  The Centre has been without a full-time Co-ordinator since March 2013 despite three recruitment processes.  This has impacted on the management and operation of the Centre in terms of services to children and families in the community and the continued development of the Centre in line with Tusla's priorities.</p>  <p>  Tusla fully recognises the need for community-based family support services serving the communities of Sneem, Tahilla, Castlecove, Kilgarvan and Kenmare.  Tusla will continue to work with the Centre and representatives from these communities to ensure that the funding currently available under the Family Resource Centre Programme is directed to a community-based service that is operating to its full potential and best supports and promotes the development, welfare and protection of children, and the effective functioning of families, in line with Tusla's priorities.</p>  <p>  In this regard, a decision has been made to establish a new Family Resource Centre based in Kenmare to serve the communities of Sneem, Tahilla, Castlecove, Kilgarvan and Kenmare.  A new legal entity will be formed.  The current Voluntary Board of Management of Kenmare Community Care will be re-constituted.  It will initially include community representatives from Sneem Family Resource Centre and Kenmare Community Care. </p>  <p>  In time, it is proposed that the new Voluntary Board of Management will also include community representatives from Tahilla, Castlecove and Kilgarvan.  The detail of this will be a matter for discussion and agreement under an agreed process which is being managed and facilitated by Tusla.  The first meeting in this agreed process is to take place later this month.</p>  <p>  Tusla has advised that Sneem Family Resource Centre will continue to administer its Programme funding until the process is completed and will continue to receive Tusla funding for counselling services during the process.</p></reply>

The Department of Children and Youth Affairs, which was established in 2011, has also been included in the CST membership in order to strengthen inter-sectoral collaboration. </p><p>The CST on foot of the Report drawn up by the Education and Health Working Group of the HSE Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People agreed to the establishment of a National Health and Education Steering Group.  The purpose of the Steering Group (a sub group of the CST) is to promote closer collaboration on children's disability issues, based on departmental policies, across the health, education and children and youth affairs sectors with particular reference to the development of guidance on local structures/linkages/protocols to facilitate a more joined up approach across the sectors as recommended in the Report.  The Steering Group has met on five occasions since it was established in mid 2014 and is currently examining the issue of local Education and Health Fora including their possible form and function. It will be reporting back to the CST on this issue later in the year.</p><p>The Health Service Executive, which has statutory responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services, is currently engaged in a reconfiguration of existing health related therapy resources for children with disabilities, including autism, to multi-disciplinary geographically based teams as part of its <i>National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years).  </i>This Programme is based on the recommendations of the <i>Report of the National Reference Group on Multidisciplinary Services for Children aged 5-18 Years,</i>which was produced by representatives of the professions and management involved in delivering multi-disciplinary services to children.  </p><p>The Programme aims to bring about equity and consistency, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of the child's difficulties.  The Programme is a key priority for the Executive's Social Care Directorate in 2015.  An additional &euro;4 million was specifically allocated in 2014 to drive implementation of the Programme.  This equates to approximately 80 therapy posts.  A further additional &euro;4m (full year cost of &euro;6m) has been allocated this year to assist in implementing the Programme.  </p><p>I have asked the HSE to provide the Deputy with the detailed operational information she has requested concerning its Progressing Disability Services Programme.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-19a.792.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051900067#WRO01200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 279, 284 and 286 to 289, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  Roaccutane (isotretinoin) is authorised for treating severe forms of acne which have been resistant to other standard therapies.  It should only be prescribed by or under the supervision of doctors with expertise in using the product and with a full understanding of the risk of therapy and the monitoring requirements.</p>  <p>  When first authorised for use in Ireland in 1983, roaccutane was authorised for the management of cystic or conglobate forms of acne vulgaris, or for use in cases of severe acne which have failed to respond to adequate courses of accepted therapy.</p>  <p>  Under European and Irish legislation, all medicinal products must be authorised before being marketed.  As part of the marketing authorisation application process the applicant company must submit evidence that the medicine meets clear and predefined standards of quality, safety and efficacy, relevant to its proposed therapeutic use.  This information is provided in a dossier and the type of data to be submitted is set out in EU Directives and guidelines.  Relevant Irish Regulations set out the requirements for companies and the procedure for the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) in assessing applications.</p>  <p>  Following assessment by the HPRA approval is given on the basis of a favourable benefit versus risk balance for the approved specific therapeutic indication.  The approved conditions for use are contained in the product information for patients and their doctors.</p>  <p>  Following authorisation, any change, for example new indications, updated safety information or product changes requires approval on foot of a formal application to vary the authorisation and the submission of relevant supporting data.  </p>  <p>  Once a medicine is approved and placed on the market, European and Irish legislation provides for ongoing monitoring of its benefits and risks.  This monitoring includes review and evaluation of suspected adverse reaction reports at National and EU level.  Roaccutane was most recently reviewed at EU level in April 2011 when further warnings regarding skin reactions were added to the product information for patients and their doctors.  The risk of depression associated with the use of roaccutane was also reviewed at that time.  However the existing comprehensive information on the risk of depression associated with roaccutane and the monitoring requirements provided on the product information were considered sufficient.  The inclusion of these, and other side effects and warnings, in the product information are on the basis of information on use of the product including reports of side effects from patients.</p>  <p>  The information for patients and for their doctors includes detailed advice on the risks associated with use of roaccutane and recommendations to minimise their occurrence.  The package leaflet advises patients to tell their doctor if they ever had any mental illness (including depression, suicidal behaviour or psychosis), or if they take medicines for any of these conditions.  It also advises them to contact their doctor immediately if they have signs of any of these problems.</p>  <p>  The information for doctors lists potential psychiatric disorders.  It emphasises that particular care needs to be taken in relation to patients with a history of depression and that all patients should be monitored for signs of depression during their treatment with the product and referred for appropriate treatment as necessary.  The benefits of treatment are considered to outweigh its risks when the product is used in accordance with the product information.  </p>  <p>  Monitoring of benefits and risks of medicines takes place through a system known as pharmacovigilance.  The EU passed new legislation in 2010 and 2012 to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the system and this legislation has been fully transposed into Irish legislation.  One of the goals of the new legislation is to provide access to more information related to the benefit-risk aspects of taking a medication as well as providing opportunity for patients and consumers to directly report suspected problems.</p>  <p>  The national regulatory medicines authorities (in Ireland the HPRA) in each EU member state are responsible for gathering and evaluating national adverse reaction reports and in turn, submitting these reports to the European Medicines Agency, which is responsible for the overall co-ordination of pharmacovigilance activities across the EU.</p>  <p>  Reporting of adverse events has been a function of the HPRA since its establishment as the Irish Medicines Board in 1995 and prior to 1995 by the National Drugs Advisory Board.</p>  <p>  Reporting of suspected adverse reactions by health professionals is undertaken on a voluntary basis with all health professionals strongly encouraged to report a suspected adverse reaction. These reports may be submitted at any time to the HPRA.  The HPRA regularly reminds health care professionals about reporting in its Drug Safety Newsletter and further information on reporting and access to reporting forms is available on the HPRA website.</p>  <p>  Reporting of suspected adverse reactions however is only one of a number of ways of identifying new adverse reactions. Individual reports of suspected adverse reactions alone are rarely sufficient to confirm that a certain reaction is caused by the medicine in question.  Other factors such as the extent and conditions of use of the medicine, the nature of the reaction, the condition being treated, any new conditions arising and other medicines taken by the patient have to be taken into account.  Further data is usually required, including worldwide spontaneous case reports, clinical trials and epidemiological studies, to confirm the reactions and help determine their significance.</p>  <p>  Under the Irish Medicines Board&rsquo;s Acts 1995 and 2006, members of the HPRA are appointed by the Minister for Health.  In the case of 1 position, i.e. the chairperson of the HPRA&rsquo;s Advisory Committee for Veterinary Medicines, the appointment is subject to the consent of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that in 2011 this Government introduced new arrangements for appointments to State Boards which have contributed to greater openness and transparency in the appointments process.  Further reforms were announced by the Government in November 2014 whereby all appointments will be advertised openly on the State Boards portal operated by the Public Appointments Service (PAS), meet specific criteria necessary for the effective performance of the role and be processed in a transparent manner.</p>  <p>  Each member of the HPRA Authority brings to the HPRA essential expertise in areas such as human and veterinary  medicines, pharmacy, medical devices and  finance.  The members  are highly qualified and well respected professionals in their field and political affiliation is not a consideration.  I would also like to refer the Deputy to the detailed and extensive provisions in place governing ethics in public office, conflicts of interest and codes of conduct which govern the activities of all appointees to State Boards, including the HPRA.</p>  <p>  Since its foundation in 1995 the HPRA has played a key role in ensuring that health products used by Irish patients are safe.  I am satisfied that the HPRA operates to the highest standards of probity, accountability and transparency in its dealings with pharmaceutical companies, health professionals and patients alike.</p></reply>

The legislation includes a proposal to prohibit the sale of all tobacco products from self-service vending machines.  My Department has conducted a public consultation on this legislation, the results of which will inform the Regulatory Impact Analysis and the General Scheme of a Bill.

In that context, the Government introduced the Health (Amendment) Act 2013, which provides for the charging of all private in-patients in public acute hospitals.  The Government believes that the charge for private care in public hospitals should cover the hospitals' costs of providing the service, including the non-consultant hospital doctors, nursing staff, medical and surgical supplies, diagnostics, operating theatres, administration and support staff.</p>  <p>  Section 55 of the Health Act 1970, as amended by the Health (Amendment) Act 2013, provides for the making available of private in-patient services and the charging for those private in-patient services.  The charge relates to the provision of in-patient services, rather than the use of a bed in a hospital. Persons who opt to be treated on a private basis on admission to hospital are liable for the fees of all consultants involved in his or her care and for hospital charges under Section 55 for that episode of care.  The charge is a per diem rate, which is a flat rate daily charge, dependent on the category of hospital treating the patient and on whether a person is accommodated in a single or multiple occupancy room or on a day case basis.  The per diem charges set out in the 2013 legislation were informed by overall cost of the provision of the private in-patient services and the policy of moving towards the recovery of full economic cost.  While a per diem charging system has the advantage of being relatively straightforward for the hospital, patient and insurer to understand, it does not directly relate to the cost of specific treatments provided to individual private patients, the level of complexity of a case or the costs of individual hospitals.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Deputy's questions concerning tax breaks for private hospitals and a land gift scheme, these are matters for the Department of Finance and should be referred to that Department for reply.</p></reply>

All medical card holders are entitled to specific dental treatments e.g., an annual dental examination, two fillings in each calendar year, extractions as necessary.  Additional treatments are available to persons with specific medical conditions, including persons in receipt of care or services for a disability, persons on a register of disability and more vulnerable clients.  The HSE prioritises for treatment patients with special needs, high risk patients and those who have greater clinical needs and will continue to monitor the operation of the DTSS to ensure the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of available resources.  The budget for the DTSS is &euro;76 million this year.  The Minister for Social Protection is responsible for the Dental Treatment Benefit Scheme (DTBS), which provides an annual dental examination to qualified people.  The budget for the DTBS is approximately &euro;11 million.</p>  <p>  Dental services for children up to 16 years of age and persons of all ages with special needs are provided by the Public Dental Service of the HSE through its dental clinics.  All HSE dental clinics prioritise emergency care for children up to 16 years of age, treatment for special needs patients and screening of children aged from 11 to 13 years, including referral for orthodontic services where necessary.  Other services, including screening of children 6 to 8 years, are provided but may be deferred in clinics where there is pressure on resources.  The budget for the PDS is estimated at &euro;60 million.</p>  <p>  The full cost to the State of providing free dental care for all citizens would depend on numerous factors, including the underlying oral health of the population, the level of take-up of dental services, the level of service provided, and the cost of contracting such services on behalf of the State.  Neither the Department nor the HSE collects data on private spending that is incurred by individuals paying for dental care.  Future service provision will be informed by the National Oral Health Policy, which the Department of Health is currently developing.</p></reply>

On that date, there were 3,067 medical practitioners registered on the Specialist Division of the Medical Council&rsquo;s Register in the Specialty of General Practice. Holding registration does not necessarily mean that the medical practitioner is in active practice in General Practice at this time.  The above figure states the number of practitioners registered and entitled to practice as specialists in General Practice.</p>  <p>  On 1st July 2010, the total GP trainee intake increased from 120 to 157 training places per year for the 14 GP Specialist (Vocational) Training Programmes.  Currently all GP training programmes are of 4 years duration.  The HSE has recently been in discussion with the Irish College of General Practitioners about the potential to increase this year's trainee intake.  This has resulted in an additional four training places for the July 2015 intake.   </p>  <p>  The data for 2012 in respect of GPs per 1,000 head of population collated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) indicates that Ireland comes around mid-table with 0.72 GPs.  This compares with France (top) with 1.56 GPs and Korea (bottom) with 0.12 GPs.  Only four countries on the list exceeded one GP per 1,000 head of population.  The United Kingdom had 0.8 GPs. OECD data for 2013 is not yet available but the ratio for Ireland has increased to 0.75 GPs per 1,000 for that year.</p></reply>

The circular states that "where a doctor lives or practises in a centre with a population of less than 500 and where there is not a town with a population of 1,500 or more within a 4.83 kilometre (three mile) radius of that centre the doctor will be entitled to special rural practice concessions", including an RPA.  The current annual RPA is &euro;16,216.07.</p>  <p>  Where a GP currently holds an RPA but the circumstances underpinning this have changed, i.e. the centre of population is now greater than 500 and/or there is a town with a population of 1,500 or more within a three-mile radius of that centre, then the GP retains the RPA while they practice.  However, the requirement for an RPA for the area is determined afresh in respect of any new GP practice.</p>  <p>  No GP had the Rural Practice Allowance withdrawn in 2014. The criteria for the allowance are reviewed on the retirement/resignation of a doctor who was in receipt of the allowance.  Five GPs that retired in 2014 had been in receipt of an RPA.  On retirement, these posts were reviewed and it was deemed that they no longer met the criteria for payment of an RPA.</p>  <p>  Under the February 2015 Memorandum of Understanding between the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive and the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO), talks have commenced on a new GMS GP contract.  It is envisaged that the review of the GMS contract and other publicly funded health sector contracts with GPs will include consideration of how best to support General Practice in urban/deprived and rural areas so as to best meet the needs of patients with regard to the provision of general practitioner services.  The Rural Practice Allowance, including any change to the existing criteria, will be considered as a part of these discussions.</p></reply>

This will enable patients with a Medical/GP Visit Card and who have Type 2 Diabetes to avail of two annual visits to their GP practice for a structured review of their condition.

Records of the capital grants paid to health boards or voluntary hospitals prior to 01/07/1994 are paper based and the files are archived. Also, prior to the establishment of the HSE, block capital grants were paid to the Health Boards and to the Eastern Regional Health Authority (ERHA) from its establishment for distribution as authorised to the hospitals in their areas. As the very high level data in the following table is available, it is not proposed to do the extensive search necessary to extract the requested data from the relevant archived files prior to 1996 as this exercise would require considerable staff resources. </p><p>The HSE will be requested to provide information on expenditure on acute hospital projects for the period since 2005 and to reply directly to you.

There will always be more projects than can be funded by the Exchequer. Therefore any further investment in acute care must be considered in the context of the establishment of hospital groups, within the overall acute hospital sector infrastructure programme and within the multi-annual capital envelope available to the health service. There is limited funding available for new projects over the next multi-annual period 2015-2019 given the level of commitments and the costs to completion already in place. In addition, the HSE cannot exceed or plan to exceed its approved commitment thresholds. It is concentrating on applying thelimited funding available for capital works in the most effective way possible to meet acute care need now and in the future.<table><tr><th><b>County </b></th><th><b>Acute </b></th><th><b>Year completed</b></th><th><b>Hospital</b></th><th><b>Project Cost (approx. figures)</b></th></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>Acute</td><td>1998/1999</td><td>Mercy Hospital, Cork <br /><br /></td><td>&euro;18m</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>Acute</td><td>2002</td><td>Cork University Hospital</td><td>&euro;15m</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>Acute</td><td>2004</td><td>Cork University Hospital <br /><br /></td><td>&euro;27m</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>Acute</td><td>2006</td><td>Letterkenny General Hospital <br /><br /></td><td>&euro;2m</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>Acute</td><td>1998</td><td>Tallaght Hospital  - New Acute Teaching Hospital</td><td>&euro;183m</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>Acute</td><td>2000</td><td>St. Luke&rsquo;s &amp;amp; St. Anne&rsquo;s Hospital </td><td>&euro;29m</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>Acute</td><td>2000</td><td>Mater Hospital <br /><br /></td><td>&euro;6m</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>Acute</td><td>2001</td><td>Purchase of St. Joseph&rsquo;s Hospital, Raheny</td><td>&euro;13m</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>Acute</td><td>2002</td><td>St. James&rsquo;s Hospital <br /><br /></td><td>&euro;5m</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>Acute</td><td>2002</td><td>St. James&rsquo;s Hospital <br /><br /></td><td>&euro;8m</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>Acute</td><td>2002</td><td>Temple Street Children&rsquo;s Hospital <br /><br /></td><td>&euro;3m</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>Acute</td><td>2003 </td><td>Connolly Hospital <br /><br /></td><td>&euro;107m</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>Acute</td><td>2003</td><td>Rotunda Hospital Development <br /><br /></td><td>&euro;10m</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>Acute</td><td>2004</td><td>St. Colmcille&rsquo;s Hospital, Loughlinstown </td><td>&euro;6m</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>Acute</td><td>2004</td><td>Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin <br /><br /></td><td>&euro;31m</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>Acute</td><td>2004</td><td>St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital </td><td>&euro;5m</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>Acute</td><td>2005</td><td>St. James&rsquo;s Hospital <br /><br /></td><td>&euro;9m</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>Acute</td><td>2005</td><td>St. James&rsquo;s Hospital </td><td>&euro;39m</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>Acute</td><td>2005</td><td>Coombe Women&rsquo;s Hospital <br /><br /></td><td>&euro;2m</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>Acute</td><td>2005</td><td>St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital </td><td>&euro;212m</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>Acute</td><td>2006</td><td>Mater Hospital</td><td>&euro;22m</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>Acute</td><td>2000</td><td>University College Hospital Galway </td><td>&euro;26m</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>Acute</td><td>2001</td><td>Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe </td><td>&euro;8m</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>Acute</td><td>2002</td><td>Purchase of Portiuncula Hospital</td><td>&euro;12m</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>Acute</td><td>2004</td><td>University College Hospital Galway </td><td>&euro;102m</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>Acute</td><td>2003</td><td>Naas General Hospital</td><td>&euro;75m</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>Acute</td><td>2002</td><td>St. Luke&rsquo;s Kilkenny </td><td>&euro;4m</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>Acute</td><td>2003</td><td>Midland Regional Hospital at Portlaoise</td><td>&euro;34m</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>Acute</td><td>1997</td><td>Limerick Regional Hospital </td><td>&euro;28m</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>Acute</td><td>2000</td><td>Limerick Regional Hospital</td><td>&euro;36m</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>Acute</td><td>2005</td><td>Limerick Maternity Hospital</td><td>&euro;4m</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>Acute</td><td>1997</td><td>Purchase of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital<br /><br /></td><td>&euro;7m</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>Acute</td><td>2004</td><td>Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital</td><td>&euro;2m</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>Acute</td><td>2002</td><td>Mayo General Hospital </td><td>&euro;47m</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>Acute</td><td>2004</td><td>Roscommon Co.

The first phase will be for all children aged under 6 years. This service will commence during the summer. In parallel with this, the second phase will extend universal GP care without fees to all persons aged 70 years and over, subject to the passing of the necessary legislation These measures represent a major step on the way to universal health care. By this summer, approximately 800,000 people in Ireland will benefit from universal access to GP services.  </p>  <p>  The introduction of a universal GP service constitutes a fundamental element in the Government's health reform programme. The current Government is the first in the history of the State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. The principles of universality and equity of access mean that all residents in Ireland should be entitled to access a GP service. </p>  <p>  Children under 6 will benefit from a new enhanced service under the proposed GP contract.  This will involve age-based preventive checks focused on health and well-being and the prevention of disease. The contract will also cover an agreed cycle of care for children diagnosed with asthma. The costs of the enhanced GP service for all children under 6 years of age will be approximately &euro;67 million. </p>  <p>  Previously estimates of costs of providing a universal GP service were made on the basis of the existing scope of the service, rates of payments to GPs and eligibility. At this time, in the absence of a detailed analysis of the make-up of this cohort, it would not be possible to provide a valid estimate in respect of those in receipt of Carer's Allowance. </p></reply>

Currently, three ambulances during the day and two at night provide emergency cover in Roscommon town.  In addition, a rapid response vehicle, crewed by an advanced paramedic, provides cover on a 24/7 basis.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the model of ambulance service delivery is changing. The service is moving away from the model of care where services are provided to a local area from a fixed ambulance base located in that area, and moving to a model of strategic deployment.  In this context, the general area of Roscommon can be supported from the north by services from Boyle and Carrick-on-Shannon, to the east by crews in Longford and Mullingar and to the south from Athlone. Services are now coming on stream at Tuam and Mulranny stations which will enhance coverage across the region of north Galway, west Roscommon and east Mayo.</p>  <p>  Refurbishment of the former Garda station at Loughglynn is now completed and discussions are under way in relation to the staffing of this facility. The Loughglynn station will allow for strategic placement of emergency ambulance resources during shifts, to ensure coverage across the region as required.</p>  <p>  The Emergency Aeromedical Service (EAS), operated from Athlone by the Air Corps and staffed by NAS advanced paramedics, is also providing support to the people of the western region. The EAS provides swift transfers of seriously ill or injured patients to appropriate hospitals. Almost 1,000 missions have been completed since June 2012.  Roscommon and Mayo are the two counties which have benefited most from the availability of the EAS.</p>  <p>  The Deputy can be assured that I intend to drive further improvements to the ambulance service. In the next few months the NAS will receive the report of an independent capacity review, which, I hope, will provide guidance on the optimum deployment of resources, including deployment in specific geographic locations.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-19a.1034.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051900071#WRS03200"><p>While I would welcome the publication of perinatal data by hospital, it must be pointed out that perinatal mortality statistics are complex.  Reporting on these rates has been hampered by different definitions of stillbirth both nationally and internationally. In Ireland, four difference agencies are involved in the compilation and reporting of perinatal mortality data.  The analysis presented in the <i>Report of the Chief Medical Officer into Perinatal Deaths in Portlaoise Hospital (February 2014) </i>showed that there are weaknesses and inconsistencies in perinatal data collection, collation and reporting.</p><p>Perinatal death is a rare event in Ireland.  Given the small numbers involved the use of perinatal mortality rates by hospital as an indicator of patient safety creates a risk of false reassurance and also can raise false alerts.  It is, therefore, important to look at these in conjunction with, for example, confidence intervals per hospital and other methods in order to distinguish between the stability of estimates based on small versus large numbers. Therefore, caution needs to be exercised in the interpretation of perinatal data by hospital for the reasons set out.</p><p>A number of actions are being taken to address these discrepancies as follows:</p><p>- The notification of stillbirths is a mandatory requirement in the Civil Registration Act (2004).  This Act was amended in 2014 to make notification of early neonatal deaths mandatory.  The General Registration Office is working on the commencement of this.</p><p>- In addition the HSE has agreed to progress agreement of definitions and reporting of perinatal statistics in Ireland.  This would include systems such as the National  Perinatal Reporting System and the National  Perinatal Epidemiological Centre.</p><p>It should be noted, however, that national statistics on perinatal events are very important in benchmarking with other countries.  Irish national  perinatal data compare favourably with other OECD Member States which provides a level of reassurance on the quality of maternity services in Ireland. </p><p>National perinatal mortality data in respect of 2014 are still being collated and validated and it is not clear at this stage when these data will be ready for publication.</p><p>Patient Safety oversight in hospitals must take into account broader activity trends which can provide early warning of safety risks and early identification of safety issues. The Chief Medical Officer's Report identified the need to develop a more accurate and timely alert system.  The Chief Medical Officer recommended that all maternity hospitals should develop a <i>Patient Safety Statement </i>which would be published and updated monthly and would be used with other available information to risk-rate services and to target quality improvement measures that enhance local ownership and capability. Ideally a<i>Patient Safety Statement </i>should be presented and discussed at the senior management team meetings every month, as a standing agenda item.  </p><p>This should set out trends in relation to activity, interventions, complaints, adverse incidents, serious incidents, transfers, staffing and any other appropriate information from the perspective of patient safety and quality. This should be part of an on-going quality improvement  cycle. The Health Service Executive is progressing the CMO's recommendation. </p><p>I would like to assure the Deputy that work in on-going to improve the data sources and the quality and safety of maternity units nationally. </p></reply>

There is no entitlement to a medical card for a person with a particular illness or medical condition. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware of the publication of the <i>Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility</i>and the <i>Medical Card Process Review</i>in November 2014. Key findings of the Expert Panel were that it would not be feasible, desirable or ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility  and that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.</p><p>However, the Government recognises that the health service needs to be responsive to the circumstances of people with significant medical needs.  Following publication of the two reports, in November 2014, the Minister for Health and I announced a series of measures to enhance the operation of the medical card scheme and make it more sensitive to people&rsquo;s needs, especially where serious illness is involved. Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant's means exceed the prescribed threshold. Where a person does not qualify for a medical card, they may be provided with a GP Visit Card, appropriate therapy or other community supports or drugs.</p><p>The medical card system is now operating in a more sensible and sensitive manner. The HSE is exercising greater discretion, as is evident in the increase in the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation - by over 63% from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 85,000 at the end of April this year.</p><p>The Long Term Illness (LTI) Scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act, 1970 (as amended) under which the<i></i>HSE may make arrangements for the supply without charge of drugs, medicines or medical and surgical appliances<i></i>to persons suffering from a prescribed disease or disability of a permanent or long-term nature.

The Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2015 re-controlled substances which had been controlled by means of Government Order and also re-confirmed regulations made under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 as if they were an Act of the Oireachtas. A second Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill is currently being drafted to restore the Government's power to control new drugs and amend a number of other provisions under which regulations are made.  It is intended that this second Bill will be enacted before the end of this year, following which it will be possible to amend existing Regulations.</p></reply>

The aim of this policy is to provide a consistent approach to protect persons at risk of abuse across, for example, older people and disability services.  This new policy is for all HSE and HSE funded services, and builds upon and incorporates existing policies in this regard.  As this policy is implemented in 2015 there will be changes to strengthen Safeguarding and Protection Teams in each Community Healthcare Organisation.  Clear procedures are being developed at operational level where concerns arise relating to vulnerable persons.</p><p>Therefore<i>, Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse</i>now provides one overarching policy to which all agencies will subscribe and implement in their place of work ensuring:</p><p>- a consistent approach to protecting vulnerable people from abuse and neglect;</p><p>- all services have a publicly declared 'No Tolerance' approach to any form of abuse;</p><p>- a culture which supports that this ethos is promoted.</p><p>In addition, the Medical Council is responsible for the regulation of doctors in Ireland.  One of its main responsibilities is to protect the public by promoting and ensuring the highest professional standards amongst doctors.  If an individual is of the opinion that these standards have been breached, along the lines specified by the Deputy, then they may make a complaint to the Council about an individual doctor on the grounds of  professional misconduct.  It should also be noted that it is open to any individual to contact either the HSE or the Garda&iacute; to inform them of any suspicion of a crime of the nature raised, so that a proper investigation may be carried out by relevant agencies.</p><p>In the light of the above, I have referred the Deputy's question to the HSE for direct reply, in relation to a more detailed response on the specific  operational issues raised as regards the provision of mental health care by the Executive.</p></reply>

It recommends, broadly, a move away from the traditional institutional based model of care to a more patient-centred, flexible and community based service, where the need for hospital admission is greatly reduced while still providing in-patient care, as appropriate.  This Government has prioritised the reform and resourcing of our mental health services in line with <i>A Vision for Change,</i>and has significantly progressed this through the provision of &euro;125 million since 2012, to underpin a range of new services initiatives to meet this widely agreed strategy objective. This sustained investment in mental health since 2012 has resulted in over 1,150 new staff for the sector.  </p><p><i>A Vision for Change </i>contained a commitment that it would be reviewed after 7 years.  It was decided to give priority to the review of the Mental Health Act 2001, after which consideration would again be given to reviewing <i>Vision</i>and establishing independent monitoring arrangements.  The Expert Group which I set up to review the Mental Health Act 2001 has now completed its work and I plan to shortly seek Government approval for the drafting of a General Scheme of a Mental Health (Amendment) Bill to incorporate the recommendations of the review in revised legislation.  </p><p>Preliminary work on the development of a successor policy to <i>A Vision for Change</i>is under way and a review will commence as soon as possible.</p></reply>

A number of target dates over a range of the areas included in the Agreement will arise in the weeks ahead. To achieve these will require a concerted effort and an intensive political investment from the Northern Ireland Executive and from both Governments.</p>  <p>  It is important to recall how far we have come already in terms of the collective achievement of getting the Stormont House Agreement over the line in December and the progress made since then in implementing it.   Since the start of the year, the two Governments and the NI Executive Parties have held two comprehensive formal review meetings.  In February, a report on new priorities for North/South cooperation was agreed at a North South Ministerial Council meeting in Belfast.  Officials from Dublin, London and Belfast are preparing the groundwork for legislation to establish the new institutions for dealing with the past; and the Northern Ireland Party Leaders continue to meet regularly to take forward work across the broad areas of responsibility they undertook in Stormont House.  </p>  <p>  It is disappointing that difficulties have recently arisen around the welfare element of the Stormont House Agreement.  The Government is committed to the implementation of the totality of the provisions of the Agreement and it is important to ensure that the developments around the welfare issue do not have a corrosive impact on the wider implementation of the Agreement.   </p>  <p>  Now that the Westminster elections are over and a new UK Government is in place, there is an opportunity and obligation to refocus our efforts to implement the next phases of the Agreement.   I spoke with each of the NI Executive Party leaders in recent days and set out the Irish Government&rsquo;s views in this regard. This is an opportunity to demonstrate that politics delivers and to create a way forward on issues that have been a source of difficulty for far too long. </p>  <p>  I will also discuss these issues with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland when I meet her later today, following on from our constructive telephone conversation last week.   There are challenges ahead, not least on the issue of welfare, but I am confident that working together in good faith the parties in the Executive can deliver the solutions that the people of Northern Ireland expect and deserve.</p>  <p>  The next implementation and review meeting will take place in late June, when a six-month progress report will also be published by the two Governments. I will continue to keep this House informed of progress.</p></reply>

That European Council agreed a comprehensive strategy to respond to the humanitarian crisis, which includes tackling the root causes through continued provision of development assistance and supporting conflict resolution and capacity building in source countries in sub-Saharan Africa as well as measures to prevent further loss of life at sea.  Ireland is actively participating in follow up discussions at EU level on various strands.</p>  <p>  The strategy requires action across a range of Departments and consultation between Departments.  One of the commitments agreed by the European Council concerns a possible CSDP mission.  My Department has been taking the lead role in respect of this mission.  As this will be a military mission, my officials have consulted closely with the Department of Defence.  The Minister for Defence and I were both present for the discussion at the Joint Council meeting yesterday.</p>  <p>  At the Council meeting Ministers adopted a Council Decision to establish a CSDP Mission, EUNAVFOR MED.  The mission will implement its mandate in several phases.</p>  <p>  The EU Political and Security Committee, acting under the responsibility of the Council of Ministers, will decide on when to make the transition between the different phases, taking into account any applicable UN Security Council Resolution and consent by the coastal states concerned.</p>  <p>  In discussions to date Ireland has insisted that the CSDP operation should be carried out in full accordance with international law.  We have highlighted the need for appropriate UN Security Council authorization for measures which are not already permitted under international law.  We have also placed particular emphasis on ensuring that any vessels assigned to the CSDP operation will be ready and equipped to perform Search and Rescue tasks as necessary.</p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality is leading on a number of other aspects of the European Council&rsquo;s comprehensive strategy, but consults with my Department, and with others, as appropriate.</p></reply>

The Office of the Prosecutor has indicated that the competent national authority continues to have a criminal case registered against two persons on charges of fraud and &lsquo;acquisition of capital&rsquo;. In July 2013 an order was issued for their arrest, but it would appear that this order remains outstanding.</p>  <p>  As the criminal case is still ongoing in Dubai, and the question of the enforcement of outstanding foreign arrest orders is strictly a matter for the local authorities, as things stand there is nothing further that the Embassy or Department can do to assist on this matter.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs does not have a budget to appoint lawyers or pay for legal costs incurred by citizens involved in legal proceedings abroad. As you will appreciate, given the large numbers of Irish citizens travelling, doing business and entering into contracts overseas, it is simply not possible for my Department to maintain a budget for such legal representation. It would also be inappropriate for us to be in a position of making judgments on the merits of which specific cases we could or could not fund. </p>  <p>  The difficulty and financial hardship that the family now find themselves in is clear from the correspondence my Department has received from them, but unfortunately it would appear that there is no further consular assistance that can be offered to them by my Department at the current time.  This is a criminal case in the UAE based on a commercial legal dispute. Both criminal cases and commercial legal disputes abroad are subject to local law and legal/settlement proceedings and the Department cannot interfere in those local judicial processes. Similarly, for reasons outlined above, the consular assistance that we can offer to citizens does not include the provision of expert legal advice on foreign disputes, nor financial support to employ legal representation in respect of legal disputes abroad.</p>  <p>  I regret to inform the Deputy that, following careful consideration of the case, it is the considered view of the Department that there is no further action that we can take to assist these individuals at this time.</p></reply>

I believe that this policy of engagement, dialogue and scrutiny, which is ongoing, regular and structured, is the best way to promote human rights and the interests of labour in Colombia.</p>  <p>  The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia has pointed out that an end to the longstanding armed conflict - now under negotiation between the government and the main guerrilla organisation in the context of the peace talks in Havana - has the potential to transform Colombia in terms of its level of respect for and enjoyment of human rights. As I noted at the Foreign Affairs Council on 20 April, the peace process in Colombia is potentially one of the most significant advances in conflict resolution the region has seen and we strongly support it.</p>  <p>  The Embassy of Ireland at Mexico City is accredited also to Bogot&aacute;. The Ambassador and diplomatic staff regularly discuss human rights issues with government interlocutors during their visits to Colombia and meet with international and local civil society organisations working on human rights issues there, including on labour and environmental rights. The Embassy oversees Irish Aid funding in Colombia, which supports civil society organisations, with a focus on the protection of human rights defenders and raising awareness of violations. In addition, Irish Aid provides funding to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, focused on their work in support of human rights in south-west Colombia.</p>  <p>  Negotiations on the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership - an international agreement among the EU, the US and Canada - are led by my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise, and Innovation.</p></reply>

Our work in Irish Aid&rsquo;s key partner countries includes support for the training of health workers to oversee and deliver quality basic services and to increase coverage to reach those most in need.  Ireland has also made a strong impact in investing globally, regionally and at national level to help overcome HIV and AIDS and other pandemics including Malaria, Tuberculosis and Ebola.</p><p>The Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI)<b></b>has been a valued partner of Irish Aid in this work in two of our partner countries, Mozambique and Lesotho.  The Initiative has also been instrumental in re-shaping international pharmaceutical markets to dramatically reduce the cost of life-saving anti-retroviral drugs and diagnostics. </p><p>Over the period 2003-2015, Irish Aid has provided a total of over &euro;162 million for the fight against HIV and AIDS in Mozambique and Lesotho, most of it channelled directly through the Ministries of Health in both countries.  In the past five years, in the framework of our cooperation with the Clinton Health Access Initiative, &euro;68.2 million has been provided directly to the Ministries of Health in Mozambique and Lesotho and &euro;1.8 million to the Clinton Health Access Initiative for the provision of technical support.  As most funding is channelled directly to the two Health Ministries, Ireland is not represented on the boards of the Clinton Foundation or the Clinton Health Access Initiative.</p><p>Details of funding in the period 2011 to 2015 are set out in the following table. <table><tr><th><b>Year</b></th><th><b>Funding to CHAI Mozambique</b></th><th><b>Funding to Ministry of Health Mozambique</b></th><th><b>Funding to CHAI Lesotho</b></th><th><b>Funding to Ministry of Health Lesotho</b></th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;295,000</td><td>&euro;12,000,000</td><td>-</td><td>&euro;4,150,000</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;200,000</td><td>&euro;12,000,000</td><td>-</td><td>&euro;3,860,600</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;250,000</td><td>&euro;12,000,000</td><td>&euro;343,077</td><td>&euro;236,800</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;250,000</td><td>&euro;12,000,000</td><td>&euro;500,000</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>-</td><td>&euro;12,000,000</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Totals:</td><td>&euro;995,000</td><td>&euro;60,000,000</td><td>&euro;843,077</td><td>&euro;8,247,400</td></tr></table></p><p>As a result of this work, there has been a marked improvement in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Mozambique.

This meeting took place while we were in the process of considering our recommendations to Honduras for their Universal Periodic Review at the UN Human Rights Council. As a matter of principle, Ireland is always open to, and welcomes consultation with, civil society as part of the UPR process.</p>  <p>  Since the establishment of the Human Rights Council in March 2006, Ireland has engaged proactively with the Universal Periodic Review process. This allows for the review of the domestic human rights records of all 193 UN Member States, based on their international human rights obligations. It is aimed at improving the human rights situation on the ground and addressing human rights violations wherever they occur. Any UN Member State can take part in the interactive dialogue, and the process enables UN Member States to raise issues and to make recommendations about the protection and promotion of human rights in the State concerned.</p>  <p>  In the case of Honduras, Ireland made two recommendations, on legislation to protect human rights defenders, and to guarantee the protection and the effective access to justice for women who are victims of violence.</p></reply>

Ireland remains supportive of all efforts to assist in the search for a mutually acceptable settlement to this long-standing problem.  In this context, the resumption of the negotiations last Friday between the leaders of the two communities in Cyprus is very much to be welcomed.  I was pleased to see that President Anastasiades welcomed the choice of Mr Mustafa Akinci as the new leader of the Turkish Cypriot community and that Mr Akinci has said that he is eager to bolster an atmosphere of trust between the two communities.</p>  <p>  This, I hope, is an encouraging sign for the outcome of the negotiations ahead. As Special Adviser Eide, the UN facilitator, has said, the resumption of talks &lsquo;is a unique opportunity&rsquo;.

Ireland is currently a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council and we pursue our human rights priorities in many international fora.  Ireland is a firm supporter of the European Court of Human Rights and the European Convention of Human Rights system and liaises regularly with the UK in relation to the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers&rsquo; supervision of states&rsquo; implementation of Court judgments.  I should note clearly at the outset there is not at this time any legislation before the British Parliament at Westminster to repeal the 1998 UK Human Rights Act.  Indeed the new British Government has not yet published its legislative programme for this parliamentary term, although it is expected to do so later this month.  In the absence of any detailed proposal it is difficult to speculate on potential consequences. Obviously were any proposal to be made it would have to be carefully analysed.  On the broad question of human rights and the Good Friday Agreement, the views of the Government are clear and unchanged.  The protection of human rights in Northern Ireland law, predicated on the European Convention of Human Rights, is one of the key principles underpinning the Agreement.  As a guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government takes very seriously its responsibility to safeguard its institutions and principles.  The fundamental role of human rights in guaranteeing peace and stability in Northern Ireland cannot be taken for granted and must be fully respected.  The Good Friday Agreement is clear that there is an obligation to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into Northern Ireland law and this is an ongoing obligation.</p>  <p>  Placing human rights at the heart of the peace process in Northern Ireland has helped to ensure the participation and trust of all communities.  A shared emphasis on human rights and all that this implies is part of what makes the peace process credible and effective.  The Government will work closely with the UK Government and with the power-sharing Executive in Belfast to ensure that the protection of human rights remains at the heart of civic life, politics and ongoing societal change in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  We will follow closely all developments in this regard. I plan to raise this matter with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland when I meet her later today.</p></reply>

While we do not interfere in the internal judicial proceedings of other countries, we would of course urge that the case be resolved in accordance with Mexican law.  The promotion and protection of human rights is a core principle of Ireland's foreign policy and we have prioritised the protection of trades unionists, human rights defenders and others who are in immediate danger.  Our Embassy in Mexico participates actively in the EU-Mexico Human Rights Dialogue, which took place most recently in Mexico City on 15-16 April.  In addition to consulting with civil society organisations, EU and Mexican human rights experts discussed a wide range of human rights issues, including challenges relating to the rule of law, the fight against impunity, and human rights defenders.  The Embassy also maintains an active dialogue with international and local civil society partners in Mexico, including Amnesty, on a range of development and human rights issues.</p></reply>

The allocation processes at both primary and post primary level also include an appeals mechanism under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  The Appeal Boards operate independently of the Department and their decisions are final.  The final staffing position for all schools at primary and post primary level will ultimately not be known until the Autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and any appeals to the Staffing Appeal Boards will have been considered.</p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teaching and Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support to schools to support children with special educational needs and additional care needs respectively.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  As part of Budget 2015, I announced that an additional 365 Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts are being provided for in 2015, as well as an additional 480 Resource Teachers, to take into account increased demand and demographic growth and to ensure that children can continue to have access to additional supports in school. This is the highest number of Resource Teaching and SNA support that we have ever had.</p><p>  These increases, building on increases which have already been provided in recent years, will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.</p><p>  Details of resource teaching and SNA allocations which have been made to each school for 2014/15 are available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  The NCSE is currently processing applications from schools for resource teaching and SNA support for the coming school year.  Schools will be notified of their 2015/16 allocations shortly.</p><p>  I will arrange to have the Deputy's question forwarded to the NCSE for their direct reply in respect of information which has been requested regarding allocations to schools in 2011.</p></reply>

Discrimination against women in the workplace is unacceptable in any setting and the issues brought to light in that case are of serious concern to me.  For that reason, I have welcomed the response of NUI Galway in unreservedly accepting the ruling of the Tribunal and in establishing a Task Force to address related issues.  However, it is important that this taskforce has the confidence of both the student body and the staff.  I am aware of concerns about the proposed composition of the taskforce in Galway.  I want to repeat my view that having the broadest possible support for the taskforce at the outset is central to its important work, and I would urge NUIG to ensure that every effort is made to achieve that goal.</p><p>  More broadly, the Higher Education Authority is actively considering how best to support the improvement of gender equality across the Irish higher education system as a whole and is developing a database of staff employed in the sector, so that we can ensure gender-equality at all levels within the academic profession in Ireland becomes a reality.</p></reply>

The improvements in the Primary Staffing Schedule for small schools which I announced in February last are the only changes that I will be making to the staffing arrangements for schools for the 2015/16 school year.</p><p>  I also wish to advise the Deputy that an additional 365 Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts have been provided for in 2015, as well as an additional 480 Resource Teachers, which takes into account increased demand and demographic growth.</p><p>  11,300 SNA posts are available for allocation in 2015. 6705 resource teaching posts are also available to the NCSE to allocate to schools.  This is the highest number of Resource Teaching and SNA support that we have ever had and has ensured that children can continue to have access to additional supports in school.</p><p>  The number of posts which will be required for allocation in futures years will be considered as part of the annual budgetary and estimate process which takes place each year.</p><p> The Deputy will also be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has recommended the development of a new model for delivering teaching resources to schools to support students with special needs.</p><p>  Through consultations, there was a broad welcome for the proposed new model from Parents, disability groups, schools and stakeholders.  However, there has not been sufficient time to address all of the concerns which have been raised in advance of the 2015 school year.</p><p>  My Department is, however, continuing to develop the new allocation model for schools and is currently working to devise a pilot of the new model.  Issues regarding the number of resource teachers which will be required in future years will therefore be considered in the context of the development of a new allocation model.</p><p>  The Government's approach to restoring the economy has helped Ireland to return to a position where we are seeing economic growth.  It is a continuing improvement in our economic growth over a sustained period that will enable us to move to a point where we can look again at providing for additional teacher resources in schools which could bring about further improvement in PTR, class size and support for classroom teachers.</p></reply>

However, it was not possible to secure the funding which would be required to also increase the rates of capitation paid to our schools.</p><p>  The school funding measures introduced in Budget 2011 provided for a 5% reduction in funding for capitation and related grants to primary and second level schools.  This was applied to schools by a 5% reduction across the range of per capita grants.</p><p>  The multi annual school funding measures introduced in Budget 2012, provided for a 6% overall reduction in the funding for capitation and related grants to primary and second level schools.

The Education and Training Boards Act 2013 recognises this in providing that the general functions of an ETB include to "plan, provide, coordinate and review the provision of education and training, including education and training for the purpose of employment". While each of the 16 ETBs, therefore, has training functions under the 2013 Act, 5 ETBs, including Kildare and Wicklow ETB have not had a training centre transferred to them.  An interim approach was adopted in 2014 which provided for ETBs with or receiving training centres to retain primary responsibility for training and to continue to be accountable to SOLAS.    This approach is still in operation.</p>  <p>  The Reform Programme for the sector is actively supported and overseen by a Programme Board chaired by my Department's Secretary General and including members of the Department's senior management team and representatives from the sector.  In  March 2014, the ETB/SOLAS Programme Board agreed that a project should be established to examine the most likely options for a longer-term solution for 2015 and beyond for the 5 ETBs without a training centre.  Accordingly, my  Department engaged with the chief executives of these 5 non-training centre ETBs and with SOLAS in relation to how these ETBs would deliver on their training remit for 2014 and beyond. As part of its consideration of this issue, the Board agreed that the establishment of new training centres should not form part of these considerations.</p>  <p>  Following consultation with the sector,  the ETB/SOLAS Programme Board has decided that each ETB without a training centre should be allocated staffing and resources to deliver Contracted/Community Training and manage the Apprenticeship Employers in its area.   Work is now progressing on moving this project into a detailed planning phase.</p></reply>

The Centre will be headed by a Director who will be an experienced school principal. He or she will be supported by two other experienced school leaders, one each from the primary and post-primary sectors. The team will be recruited in the coming weeks.

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing arrangements for the 2015/2016 school year are set out in Circular 0005/2015 which is available on the website.At primary level the staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally. The primary staffing schedule currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils, with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools.</p>  <p>  The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level. My Department's guidance to schools is that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.). School authorities are also requested, where possible, to use their autonomy under the staffing schedule to implement smaller class sizes for junior classes.</p>  <p>  The Government's approach to restoring the economy has helped Ireland to return to a position where we are seeing economic growth. It is a continuing improvement in our economic growth over a sustained period that will enable us to move to a point where we can look again at providing for additional teacher resources in schools which could bring about further improvement in PTR, class size and support for classroom teachers.</p>  <p>  The challenge for all schools is to ensure that they utilise their allocated resources to best effect to maximise teaching and learning outcomes.</p></reply>

ACELS is a voluntary national scheme responsible for the development and management of the recognition and inspection of English language teaching organisations. It is not a regulatory body, as suggested by the Deputy in a number of his questions. ACELS therefore has no role in preparing regulations for the international education sector or in conducting either a regulatory impact assessment or an economic impact assessment of the sector.</p>  <p>  The objective of ACELS is to establish and maintain standards in English language teaching organisations. Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), the State agency which operates ACELS, is under the remit of the Ombudsman.</p>  <p>  As ACELS is a voluntary scheme, English language providers can operate in Ireland without having ACELS recognition. Equally, ACELS does not close English language providers or stop providers from operating and ACELS recognition is not compulsory for providers wishing to recruit international students. Many of the English language colleges that have closed over the last year have been operating in the State for a number of years without ACELS recognition.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's question in relation to the working conditions of teachers, the relationship between teachers and private colleges is based on a private contract so issues such salary and working hours are a matter between the two parties. The regulations governing ACELS recognised schools specify a requirement that all obligations relating to national employment legislation are complied with. If teachers have a concern about their terms and conditions of employment they should contact the National Employment Rights Authority in this regard.</p>  <p>  My Department and the Department of Justice and Equality have produced a package of reforms to the student immigration system for international education which will be brought to Government for its approval shortly. These reforms were prepared by the two Departments, rather than by ACELS or QQI.  While it is not possible to provide specific details of the reforms prior to their approval by Government as requested in a number of the Deputy's questions, I wish to inform the Deputy that the reforms are designed to improve the overall quality of offering to international students, improve protection for learners, enhance Ireland's reputation and diminish negative impacts on the Irish labour market and social protection costs, strongly in line with the goals of Ireland's international education strategy.</p>  <p>  Finally, there are no plans at present to introduce primary legislation for this sector.</p></reply>

The majority of English language schools in Ireland are privately run.  Education providers are subject to unannounced inspection by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and the Garda National Immigration Bureau for immigration control purposes.  English language training organisations registered for quality purposes with ACELS (Accreditation and Co-ordination of English Language Services) on a voluntary basis are inspected as part of the ACELS scheme. </p><p>  While I have every sympathy for the genuine affected students who lost money when the colleges closed, the relationship between students and private colleges is based on a private contract so there is no obligation on my Department or the State to provide refunds, or to pay for alternative provision.  For that reason, the Task Force which I established jointly with the Minister for Justice and Equality to assist affected students has worked closely with the representative bodies of the high-quality private sector providers to develop solutions that could provide alternative courses at a significantly discounted rate for students impacted by the closures who were not covered by learner protection arrangements.</p><p>  I am aware that liquidation proceedings are underway in certain cases, and students are pursuing claims as creditors through this process, including with the support of the Irish Council for International Students.  Students may also be entitled to a refund from their agent or credit-card company.</p><p>  My Department and the Department of Justice and Equality have produced a package of reforms to the student immigration system for international education which will be brought to Government for its approval shortly.  These reforms will drive a restructuring in the sector designed to improve the overall quality of offering to international students, improve protection for learners, enhance Ireland's reputation and diminish negative impacts on the Irish labour market and social protection costs, strongly in line with the goals of Ireland's international education strategy.</p></reply>

A total of 498 dwellings have now been accepted into the scheme of which 352 have technical consultants assigned to them and the necessary preparatory work, tendering or remediation is either under way or imminent. The remaining applications are being progressed through the initial application and validation stage or the assessment and verification process of the scheme.</p>  <p>  As matters stand, 15 dwellings have been completed to date, i.e. the pilot project of 5 dwellings completed in late 2014 plus another 10 dwellings completed recently. A further 6 projects, comprising 94 dwellings, are on site at present. Tender proposals have been received, or are due, in respect of another 5 remediation projects which will involve some 82 dwellings.  It is anticipated that an additional 4 remediation projects, in respect of 119 dwellings, will go out to tender shortly.</p>  <p>  The Board estimate that approximately 200 dwellings will be remediated under the scheme by the end of 2015. Ultimately, the timeframe for completion of remedial works to all affected dwellings will largely be influenced by the final number of applications that will be received under the scheme; in this regard, the scheme is open-ended.</p></reply>

My Department has in recent years requested local authorities to exercise restraint in setting, and where possible to reduce, ARVs and they have responded positively in this regard. The national average ARV decreased each year from 2010 to 2014; 2015 is not directly comparable due to the local authority mergers and the necessity to harmonise rates across new local authority areas.</p><p>Following the reorganisation of local government structures arising from the Local Government Reform Act 2014 there are now just 31 local authorities that adopt an Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV). This is a reduction from the 88 rating authorities which existed prior to the Act.</p><p>Because of the wide variances in ARVs within counties, it is not possible to achieve a single ARV per county without some ratepayers benefiting and others losing as a consequence. Moving rates downwards as a general policy would result in a very significant loss of income to the local government sector which would negatively affect the provision of services by local government. The challenge was to identify a solution that balanced these conflicting interests.</p><p>The local government reform programme requires authorities to harmonise ARVs across former rating authorities within each of the restructured 31 local authorities within a 10 year period, generally. This will ultimately result in one ARV being in place for each of the 31 authorities.

The Commissioner of Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters, including the method of valuation.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  The Valuation Act 2001 is a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation for each property determined by the Valuation Office to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.</p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge that commercial rates, as a local tax, and the rating system generally are deeply embedded in the local government system.  A large body of case law is well established and local authorities and ratepayers are, in the main, very familiar with, and generally accepting of, the operation and practice of the rating system.  Rates are also a stable source of financing for local government which is not affected unduly by short-term changes in economic circumstances.</p>  <p>  I will continue to keep the approach to rates by local authorities under active review, and am determined that every avenue will be pursued to optimise efficiency and contain costs in the local government sector.</p>  <p>  An amendment to the law has been included in the recently enacted Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 to provide for changes to the valuation of certain child care facilities.

It reported that rents nationally were 8.2% higher than in the first quarter of 2014, down from the 10.4% annual increase recorded in mid-2014. While the report recorded a slow-down in rent inflation in Dublin, this was offset by an increase in the surrounding counties.  These trends are broadly in line with the most recent data from the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) whose rent index is based on actual rents paid as opposed to the asking price.  The PRTB data shows that in the fourth quarter of 2014, rents were 5.8% higher nationally than in the same quarter of 2013.  Dublin, however, was seeing the highest rates of increase nationally with rents there higher by 9.6% over the same period although the rate of annual increase was down slightly.</p><p>The daft.ie report notes that a shortage of supply is at the heart of rising rents and the Government is addressing this on a number of fronts.  Construction 2020 A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector, published last year, is aimed at addressing issues in the property and construction sectors and ensuring that any bottlenecks that might impede the sector in meeting residential and non-residential demand are addressed. Construction 2020 also commits to identifying and implementing further improvements to the planning system to facilitate appropriate development.  The General Scheme for a Planning and Development (No. 1) Bill aimed primarily at addressing the current housing supply shortage situation was published in November 2014.  The main provisions in this Bill are:</p><p>- the revision of the Part V arrangements on social and affordable housing;</p><p>- retrospective application of reduced development contribution charges, and</p><p>- the introduction of a vacant site levy to incentivise urban regeneration and the provision of housing in central urban areas.</p><p>It is estimated that the revised Part V arrangements will contribute in the region of 4,000 housing units to the delivery of the output targets included in the Social Housing Strategy.  The Bill is currently being drafted in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel with a view to publication in the coming weeks and enactment before the summer recess.</p><p>Addressing the supply shortfall in housing will take time but in the period since the publication of Construction 2020, some welcome signs of recovery in the sector have become evident.  Particularly notable in this regard is the increase in the number of house completions in 2014 to 11,016 units nationally &ndash; an increase of 33% on the 2013 figure.  The latest figures for new house completions show that 2,629 units were completed in the first three months of 2015, up 26% on the corresponding figure for the first quarter 2014.</p><p>Social housing is a key priority for the Government, evidenced by the additional &euro;2.2 billion in funding announced for social housing in Budget 2015 and the publication of the Social Housing Strategy 2020 in November 2014.  The total targeted provision under the Social Housing Strategy 2020 of 110,000 social housing units includes the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units through Pillar 1.  The private rental sector, through Pillar 2 of the strategy, will accommodate up to 75,000 eligible low-income households primarily through the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme.  Social housing targets have been set for each local authority out to 2017 and are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .</p><p>The National Economic and Social Council (NESC) report Ireland&rsquo;s Rental Sector: Pathways to Secure Occupancy and Affordable Supply which was published last week, is a welcome and timely contribution to the debate around the rental sector.  The report calls for more secure occupancy for tenants, including greater rent certainty as well as measures to increase the supply of rental housing.  The recommendations put forward in this report will be considered carefully in the context of framing any measures in relation to the rental market.</p></reply>

The Statement also emphasises a housing-led approach which is about accessing permanent housing as the primary response to homelessness.  Such an approach to addressing homelessness is sometimes referred to as a &lsquo;housing-first&rsquo; model. Given the significance of housing-led/housing-first approaches to homelessness, both in Ireland and internationally, homelessness service providers often use these descriptions when identifying the ultimate objective of their services.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at local level. Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with the housing authorities.</p><p>A range of measures are being taken to secure a ring-fenced supply of accommodation to house homeless households and mobilise the necessary supports in order to deliver on the Government's target of ending involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016. These measures have been identified in the Government's Implementation Plan on the State's Response to Homelessness (May 2014) and in the Action Plan to Address Homelessness (December 2014).

That announcement followed proposals made by local authorities on their planned delivery of new social housing units out to 2017.</p>  <p>  The projects approved were those deemed most suitable to go ahead at this time. This was the first such announcement under the Social Housing Strategy and further announcements will be made as local authority proposals for the delivery of social housing units are evaluated. Information supplied by the local authorities on their proposals shows that 32 of the projects approved by me already have Part VIII planning approval. As this was an announcement of newly approved projects, it did not include any projects that are already under construction.</p>  <p>  The process for new build construction involves a number of stages, such as the appointment of consultants, design and planning stages, contractor procurement and ultimately the site build and sign-off period. In a social housing context, each of these stages must comply with the requirements of the Capital Works Management Framework, including in relation to the procurement elements of the process. Taking each of these stages into account, a minimum realistic timeline from inception to completion for a standard new build scheme on a serviced site would be 14-16 months, assuming no issues with planning or site vacancy exist.</p>  <p>  Given the foregoing, it is not possible at this stage to state the number of units that will be delivered each year from 2015 to 2017. However, I expect that all the projects involved will be advanced as quickly as possible and will be delivered by the end of 2017.</p></reply>

Under this Strategy a target of 3,000 units has been set for delivery in 2015 under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP). Within this overall target each individual Local Authority has a target for delivery under this Programme.   </p>  <p>  It is a matter for each Local Authority to determine the most appropriate mechanism for reaching their target under SHCEP. Under SHCEP, units can be acquired directly by Local Authorities through rental or leasing arrangements. They can also be sourced by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) through construction, purchase or leasing arrangements and can be leased by both AHBs and local authorities from the NAMA special purpose vehicle.   </p>  <p>  There is no specific breakdown of the individual local authority targets be tween these delivery mechanisms. However, it is expected that some 1,000 units of the 3,000 national SHCEP target will be delivered by Approved Housing Bodies in 2015. Each Local Authority is best placed to determine how best to meet their individual SHCEP targets using all the delivery mechanisms available to them, taking account of the particular housing circumstances in their area.   </p>  <p>  There are a wide variety of possible rental and lease terms available depending on the delivery mechanism used. Units acquired by local a uthorities through rental agreements are in general in place for up to 10 year s and under lease arrangements for up to 20 years. Arrangements put in place by AHBs range from a minimum of 10 years up to 30 years, with units delivered through the NAMA SPV (whether by a local authority or an AHB) having lease terms in place   for just over 20 years. </p>  <p>To the end of April 2015, 406 units have been delivered for social housing purposes under SHCEP in 2015. Of that number 60% of the units have agreements for 20 years or more and a further 12% have agreements for between 10 and 20 years. The remainder have agreements in place for less than 10 years.   </p></reply>

Applications for a new round of funding, which commenced on 1 July 2014, were subject to an appraisal process. 55 applications were approved for funding for the two-year period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016. A number of previously funded organisations were not approved for funding on this occasion.  Pobal were asked to undertake the management of the scheme and, in that context, put in place a dedicated team to deal with any inquiries from applicants and to provide detailed feedback. Furthermore, an appeals process was put in place, on foot of which Pobal submitted a report, which is currently being considered.</p><p>On 18 July 2014, it was announced that bridging funding of &euro;1.4 million would be allocated for a twelve month period to a number of previously funded health, disability and other organisations that were not approved for funding under the new scheme, pending the carrying out of a review of the public funding of national organisations in the health and disability sector. This bridging funding in 2014/2015 will enable organisations to plan for their future, whether with or without State support, such as that provided under the SSNO. Details of the bridging funding provided are set out in the table below. </p><p>The review process is well underway and is being advanced in consultation with the Department of Health. The review is designed to rationalise the funding of these organisations to ensure efficiency in the use of public money and avoidance of duplication, while providing appropriate support to organisations working in the sector. The Health Service Executive and Pobal are also participating in the review. All organisations in receipt of bridging funding have been contacted to make submissions as part of the review process. A number of meetings have also taken place with representative organisations.  I intend to complete and publish the outcome of the review in the coming weeks.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">Bridging Funding Provided 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015</font><table><tr><th>National Organisations</th><th>Funding Scheme</th></tr><tr><td>Arthritis Ireland</td><td>53,882</td></tr><tr><td>Asperger Syndrome Association of Ireland Ltd</td><td>41,448</td></tr><tr><td>Asthma Society of Ireland</td><td>41,448</td></tr><tr><td>Breaking Through Limited</td><td>58,028</td></tr><tr><td>Chronic Pain Ireland Limited</td><td>37,304</td></tr><tr><td>Dyslexia Association of Ireland</td><td>62,172</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic and Inherited Disorders Organisation Ltd</td><td>16,580</td></tr><tr><td>GROW in Ireland</td><td>16,580</td></tr><tr><td>Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland Limited</td><td>19,066</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Deaf Society The National Association of the Deaf Limited</td><td>62,172</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Heart Foundation</td><td>41,448</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Mountain Rescue Association</td><td>58,028</td></tr><tr><td>Irish National Council of Attention Deficit Disorder Support (INCADDS)</td><td>33,158</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Stammering Association</td><td>24,868</td></tr><tr><td>Migraine Association of Ireland Ltd</td><td>29,014</td></tr><tr><td>Motor Neuron disease Association</td><td>24,868</td></tr><tr><td>MOVE Ireland</td><td>41,448</td></tr><tr><td>Muintir na T&iacute;re</td><td>70,462</td></tr><tr><td>Muscular Dystrophy Ireland</td><td>37,304</td></tr><tr><td>National Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus Ireland Limited</td><td>37,304</td></tr><tr><td>National Association for Youth Drama Ltd</td><td>29,014</td></tr><tr><td>New Communities Partnership (NCP) Ltd</td><td>74,606</td></tr><tr><td>Peter Bradley Foundation Limited</td><td>41,448</td></tr><tr><td>Post Polio Support Group Limited</td><td>24,868</td></tr><tr><td>Safe Ireland</td><td>74,606</td></tr><tr><td>Show Racism The Red Card Limited</td><td>29,014</td></tr><tr><td>Suas Educational Development </td><td>37,304</td></tr><tr><td>The Alzheimer Society of Ireland</td><td>62,172</td></tr><tr><td>The Carers Association Limited</td><td>62,172</td></tr><tr><td>The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland</td><td>49,738</td></tr><tr><td>The Neurological Alliance of Ireland</td><td>49,738</td></tr><tr><td>The Union of Voluntary Organisations of People with Disabilities</td><td>45,592</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water shall collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it in accordance with a water charges plan to be approved by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).</p><p>Section 22(5) of the Act provides that a water charges plan may provide for charges in respect of the provision of a service connection (within the meaning of the Water Services Act 2007) to, or in respect of, a premises. In its decision on Irish Water&rsquo;s Water Charges Plan, published in October 2014, the CER stated that, until it made a decision on Irish Water&rsquo;s new connection charges, Irish Water should continue to apply the rates which were charged by the local authorities at 31 December 2013.  Although Tipperary County Council is now the amalgamation of North Tipperary County Council and South Tipperary County Council, including Clonmel Borough Council, all of these entities were still in place as of 31st December 2013 and as such the various fees at that date still apply.  Irish Water has informed my Department that there is not a single set fee for either a water or wastewater connection in Tipperary and the calculation for each composite connection charge (connection w orks f ees plus d evelopment contribution f ees) is calculated separately, depending on the location of the connection.</p><p>The CER has recently reviewed its 2015 work plan with Irish Water and has published, in its Water Charges Plan Decision Paper of 5 March 2015, the areas that it will be progressing in 2015, which includes the development of Connection Charging Policy. Later this year, the CER will publish a detailed work plan in relation to connectioncharges and will consult widely as part of that plan. </p><p>If the Deputy has queries about the fees charged in relation to a particular property, Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

However, I understand that Local Enterprise Offices in association with the National Standards Authority of Ireland and Enterprise Ireland hosted a series of regional workshops for fabrication, engineering and construction companies and other interested parties on requirements under the harmonised European standard for structural steel, EN 1090-1:2009 Execution of steel structures and aluminium structures - Part 1: Requirements for conformity assessment of structural components. </p><p>A suite of supporting documentation, including an assessment checklist and a pre-audit questionnaire, were disseminated to all participants at these regional workshops and are also available on the National Standards Authority of Ireland&rsquo;s website at . In addition, the primary standards I.S. EN 1090-1 and I.S. EN 1090-2 are now being made available, through the Local Enterprise Offices, to industry at a discounted packaged rate. Furthermore, I understand that the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Education and Skills are in the process of identifying the training providers/courses that are available locally to facilitate small and medium sized fabricators in achieving compliance with the requirements of I.S. EN 1090-1. </p><p>My Department, working through Building Regulations Advisory Body structures, and in conjunction with the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the National Roads Authority, the Office of Public Works and the Building Materials Federation, prepared an information paper setting out the implications for manufacturers, importers and distributors in relation to placing construction products on the market arising from the introduction of the Construction Products Regulation on 1 July 2013. </p><p>This information paper was widely circulated, firstly in mid-2012, again in mid-2013 and also as part of the information pack provided at the regional workshops for steel fabricators, to stakeholders throughout the construction sector by the Department, local authorities and by each of the participating organisations. My Department has also proactively promoted awareness of the Construction Products Regulation at key indust ry conferences and workshops.  In addition, a comprehensive three-month public consultation was held as an integral part of the development of the supporting European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 which set out the framework for market surveillance in Ireland under the Construction Products Regulation.</p><p>It is understood that the number of steel fabricators operating in the State who have already established, or are in the process of establishing, the systems necessary to comply with their obligations under the Construction Products Regulation and I.S. EN 1090-1 continues to increase. All other fabricators of structural steel are encouraged to put in place the systems necessary for compliance at the earliest possible opportunity. </p></reply>

To be eligible for the Approved Housing Body (AHB) mortgage-to-rent scheme a household must have had their mortgage position deemed unsustainable under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process, agree to the voluntary surrender of their home, be in negative equity, and be deemed eligible for social housing in accordance with section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009.   </p>  <p>  A single independent open market valuation is commissioned by the Housing Agency to determine the value of the property upon which the purchase price is based.

The capped annual charges will be &euro;160 for single adult households and &euro;260 for all other households until the end of 2018. All households will know what their capped bills will be until the end of 2018, which is particularly important for larger households or those with high usage due to medical needs.  In addition, a water conservation grant of &euro;100 per year will be available to qualifying households. The Department of Social Protection will administer the grant on behalf of my Department, which will be available to households (principal private dwellings) that complete a valid response to Irish Water&rsquo;s customer registration process.</p>  <p>  The water conservation grant replaces the tax rebate and social protection measures previously announced and is a more straightforward means of addressing water issues for all households on equal terms and will reduce households&rsquo; outlay on water services both now and in the future.</p>  <p>  The charges structure was revised with a view to making it simpler and fairer, providing more clarity and certainty to households.  The overall cost for those who register with Irish Water, net of the &euro;100 water conservation grant, is either &euro;1.15 a week for single adult households or &euro;3 a week for all others. Water supply will not be reduced under any circumstance.</p>  <p>  When it comes to payment, a range of easy pay options will be in place, including direct debits, electronic funds transfer, payment by cash at any retail outlet with a paypoint or payzone sign or a post office where a bill can be paid in full or part payments of a minimum of &euro;5 can be made. Irish Water also intends participating in the Household Budget scheme.

Details of monitoring requirements along with the procedures to be followed and the roles of water suppliers, the EPA and the HSE, where there is non-compliance with the parametric values set out in the Schedules to the Regulations, are clearly laid out in the Regulations.  The Water Services Act 2007 provides that the owner of a premises is responsible for the maintenance and renewal of the internal water distribution system. Responsibility for replacing lead pipes from the main stopcock to the house and within the house therefore rests with the homeowner.  In a joint position paper on lead published by the EPA and HSE in 2013, it is recommended that all lead pipes and plumbing in public and private ownership should be replaced over time. The position paper contains advice for property owners and can be downloaded from: .</p><p>The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from each customer in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers. The Water Charges Policy Direction issued to the CER in July 2014 referred to a number of matters relating to domestic water charges, including where the quality of water services provided by Irish Water to its customers is impaired or where services are reduced or restricted. Where customers are subject to a drinking water restriction notice, affected customers will receive a 100% discount to the water supply portion of their bill for the duration of the restriction.</p><p>My Department is developing a national strategy for lead, in consultation with the Department of Health, Irish Water, the HSE and the EPA, in order to map the scale of the problem and identify measures to mitigate any risks to human health posed by lead in drinking water.

The decision on the budget to be provided is made each year on the basis of balancing the indicative research requirements of the Agency, and the availability of funding.  For example, in 2014, a research budget of &euro;12.98 m was approved for the EPA. Ultimately, the final distribution of the research budget allocated from the Environment Fund is a matter for the Agency.  </p>  <p>  I understand that, following an announcement in November 2013, the EPA is coordinating a multi-agency trans-boundary programme of research on the potential Impacts on the environment and human health from Unconventional Gas Exploration &amp;amp; Extraction projects/ operations. This UGEE Joint Research Programme (JRP) is funded by the EPA, the Department of Communications Energy and Natural Resources (DCENR) and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA). The research is being undertaken by a consortium of independent organisations comprising CDM Smith, British Geological Survey, University College Dublin, Ulster University, Queens University Belfast, AMEC Foster Wheeler and Philip Lee Solicitors. The research, which began in August 2014, is anticipated to take place over approximately 24 months.</p>  <p>  As it is the EPA which is the independent body leading on this research project, further information, if required, can be obtained directly from the Agency.</p></reply>

The HAP scheme will bring all social housing supports provided by the State under the aegis of local authorities. The scheme will remove a barrier to employment by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment. HAP will also improve regulation of the rented accommodation being supported and provide certainty for landlords as regards their rental income.  Further to the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 on 28 July 2014, the first phase of the HAP statutory pilot commenced with effect from 15 September 2014 in Limerick City and County Council, Waterford City and County Council and Cork County Council. HAP commenced in Louth, Kilkenny, South Dublin and Monaghan County Councils from 1 October. Subsequently, on 18 December, Dublin City Council became part of the statutory HAP pilot, with a specific focus on accommodating homeless households. Dublin City Council is implementing the HAP pilot for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of all 4 Dublin local authorities.</p>  <p>  There are now over 1,800 households in receipt of HAP across the local authority areas taking part in the statutory pilot scheme.</p>  <p>  During the legislation&rsquo;s passage through the Oireachtas in July 2014 an undertaking was given that a progress report would be prepared for the relevant Oireachtas Committee.  Data from the pilot sites has been gathered and I submitted a report to the Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht last month. Consideration is currently being given to the sequencing of a further cohort of local authorities to commence HAP on an incremental basis this year. While no implementation date has yet been confirmed, my Department is working with Kildare County Council to make the necessary arrangements for their inclusion in the next phase of the pilot.</p>  <p>  Under the HAP scheme, local authorities will make the full rent payment on behalf of the HAP recipient directly to the landlord. The HAP recipient will then pay a rent contribution to the local authority. The rent contribution is a differential rent &ndash; that is, a rent based on income and the ability to pay.  The landlord will receive prompt payments directly from the local authority on a monthly basis, subject to the HAP recipient paying the local authority their rent contribution and all payments will be made electronically.</p></reply>

These guidelines retained the previous caps on store size in less populated and smaller towns, and were aimed at striking the right balance to ensure that local monopolies are not created in smaller towns which would be detrimental to competition.</p>  <p>  In terms of Government action other than by my Department in providing assistance to retail businesses and stimulating economic activity in local communities, a number of measures have been introduced since 2011, including</p>  <p>  -  the introduction of the 9% rate of VAT on certain goods and services,</p>  <p>  -  the halving of the lower rate of employers&rsquo; PRSI,</p>  <p>  -  the introduction of the Microenterprise Loan Scheme and Credit Guarantee Scheme, both of which schemes have had take-up from the retail sector, and the extension of seed capital and the employment and investment incentive scheme to the retail sector.</p>  <p>  My Department remains committed to working with other Government Departments, with local government and with other community development and enterprise stakeholders with a view to providing a clear framework for addressing urban centre decline and its impacts on the retail sector, and will continue to explore all relevant options for   further action in this regard.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, Ireland has been allocated &euro;1.2 billion of Structural Funds from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) for the period 2014 &ndash; 2020. The new ERDF regulation requires an increased focus on sustainable urban development and urban regeneration. In its Partnership Agreement with the European Commission on the new ERDF regulation, the Government has agreed that an urban development fund with a total value of &euro;80 million will be available over the duration of the programme. Local authorities will be invited to bid for this ERDF support for projects that will contribute to the social, economic and environmental development of their urban areas. The first call for proposals will be made shortly, and it will be a matter for the local authorities to nominate appropriate projects for such funding.</p>  <p>  A new tax relief scheme entitled the Living City Initiative was launched by the Minister for Finance earlier this month. This initiative is a targeted pilot tax incentive scheme which aims to encourage people back to the centre of Irish cities to live in older buildings (residential element), and to encourage the regeneration of central business districts (commercial element). Tax relief is available on qualifying expenditure related to the refurbishment or conversion of residential and commercial premises within the special regeneration areas of six cities (namely Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick, Kilkenny and Waterford). Further information on the scheme can be obtained from the Department of Finance.</p></reply>

This will be achieved through a partnership between Government and commercial telecommunications companies.</p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services with approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next two years. These very significant investments represent a step change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>Last November, I published a national high speed coverage map for 2016. This map is available at . The areas marked BLUE represent those areas that will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016.</p><p>The AMBER areas show the target areas for the State intervention. All premises within the AMBER areas will be included in the State's intervention.</p><p>New private planned next generation access investments may be added to the national high-speed coverage map, once it is established that these plans are definitive and meet the relevant criteria required to be put on the map. i.e. that they will deliver high speed broadband service to end users. It is envisaged that the map will be updated on an ongoing basis from now until the award of a contract or contracts relating to the State intervention. How the map will develop beyond the contract award has yet to be determined.</p><p>Good progress is being made on all of the different elements of this complex project and we remain on track to publish the draft Intervention Strategy for public consultation in July. We are also on track to submit a State Aid Pre-Notification to DG Competition in June. Once the public consultation has been completed, I expect to move quickly into the formal procurement phase towards the end of the year.</p><p>As the draft Intervention Strategy is not yet fully finalised, I am not in a position at this time to comment in detail on whether the intervention will include any role for community co-funding in the access network. Based on my Department's on-going interaction with industry, it is clear that there is very significant interest in this project from several commercial operators so it is reasonable to expect a very competitive procurement process. The Intervention is also being designed on a wholesale basis with built-in assurances that it will be on a fully open access basis for all retail service providers who wish to use the new network to provide services to customers.</p><p>My Department is fully aware of the legal obligations in place under the relevant environmental impact assessment legislation and we are continuing to consider and address the application of this legislation to the State intervention.</p><p>There is no formal deadline in relation to contacting my Department as a potential bidder and bids will not be disadvantaged by not having contacted the Department in advance of the formal procurement process.</p><p>In relation to infrastructure sharing, last week my Department published a register of owners of infrastructure, as notified to us. The purpose of this register is to give potential bidders recourse to information on infrastructure which could be used as part of their bid. The register will remain open to any interested party should they wish to have their details included. Indeed, since publication, my Department has received further details for inclusion, and we will continue to engage with various organisations to ensure the maximum level of infrastructure re-use. The sharing of existing telecommunications infrastructure is considered a key enabler in reducing the overall cost of the project and in ensuring value for money to the State.</p><p>I expect the physical build of the network to begin in late 2016, and it will take between three and five years to fully complete &ndash; depending on the details of the bid or bids that we select.</p><p>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government and aims to conclusively address current broadband connectivity issues in mainly rural parts of the country.</p></reply>

Better Energy Homes provides a financial incentive to private homeowners who wish to improve the energy performance of their homes. Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures including attic insulation, wall insulation, heating systems upgrades, solar thermal panels and accompanying BER. In March of this year I announced increases of between 25% and 50% in the grant levels awarded to householders under the scheme. In addition, a bonus payment has been introduced for householders that complete three or more energy efficiency improvements.</p><p>The importance of improving our energy efficiency for reducing our harmful emissions cannot be overstated. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) yesterday published its report on Ireland's Greenhouse Gas Emission Projections 2014-2035. The report finds that significant additional effort is required by Ireland to meet our 2020 emissions targets, particularly in energy efficiency and renewable energy. Currently, emissions from the residential sector account for 10% of our total emissions. The report highlights the importance of the Better Energy Programme in delivering the emissions reductions necessary in the residential sector to 2020. </p><p>A breakdown on the amount of grants awarded under the Better Energy Homes Scheme on a county by county basis from 2009 is provided in the following table: <table><tr><th>County</th><th>Total Amount Spent</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>&euro;40,649,542.16</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>&euro;24,503,987.74</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>&euro;13,072,441.40</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>&euro;11,031,468.88</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>&euro;8,344,621.40</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>&euro;7,962,888.51</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>&euro;7,932,038.57</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>&euro;7,040,037.15</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>&euro;5,202,341.54</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>&euro;4,750,920.01</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>&euro;4,666,536.19</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>&euro;4,426,834.30</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>&euro;4,301,676.94</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>&euro;4,138,553.85</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>&euro;3,699,502.33</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>&euro;3,110,023.03</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>&euro;3,063,718.04</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>&euro;2,808,210.52</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>&euro;2,487,613.68</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>&euro;2,263,739.55</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>&euro;1,880,960.57</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>&euro;1,879,561.56</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>&euro;1,720,753</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>&euro;1,463,406.01</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>&euro;1,234,148.05</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>&euro;887,380</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>&euro;174,522,904.98</td></tr></table></p></reply>

I understand Minister Varadkar was concerned that to proceed any further with the scheme to build the M20 would have exposed the NRA to significant costs arising from a consequent requirement to purchase the CPO'd land within a limited timeframe.  This would have had to be done without the reasonable prospect of proceeding to the construction stage quickly.</p>  <p>  Given continuing budget constraints and the need to focus on road maintenance and renewal, I do not currently plan to review this decision.</p></reply>

Last year some 2.1 million passengers used the Airport.  Cork Airport has 42 scheduled routes and offers excellent award winning passenger facilities and connectivity into three major European hub airports.   </p>  <p>  Of course we are all concerned at the fall in passenger numbers at Cork Airport.  However, following my visit to the Airport and meetings with DAA and Cork Airport management, I believe there are opportunities to increase passenger numbers particularly in the area of incoming tourists. Accordingly, I have engaged with Tourism Ireland on the matter and significant co-operative marketing activity has been undertaken with carriers serving Cork Airport to promote flights to Cork and boost travel to the wider regions.    </p>  <p>  However, these marketing activities have to be underpinned by a cohesive product brand for the Cork region, providing a clear selling point for Cork as a destination in itself and as a gateway to other attractive destinations in Ireland.  I am pleased that a Task Force comprising the two local authorities, the Chamber and the Tourism agencies along with DAA and the Irish Tourism Operators Association, is now working on delivering just such a destination brand for Cork, as well as a strategy and implementation plan for maximising inbound tourism growth opportunities.   </p>  <p>  I urge everybody with an interest in securing the future of Cork Airport to work together to develop and exploit these opportunities.  </p></reply>

The Regulation included a partial derogation to be reviewed every five years with the first period lasting until 31 December 2011. Following a review, the partial derogation was extended for a second period until 31 December 2016 under Regulation 1257/2010. Under the terms of the derogation in place since 2007, only legislation adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure (formerly the co-decision procedure) must be translated into Irish.</p>  <p>  In order to achieve the required timelines, a decision is required by Government in 2015 on the optimal approach to the derogation, following which the Council of the European Union will review its operation. A unanimous decision by Council is required before the end of 2015 on whether to extend, amend or end the derogation. The action agreed by Council would then be implemented from 1 January 2017.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department and the Department of An Taoiseach have been actively engaging with the EU institutions and other relevant stakeholders for some time in order to formulate the optimal approach to the derogation. In this context, the legislative and non-legislative services which are currently provided through Irish and the potential to expand these services are under consideration. Preparatory work on a draft Regulation is underway in advance of a draft memorandum being brought to Government.</p>  <p>  In logistical and reputational terms, it is important to note that the approach adopted by Ireland in relation to the derogation is seen to be a balanced and rational response that will have regard to prevailing circumstances and challenges, particularly in relation to issues such as the timely recruitment of the requisite personnel and the actual usage of Irish in the EU institutions.</p></reply>

The Government has been represented at many national and international events since the centenary of the outbreak of the War in August 2014. Many of these events and activities are detailed in the website supported by my Department.</p><p>Some highlights in 2014 included the following:</p><p>-  The dedication jointly by President Higgins and the Duke of Kent of the Cross of Sacrifice in Glasnevin Cemetery in July 2014.  This was a welcome addition to the comprehensive and inclusive representation of Irish history in Glasnevin and was brought forward in partnership between Glasnevin Trust and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.</p><p>-  Government representation at war memorial ceremonies in Northern Ireland on Armistice Day and at the anniversary of the first day of the Battle of the Somme on 1 July.</p><p>-  Government representation, alongside the representatives of the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive, at the annual commemorations on the Somme &ndash; a sequence of engagements which acknowledge our shared heritage.</p><p>-  A National Museum of Ireland conference at Collins Barracks on 1 February 2014 on <i>Remembering World War One in Europe, 1914-2014.</i></p><p>-  A National Gallery of Ireland programme of events commencing on 1 March 2014 with a <i>Study Day on War Artists</i>, followed on 2 March 2014 by a consideration of<i>War Poetry and Images of the First World War.</i></p><p>-  A National Library of Ireland exhibition on World War 1, entitled <i>World War Ireland: Exploring the Irish Experience.</i></p><p>With regard to 2015, my Department supported a very successful dramatisation of the Gallipoli experience, entitled PALS, which was presented at the National Museum of Ireland, Collins Barracks to popular acclaim over a 3 month period in early 2015.</p><p>On 25-26 April, a series of events related to the 100 anniversary of the Gallipoli campaign were initiated in association with the Australian Embassy and the New Zealand Ireland Association.  At Glasnevin Cemetery, 8 recipients of the Victoria Cross (VC) were honoured, with participation from British, Australian and New Zealand diplomatic corps, as well as veterans of the British Legion and a descendent of one VC recipient from the Royal Munster Fusiliers. This presentation followed similar ceremonies in 2014/15 in respect of earlier VC recipients.</p><p>History Ireland has organised a &ldquo;hedge school&rdquo; in the National Library supported by my Department. </p><p>My Department also provided financial support to the local authorities in Cork towards the recent substantial programme of events arranged to commemorate the 100 anniversary of the sinking of the <i>Lusitania.</i></p><p>For more local events, my Department seeks to provide advice and guidance to local communities. Local authorities can also help with practical advice and assistance. My Department does not generally fund local memorials. </p><p>In terms of overall expenditure by my Department for activities relating to the Decade of Centenaries, including Word War 1, a sum of the order of &euro;300,000 was provided in 2014. A budget of the order of &euro;350,000 is envisaged in respect of 2015. These sums would include the supports from my Department for the Decade of Centenaries website at and the Century Ireland website at , which deal with all aspects of the period in question.</p></reply>
