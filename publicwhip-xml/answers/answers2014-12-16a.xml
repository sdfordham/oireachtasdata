Public Service Reform will also continue to play an important role in our recovery.</font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">As the Deputy will be aware, we published our first Public Service Reform Plan in November 2011.  A Progress Report published in January this year sets out the considerable progress we have made.  Also in January, I published the Government's second Public Service Reform Plan 2014-2016, with over 230 specific actions to deliver reform and service improvements across the Public Service.</font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">In addition, the Taoiseach and I launched the Civil Service Renewal Plan in October.  This plan outlines the practical changes that will create a more unified, professional, responsive, open and accountable Civil Service.  We are also enhancing openness and transparency through our extensive programme of political and legislative reforms.</font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">With regard to State Board appointments, while new arrangements introduced in 2011 were successful in opening up the appointments process, further steps have recently been taken, as the Deputy will be aware. The new guidelines provide good practice rules with the core principles of: promoting wider access to opportunities on State Boards; putting in place detailed and comprehensive criteria for those roles; and introducing transparent and rigorous assessment of candidates against these criteria.  To facilitate this, a new website was created stateboards.ie on which members of the public can apply for such vacancies.</font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">Overall, I am satisfied that we have made strong progress on the delivery of Public Service Reform.  Our plans are in line with, and frequently exceed, best practice across Europe and our progress is well regarded internationally.  The levels of reform we have delivered could not have happened without the efforts and commitment of our public servants and I commend them for their contribution to date.</font></p></reply>

This Memorandum sets out principles of how the two organisations will work together to ensure that appropriate and relevant information on completed OPW flood defence schemes is provided to insurers to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, the availability to the public of insurance against the risk of flooding.  The Memorandum came into effect on 1 June, 2014 with an initial tranche of data provided by the OPW to Insurance Ireland in respect of 12 completed flood defence schemes and showing the design, extent and nature of the protection offered by these works.  The arrangements set out in the Memorandum represent an ongoing process which, over time, should lead to an improvement in the availability of flood insurance cover.  The text of the Memorandum of Understanding and further information on the process is available on the OPW website, www.opw.ie</p><p>  Since the signing of the Memorandum, contact has continued between OPW and Insurance Ireland.  The implementation of the Memorandum has been discussed at a number of meetings held in recent weeks at both official and Ministerial level involving Insurance Ireland, the Office of Public Works and the Department of Finance.  Work is ongoing in OPW to prepare a further tranche of data on completed flood defence schemes in the agreed format for transfer to Insurance Ireland. </p><p>  Insurance Ireland has been requested by both the OPW and the Department of Finance to provide a report on the position regarding implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding since it came into effect in June 2014, this report to include specific information on:</p><p>  -	What specific actions have been taken by the insurance industry to meet its obligations under the Memorandum of Understanding</p><p>  -	The extent to which insurance companies are using the details provided by OPW on completed schemes to re-assess flood risk in the benefiting areas</p><p>  -	What impact is this actually having on the availability of flood cover where not previously available and/or on the cost of that cover to households/small business?</p><p>  Insurance Ireland has indicated that will be in a position to provide this report shortly and that early indications are that it shows an improvement in the overall position.</p><p>  Further regular meetings will continue between the OPW, the Department of Finance and Insurance Ireland on this matter.</p></reply>

The Decision, building on the earlier 2011 Decision, required my Department to prepare Guidelines on a new process to be agreed by Government. In preparing the Guidelines the Department sought the views of all Departments, as well as meeting with interested parties and working closely with the Public Appointments Service. </font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">The Guidelines were approved by Government in November and seek to provide good practice rules around the implementation of the Decision, which has at its core three key principles:</font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">-promote wider access to opportunities on State Boards;</font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">-put in place detailed and comprehensive criteria for those roles; and</font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">-introduce transparent and rigorous assessment of candidates against these criteria.</font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">The Guidelines clarify which positions on Boards they apply to and change the process around Ministerial appointments of individuals to State Boards.</font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">  The new arrangements provide for a robust selection system operated independently by the Public Appointments Service with selection being based on objective criteria. The new arrangements will ensure that candidates recommended for appointment have the skills and competencies required to carry out their duties on a State board. </font><font color="#181818">The Guidelines are very clear that in the end it is the responsibility of the relevant Minister to make appointments on the basis of the statutory authority provided in legislation approved by the Oireachtas.  </font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">Under the new system for appointments to State Boards, the specific requirements identified for board roles will be published as well as information illustrating the knowledge, skills, experience and expertise possessed by appointees conforming to those requirements.  I am satisfied that this approach will demonstrate in each case the basis on which each board appointee was assessed to be qualified to successfully perform the relevant role.</font></p></reply>

It has never been the custom to link borrowing to specific projects as to do so would limit the flexibility of the Government in managing the State's finances.</font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">That said, the PPP programme allows for private sector investment and risk sharing in the provision of specific public infrastructure projects.  Because of their funding and risk profile, these PPP projects are not included in the calculations of General Government spending, and therefore, this approach as allowed the </font><font color="#181818">Government to supplement its traditional Exchequer capital programme (which is funded by the revenues and borrowing in the Central Fund) and which is necesarily limited by the constraints on our expenditure levels, consistent with our fiscal commitments.</font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">The Deputy is asking about the potential usefulness of introducing a wider means of channeling private funding to support specific State infrastructure projects. The Department of Finance and the NTMA - which lead on identifying and harnessing funding sources for the State - have considered possible approaches to increasing funding sources.  One of the Government's recent initiatives in this regard has been the introduction of the Irish Strategic Investment Fund which will harness both public and private sector sources of funding to provide commercial investment, including in public infrastructure projects.</font></p></reply>

Under those arrangements Departments invited expressions of interest from the public in vacancies on the boards of bodies under their aegis on their websites. It was intended that all members of the public could apply for appointment to these vacancies. In order to facilitate this wider access, a new website portal, </font><i><font color="#181818">stateboards.ie</font></i><font color="#181818">, was created by Public Appointments Service to offer a single dedicated point of contact to all Government Departments as a support to existing Board member selection procedures. </font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">While these new arrangements were successful in opening up the appointments process for State boards, the Government concluded that further progress could be made building on progress to date.  I, therefore, brought a further Memorandum to Government in September approving the introduction of a new system for State Board Appointments.  The Decision required my Department to prepare Guidelines on the new process. In preparing the Guidelines my officials sought the views of all Departments, as well as meeting with interested parties and working closely with the Public Appointments Service. </font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">The Guidelines were approved in November and seek to provide good practice rules around the implementation of the Decision, which has at its core three key principles:</font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">-promote wider access to opportunities on State Boards;</font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">-put in place detailed and comprehensive criteria for those roles; and</font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">-introduce transparent and rigorous assessment of candidates against these criteria.</font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">  The Guidelines clarify to which positions on Boards the Guidelines apply and set out the steps in the process leading up to Ministerial appointments of individuals to State Boards.

At this stage, in advance of the outcome of various competitions, it is not possible to  be definitive about actual numbers.

Over the first 17 months of its lifetime, the Agreement has been a key enabler in reducing the cost of the public service pay and pensions bill. The cost reductions and productivity increases, and the reform dividend which the Agreement has facilitated, have allowed the Government the scope in 2014 to recruit additional staff to key frontline services. This demonstrates that the Agreement is delivering and is making a significant contribution to the Government's fiscal consolidation deficit target of below 3% GDP by 2015. Public expenditure estimates and allocations in respect of Budget 2015 are based upon the cost reductions and savings provided for by the Haddington Road Agreement.</font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">  The public service unions have indicated their intention, should the State's financial circumstances permit, to lodge a pay claim next year.  If such a claim is made the Government will of course have to consider it, in line with the prevailing fiscal position. The legal position concerning the financial emergency legislation, which has underpinned the public service pay and pension reductions to date, will also have to be addressed in that context while ensuring that this country has a sustainable pay arrangement over the longer term</font>.</p></reply>

It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular bidders on grounds of nationality and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules. </font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">The reform of the procurement system across the public service is a key element of the reform programme for the public service.  The fragmented procurement arrangements across the public service have enabled suppliers to charge different public service bodies different prices for the same goods and services. Public Procurement savings are necessary to enable public service organisations deliver much needed services within the tighter budgets that they must now operate.</font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">However, I would point out that reforms in this area are being carried out in a manner that recognises the importance of SMEs.  The Government acknowledges the significant role that SMEs play in the Irish economy and is committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged with public sector procurement and the opportunities presenting.  Circular 10/14 issued earlier this year by my Department is aimed at opening up opportunities for small businesses that want to tender for public contracts and also to ensure that engaging with government procurement is easy and low cost.  This guidance set out positive measures that contracting authorities are to take to promote the involvement of smaller enterprises as well as highlighting practices that are to be avoided because they can hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.</font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">From 1 August of this year, public bodies are required under Circular 10/14 to publish all Contract Award Notices over &euro;25,000 on the eTenders website on completion of the award.  It is intended that this additional information will allow improved reporting by the Office of Govenment Procurement in relation to public contract awards.</font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">In addition, the Office of Government Procurement supports the work of Enterprise Ireland and InterTrade Ireland in building awareness of public procurement and supporting training for small suppliers in bidding for public contracts.  For example, this year the Office of Government Procurement supported two &quot;Meet the Buyer&quot; events in Belfast and Dublin which were attended by approximately 1,600 suppliers. The Office of Government Procurement also supported the 'Go 2 Tender' programme run by InterTrade Ireland which was attended by approximately 400 SME's.This year InterTrade Ireland also delivered a programme on consortia building to assist SME's to jointly bid for state contracts.  </font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">The OGP will continue to work with suppliers to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that Government procurement policies are business friendly.</font></p></reply>

The European Court of Justice had previously ruled that, in the case of the workers concerned, the State had failed to provide adequate protection to members of occupational pension schemes from instances of double insolvency. The Minister for Social Protection has since enacted the Social Welfare and Pensions (No.2) Act 2013 which makes statutory provision for protection of workers where cases of double insolvency arise. However, as the double insolvency case of Waterford Crystal pre-dated the 2013 Act, it does not cover the former workers of Waterford Crystal.</font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">  The mediation process was a welcome initiative to arrive at an acceptable settlement without recourse to further costly legal proceedings while providing a fair and equitable settlement of the claims for pension entitlements for over 1700 former Waterford Crystal workers.  The mediation was between officials of the Department of Social Protection and representatives of the Waterford Crystal workers, facilitated by the chairperson of the Labour Relations Commission. Neither I nor my officials were directly involved in the mediation process, although developments in the mediation process were communicated by officials of the Department of Social Protection on an ongoing basis. Proposals for settlement carrying the recommendation of the mediator were brought to Government by the Minister for Social Protection and approved on the 9 December last. They are also under consideration by </font><font color="#181818">the former Waterford Crystal workers.</font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">Legislation is currently before the House to permit funding for pensions involved to be made available by the Minister for Finance from the Central Fund to the Department of Social Protection who will be responsible for putting in place appropriate arrangements for the processing of claims and payment and disbursement of sums due in accordance with the settlement terms.</font></p></reply>

The Minister for Business and Employment, Mr. Ged Nash, T.D., is currently developing proposals to implement this commitment and determine the role and mandate of the LPC which will be statutorily independent in the performance of its functions.</font><br/><br/><font color="#222222">  In relation to pay in the public service the pay and pension reductions imposed on public servants through the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2009-2013 were progressively structured. Those on lower incomes we</font><font color="#222222">re least affected, with the highest reductions imposed on the highest paid. The most recent pay reduction effected by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, was confined to those public servants on annual salaries of &euro;65,000 or more only; the core pay of almost 87% of public servants at  low and midranking pay levels was not impacted by this pay reduction.</font><br/><br/><font color="#222222">  In seeking the most recent savings and reductions from the public service pay and pensions' bill, public service employers and trade unions entered into negotiations and concluded a collective agreement, the Haddington Road Agreement (HRA). This three year Agreement, effective from July 2013, built upon and reaffirmed the existing overall commitments in the Public Service Agreement (Croke Park Agreement) including those in relation to lower paid public servants and sets the terms of pay in the public service until 2016. As the public service unions have indicated they intend to submit a pay claim in the new year for all public servants, any such pay claim in respect of public servants will have to be considered in the context of both the emergency legislation and the HRA. I have stated that if such a pay claim is submitted the Government will be required to consider it.  </font><font color="#222222"> </font><br/><br/><font color="#222222">It should also be noted that under the Haddington Road Agreement, and subsequently legislated for in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, the rate of PRD on the &euro;15,000 to &euro;20,000 band of pay received in a year was reduced from 5% to 2.5% on 1 January 2014. This rate cut is worth &euro;125 annually in gross terms to most public servants, with those taxed at the standard rate enjoying the greater gain in terms of take-home pay boost.</font></p></reply>

Galway<br/><br/>In addition, there are other locations in the care of the Commissioners which are not formally designated as National Monuments but are regarded as important heritage properties and are managed by the Commissioners as sites with a strong connection to the Independence history.These include:<br/><br/>-Dublin Castle<br/><br/>-St. Enda's, Rathfarnham, Dublin.<br/><br/>While the Commissioners have a statutory duty to maintain and care for these sites on behalf of the State, it is also important to recognise that these places will have a particularly important resonance and a role to play in the era of Commemorations and particularly in the context of 2016.The strategy of the Commissioners is, first and foremost, to continue to maintain these sites in accordance with their statutory remit and to present them to the public either with guided services or with passive interpretation, so that there can be a full appreciation of their importance in the story of the era.Sites such as Kilmainham Gaol, the Garden of Remembrance, Arbour Hill and Dublin Castle will obviously play a significant part in some of the formal State events already announced by the Government for 2016.In planning for the calendar of events at these locations the Commissioners will be guided significantly by the All Party Oireachtas Committee on Commemorations which is chaired by my colleague the Minister for Arts Heritage and the Gaeltacht and which has a key role  in this regard.<br/><br/>As well as facilitating events at sites managed by the OPW, it will also be the role of the Office to provide logistical support for many of the planned formal State Commemoration events that will take place in 2016 at, for example, O' Connell St, Kilmainham Gaol and Arbour Hill.This is part of the normal event management support provided by the OPW at State events and arrangements are being made to ensure that the usual comprehensive service will be in place at the required time.<br/><br/>The OPW also has a number of specific projects in hand to enhance the individual site or visitor experience in recognition of the importance of this centenary.These include:<br/><br/>-Provision of new Visitor facilities at Kilmainham Courthouse, adjacent to Kilmainham Gaol;<br/><br/>-Upgrading works to Arbour Hill Cemetery;<br/><br/>-Provision of Universal Access at the Garden of Remembrance;<br/><br/>-Conservation works to Children of Lir Statue in Garden of Remembrance;<br/><br/>-Mounting of a series of 1916 themed exhibitions;<br/><br/>-Cooperation with the provision of new Visitor facilities at Pearse Cottage by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Galway Co.

As with all of my visits to the USA, the focus will be on promoting investment, bilateral trade and job creation in Ireland.<br/><br/>My EU engagements for the end of 2014 and the first half of 2015 include attendance at European Council meetings with Heads of State and Government and attendance at informal meetings of EU Heads of State and Government in Brussels.

In 2014 funding of some &euro;18.6 million has been provided to MABS.<br/><br/>Information on the waiting times in each MABS office is compiled on a quarterly basis and posted to the website.  The most recent statistics available, compiled to end of  September 2014, record that the average waiting time from first point of contact to first appointment with a money adviser is some 2.53 weeks.  This is a national average and can vary greatly between offices.<br/><br/>North Donegal MABS has its main office in Letterkenny with a sub-office in Buncrana and provides a service to the North and Eastern part of the county. There are two other MABS offices in the county, one in the Gaeltacht area (Derrybeg) and one in South Donegal (Donegal town). There has been a substantial improvement in the  number of people waiting for an appointment with a money adviser in North Donegal MABS in recent months.  The number has dropped from 132 in January of this year to 33 at the end of November.  The waiting time has significantly reduced also from 24 weeks in January to the 9.8 weeks recorded at the end of September. The Service is currently offering appointments to clients within approximately 6 weeks.<br/><br/>The significant improvement in waiting times is due to the prudent allocation of resources and the on-going collaborative work with the two other MABS in County Donegal. CIB will continue to work closely with North Donegal MABS on all aspects of demand, capacity and resources with a view to further reducing waiting times.<br/><br/>I am satisfied that the ongoing monitoring of MABS services and the deployment of available resources to meet demand will continue to contribute to the reduction of waiting times across the MABS network of offices.</p></reply>

A 25% bonus was paid in the first week of December to social welfare recipients such as pensioners, people with disabilities, carers and the long-term unemployed, in recognition of the fact that the majority of these recipients are wholly or mostly dependent on their weekly payment.<br/><br/>The bonus was paid this year to the beneficiaries of all schemes to which the bonus previously applied. It should be noted that a Bonus was never payable to recipients of certain schemes such as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and illness benefit and similar arrangements apply this year.  The bonus was extended to long-term jobseekers in 1985 with the condition that the jobseeker must be in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment for 15 months in order to be eligible for payment.

It is envisaged that the guarantee as it affects those aged under 18 years will be implemented within 2 years, i.e. by the end of 2015. The guarantee of an offer of training, education or work experience for those aged 18-24 years after a four month period should be implemented on a phased basis.<br/><br/>Starting in 2014, and for completion by the end of 2015, processes and programmes will be progressively rolled out to ensure that all of those young unemployed people who need most support (i.e. are assessed as having a low probability of securing employment in the absence of support from the Public Employment Services) will receive a Youth Guarantee offer within four months.<br/><br/>These new and existing initiatives will provide 28,000 plus places for unemployed young people during 2014 (this figure excludes apprenticeship and PLC places).<br/><br/>Approximately 20,400 of these places had been taken up at the end of November.  The table appended to this reply details the total take-up for the year-to-date, together with the estimate for full-year intake provided in the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan.<br/><br/>Some of the initiatives planned under the guarantee required primary legislation to allow positive discrimination on age grounds in the provision of employment services and supports.  This legislation was enacted as part of the Social Welfare Bill over the summer.  Two schemes in particular, the Youth Guarantee developmental internship programme and the JobsPlus variant for young people (supporting young unemployed at risk of becoming long-term unemployed who have been signing on the Live Register for 4 months), were dependent on this legislation being passed.  These schemes were announced in November and will be implemented in full during 2015.  The legislation also permits the introduction of earlier and more intensive engagement by INTREO with the young unemployed that should also translate increased placement on schemes covered by the Youth Guarantee. Processes to give effect to this engagement are currently being implemented by the Department.<table><tr><th>Programme</th><th>Expected full-year intake</th><th>2014 YTD</th><th>Note</th></tr><tr><td>Youthreach/CTC</td><td>3,300</td><td>3,505</td><td>CTC starters  &ndash; including Youthreach 1,800 persons</td></tr><tr><td>JobBridge (including developmental internship)</td><td>5,000</td><td>2,939</td><td>As of end November 2014</td></tr><tr><td>T&uacute;s</td><td>1,000</td><td>1,410</td><td>As of end November 2014</td></tr><tr><td>JobsPlus</td><td>1,500</td><td>357</td><td>As of end November 2014</td></tr><tr><td>Momentum</td><td>2,000</td><td>631</td><td>As of end November 2014</td></tr><tr><td>BTEA (excl Momentum)</td><td>3,300</td><td>2,319</td><td>As of 14th October 2014</td></tr><tr><td>BTWEA</td><td>200</td><td>139</td><td>Including 5 persons on STEA</td></tr><tr><td>VTOS</td><td>500</td><td>672</td><td>Estimated U25 unemployed entrants</td></tr><tr><td>FAS/Solas</td><td>9500</td><td>7,677</td><td>Based on SST, Traineeship, Bridging &amp;amp; LTI starters as of end November 2014</td></tr><tr><td>CEB youth Entrepreneurship Training and Mentoring supports</td><td>700</td><td></td><td>Not yet commenced</td></tr><tr><td>CEB/MFI micro-loans for young people</td><td>150</td><td>2</td><td>As of 31st August 2014</td></tr><tr><td>International Work Experience and Training</td><td>250</td><td></td><td>At client selection process</td></tr><tr><td>Gateway</td><td>450</td><td>173</td><td>As of end November 2014</td></tr><tr><td>Community Employment</td><td>500</td><td>558</td><td>As of end November 2014</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>28,350</td><td>20,382</td><td>Excluding where figures are not available</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The original intention of the MIS scheme was to provide short-term support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence. The supplement assisted with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only. In the context of the overall strategy, the continued payment of MIS did little to assist recipients or lenders in improving the long term difficulty in addressing the mortgage problem.</p><p>  Customers availing of this support prior to 1st January 2014 have been able to retain entitlement to the scheme up to 1st January 2018. There are currently approximately 6,100 people in receipt of the supplement for which the Government has provided almost &euro;18 million in 2014.</p><p>  It is expected that during the four year period, existing customers will no longer require this support through sustainable solutions being put in place with their lenders, securing employment or exit strategies sponsored by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. I am satisfied that the most appropriate way in which customers experiencing mortgage difficulties can be supported is through engagement with their lender.</p></reply>

In general, only those in receipt of a CE-qualifying payment for the requisite period of time are eligible to participate on the CE programme.</p><p>  Given the scale of unemployment, the key objective of activation policy and labour market initiatives has been to offer assistance to those most in need of support in securing work and achieving financial self-sufficiency.  Accordingly, the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused, in the first instance, on the cohort of people who are unemployed and in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment.  There are no plans to make changes to these arrangements at present.</p><p>  Despite this focus, access to training and employment programmes is also open to other groups under certain circumstances.  Thus, persons who have been signing for credits for three months (78 days) of the last six months are eligible to participate in the JobBridge programme.  Persons signing on for credits for 12 months or longer are also entitled to participate on Momentum provided that they have been actively seeking work.  Persons signing for credits for six months or more are entitled to participate on VTOS courses subject to availability.  In the case of VTOS courses, participants do not receive a training allowance but may receive travel and lunch allowances.</p><p>  More generally, a range of services are available to persons who are unemployed but not in receipt of a social welfare payment.  For example, employment services, such as advice on job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices, regardless of their social welfare status. </p><p>  Furthermore, unemployed persons not in receipt of payments may also be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities, for example through ETB (formerly F&Aacute;S) training for unemployed people. While they are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course, they may receive travel and lunch allowances.</p><p>  The Work Placement Programme is also open to persons not in receipt of a social welfare payment, although the participant will not receive a payment while on the programme.</p></reply>

Individuals who qualify for the JA transitional arrangement are exempt from having to be available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time employment and can avail of this arrangement until their youngest child reaches 14 years of age.</p><p>  The JA transitional arrangement thus enables these parents to balance their caring responsibilities with work and significantly reduces their requirement for child care.  It allows lone parents to work part-time without restrictions (e.g. mornings only) and still receive a JA payment &ndash; subject to a means test.  They also have access to the &lsquo;Intreo&rsquo; activation process and supports to enable them to become job-ready and/or find employment.</p><p>  The exemptions from the full JA conditions remain in place until their youngest child reaches the age of 14 years, at which point, should they continue to claim the JA payment, they will be subjected to the scheme&rsquo;s full conditionality.</p><p>  The current cut off point for receipt of a payment under the JA transitional arrangement is the youngest child&rsquo;s 14th birthday.  The rationale for this age threshold is, in conjunction with the OFP scheme, to provide a tapered support to lone parents with young children - up to 14 years of age, while also maintaining the policy goal that they will not remain outside the labour market indefinitely.  At 14 years of age the youngest child will be in secondary school and so the need for childcare will be substantially reduced in comparison with younger children.  </p><p>  There are no plans to change this at the present time.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-12-16a.161.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014121600067#WRD03100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 169 and 176 together.</p><p>  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible people living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources. There are approximately 71,800 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.</p><p>  I am acutely aware of the difficulties people are experiencing in maintaining affordable rented accommodation in areas of high demand in the current market in line with the findings by the Private Residential Tenancies Board. I am keeping the matter regarding rent limits under consideration and the review being undertaken by the Department will be finalised shortly. However, the Department is in a position of both significant influence in the private rented market and responsibility and there is a real concern that increased rent limits may add to further rental inflation and impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers, their families and students.</p><p>  Emergency actions are being undertaken within the administration of the rent supplement scheme through the increased use of flexibility in relation to rent limits, including under the Interim Tenancy Sustainment Protocol operating in Dublin. A notice reminding all Community Welfare Service staff of their statutory discretionary power to award a supplement for rental purposes, for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy was circulated in July 2014 and a further instruction issued last week.</p><p>  Staff are increasing rental payments as necessary and are actively engaging with the various local authorities and organisations involved in homelessness. The Department is reviewing the local arrangements in place throughout the country to strengthen the existing framework to ensure that the necessary supports continue to be provided in a consistent manner. </p><p>  I advise that where a person in receipt of rent supplement is at risk of losing their tenancy they should make contact with the Tenancy Protection Service provided by Threshold in Dublin at 1800 454 454 or their local Community Welfare Service throughout the country.</p><p>  Rent supplement is not generally payable where a person or their spouse/partner is in full time employment i.e. 30 hours or more per week.  However, a person on rent supplement who is deemed by a local authority to be eligible to participate in the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) scheme may engage in full-time employment and retain entitlement.  Payment is subject to the standard means test and may continue while the local authority is making arrangements to transfer the tenant to RAS.</p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of a short-term income support scheme. Under the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer to local authorities.  To date, over 390 persons have transferred to HAP in the selected local authorities. HAP will provide a more integrated system of housing supports and has been designed to allow any households that find full-time employment to remain in the scheme.</p></reply>

The schemes are designed to assist jobseekers to pursue self-employment options by allowing the retention of all or part of the monetary value of the social welfare payment.  The scheme provides support for a two year period with the full value of the social welfare payment being retained in year one and three-quarters in year two.  For jobseekers receiving jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, the qualifying period is 12 months in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  The STEA provides immediate access to those who have lost their jobs and qualify for jobseekers benefit and wish to set up a business. Payment under the scheme is at the same rate and for the same duration as their entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. <br/><br/>The BTWEA does not provide for circumstances whereby a customer in receipt of the payment in the second year of their business plan may claim a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment during periods of low business activity.  It is likely that the value of the BTWEA payment and income from self-employment would exceed the value of any jobseekers payment to be made to cover such periods.A customer in receipt of a BTWEA payment can access support for their business venture from the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s Intreo centres, local enterprise offices and local development companies.</p></reply>

To qualify for a credited PRSI contribution (credit), a person must have worked and paid at least one PRSI contribution at PRSI Class A, B, C, D, E, or H and have paid or credited contributions in either of the last two complete tax years.  For example, if a person is unemployed and/or incapable of work in 2014, they must have reckonable paid or credited contributions in either 2013 or 2012 in order to qualify for credits for the period of their incapacity/unemployment.  If there is a gap of more than two complete tax years a person must work and pay reckonable contributions for a further 26 weeks before they will qualify for credited contributions.  Credits are usually awarded at the same rate as the person&rsquo;s last paid PRSI contribution e.g. if the person last paid PRSI at Class A, the credit they receive will be reckonable for Class A benefits.<br/><br/>Persons who have an insufficient employment/PRSI record to qualify for a social insurance benefit/pension may apply for the appropriate means-tested social assistance scheme.  For example persons, between the ages of 16 and 66 who are suffering from an illness or disability which is expected to last at least 1 year, may qualify for disability allowance (DA).  Disability allowance recipients must be habitually resident in the State.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-12-16a.208.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014121600068#WRE04400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 186 to 188, inclusive, and 199 to 201, inclusive, together.<br/><br/>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the quantities of illicit cigarettes and other tobacco products seized in each of the years 2009 to 2013 and in 2014 to the end of October, and the estimated retail value of those products, are set out in the following table.<br/><br/><table><tr><th>-</th><th>Cigarettes</th><th>-</th><th>-</th><th>Tobacco</th><th>-</th></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>Quantity (Million)</td><td>Value(&euro; Million)</td><td></td><td>Quantity (Kgs)</td><td>Value(&euro; Million)</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>218.5</td><td>92</td><td></td><td>10451</td><td>3.7</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>178.4</td><td>75.2</td><td></td><td>3367</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>109.1</td><td>46</td><td></td><td>11158</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>95.6</td><td>43.3</td><td></td><td>5277</td><td>1.95</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>40.8</td><td>18.9</td><td></td><td>4203</td><td>1.7</td></tr><tr><td>2014 (end Oct)</td><td>50.6</td><td>24.05</td><td></td><td>9559</td><td>4.09</td></tr></table><br/><br/>The Deputy will appreciate that estimating the scale of any illegal activity, and the tax loss to which it gives rise, is necessarily difficult and that estimates of such loss need to be viewed with caution.The extent of the illegal trade in cigarettes is estimated through annual surveys of smokers that are carried out for them and for the National Tobacco Control Office of the Health Service Executive by Ipsos MRBI. The 2013 survey indicated that some 11% of cigarettes consumed were illicit.  This represents a loss of some &euro;212 million to the exchequer in excise duty and VAT, assuming that the illegal cigarettes consumed displaced the equivalent full tax paid quantities of cigarettes.  A further survey in respect of 2014 is underway and it is expected that the results will be available towards the end of the first quarter of 2015. <br/><br/>A separate and smaller-scale survey on &quot;roll your own&quot; tobacco conducted by Ipsos MRBI last year found that 15% of tobacco packets held by the smokers surveyed were illegal.  On that basis, it is estimated that the loss to the exchequer would be in the order of some &euro;17 million.<br/><br/>The penalties for smuggling tobacco products are laid down in section 119 of the Finance Act 2001.Section 78 of the Finance Act 2005 provides for penalties for the illegal sale of unstamped tobacco products while section 78A of that Act contains penalties in relation to the illicit production of tobacco products.On conviction following summary prosecution for any of these offences, a court may impose a fine of &euro;5,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both a fine and imprisonment.  A fine of up to &euro;126,970 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years, or both a fine and imprisonment, may be imposed on conviction following a prosecution on indictment.  Section 119 of the Finance Act 2001 provides also that, where the value of the goods concerned (inclusive of any tax or duty payable on them) is greater than &euro;250,000, a fine of an amount not exceeding three times their value may be imposed. <br/><br/>The specific penalty to be imposed in any particular case is a matter for the courts.Section 130(2) of the Finance Act 2001 permits a trial judge, in his or her discretion, to mitigate a fine or penalty incurred for an offence under excise law, provided that the amount mitigated is not greater than 50 per cent of the amount of the fine or penalty.<br/><br/>The penalties for summary and indictable offences in relation to tobacco smuggling and illegal selling were increased significantly in 2008 and 2010 respectively.Fines for summary offences are set at the maximum level that may be applied by the District Court.There are no proposals for further penalty increases at present, but the position is kept under review.<br/><br/>I wish to inform the Deputy also that a number of legal provisions have been introduced in recent years to further strengthen Revenue's response to the illegal tobacco trade.<br/><br/>The Finance Act 2012 clarified the legal basis for Revenue officers to open and examine the contents of postal and courier packets that are reasonably believed to contain untaxed excise products.  The Finance Act 2013 introduced new offences and forfeiture measures relating to the illicit production of tobacco, including offences for involvement with illicit tobacco production, knowingly dealing in or delivering any illicit tobacco product and keeping materials and equipment for the purposes of illicit production.Provision was made also for the forfeiture of any equipment or materials, including unmanufactured tobacco, used for illicit production.  That Act also strengthened the offence provisions relating to the sale or delivery of unstamped tobacco products.  The Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 provided that a person suspected of an offence of dealing in, or with, unstamped tobacco products must provide information to a Revenue Officer or a Garda and may be required to present any tobacco product concerned for examination, and makes provision for search by a Revenue officer or a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of any bag or other receptacle that he or she reasonably believes to contain tobacco products that are concerned in the offence.<br/><br/>As well as those changes to primary law, I introduced a quantitative restriction, with effect from 1 January 2014, on the number of cigarettes that may be brought into the State for personal use by individuals travelling from Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania.  The Excise Duty on Cigarettes (Quantitative Restrictions) Order 2013 (S.I. No. 553 of 2013) provides that the number of tax-paid cigarettes that may be brought into Ireland for personal use by individuals travelling from those Member States, without payment of further excise duty in Ireland, is restricted to 300.  Anyone with cigarettes in excess of that quantity must declare them to a Revenue Officer and pay the appropriate excise duty.  This restriction will remain in place until 31 December 2017 or until such time as the particular Member State has achieved the required EU minimum tax levels, whichever is the earlier. <br/><br/>I am satisfied that the legislative framework as it now stands, and the penalties that apply in respect of tobacco related offences, provide an effective basis for action  by Revenue against the illegal tobacco trade.  Nonetheless, the position will be kept under review and I am committed to responding positively to any proposals for additional measures that might assist the Revenue Commissioners in that regard.<br/><br/>Revenue relies on the tobacco tax stamp to identify tax-paid tobacco products and this will continue following the introduction of standardised packaging.  The standardised packaging legislation will accommodate the tax stamp and Revenue expects that the new packaging rules will ensure effective security features to make counterfeiting very difficult.  The tobacco tax stamp has, itself, a range of sophisticated security features to minimise the risk of counterfeiting.  I am advised that Revenue's view is that the introduction of standardised packaging will not affect their work against the illicit trade in tobacco products.  <br/><br/>Revenue currently has three mobile scanner systems.  Two of these are mobile x-ray container scanning systems that are based at Dublin Port and Rosslare Ferry Port respectively.  Both of these scanners are available for deployment at other ports, and at other locations such as warehouses, as required, and Revenue uses them, on a risk assessment basis, at various locations throughout the country.  The other mobile scanning system is a scanner van, a specialist vehicle incorporating an x-ray facility and radiation detection facilities.  It is used for monitoring baggage and cargo at airports for narcotics, tobacco products, radioactive materials and other contraband.  It also allows Revenue officers to carry out control actions at other locations such as warehouses and courier depots.<br/><br/>The mobile scanner systems are complemented by static baggage and parcel scanners at all major ports, airports and postal depots.<br/><br/>Revenue continuously reviews its detection technology requirements, taking account of developments in those technologies, and has availed of part-funding under the European Union's Hercule programme to acquire new or replacement equipment of this kind.  I understand that Revenue is generally satisfied with the current scanning capabilities and consider that the container ports are adequately serviced by the two mobile x-ray container scanning systems. I am advised also that the performance of the scanner van has been evaluated on an ongoing basis since its acquisition, and that the possibility of augmenting this resource with additional units is currently being considered.</p></reply>

A successful applicant is provided with a Primary Medical Certificate, which is required under the Regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the Regulations. <br/><br/>An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.  The Regulations mandate that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations.  After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition.<br/><br/>Given the independence of the Medical Board of Appeal is provided for by Regulation 6(1)(e) of S.I. 353 of 1994, the Deputy will appreciate it would not be appropriate for myself or my officials to meet the citizen in question at this juncture.</p></reply>

Although this represents a slowdown on the exceptionally strong first half of the year, GDP still grew by close to 5 per cent year-on-year in the first half of this year.</p><p>  On a full-year basis, the increase in economic activity is broadly-based with both domestic sectors and exporting sectors performing strongly.  Importantly, domestic demand is continuing to grow, with consumption and investment up in the first three quarters of the year.  Exports continued their strong performance up 15.5 per cent year-on-year, the strongest growth since 2001.</p><p>  Recovery is perhaps most clearly evident in the labour market, with employment having increased in each of the last eight quarters, representing a net increase of nearly 85,000 jobs since the low-point in mid-2012.  It is expected that employment will continue to increase and that unemployment will continue to fall steadily, to an average of 10.2 per cent next year.</p><p>  Growth in the euro area is essential for sustained growth in Ireland.  The sluggish growth being recorded in the euro area at the moment remains of concern.  Notwithstanding that, Ireland has out-performed other EU Member States in recent quarters due in part to the competitiveness improvements achieved in recent years, as well as to Ireland's economy being more closely linked than those of other euro area countries to the UK and US economies.  The Department of Finance is forecasting GDP growth of 4.7 per cent this year and 3.9 per cent in 2015.  According to recent forecasts by the European Commission, Ireland is set to record the fastest rate of GDP growth in the EU this year and in 2015.</p><p>  In terms of the public finances, policy measures implemented by the Government have resulted in a decline in Ireland's deficit in recent years.  This decline has been managed in a phased manner, consistent with the dual needs of supporting domestic activity as well as repairing the public finances.  All of Ireland's interim deficit ceilings under the Excessive Deficit Procedure have been met and, as a result, Ireland is firmly on track to achieve a deficit of below 3 per cent in 2015.  This fall in the deficit has been important in restoring Ireland's credibility in the international markets; bond yields have fallen substantially since the high rates of mid-2011.  The debt ratio has peaked and is now on a downward path.</p></reply>

It is important to take into account that the figures displayed for 2011, 2012 and 2013 in the table are based on end-year outturns and are on a Revenue Net Receipts basis.  These can differ slightly from Exchequer Receipts for reasons of accounting and timing.  The estimates and projected percentages for 2014 and 2015 are in respect of the most up to date forecast as contained in Budget 2015.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Total USC Receipts &euro;million</th><th>Total Income Tax Receipts (Including USC Receipts) &euro;million</th><th>Total USC Receipts as a % of total Income Tax Receipts</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;3,114</td><td>&euro;13,814</td><td>22.5%</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;3,790</td><td>&euro;15,151</td><td>25.0%</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;3,930</td><td>&euro;15,753</td><td>24.9%</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;3,695</td><td>&euro;17,180</td><td>21.5%</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>&euro;4,175</td><td>&euro;17,980</td><td>23.2%</td></tr></table><br/><br/>It should be noted that receipts, when received by the Revenue Commissioners, are apportioned on an estimated basis between Income Tax and USC and then finalised when end year tax returns are filed.  This apportionment remains in place for Schedule D (self employed) taxpayers.  However for PAYE taxpayers, since mid-year 2013, the monthly employer returns specify the Income Tax /USC split.  The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that the 2013 P35 returns (received in early 2014) show lower USC payments and higher PAYE payments than was initially allocated in 2013.  To offset an automatic reallocation based on these P35 declarations, receipts are being taken out of USC collection throughout 2014.<br/><br/>The net Exchequer effect of the reapportionment is and will remain neutral.</p></reply>

The taxable amount is the gross rent less allowable expenses incurred in earning that rent, as specified in section 97(2) of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997.  The main deductible expenses are: <br/><br/>- any rent payable by the landlord in the case of a sub-lease;<br/><br/>- the cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant;<br/><br/>- the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property;<br/><br/>- the interest on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair the property (which, in the case of residential property, is restricted to 75% of the interest and is subject to compliance with PRTB registration requirements for all tenancies that existed in relation to the property in the relevant year); and<br/><br/>- payment of local authority rates.<br/><br/>In addition, wear and tear capital allowances are available in respect of the capital expenditure incurred on fixtures and fittings provided by a landlord for the purposes of furnishing rented residential accommodation.  These allowances are granted at the rate of 12.5% per annum of the actual cost of the fixtures and fittings over a period of 8 years.<br/><br/>The effect of the deduction of allowable expenses from gross rent means that the amount of taxable rental income will often be substantially lower than the gross rent, and could, depending on individual circumstances, be nil.<br/><br/>In relation to interest on borrowings, section 105 of the TCA 1997 provides that a deduction is not due for interest payable in respect of a period prior to the first letting of a property.

The Commissioners have confirmed that these costs amounted to approximately &euro;520,000 for 2013.  I am advised that relevant costs for 2014 are not yet available but are likely to be significantly less than the 2013 figures, as will be seen from the figures below.</p><p>  In Revenue's public information campaign, the online filing option has been strongly promoted as the easiest way to file and pay and the success of this campaign is reflected in the number of owners who are using the online LPT facility on the Revenue website.  In addition, the Deputy will be aware that any person who owns two or more properties is obliged to file electronically and Revenue provides a telephone based e-filing service for those property owners who do not have the capacity to file electronically themselves.  I am informed that 77% of all LPT returns for 2013 were filed using the online LPT filing system and the balance of 23% were paper returns. For 2014, about 90% of those who were required to select a payment method completed their transaction online and the indications for 2015 payments so far are consistent with this figure. </p><p>  While it is stated Government policy to move to online service provision, in view of the range of property owners who may not be currently &quot;e&quot; enabled and need the paper filing option to make their LPT Return and payment, I would not be in favour of moving to a fully automated LPT system at this point in time. </p></reply>

Employees are exempt from the charge to PRSI if their income does not exceed &euro;18,304.  However, once PAYE income exceeds this threshold they are liable to pay PRSI on the full amount at 4%, thus equalising the treatment of personal PRSI contributions, on all of the income, for PAYE and self-assessed workers on incomes above that level. </p><p>  Self-assessed individuals are required to pay the greater of &euro;500 per annum, or 4% of their income, whichever is higher, and do not benefit from the exemption threshold.  However, in the case of employees, their employers are required to pay a PRSI charge in respect of each employee.  Thus the contribution made to the Social Insurance Fund in respect of employees is usually higher than that made by a self-assessed individual.  For instance, at the specified income level of &euro;15,000, an employer would typically be required to pay PRSI of &euro;1,275 in respect of the employee.  PRSI of &euro;600 is payable in respect of a self-employed individual with the same income.  Entitlement to social welfare benefits is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social Protection.  However, it is worth pointing out that for individuals with incomes in excess of &euro;18,304 the total PRSI payable in respect of an employee is 14.75% of salary, while the total payable by a self-employed individual is 4%.</p><p>  Employees in the PAYE system benefit from a PAYE income tax credit worth &euro;1,650 per annum, to which the self-assessed are not entitled.  The PAYE allowance, as it was then, was introduced in 1980 to improve the tax progression of PAYE taxpayers and to take account of the fact that the self-employed generally then had the advantage of paying tax on a preceding year basis.  The argument was also made at the time that the general scheme of allowances for expenses discriminated against employees and in favour of other taxpayers. </p><p>  There have been some changes since 1980.  For example, the self-employed now pay tax on a current year basis.  In addition, the PAYE allowance has become a tax credit.  However, there are other aspects to how the self-assessed are taxed which can be beneficial to them.  For instance, there are significant timing benefits, depending on the accounting period used by the taxpayer, which are available to the self-assessed but which are not available to PAYE workers.  In addition, the expenses regime for self-assessed taxpayers remains somewhat more liberal than that afforded to employees and therefore the self-employed can actually pay less tax when compared to a PAYE worker on the same income.</p><p>  It is important to note that the changes to the Income Tax system introduced in Budget 2015 will benefit all those who pay income tax and or USC equally, regardless of whether they are PAYE or self-assessed taxpayers.</p></reply>

The Task Force was chaired jointly by the EIB and the European Commission and included a nominee from each Member State. The Task Force requested each Member State to submit a list of projects in accordance with its terms of reference.</p><p>  Ireland's EIB Task Force's project list has been the result of coordination between my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and the Departments with responsibility for the investment sectors specified in the Task Force's Terms of Reference.  We have relied on Department's and agencies with direct policy responsibility as the source of all the projects that have been included in Ireland's input to the EU wide project list. </p><p>  The Irish project list is part of an EU wide request from the Task Force to gauge the level of available projects in the period 2015-2017 should investment resources be found.  The project list is only a cross section of available projects that could commence between 2015 and 2017.  The list does not involve prioritisation and does not bestow any special status on the projects themselves.  It is still a matter for the Department's concerned to advance these projects or other projects such as the one you have mentioned in accordance with the Capital programme and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.   As of now, there is no extra funding available beyond the allocations agreed at Budget time and published in the Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2015-2017.  It is also important to acknowledge that the current rules of the Stability and Growth Pact mean that even if additional resources were to become available whether they could be used for additional expenditure would depend on the impact of that expenditure on our expenditure limits and the GGB, while how they could be used would depend on competing expenditure priorities.</p></reply>

To meet this objective, NAMA must realise assets including through the sale residential property portfolios.  It is entirely incorrect to claim that the sale of assets securing NAMA's loans is contributing to rent inflation in the private residential rental market.  Rent levels are determined by the interaction of supply and demand in the market.  The owners of residential property, be they NAMA debtors and receivers or private investors, set rents at levels that are in accordance with what the market is willing to pay.  I cannot accept the implication of the Deputy's question, namely, that there is an onus on NAMA to subsidise the rents paid by private tenants. </p><p>  However, we recognise the evidence of a growing and significant under-supply of available housing units demonstrated by rising prices and rent levels in key urban areas, especially in parts of Dublin.</p><p>  I can assure you that this issue is being taken seriously.  The Construction 2020 initiative sets out a focussed programme of action  to deliver a strong, sustainable, well-financed, competitive and innovative approach to construction and housing.  This initiative is examining a number of aspects of the Irish property market with the aim of uncovering the source of any current market dysfunction and making recommendations to address these.  It will develop an overall strategic approach to housing supply one that is evidence based, and that equips local and national authorities with the tools they need to detect emerging imbalances and to take the steps necessary to correct them.   We intend to ensure that renting is a secure, stable, and viable option for those who choose it.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the Revenue Commissioners do not have statistics on the uptake of the scheme and a county level breakdown is not available. </p><p>  The scheme operates on a self-administration basis, and relief is automatically available provided the employer is satisfied that the conditions of their particular scheme meet the requirements of the legislation.  The purchase of bicycles and associated safety equipment by employers for employees or directors is subject to the normal Revenue audit procedure with the normal obligations on employers to maintain records (e.g. delivery dockets, invoices, payments details, etc.).</p><p>  It was estimated at the time of the introduction of the scheme that approximately 7,000 employees would avail of it over the first five-year period of its operation at a cost of &euro;0.4 million in a full year.

However, Ireland applies the 13.5% reduced rate of VAT to construction services under a derogation from the EU VAT Directive, because Ireland applied a reduced rate to such services on 1 January 1991.  However, this derogation is only permissible where the VAT rate applying is 12% or greater.  In this case, it is not legally possible to introduce a 9% rate of VAT on all construction services.</p><p>  Having said that, it is possible for us to apply the 9% VAT rate to the construction of residential properties.  However, this would involve having two separate VAT rates applying to construction services, which would be difficult to administer and could lead to underpayment of VAT.  However, the Deputy will be aware that the Home Renovation Incentive, which came into operation on 25 October 2013 and will run until 31 December 2015, provides tax relief by way of a tax credit at 13.5% of qualifying expenditure incurred on repair, renovation or improvement work carried out on a principal private residence. </p><p>  The Home Renovation Incentive has been very successful to date with works on just under 12,100 homes notified to the Revenue online system as of 14 November 2014.  This represents more than &euro;243 million worth of works involving some 3,464 contractors.  The Incentive is generating significant employment in the tax compliant construction sector and increasing sales in building supplies, hardware and related businesses.  </p><p>  I announced in the Budget that I am extending the Home Renovation Incentive to rental properties whose owners are liable to income tax.  The aim of this amendment is to increase and improve housing supply at a time when there is strong demand for housing and insufficient supply in certain areas.</p><p>  As is currently the case, the work must cost a minimum of &euro;5,000 inclusive of VAT which would attract a tax credit of &euro;595.  Relief will be granted in respect of qualifying expenditure up to &euro;30,000 exclusive of VAT.  The maximum credit is &euro;4,050.  Qualifying expenditure is expenditure which is subject to the 13.5% VAT rate.</p><p>  The credit is payable over the two years following the year in which the work is carried out.  The minimum threshold does not have to be reached by each contractor, where a homeowner or landlord engages a number of contractors to carry out different works.  So long as the aggregate payments reach the minimum threshold of &euro;5,000 inclusive of VAT, the homeowner or landlord will qualify for relief.</p><p>  The scheme is administered through Revenue's online systems.  Contractors are required to inform Revenue in advance of details of works to be carried and are also required to notify Revenue in relation to any payments received in respect of the works.  Homeowners are able to view the information provided to Revenue by the contractor through the Revenue electronic systems and also claim the relief through those systems.</p><p>  With regard to the cost of reducing the VAT rate on construction services, given the options for reducing the VAT rate, estimating a costing would not be appropriate as the Revenue Commissioners' statistics are not compiled in such a way as to provide a suitable basis to accurately estimate the impact on the Exchequer from the change mentioned in the question.</p></reply>

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit.  It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced.  It is applied at a low rate on a wide base.  I should point out that it was never intended that the USC would be a temporary measure.  The USC was designed and incorporated in to the Irish taxation system as part of its permanent structure and the revenues collected play a vital part in meeting the many expenditure demands placed on the Exchequer. </p><p>  It is estimated that the income tax and USC measures introduced in Budget 2015 will cost &euro;478 million in 2015.  Although this is a sizeable amount of money it is only about one tenth of the estimated yield from USC next year.  Thus any plan to abolish USC would need to be implemented over a long period and would be subject to the fiscal space available in each year.  In addition, Government priorities need to be considered on an annual basis, particularly regarding tax and expenditure measures, and the annual Budget process allows Government to consider all of these aspects in the round.  Therefore, I would not be in favour of tying the Government to multi-annual specific changes to only one aspect of the tax system in isolation.</p><p>  The Deputy should note that the amounts raised by the new USC in 2011 were of the same magnitude as that raised from the levies that it replaced.  It is estimated that USC receipts for 2014 will amount to around &euro;4 billion, or approximately one quarter of total income tax receipts. Any scheme to abolish the USC would have to contain a credible road map as to how this revenue would be replaced, in order that vital services can continue to be funded. </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that in fulfilment of a Programme for Government commitment my Department conducted a review of the USC in 2011.  As a result, I decided to raise the USC exemption threshold from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 in Budget 2012, removing 330,000 individuals from liability to the charge entirely.</p><p>  Furthermore, in Budget 2015 I extended the USC exemption threshold to &euro;12,012, taking another 87,000 out of the charge.  Budget 2015 also included a reduction in the two lower rates of USC and an extension of the threshold before which an individual is liable to the 7% rate, thereby exempting all those on the standard minimum wage from liability to the higher rates of USC entirely.  Collectively the budgetary income tax and USC measures ensure that all those who pay income tax and or USC will see a reduction in their tax bill from next year.</p><p>  A fair, efficient and competitive income tax system is essential for economic growth and job creation.  I have long said that the burden of the income tax system in Ireland is too high and that I would seek to reduce it when the public finances would allow me to do so.  The income tax measures in the Bill are the first stage of a three-year plan to reduce the marginal tax rate on low and middle income earners in a manner that maintains the highly progressive nature of the Irish tax system.  However, it is not possible to be specific about the individual components of the plan for subsequent years, as each component will need to be considered in terms of its overall contribution to the total tax package delivered in each year's Budget.</p></reply>

The operational framework for the DRI, approved on the same date, includes a specific provision in relation to the retroactive application of the instrument.  The guideline states that the potential application of the instrument for this purpose should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement.</p><p>  However, I would remind the Deputy that unlike back in 2012, the ESM is no longer the only option open to us to recover the money provided to recapitalise our banks.  Investors are now willing to support Irish banks again and the market value of our investments has improved accordingly.</p><p>  With respect to the State's shareholdings or ownership in the banks, Government policy remains unchanged that we do not wish to hold these investments in the banks over the long term.  Subject to market conditions therefore we are willing to exit in a manner that maximises value for the taxpayer.</p><p>  In the last 18 months the State has exited successfully from some debt investments with the sale of our &quot;Cocos&quot; and Preference Shares in Bank of Ireland in addition to the sale of Irish Life.  Given the significant cash resources we hold, we are not under any immediate pressure to exit our remaining investments.  However given where our national debt is, neither do we have the luxury of holding on indefinitely.</p><p>  In relation to AIB, which is our largest remaining investment, we have important work and decisions to make around the bank's capital structure and how we should best reconfigure our various holdings in a way that benefits both the bank and the taxpayer.  Hence we are not making any decisions around reducing our ownership of the bank now.  If we can deliver on this work programme next year and everything else develops as we would like, then we may be at the point where we can consider selling some of our shares.</p><p>  In relation to retrospective recapitalisation via the ESM, I would reiterate what I've said previously, that in Europe a strategic approach tends to deliver the best results and that it serves our interest to keep this on the table.</p><p>  However I see no benefit in making an application to the ESM now. I believe the work we are doing in relation to our AIB investments will help us better understand what they are really worth, and ultimately which route - ESM or the markets - will be our best option.</p></reply>

During the development process, some matching difficulties occurred when consolidating the various Government and non-Government data sources and as a result the information input to the Register for a relatively small number of cases was incorrect.</p><p>  As part of its comprehensive communications strategy, Revenue requested that any taxpayers who received an LPT Return for a property they did not own to make immediate contact with the LPT team so that the Register could be corrected thereby preventing any unnecessary debt collection/enforcement action, including possible mandatory deduction at source (DaS) from income/pension payments. </p><p>  In regard to the specific case to which the Deputy refers, the difficulties occurred because the person in question did not make contact with Revenue to confirm that she was not the liable owner of the property for which an LPT Return issued, though it is acknowledged that the various LPT notifications issued to the address of the property in question and she may not have had sight of them.

There is no specific exemption in the case of interest paid on deposit accounts held by children.<br/><br/>Certain exemptions apply from DIRT, the main ones are:<br/><br/>Individuals aged over 65: <br/><br/>Since the enactment of the Finance Act 2007, individuals are exempt from Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) on their interest income provided they or their spouse or civil partner  are aged 65 or over, and their total income in a year (including the interest) is below the annual exemption limit.<br/><br/>The annual exemption limits, for 2014, are as follows<br/><br/>&euro;18,000 (in the case of a single person) and<br/><br/>&euro;36,000 (in the case of a married couple or civil partnership).<br/><br/>In order to claim the exemption the person must make a declaration, on form DE1, to the financial institution where the account is held.  As part of the process, the person makes a declaration on the form DE1 that their income is less than the exemption limit and that they will notify the financial institution if this changes.<br/><br/>In the absence of this declaration, a financial institution must deduct DIRT at the appropriate rate from the interest income.  However, in any case where tax was so deducted from interest income of an individual who otherwise qualifies for the exemption, he or she will be entitled to a refund of that tax.<br/><br/>Permanently Incapacitated Individuals:<br/><br/>Since the enactment of the Finance Act, 2007, an exemption from DIRT also applies where an individual, his or her spouse or civil partner:<br/><br/>I. is permanently incapacitated by reason of physical or mental infirmity from maintaining himself or herself and<br/><br/>II. is not liable to pay income tax because of the level of his or her income. <br/><br/>In order to claim the exemption, the individual must make a declaration to the Revenue Commissioners, on form (DE 2) to the effect that they or their spouse or civil partner are permanently incapacitated.  Where the person qualifies for the exemption, Revenue will notify the financial institution where the deposit account is held, that they should operate a DIRT free account for the individual.<br/><br/>In the absence of a Revenue notification, a financial institution must deduct DIRT at the appropriate rate from the interest income.  However, in any case where tax was so deducted from interest income of an individual who otherwise qualifies for the exemption, he or she will be entitled to a refund of that tax. <br/><br/>Companies, Pension Funds and Charities:<br/><br/>DIRT is not deducted from interest paid on deposits held by companies, pension funds or charities.  However, Irish resident companies pay tax on investment income (including deposit interest) at 25%.<br/><br/>Non-Resident Account Holders:<br/><br/>Deposit accounts where all of the interest on the deposit is beneficially owned by a person or persons resident outside the State are exempt from the application of DIRT.  However a joint account owned by an Irish resident and a foreign resident would be subject to the retention tax system.</p></reply>

In total, there were 15,734 Borrower Groups comprising 24,632 loans for sale across the 6 portfolios. </p><p>  In April 2014, the Special Liquidators announced that the initial loan sales process had concluded. The sales process of the IBRC loan assets delivered a very positive result with over 90% of the loan assets (with a par value of &euro;21.7bn) being sold.</p><p>  Following instructions from the Minister for Finance, NAMA are no longer obliged to purchase the unsold IBRC assets at their independent valuation as previously envisaged, as the expected proceeds to be raised from the sale of the IBRC loan assets will be sufficient to fully repay the IBRC debt to NAMA (this debt has since been fully repaid).  Therefore, the Special Liquidators devised a further sales process in respect of the unsold loan assets to maximise the return to all remaining creditors of IBRC, including the State. </p><p>  The Special Liquidators have corresponded with all those remaining Borrowers of IBRC whose loan assets were not sold in the first sales process providing them with an opportunity to make written representations on the method of disposal of their loans and the criteria for determining who may bid for loan assets. Consideration was given to these Borrower representations and the Special Liquidators responded to these Borrower representations. </p><p>  This sales process is currently underway and the Special Liquidators are unable to quantify at this stage the total sales proceeds that will be achieved from this process.  The Special Liquidators expect the sales of the remaining loan assets to be completed before 31 December 2014.</p><p>  In tandem with the further sales process, the Special Liquidators have published advertisements and written to those known creditors in order to finalise their claims in the liquidation.

The sales process of the IBRC loan assets, including their segmentation to meet demand from international buyers, delivered a very positive result with over 90% of the loan assets (with a par value of &euro;21.7bn) sold.<br/><br/>Following instructions issued by me, NAMA are no longer obliged to purchase the unsold IBRC assets at their independent valuation as previously envisaged, as it became clear that the expected proceeds to be raised from the sale of the IBRC loan assets would be sufficient to fully repay the IBRC debt to NAMA. <br/><br/>The Special Liquidators have therefore devised a further sales process in respect of the unsold loan assets so as to maximise the return to all remaining creditors of IBRC, including the State.  This sales process is currently underway and the Special Liquidators are unable to quantify at this stage the total sales proceeds that will be achieved from this process.<br/><br/>As the Special Liquidators maximise the proceeds of the liquidation, it is important that they have a comprehensive view of the creditors who ultimately may be entitled to these proceeds.  To this end, the Special Liquidators have published advertisements and written to those known creditors in order to finalise their claims in the liquidation.  Creditors in the UK and Ireland have until 31 March 2015 to submit their claims and those creditors in the US have until 31 May 2015. <br/><br/>Once all claims have been submitted, they will be reviewed in detail and adjudicated on by the Special Liquidators.  In order to finalise this process, further information may be sought from some creditors in order to validate their claim.<br/><br/>The Special Liquidators are unable to comment at this stage both on the level of proceeds that will ultimately be generated from the liquidation and on the level of valid creditor claims that will ultimately be received in respect of the liquidation.  It is the balance between the proceeds generated by the liquidation and level of valid claims received and approved that will ultimately determine the dividend to which each creditor may be entitled.  The ultimate level of dividend, if any, paid to each creditor cannot be known until such time as the sales processes are complete, the total level of adjudicated creditors is finalised and the other contingent creditor claims which may crystallise, including those from litigation, are known.<br/><br/>It is understood that for the payment of proceeds from the liquidation, preferred creditors and senior unsecured creditors will rank in priority to the holders of subordinated debt.  The priority for the distribution of assets under the Companies Acts is generally:<br/><br/>i. costs and expenses of the ongoing liquidation;<br/><br/>ii. preferential creditors, including certain taxes and employee and pension claims arising prior to the date of liquidation (these claims are certain to be paid in full)<br/><br/>iii amounts owing to NAMA under the Facility Deed acquired from the Central Bank which were secured by a floating charge over the banks assets (this debt is now fully repaid and so the floating charge is now released)<br/><br/>iv. unsecured creditors, including:<br/><br/>- Debts owing to the Minister/NTMA under ELG and to DGS<br/><br/>- Unguaranteed debt/depositors (including holders of tracker bonds etc.)<br/><br/>- Unknown, including:<br/><br/>- Local authority development bonds<br/><br/>- Suppliers/other  normal  unsecured creditors<br/><br/>- Employees that are not preferential creditors<br/><br/>- Contingent creditors and other potential costs principally relating to litigation etc <br/><br/>v. subordinated creditors<br/><br/>vi. Members of the company - the Minister currently holds 100% of all shares and preference shares in the company.</p></reply>

The Courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and, therefore, it is not open to me as a Minister to comment in any way.  I understand that the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013 proposes to replace the Wards of Court system with a new legal framework that gives greater autonomy to those who need assistance in making fundamental decisions concerning their lives.  If the Deputy requires further details on that Bill he should approach my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality who is sponsoring the Bill. <br/><br/>For the information of the Deputy, section 189 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 exempts from income tax and capital gains tax, the return arising to permanently incapacitated individuals from the investment of compensation payments awarded by the Courts, or made under an out-of-court settlement, or following assessment by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, in respect of personal injury claims.  The section applies where the return on such investment (both income and gains) is greater than 50 percent of the individual's total income and gains. <br/><br/>In relation to Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT), Finance Act 2007 introduced new arrangements that allow a person to have any interest earned on money on deposit credited to their savings account by their Financial Institution without deduction of DIRT where they satisfy certain conditions.  If a person meets these conditions, they can apply to Revenue to have the interest paid without deduction of DIRT.  The conditions involved are that either the person or their Spouse or Civil Partner (if appropriate) are permanently incapacitated by physical or mental infirmity from maintaining themselves, and would be entitled to a refund of the entire amount of DIRT deducted by a Financial Institution.  A trustee of a Special Trust under Section 189A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, can apply for exemption from DIRT, in respect of an account held by them, where the trust was set up exclusively for the benefit of one or more specified permanently incapacitated individuals and the funds of such a trust were obtained by subscriptions from the general public.  The funds in the account must be beneficially owned by the specified permanently incapacitated individual(s)<b>.</b><br/><br/>As regards exit tax, where funds which are held under the control or subject to the order of any Court are used to acquire units in an investment undertaking, payments from the investment undertaking to the Courts Service in respect of these units may be made without deduction of the exit tax.  In addition the Courts Service will not be subject to exit tax in respect of a transfer of units resulting solely from the changing of investment managers.  However, the Courts Service will be required to operate the exit tax when they allocate those payments to the beneficial owners.<br/><br/>The following persons may be entitled to repayment of exit tax provided the conditions outlined in the following sections of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, are satisfied<br/><br/>- a permanently incapacitated individual who is exempt from income tax under section 189 in respect of income arising from the investment of compensation payments in respect of personal injury claims;<br/><br/>- the trustees of a 'qualifying trust' within section 189A where the life policy is held as part of the trust fund (funds raised for the benefit of incapacitated individual(s) through public subscriptions) of the qualifying trust, provided that income from the trust or investment returns from investment of the trust funds is the sole or main income of the incapacitated individual;<br/><br/>- a thalidomide victim who is exempt from income tax under section 192 in respect of income arising from the investment of compensation payments made by the Minister for Health and Children or by the foundation Hilfswerk f&uuml;r behinderte Kinder.<br/><br/>The investment undertaking or Courts Service must deduct the exit tax in the normal manner, but the individual or trust may be entitled to a repayment of the exit tax.  The exit tax can be reclaimed, where appropriate, when the annual tax return is submitted to Revenue.<br/><br/>I assume that the stamp duty referred to in the correspondence relates to fees payable to the Courts Service and thus is outside the scope of the tax system.</p></reply>

This Department has set out its obligations as part of our Irish Languages Scheme 2014-2017.<br/><br/>Generally the Department does not provide services directly to the public but where there is a need for translation and Divisions do not have a member of staff proficient in Irish, or where such a person is not available, a designated member of staff from another Division will provide a service in Irish where required.  A Language and Qualifications survey was carried out during 2014 which indicated that 7 members of staff have some proficiency in Irish.  This represents some 2.3% of the current staff compliment of the Department. <br/><br/>As part of the 2014-2017 Irish Languages Scheme within this Department, the Department plans to carry out the following activities:<br/><br/><b>Means of Communicating with the Public/Information to the Public</b><br/><br/>In conjunction with this new Irish Language Scheme, the Department is updating its Customer Service Action Plan and Customer Charter.<b></b>The revised Charter will continue to reflect the principles of Quality Customer Service and in this way ensure that persons who wish to conduct their business through Irish are facilitated as much as possible.<br/><br/><b>Correspondence</b><br/><br/>All correspondence (letters, phone calls, requests) received in Irish will continue to be logged to allow for monitoring of demand and will be responded to in Irish.  In addition to fulfilling the legal obligation to reply in Irish to correspondence received in Irish, the Department will strive to correspond in Irish with those who are known to prefer correspondence in Irish.  Standard messages on the Department's e-mail system, such as disclaimers of responsibility, will be both in Irish and English.  Staff will be encouraged to provide automatic out of office messages in Irish and English.<br/><br/><b>Department Website and Computer Systems</b><br/><br/>While a limited version of this website is available in Irish, it will be enhanced and developed to have at least 25% of documents made available in Irish and in addition to the provision of static content, the Department will continue to build on the Irish language content on its website.<br/><br/><b>Speeches</b><br/><br/>Speeches or statements, given by the Minister in the Oireachtas or elsewhere as well as made by senior officials will continue to be made in the language in which they are delivered.<br/><br/><b>Official Invitations</b><br/><br/>The Department will ensure that invitations to official functions hosted by the Minster or Ministers for State are printed bilingually.<br/><br/><b>Publications</b><br/><br/>The Department produces a range of publications from various policy areas.  The Department undertakes to provide bilingual versions of core publications (major policy statements, strategies etc.) preferably within the same cover (either hard copy or electronic publications).  It is not the intention to publish bilingually all technical documents or those having a small circulation.  Under Section 10 of the Official Languages Act 2003, the Department publishes the following documents in both Irish and English:<br/><br/><b>Documents setting out public policy</b><br/><br/>Annual Report<br/><br/>Audited Accounts<br/><br/>Statement of Strategy<br/><br/>Documents of major public importance<br/><br/><b>The Department also publishes the following documents in both Irish and English:</b><br/><br/>Annual Appropriation Accounts<br/><br/>Budget (summary of Budget Measures)<br/><br/>Finance Accounts<br/><br/>Irish Language Scheme<br/><br/>Legislation<br/><br/>Medium Term Economic Strategy<br/><br/>White Paper on Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure<br/><br/><b>Oral Announcements/Telephone Communications with the Public</b><br/><br/>In line with the principles of Quality Customer Service, the Department continues to ensure that the switchboard operators and receptionists, who are the first point of contact with the public, give <br/><br/>The name of the Department in Irish and English <br/><br/>Are familiar with basic greetings in Irish<br/><br/>Put members of the public in contact without delay with whatever offices or officer is responsible for offering services required through Irish<br/><br/><b>Press Releases </b><br/><br/>Over the period of the Irish Language Scheme 2014-2017 the Department intends to issue 30% of press releases bilingually.  Where possible press releases in Irish will issue at the same time as English language ones but where this is not possible, Irish language versions will be provided on the website within 24 hours.<br/><br/><b>Meetings</b><br/><br/>It is the policy of the Department that, when warranted, staff proficient in Irish will continue to be provided when meeting Irish language organisations where sufficient notice is given.<br/><br/><b>Learning and Development</b><br/><br/>The Department includes Irish language awareness as part of the Induction training course, to ensure that staff understand their bilingual obligations under the Official Languages Act 2003.<br/><br/><b>Seachtain na Gaeilge</b><br/><br/>The Department is committed to promoting cultural initiatives which support and encourages the use of the Irish language.  In this way, the Department supports activities organised during Seachtain na Gaeilge and will seek advice from Irish language bodies in this respect.</p></reply>

The relief will continue, in relation to the conveyance of land executed on or after 1 January 2015 and before 1 January 2018.  Farmers of any age who may wish to transfer their land to a close relative have an opportunity to do so before 1 January 2016. Thereafter, the relief will only be available where the farmer transferring the land is aged 66 years or under. The relative who acquires the land or a person to whom the relative may lease the land for a period of not less than 6 years, must be either a farmer with an agricultural qualification or a farmer who spends not less than 50% of his or her normal working time farming the land on a commercial basis and with a view to the realisation of profits.<br/><br/><b></b>Relief from stamp duty on agricultural leases.<b></b>This relief applies to leases for a period of not less than 6 years and not more than 35 years.  The land must be used exclusively for farming carried on by the lessee.  The lessee who acquires the lease of the land must be either a farmer with an agricultural qualification or a farmer who spends not less than 50% of his or her normal working time farming on a commercial basis and with a view to the realisation of profits. This relief is subject to a Commencement Order pending clarification of EU State Aid issues.<br/><br/>The Revenue Commissioners will issue a detailed Guide to the various farm taxation measures once the Finance Act 2014 is enacted.</p></reply>

The Regulation also sets out that a portion of the variable remuneration shall be deferred for 3-5 years and that a portion shall also be taken in non-cash financial instruments. </p><p>   The remuneration framework has been further strengthened with regard to the relationship between the variable component of remuneration and the fixed component. The variable component of the total remuneration shall not normally exceed 100% of the fixed component of the total remuneration of material risk takers. Exceptionally, and under certain conditions, shareholder can increase this maximum ratio to 200%.</p><p>  The Central Bank of Ireland has an important role in overseeing and monitoring remuneration levels in institutions as it is obliged to collect extensive information on persons remunerated more than &euro;1 million per year. </p><p>  The objective of these provisions is to ensure that the remuneration of bank officials is linked to the continued health and long term profitability of an institution. While the Regulations do not specifically refer to market share or loan value performance as risk indicators, the provisions have been drafted in such a manner so as to encompass these and more were they to affect the long-term viability of an institution. In those circumstances the remuneration of the bank officials concerned could be reduced or subject to a clawback, by the institution.</p></reply>

Decisions with regard to the selection of rating authority areas for revaluation is his sole prerogative. Section 19(1) of the said Act empowers the Commissioner to make a Valuation Order specifying a rating authority area over which a revaluation is to be conducted, after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the rating authority concerned. I, therefore, have no role in selection of the order of counties for revaluation.   </p><p>  The Valuation Office is currently undertaking a systematic programme of revaluing, for rates purposes, all industrial and commercial properties in the State. The immediate objective of the national revaluation programme is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas is conducted as soon as possible. Revaluation is conducted across all relevant properties in one or more rating authority areas at the same time. However, implementation of the national programme cannot occur across the entire country simultaneously and the programme must, accordingly, be operated on a phased basis. Following the first revaluation, subsequent revaluations of each rating authority area will then be carried out on a cyclical basis no sooner than five years and no later than ten years after the first revaluation (Section 25 of the Valuation Act 2001).</p><p>  The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system and to distribute the commercial rates liability more equitably between ratepayers. Following revaluation there generally will be a much closer and uniform relationship between rental values of property and their commercial rates liability.  In essence, the exercise aims to ensure that each ratepayer bears a fair share of the rates burden relative to the value of the property that they occupy.  I should emphasise that while the list of rateable valuations produced and maintained by the Valuation Office is the basis on which rates are levied, the amount of rates to be collected is ultimately a matter for each local authority to decide.</p></reply>

The awarding of individual contracts is a matter for each contracting authority. Therefore the onus is on the contracting authority to ensure that their public procurement complies with national and EU rules.</p><p>  Whilst the rules for procuring such services are more flexible, national guidelines require that best value for money must be obtained by State bodies in all procurements. Therefore public bodies should procure such services by way of a transparent and objective tendering process. In this regard, my Department issued guidance (Circular 5/13) instructing public bodies of the need to carry out a competitive process for engagement of general legal advisory services to ensure value for money. </p><p>  The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) is in the process of assessing how such legal services are procured by public bodies with the aim of delivering savings in this area. To this end, OGP will take responsibility for the procurement of Professional Services within which Legal Services falls. The OGP has already established a procurement sourcing team specific to the legal services requirements of Local Authorities. This team is comprised of representatives from a number of Local Authorities and their function is to design a procurement strategy that suits the needs of all Local Authorities while at the same time matching the capacity and capability in the marketplace. </p><p>  On completion of the procurement strategy design stage, it is anticipated that OGP will (on behalf of all Local Authorities) approach the marketplace by way of a formal tender process in the first half of 2015.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-12-16a.386.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014121600071#WRH05300"><p>The assessment of a tenderer's financial and economic standing is a key part of any procurement process. Establishing the appropriate suitability criteria that are relevant and appropriate to a particular contract is, of course, a matter for the contracting authority concerned. This is because the contracting authority is in the best position to gauge the appropriate levels of financial capacity that are appropriate to the needs of that specific contract. Such requirements would logically be developed on a case by case basis with reference to the specific needs of the contract.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the above the Government recognizes that it is vital that all suppliers engaging with contracting authorities are treated in a fair, transparent and professional manner. The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) has engaged with SME stakeholders who have raised concerns in relation to possible barriers for SMEs in competing for tender opportunities. In order to address these concerns, the OGP has developed a pilot programme designed to give an informal outlet for potential suppliers to raise concerns in relation to a particular live tender process. The objectives of the initiative are to improve communications with suppliers and increase professionalism and consistency in how procurement processes are carried out across the public service. <br/><br/>The new Tender Advisory Service (TAS) will liaise with potential suppliers and contracting authorities to clarify or query tender documentation and, where necessary, will make suggestions to contracting authorities aimed at resolving the concerns that have been raised.  As a matter of course TAS will communicate, to all parties, the informal nature of this service and that they do not have any legal authority to overturn any decision that has already been taken by the responsible contracting authority. As tendering of public service contracts must be carried out in an open and transparent manner, any information arising from this service will be communicated to all suppliers that have registered an interest in the tender process by the contracting authority. <br/><br/>This new service will contribute to an improved public procurement landscape for both suppliers and contracting authorities and to maximise all avenues for dealing with issues arising. The service will be operational from the 1<sup>st</sup>February 2015 and details of the pilot will be available shortly on the OGP website .</p></reply>

The significant reduction in access to paid sick leave is required to reduce the unsustainable costs of sick leave in the public service. The new scheme was finalised on the basis of two Labour Court recommendations following extensive negotiations with staff representatives. The new approach seeks to ensure more proactive management of absenteeism while providing appropriate protection and support for public service personnel who experience illness. </p><p>  In the case of individuals experiencing critical illnesses or serious injury, substantial additional protection is provided by means of a Critical Illness Protocol (CIP) which provides the basis for access to extended sick leave. Under the CIP, public servants who suffer from a critical illness or serious physical injury may have access to extended sick leave of 6 months on full pay in a rolling 1 year period, followed by 6 months on half pay subject to a maximum of 12 months' paid sick leave in a rolling 4 year period.</p><p>  An illness or injury may be classified as critical depending on the severity of the illness or injury which the staff member has suffered and it will be assessed against specific medical criteria. It is not possible to determine definitively whether a past illness was a critical illness as it was not assessed under the CIP criteria at the time of the illness. Notwithstanding this, transitional arrangements have been introduced for staff who suffered from a very serious illness prior to the introduction of the new sick leave scheme. In the Civil Service, HR managers have been advised that they can use the discretionary provision within the CIP to award extended sick pay to civil servants who have had a serious illness or injury in the year prior to the introduction of the new scheme. In such cases staff will have access to the extended sick pay limits normally given for critical illness/injury (i.e. 365 days of sick pay), even where they are not critically ill, provided that they had a serious illness in the previous 12 months before the introduction of the new scheme. Moreover, the discretionary provisions within the CIP mean that organisations can take into account all relevant circumstances of the case when awarding extended sick pay where the strict medical criteria have not been met. </p><p>  I am satisfied that the new sick leave arrangements for the public service strike the appropriate balance between reducing the unsustainable costs of sick leave in the public service and safeguarding the interests of public servants who experience serious illness or injury.</p></reply>

This compares with the previous estimate of &euro;116bn for 2009 which was arrived at by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;amp;AG). Therefore, over the three years from 2009 to 2012 the liability has fallen by &euro;18bn or by 16%. The main reasons for the reduction were the pay and pension cuts since 2009 and the freeze in pay and pension rates until after the Haddington Road Agreement.<br/><br/>This figure of &euro;98bn represents the present value of all expected future superannuation payments to current staff and their spouses in respect of service to December 2012, plus the liability for all future payments to current and preserved pensioners and to their spouses.  The pension payments to discharge this liability will therefore be spread over the next 70 years or so.<br/><br/>A report on the actuarial exercise is contained on the Department of Public Expenditure web site at .</p></reply>

Data is aggregated at county level on an annual basis.  Figures for 2014 will not be available until early next year.</p><p>  I have been advised by IDA Ireland that in 2013, the latest year for which data is available,   there were 735 people employed in 7 IDA Ireland client companies in County Carlow. In order to achieve regional economic development, IDA Ireland markets integrated regions with critical mass and markets specific locations within these regions in response to the requirements of mobile FDI.</p><p>  Carlow is part of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s South East Region along with counties of Carlow, Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny and South Tipperary. The region has a strong cluster in Life Sciences with many prestigious brands in the sector located there.  In addition, there is also a significant Financial Services cluster in the South East Region, which is home to the many major players in that sector including Unum located in Carlow.  </p><p>  The presence of international brands provides an attraction for additional companies to potentially locate in the South East Region including Carlow. Recent examples of where the cluster benefitted investment decisions in the Region were the announcements by Nypro and Sanofi Genzyme creating 200 jobs and investing a further &euro;44 million respectively.  These announcements provide potential employment for people in Carlow. It must also be noted that there is also a strong cluster of indigenous companies operating in the business services sector including Maven TM based in Carlow.</p><p>  IDA Ireland recognises the challenges for Ireland and its regions in attracting FDI and, with this in mind, a new IDA strategy will be launched early in the New Year, detailing goals and the broad direction IDA will take to accomplish them over the next five years. </p><p>  I have been working with my Department on the development on a framework for the formulation of Regional Enterprise Strategies that will enable us to identify the sustainable competitive strengths of each region and to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprise growth and jobs in areas of potential. It is my intention that this framework will be applied initially to produce action-oriented plans to support enterprise growth and jobs in the Midlands region and the South East region. Learning in these regions will inform any adaptations that might need to be made prior to the framework being applied to other regions in the course of 2015.</p></reply>

However, the Government is focussed on ensuring that jobs are created and sustained across the whole economy and has introduced a series of measures since coming into office to support the wider hospitality sector.  For example, the Government&rsquo;s Jobs Initiative of May 2011 placed a significant focus on the tourism and hospitality sector and introduced the reduced 9% VAT rate which helped provide an important stimulus to the sector generally.  This measure, which was originally intended to run until the end of 2013, has been retained in the last two Budgets.  This initiative has benefited the wider tourism industry, including many public houses which provide catering services that attract the 9% VAT rate.  There are now more than 25,000 extra people employed in Tourism than was the case in mid-2011. </p><p>  Since its inception in 2012, the Action Plan for Jobs process has seen over 600 actions being implemented which are aimed at supporting businesses to create and sustain jobs, including in the wider hospitality sector.    </p><p>  The latest Tourism and Travel data released by the CSO on 11th December indicates that the number of overseas visitors to Ireland increased by over 9% - or approximately 500,000 additional visitors - for the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same period last year.  Expenditure by overseas visitors, which will undoubtedly have a positive impact on the pub sector, also increased by &euro;241 million, or 9.3%, in the first nine months of 2014. </p><p>  The 2015 Action Plan for Jobs, which I am currently preparing on behalf of the Government, will continue to place an emphasis on supporting the domestic economy and on improving cost competitiveness for businesses in all sectors.  The Action Plan will be published early in the New Year. </p></reply>

Kerry.  In order to achieve regional economic development, IDA Ireland markets integrated regions with critical mass and markets specific locations within these regions in response to the requirements of mobile FDI.  Kerry is marketed as part of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s South West region, which consists of Counties Kerry and Cork.  Based on the strengths of the region IDA is particularly targeting emerging companies in the ICT (including software), International Financial Services and Global Business Services sectors. <br/><br/>At the end of<b></b>2013, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 12 IDA Ireland-supported companies in Kerry employing 1,638<b></b>people.  IDA Ireland works closely with these companies to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and continuing re-investment in their sites.  The primary opportunity for regional locations is in respect of the existing client base and potential further investment opportunities from that client base.  Almost 70% of all FDI investments won by IDA Ireland are from the existing client base.  <br/><br/>IDA Ireland continues to market all available land and buildings in the county including its 12-acre Business &amp;amp; Technology Park at Tiernaboul, Killarney, Co. Kerry.  In Tralee, IDA is also marketing the Kerry Technology Park.  <br/><br/>IDA Ireland recognises the challenges for Ireland and its regions in attracting FDI and, with this in mind, a new IDA strategy will be launched early in the New Year, detailing goals and the broad direction IDA will take to accomplish them over the next five years is being prepared at present and will be launched early in the New Year.<br/><br/>I have been working with my Department on the development on a framework for the formulation of Regional Enterprise Strategies that will enable us to identify the sustainable competitive strengths of each region and to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprise growth and jobs in areas of potential.  It is my intention that this framework will be applied initially to produce action-oriented plans to support enterprise growth and jobs in the Midlands region and the South East region.  Learning in these regions will inform any adaptations that might need to be made prior to the framework being applied to other regions in the course of 2015.</p></reply>

My Department, in association with Enterprise Ireland, supports Irish companies to bid on ESA development contracts and to exploit the technologies in commercial space and non-space markets.<br/><br/>The State&rsquo;s investment in ESA Space programmes (&euro;17.3m in 2014) reflects a strategy that prioritises Ireland&rsquo;s investment in those ESA programmes which support technology innovation and technology transfer that leads to export, sales and employment generation by Irish industry.  Ireland will continue to pursue this strategy through representation at ESA Ministerial Council, Council at Delegate level and at relevant Programme Boards and through engagement with other ESA member States in order to maximise the opportunities for Ireland.<br/><br/>Ireland&rsquo;s Space Strategy is focused on strengthening the competitiveness of Irish industry in the global space market through supporting product development and qualification for the space market, building supply team relations and supporting access to new geographic and sectoral markets.  A key element of the strategy is to focus on technologies that can be qualified for space use, but also adapted for and commercialised in a range of other markets such as the broader space and aerospace market, biomedical, energy and telecommunications.  ESA is also providing increasing levels of support for Irish 3rd level research and increased support for 3rd level industrial collaboration.  Irish companies have developed a specific reputation for introducing innovative and disruptive technologies to the space programme, in a number of cases leveraging the R&amp;amp;D investment supported through SFI and EI. <br/><br/>The engineering expertise developed in ESA programmes has been applied by many Irish companies to develop products in a range of non-space market sectors for which performance-critical technologies are required.<font color="#FF0000">  </font>Irish companies have used ESA to develop new intellectual property and develop new geographic markets.  ESA acts as a valuable reference site for these companies, enabling them to compete for non-ESA related business.<br/><br/>In recent years Ireland has seen strong and sustainable growth within existing Irish ESA contractors and in the number of new Irish companies entering the space and space related markets.  The number of Irish companies securing ESA contracts has increased by 15 in the past 5 years.  The total number of Irish companies currently active in ESA programmes is approximately 45 with over 80 Irish companies having secured ESA contracts in the past ten years.  The number of new companies entering the sector is expected to continue to grow in 2014/2015.  The value of revenues being generated by Irish companies as a result of ESA support is also expected to show significant growth of between 8 to 10% per annum. <br/><br/>An independent assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s membership of ESA, conducted in 2012, indicated total employment in Irish companies actively engaged in contracts with ESA to be 1,300 in 2012 and projected to increase to over 2,000 by 2015.  This assessment also indicated that the value of commercial sales derived from ESA contracts, including direct ESA contracts, to be &euro;44 million in 2011.  The value to Ireland from ESA contracts is far greater than the monetary value of ESA contracts placed.  A further evaluation of the economic impact of Ireland&rsquo;s membership of ESA is under way at present and the findings of this evaluation will guide Ireland&rsquo;s investment strategy in the space sector in coming years.</p></reply>

There are currently 117 such centres across the country.  There are currently no specific proposals to extend the Community Enterprise Centre Scheme to fund Business Development Management in 2014.  The last scheme rolled out was in 2012 and 2013 when Enterprise Ireland provided funding of &euro;2 million to support the recruitment of a total of 46 Business Development Managers.  </p><p>  On the wider issue of the Centres, the success levels, occupancy levels and sustainability of jobs at the Centres varies and therefore I have asked Enterprise Ireland to review the operations of the Community Enterprise Centres in the context of regional enterprise development and how the Community Enterprise Centres and the Local Enterprise Offices might work more closely in support of business start-ups before giving further consideration to the matter.  </p><p>  There are a number of dimensions to this issue, including the role of other players such as the Local Authorities, private sector involvement and the level of supply and demand for business space in the locality.  </p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2014 includes a commitment to develop a framework for Regional Enterprise Strategies that will enable us to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders, including Community Enterprise Centres, in supporting enterprise growth and jobs in the regions.  While there is already a significant amount of practical co-operation taking place at local and regional levels between many public bodies, developing a framework in which co-operation can be improved, is timely.  </p><p>  I have been actively working on a template for the development of Regional Enterprise Strategies and it is my intention that this framework will be applied initially on a pilot basis to produce action-oriented plans to support enterprise growth and jobs in the Midlands region and the South East region.  These pilots will inform any adaptations that might need to be made prior to the framework being applied to other regions.  I fully expect that the existing network of Community Enterprise Centres will have a role to play in the creation and implementation of enterprise strategies in their regions.</p></reply>

Data management and analytics is a key enabler of business across all areas of economic activity, for example, in the food, manufacturing and financial services sectors.  </p><p>  The Irish government identified Big Data and Analytics as one of its 9 Disruptive Reforms in the Action Plan for Jobs (APJ), with an overall ambition to &quot;build on existing enterprise strengths to make Ireland a leading country in Europe in the area of Big Data and Data Analytics&quot;.  As part of this disruptive reform the Government has taken a number of key steps such as the establishment of the Taskforce on Big Data, the launch of Insight, a Science Foundation Ireland-supported research centre for data analytics, and the launch of CeADAR, the IDA Ireland/Enterprise Ireland-supported data analytics technology centre.</p><p>  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) has recently completed a report assessing the demand for big data and data analytics skills.  While there are no exact figures known, the EGFSN estimated that there were 35,000 persons employed in big data/analytic roles within Irish enterprises in 2013. </p><p>  The EGFSN report estimates that employment in big data and analytics roles could grow by up to 27,000 by 2020 (to a total of 62,000 ) both as a result  of expansion growth within the existing enterprise base and  through inward investment, as well as through the upskilling of persons already in employment.</p><p>  There are a number of multinational enterprises that are providers of services and solutions for analytics and big data and whose business are built in whole or in part on the application of analytics and big data technologies, such as IBM, Aon, Groupon and EMC amongst others. For example in May 2014, SAP announced an investment in its Dublin facility creating a further 60 jobs. </p><p>  There is also a growing base of indigenous companies whose business focuses on IT solutions for analytics and/or for whom analytics is central to their business offering.  The companies include Swrve, Datahug, Ripple and 4Impact Intelligent Solutions. Earlier this year, Boxever, which provides a big data platform for airlines and travel operators, announced plans to create 100 jobs.</p></reply>

The EU mackerel quota is dependent on the outcome of annual Coastal State negotiations between the EU, Norway and Faeroes as it is a stock that is widespread in the North East Atlantic.  Account must also be taken of the interests of Iceland (not been party to recent agreements, although a Coastal State) as well as Russia and Greenland.  Ireland is the second largest mackerel quota holder within the EU (after the UK) and, as a result of this year&rsquo;s negotiations, in which we played an active part, the mackerel quota for Irish fishermen for 2015 will be 89,222 tonnes.  With the exception of the 2014 quota the quota agreed for 2015 is the highest mackerel quota available to Irish fishermen for very many years.</p><p>  The 2014 quota was set at an artificially high level, above scientific advice, due to the extraordinary circumstances of the March 2014 agreement which lead to a partial resolution of the international mackerel sharing dispute which had been ongoing for some years.</p><p>  Mackerel is of course our single most valuable fishery and the agreement provides a high quota, stability and certainty for the Irish pelagic fishing Industry.</p><p>  However, I remain unhappy with the overall sharing arrangement agreed in March and I do not agree with the amount set aside for other parties such as Iceland.  This sharing arrangement remains fixed until 2018 but at that stage I would expect that the relevant arrangement can and should be revised.  I have of course worked closely with the Federation of Irish Fishermen throughout the negotiation process.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-12-16a.571.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014121600074#WRL05900"><p>As the Deputy is aware, dairy Prices are a function of global market dynamics, with supply and demand issues in markets across the globe affecting prices across different dairy commodity groups in domestic markets.  Price volatility is a continuing feature of dairy commodity markets, and it is clear that managing the price peaks and troughs in a way that allows farmers and others to plan ahead is a significant challenge for the sector.  After two years of extremely high prices, the combination of strong production in key dairy producing countries, including the USA, New Zealand, Australia and the European Union, driven by good weather, increased cow numbers in the US and strong cereal harvests, has seen the emergence of a surplus in dairy products on international markets coming into 2015.  Furthermore, with Russia and China accounting for 27% of the traded world market in the dairy sector, the effect of surplus stocks in the Chinese market along with the displacement effect of the Russian ban can be seen as critical factors in setting the context for price evolution in the sector.</p><p>  The anticipated decline in 2015 largely reflects the impact of the aforementioned developments on global dairy markets.  Teagasc, in their recent 2015 Outlook Conference, relayed an expectation that average Irish milk prices in 2015 will fall to 27 cent per litre, a reduction of over 10 cent per litre on the average for 2014.  However it should be noted that this follows several years of very good incomes on dairy farms.  Furthermore, Teagasc are clear that these negative effects are expected to be temporary in nature.</p><p>  Under the new Common Agriculture Policy there is a range of tools available to mitigate the worst impact of downward price volatility, including Aids to Private Storage, Intervention and Export Refunds and I have called on the EU Commission to deploy these tools as appropriate.  The Single Farm Payment will also provide a measure of income stability during this difficult period.  I have also asked the banking sector to tailor their financial products to take account of the kind of price volatility that will be a feature of international dairy markets, and of course co-ops have a role to play in ensuring that their contractual arrangements with suppliers provide a requisite measure of stability.  A focus on innovation and the production of added value products will also have a role to play in mitigating the impact of volatility, and a greater use of futures markets may also feature among the tools deployed by the sector.</p><p>  In terms of how this will evolve in the medium term, Teagasc, in common with a number of other commentators, anticipate that lower milk prices will lead to a slowdown in the expansion of milk production globally through 2015, with global dairy markets set to witness signs of recovery as the year progresses.  In the medium to longer term population growth and increasing affluence in developing countries will continue to drive strong growth in demand for dairy products, and Irish producers will be well placed to take full advantage of this demand.</p></reply>

The Authority is representative of the main stakeholder groups in the agri-food sector including the farming organisations.  The Animal &amp;amp; Grassland Research and Innovation Centre, Athenry, is part of the Teagasc &lsquo;Animal &amp;amp; Grassland&rsquo; research programme.  Its mission is to produce high quality &lsquo;animal science research&rsquo; to increase the profitability and competitiveness of Irish animal production systems.  In relation to the sheep sector, Athenry plays a key role in developing competitive, profitable and sustainable systems of sheep production.  The sheep research demonstration farm at Athenry places particular emphasis on developing profitable &lsquo;grass-based systems&rsquo; of sheep production so as to capitalize on Ireland&rsquo;s natural competitive advantage in grass production.</p><p>  Following stakeholder representations over a number of years, Teagasc proposes to establish a &lsquo;suckler&rsquo; demonstration farm in Athenry to serve farmers in the West of Ireland.  The project is modelled on the well known Greenfield dairy demonstration farm in Kilkenny, which annually attracts large numbers of farmers and discussion groups.  The Greenfield model is very highly regarded, and provides a public good demonstration service to all farmers in the dairy sector.  It is envisaged that the Athenry suckler project would operate along similar lines with the aim of demonstrating to farmers, the profit that can be obtained from a well run suckler beef farm.</p><p>  I understand that Teagasc intends to establish the suckler demonstration farm on rented land in Athenry.  The existing sheep research programme will continue unaffected on lands that Teagasc own in Athenry.  My Department has only recently been approached by Teagasc to see if some Department owned land in Athenry could be made available for the suckler demonstration farm and this matter is currently under examination.</p><p>  I appreciate the important contribution that the Athenry research station makes to the development and evaluation of research relevant to the sheep sector.  Teagasc is satisfied that a suckler demonstration farm can be established in Athenry on adjacent rented lands without impacting on the existing sheep research programme.</p></reply>

I am cognisant of the role that a resource-efficient agriculture sector can play in supporting the use of 2<sup>nd</sup>and 3<sup>rd</sup>generation biofuels to contribute to renewable energy targets, especially where it can improve its competitiveness and promote job creation. <b><i></i></b><br/><br/>In 2006, my Department launched a Pilot Waste Processing Facilities Scheme with funding of &euro;4 million in order to provide grant-aid for the installation of anaerobic digesters on ten Irish farms.  To date, one applicant has been paid under the Scheme and I understand that a number of others have expressed interest in commencing on-farm projects. Funding extensions have been granted for that purpose.<br/><br/>Officials from my Department have contributed to the development of the draft Bioenergy Plan which was published by my colleague the Minister for -Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on 10 October this year. The Plan covers various strands of bioenergy with a view to maximising their potential contribution to achieving renewable energy targets for 2020 and beyond.  It encourages the innovative use of animal by-products as a fuel to generate heat or electricity. <br/><br/>In recent years my Department, in collaboration with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Environmental Protection Agency, has sought to encourage the use of animal by-products as &ldquo;valuable by-products not waste&rdquo;. The sustainable use of animal by-products can result in wider environmental and economic benefits. Anaerobic digestion plants which use animal by-products (ABP) as a feedstock are subject to processing and hygiene requirements as set out in EU ABP regulation. My Department has drawn up detailed conditions of approval for such plants following consultation with stakeholder representatives in the ABP Consultative Forum.<br/><br/>As a large ruminant livestock producer, it is notable that methane contributes a significant portion of agriculture greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. While it is possible to produce and utilise methane through AD of stored manure, analysis to date would suggest that costs are a significant factor. The Teagasc Marginal Abatement Cost Curve for Irish Agriculture completed in 2012 covered the technical, financial and environmental effectiveness of various mitigation strategies for the sector. The report, which was completed in the light of detailed research, found AD to be one of the most expensive mitigation strategies. <br/><br/>In terms of overall EU policy, <i>t</i>he Commission has proposed limiting the amount of food-based biofuels that can be counted towards the EU's target of reaching a 10% share of renewable energy in the transport sector by 2020.This limit will allow non-food based biofuels to make a greater contribution to meeting the 10% target. The proposal seeks to shift the focus away from first generation biofuels and encourage future investment in advanced biofuels such as municipal waste and agricultural residues that do not compete directly with food and feed crops. <br/><br/>The draft Bioenergy Plan provides for further analysis to be carried out on the costs and benefits of biogas and biomethane. This analysis will be critical in terms of identifying the energy sectors where they can be cost-effectively deployed.  </p></reply>

Successful applicants to the National Reserve will receive an allocation of entitlements based on the eligible land declared on their 2015 Basic Payment Scheme application at a value equal to the national average value of entitlements in the year of application. Successful applicants who already hold entitlements which are below the national average value will receive a top-up whereby the value of those entitlements will be increased to the national average value.<br/><br/>To qualify as a &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo;, a farmer must meet all of the following conditions:<br/><br/>- S/he is participating in the Basic Payment Scheme<br/><br/>- S/he is aged no more than 40 years of age in the year when s/he first submits an application under the Basic Payment Scheme<br/><br/>- S/he is setting up an agricultural holding for the first time or has set up such a holding during the five years preceding the first submission of the Basic Payment Scheme application<br/><br/>- S/he has successfully completed a recognised course of education in agriculture giving rise to an award at FETAC level 6 or its equivalent or commits to undertaking such a course before the end of September 2016.<br/><br/>After consultation with the Direct Payment Advisory Committee comprising of members of the main farming bodies and advisory services, I have decided that an off-farm income limit of &euro;40,000 will be applied to all applicants. Under the previous National Reserve Schemes, this limit was &euro;30,000. A maximum allocation that any one farmer may receive from the National Reserve has been fixed at 90 entitlements.<br/><br/>Applications to the National Reserve, and the Young Farmers Scheme, will be accepted from January 2015 by way of the Department&rsquo;s AgFood online facility which can be accessed at .</p></reply>

The welfare of greyhounds involved in coursing is provided for in the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 which inter alia requires that persons who course greyhounds must have regard to the &ldquo;Code of Practice in the Care &amp;amp; Welfare of the Greyhound&rdquo;, developed jointly by the ICC and BnG.<br/><br/>The ICC has assured my Department that it has extensive systems and practices in place to underpin the welfare of animals participating in coursing and that it goes to great lengths to ensure that the highest standards of hare and greyhound welfare are adhered to. <br/><br/>A Monitoring Committee on Coursing was established during the 1993/94 coursing season and comprises of officials from my Department and representatives from both the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the ICC to monitor developments in coursing and in that regard the situation is kept under constant review to ensure that coursing is run in a well controlled and responsible manner in the interests of both hares and greyhounds alike.<br/><br/>The ICC adhere to the conditions attached to the licence granted by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht under Section 34 of the Wildlife Act 1976 (as amended) for the capture of hares for coursing. The Licence requires that all clubs :<br/><br/>- &ldquo;shall arrange for a qualified veterinary surgeon to be in attendance during all of their coursing meetings, and that he/she shall prepare a signed report on the health of the hares and on any injuries or deaths of hares that occur during the meeting.&rdquo;<br/><br/>- &ldquo;any hare captured pursuant to the Licence may not be coursed more than once on the same day and all necessary arrangements shall be made to ensure that hares that have been coursed can be readily identified to ensure this condition is rigidly observed.&rdquo;<br/><br/>- &ldquo;sick, injured or pregnant hares shall not be taken under the Licence&rdquo;.<br/><br/>- &ldquo;hares that become sick or injured or that appear to be pregnant while in captivity may not be coursed&rdquo;.<br/><br/>- &ldquo;adequate escapes must be provided while coursing hares pursuant to the Licence&rdquo;.<br/><br/>- &ldquo;all hares must be released back into the wild during daylight hours the day after coursing meeting is concluded, unless otherwise agreed with the relevant NPWS staff beforehand.&rdquo;<br/><br/>- &ldquo;the same number of hares must be released back into the wild at the same locations from which such numbers were captured, unless otherwise agreed beforehand with the relevant NPWS staff.&rdquo;<br/><br/>-&ldquo;the removal from this jurisdiction of hares captured in this jurisdiction under the terms of the licence is strictly prohibited.&rdquo;<br/><br/>-  &ldquo;in all matters relating to the capture, keeping in captivity, tagging, marking, coursing and release of hares, and the muzzling of greyhound, there shall be full compliance with the Directives, Instructions and Guidance Notes issued by the Irish Coursing Club.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The ICC ensures:<br/><br/>- The health status of all hares is assessed prior to placing in Hare Park following netting<br/><br/>- Hares are treated for a range of common ailments under veterinary supervision<br/><br/>- Hares are released into Hare Park which is laid out to replicate the wild with appropriate cover and shelter<br/><br/>- Footbaths are located in Park to treat/prevent any minor foot issues<br/><br/>- Hares are fed on a diet of oats (whole or sheaf), sallies (branches of young trees), apples and fresh water in general<br/><br/>- The feeding and training of hares is confined to a limited number of people with the relevant expertise<br/><br/>- All hares are familiarised with the layout of the course.<br/><br/>- Prior to each meeting, the hares and facility are inspected by a Hare &amp;amp; Field Committee member, a veterinary surgeon and ICC Control Steward<br/><br/>- Coursing Clubs employ a veterinary surgeon to attend at coursing meetings who see to any animal in need of attention.<br/><br/>- The Executive Committee of the ICC appoint one of its members to oversee each coursing meeting with powers to curtail or abandon a meeting if required<br/><br/>- An ICC Control Steward is appointed to each meeting to ensure all rules are adhered to by the host club<br/><br/>- In the event of a hare being compromised (pinned by muzzled greyhound(s)) a dedicated Hare Steward is appointed (2/3 stewards operate to ensure efficient intervention). This hare is examined by appointed vet and not coursed again irrespective of outcome of examination<br/><br/>- On conclusion of the coursing meeting all hares are released back into the countryside under supervision of ICC steward and Wildlife Ranger.<br/><br/>- Each coursing meeting is documented to capture relevant information regarding the conduct of the meeting as required by the NPWS and the ICC and this data is returned to the NPWS.<br/><br/>- The ICC appointed Hare &amp;amp; Field Committee advise and instruct clubs on best practice in terms of hare welfare and field layout to ensure greyhound welfare<br/><br/>- The ICC provide full/partial grant aid to clubs to develop their facilities to ensure best practice<br/><br/>A review of the outcome for the most recent coursing season indicates that the procedures and processes in place in terms of animal welfare are appropriate given that 99.4% of hares were released back to the wild at the conclusion of coursing. <br/><br/>Any incidents that the Deputy may be aware of should be brought to the attention of the relevant authority.</p></reply>

Where the fertility treatment leading to pregnancy was carried out in a clinical setting, parentage will be assigned in accordance with clear rules and subject to the informed consent of the couple undertaking treatment and of the donor.</p><p>  The reason that the General Scheme requires the fertility treatment to be carried out in a clinical setting is because there is very clear case-law on the situation of a donor father where the treatment takes place outside a clinical setting. In such a case, notwithstanding the intentions of the parties, the donor has all of the rights and obligations of a father in relation to the child. These rights cannot be reassigned by the parties.  </p><p>  The General Scheme includes a number of provisions to address the situation of children born through donor-assisted reproduction in a non-clinical setting.  Depending on the circumstances, the non-biological parent can apply for guardianship, thus obtaining the right jointly with the child's birth mother to make decisions on behalf of a child, ranging from the day-to-day care of the child, to key decisions on the child's education and health-care. Alternatively, the couple can jointly adopt the child, thus securing the child's right to be treated as the child of both of them, and severing the legal relationship with the child's biological father.</p></reply>

However, it appears that some steps have been taken at national level to help alleviate the effects of light pollution. Ireland's regulations on environmental impact assessment of projects which are likely to have significant effects on the environment require such an impact statement to include an estimate of expected residues and emissions from the operation of the proposed development. This requirement expressly covers impacts from artificial lighting.  While a limited number of planning authorities have included objectives in relation to the minimisation of light pollution in their development plans, it is open to authorities to address this issue in the context of providing for the proper planning and sustainable development of their areas through their development plans.</p><p>  In specific cases in which excessively strong light from external sources represents a substantial interference with the enjoyment of property, it may, depending on the specific circumstances, be possible to seek a remedy under the tort of nuisance. I would, however, strongly recommend that parties in such cases engage in a process of mediation as a means of arriving at a mutually acceptable outcome. </p></reply>

Penalties for these offences are set out in the Finance Acts and are a matter for the Minister for Finance.  In targeting the illicit tobacco trade there is close cooperation between the Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Searches are regularly undertaken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as part of intelligence-led operations led by Revenue.

It is a matter for the court having considered all the circumstances of the case to impose an appropriate penalty. However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have made enquiries and the Courts Service has provided the information set out in the table below in respect of the average sentences for crimes associated with illegal and counterfeit tobacco products in the period from 2012 to October 2014. <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Average Fine</th><th>Average Sentence</th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;2,648.15</td><td>4 months</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;2,517.29</td><td>4.6 months</td></tr><tr><td>2014 (Jan to Oct)</td><td>&euro;2,717.36</td><td>3 months</td></tr></table><br/><br/>Note: In relation to the above statistics, the Courts Service has indicated that in circumstances where a prosecution associated with illegal and counterfeit tobacco products may have been brought before the courts but offence codes may not have been supplied, such offences are not included in the calculation of the averages in the table. In addition, due to the manner in which the offences are recorded, some of the offences relate to evasion of excisable duty generally which might also include offences for products other than tobacco. </p></reply>

Each application is assessed on an individual basis, by my officials in the Restorative Justice Implementation Unit, taking into account any available records, documents and statements including the applicant's testimony.  If the applicant disagrees with this assessment, she can, in the first instance, seek a review of her case by a senior officer.  If the applicant disagrees with the Reviewer's decision she can request an independent review by the Ombudsman's Office.  To date, 19 or less than 3% of the 689 applicants on whose cases a decision has been made, have requested their case to be reviewed by the Ombudsman's Office.

It is therefore considered inappropriate to place a time constraint upon the working of the Panel, although they intend to conclude their work as soon is reasonably practicable.  Appropriate steps have been taken to ensure that nothing arises which might in any way detract from the integrity of the review mechanism, including issues of conflict of interest.  Arrangements have been put in place to ensure that if there is any conflict, or potential conflict, the conflicted counsel not only will not be involved in the particular complaint, but also will not be aware of which counsel is reviewing it.  This is normal professional conduct and there are sufficient counsel on the Panel to ensure the practicality of this.  Whatever steps are necessary will be taken to ensure there is no conflict of interest.  This has been explained to the person to whom the Deputy refers.​  The order in which cases are dealt with is a matter for Senior Counsel who, in addition to examining individual complaints, are required to advise the Department generally on the management of the process, take a joint lead in allocating cases to Junior Counsel, and jointly oversee recommendations with a view to ensuring as far as possible a consistency of approach.  Consideration is currently being finalised in relation to the format and content of replies to complainants, and the objective will be to ensure that each complainant receives as comprehensive an answer as possible.</p><p>  Without in any way pre-judging the outcome in any individual case, I think it is important to be realistic and to acknowledge that in many instances no further action may be recommended by the review.  This is to some extent inevitable in circumstances where, on the one hand, individuals have genuine but necessarily subjective concerns about how their particular cases were originally handled and, on the other hand, counsel have to examine objective evidence, and in particular take into account whether those cases have been through due process, even if the persons involved remain unhappy with the outcome of that process.</p></reply>

The general approach to sentencing in Irish criminal law is one whereby the Oireachtas sets a maximum possible sentence in statute and allows the court discretion to set the precise sentence in any given case in a manner that is proportional to the seriousness of the offence having due regard to all the circumstances including the degree of harm caused to the victim.</p><p>  The prescription of mandatory prison terms in legislation is an exception to this general approach.  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Law Reform Commission 2013 Report on Mandatory Sentences, which recommends the repeal of existing presumptive mandatory minimum sentence provisions for various drugs and firearms offences.  I would also note that the Report on the Strategic Review of Penal Policy which was published in September recommended that no further mandatory sentences or presumptive minimum sentences should be introduced.</p></reply>

Details in respect of each category are outlined below.<br/><br/><b><i>Criminal Legal Aid</i></b><br/><br/>Under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid. An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his/her means are insufficient to enable him/her to pay for legal representation him/herself. The assignment of lawyers or the granting of aid are matters for the Court and, as such, are handled by the judiciary on the applicant's appearance in court.  Unfortunately figures are not kept in such a way as to be able to provide a breakdown by county of the number of certificates granted for criminal legal aid.<br/><br/><b><i>Civil Legal Aid</i></b><br/><br/>In respect of civil legal aid, this is provided by the Legal Aid Board, an independent State agency. At the outset, it should be clarified that with the exception of a very small number of cases, civil legal aid is not free nor is the word &lsquo;free&rsquo; part of the Board&rsquo;s title. Clients pay a contribution for legal advice and a further contribution if they require representation in court. This is important as many applicants to the Board query why they are being asked to make a payment as they have heard reference to &lsquo;free legal aid&rsquo; or the &lsquo;Free Legal Aid Board&rsquo;.<br/><br/>In relation to civil legal aid, the Legal Aid Board operates 30 general full-time law centres in twenty-three different counties. Attached below is the number of applicants in each of the last five years at the law centre(s) in each of the counties in which the Board has a full time presence. (The Board has six general law centres in Dublin and two general law centres in both Cork and Galway).Only applicants that have been financially assessed are placed on an applications record and financial eligibility is usually determined  by law centre staff within 48 hours of receipt of the application. Therefore, the figures below represent financially eligible applications that fall within the scope of the Act.<br/><br/>Persons seeking legal services can apply at any law centre and are not required to apply within the county in which they reside. The Board also operates part-time law centres in the counties where it does not have a full-time presence. Each of these centres is operated by a full-time centre and the numbers getting services at these centres are included in the applications figure for the full-time centre.

It is important to recognise that any legislation in this area would have a potentially significant impact on a broad range of businesses. There are a large number of legitimate businesses such as jewellers, antique dealers etc., as well as &lsquo;cash for gold&rsquo; outlets that would be impacted upon.  As the regulatory and resource burden of any proposed measure will have to be carefully examined to ensure that it is proportionate to the matter being addressed I have asked officials in my Department to carry out a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) which will facilitate a process of consultation with groups likely to be affected.  The current position is that my Department is finalising a RIA which will comprise a detailed and systematic appraisal of the potential impacts of any proposed regulation in order to assess whether the regulation is likely to achieve the desired objectives and the potential costs that will arise.

The second is the more serious offence of purchasing a sexual service from a trafficked person and carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling the sexual service will not be subject to an offence.</p><p>  These proposals have been developed following extensive consultation, initiated by my Department, dating back to 2012 and which includes a recommendation from the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence to introduce such an offence.  I have met with representatives from both sides of the debate, including those working in the industry, and my Department has received numerous representations expressing views from both sides.</p><p>  I am satisfied that it is necessary to take steps to tackle the trafficking and wider exploitation of persons through prostitution.  Unlike the existing offences relating to prostitution such as soliciting, loitering or brothel keeping, the new offences will specifically target the demand for prostitution.</p><p>  In terms of the specific question concerning the introduction of new legislation to combat human trafficking, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the existing legislative provisions addressing the trafficking of persons for the purposes of exploitation (including sexual exploitation) which can attract significant penalties.  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 prohibits trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation.  Any person found guilty of such an offence shall be liable to imprisonment for life or a lesser term, and at the discretion of the court, to a fine.   It is also an offence for a person to solicit or importune a trafficked person for the purposes of prostitution with a potential penalty of imprisonment for up to 5 years and / or a fine.</p></reply>

The safety of the Garda&iacute; concerned and, of course, the general public is of paramount importance and I can assure the Deputy that all incidents of this nature are subject to full investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br/><br/>It is the case that there is a range of robust road safety and other legislative enforcement provisions available to the Garda authorities in such circumstances. Legislative provisions include the assault offences contained in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 and for which penalties range from up to 5 years imprisonment to life imprisonment depending on the seriousness of the offence involved.  In addition, section 19 Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994<b></b>provides for specific offences relating to assaults on &quot;peace officers&quot; which includes members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The penalty for this offence was increased from 5 to 7 years imprisonment by section 185 Criminal Justice Act 2006.  I would also add that section 2 Criminal Damage Act 1991 provides for the offence of damage to the property of another person for which the penalty is a maximum of 10 years imprisonment.  Furthermore, the Road Traffic Act 1961 (as amended) provides for offences of driving without reasonable consideration, careless driving and dangerous driving, and an offence of dangerous driving which causes death or serious bodily harm carrying a penalty of up to 10 years imprisonment.  In addition, as the Deputy will appreciate if the ramming of a Garda vehicle resulted in a death, an offence of attempted murder, murder or manslaughter may be considered applicable with the resultant penalties including mandatory life imprisonment for a conviction for murder.</p></reply>

The approach of the Oireachtas has generally been to specify in law a maximum penalty for an offence, so that a court, having considered all the circumstances of a case, may impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions who may apply to have a sentence reviewed if she regards it as unduly lenient.</p><p>  The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Information System (ISIS) website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  ISIS is being developed as a valuable tool not only for members of the judiciary but also for lawyers, researchers and those concerned with the needs of victims and their families, the initiative which is being led by the Judiciary through the Judicial Research Office in undertaking the detailed work of gathering and providing information via the website.</p><p>  I recently published the report of the Penal Policy Review Group which was tasked with carrying out a strategic review of penal policy. The Group was asked to make recommendations on how a principled and sustainable penal system might be further enhanced taking into account resource implications, constitutional imperatives and our international obligations.</p><p>  The Report of the Review Group contains 43 recommendations some of which can be implemented in the short to medium term while others will require a more long term approach. As an initial step, the Government recently gave its approval, in principle, to proceed immediately with the implementation of a number of key recommendations including (i) preparing proposals and options for Government on reform of sentencing policy including a review of the threshold at which presumptive minimum sentences in drugs and other offences apply, and (ii) preparing proposals for Government on legislating for the review's recommendation that courts set out in writing their reasons for imposing a custodial sentence.  This work is currently under way.</p><p>  It might be noted that a Sentencing Council was not advocated by the Law Reform Commission in its Report on Mandatory Sentencing which was published in 2013. The report covers a number of complex issues and the recommendations contained in the report will be fully considered in my Department together with the report of the Penal Policy Review Group.</p></reply>

There is, I believe, much in common between both reports and indeed the Joint Committee's report complements the more recent strategic review of penal policy.  There has been considerable progress in recent years but there remains much to be done, and both reports recognise that.  There are naturally some variations in approach between the two reports but these can be examined as part of the ongoing process of implementation.<br/><br/>The Report of the Review Group contains 43 recommendations, some of which can be implemented in the short to medium term, while others will require a more long term approach.

The relevant extracts are set out beneath:<blockquote>&quot;Many District Court Judges who have overturned the decisions of Chief Superintendents have consistently stated the current legislative provisions need to be addressed. <br /><br />In Limerick District Court, an appeal hearing was heard in August 2013 with regard to two semi automatic, restricted rifles (rifles resembling assault rifles) and two centre fire handguns.  This was an appeal against the decision of the Chief Superintendent not to grant licences for these firearms.  It is reported that the Judge stated that the Chief Superintendent is being placed in an invidious position, with his concern being the public who he must protect and the possibility that the firearms may fall into the wrong hands.  The Judge commented that the legislation has not grappled with the kernel of the issue; are these firearms lawful or not.  The decision in this case was that the licences should be granted. <br /><br />An appeal was heard in the Dublin District Court in October 2013 against the refusal to grant restricted licences for two centre-fire handguns (Thomas Mansfield V Chief Superintendent Coburn &amp;amp; the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na).<br /><br />The Judge issued a ten page written judgment in December 2013, allowing the appeal, stating the following: &ldquo;The Court is satisfied that he has a good and sufficient reason and that the guns are appropriate for the purpose for which they are required. The Court is satisfied that he doesn&rsquo;t take part in practical or dynamic shooting. I am further satisfied that the concerns expressed by the Chief Superintendent on public safety are not enough to deprive the Appellant of his licence, particularly in view of the unexplained 90% who subsequently got their licences on reconsideration&rdquo;. <br /><br />The Judge also states: &ldquo;Arguments about the availability of guns to civilians is a wider political question for the Legislature to address.  This is not a question for the Courts; we can only deal with the law as it is&rdquo;.  <br /><br />&quot;In February 2014,  in Bray District Court, the District Justice granted firearms licensing appeals and directed the relevant Chief Superintendent to issue nine restricted firearm certificates for centre fire handguns. The Judge commented that it was open to the legislature to ban these weapons but in the absence of that, he was allowing all of the appeals.&quot;</blockquote></p></reply>

The position remains as set out in that reply.<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><b>PQ Reply 283 of 25 November, 2014</b><br /><br />I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person concerned arrived in the State on 20 August 2008 and applied for asylum on the following day. This application was refused and the person concerned was notified of this decision on 28 July 2009. <br /><br />Subsequently the person concerned made an application for Subsidiary Protection under the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (Statutory Instrument No. 518 of 2006) on 19 August 2009. His application was refused by my Department and the person concerned was notified of this decision on 1 March 2010.  <br /><br />Representations were submitted by and on behalf of the person concerned on 19 August 2009 against the making of a Deportation Order pursuant to Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended). These and subsequent representations were examined and assessed and a Deportation Order was signed in respect of the person concerned on 8 March 2011. <br /><br />Further representations were submitted by and on behalf of the person concerned on 11 July 2011 seeking to have the aforementioned Deportation Order revoked pursuant to Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended). These and subsequent representations were examined and assessed and it was decided that the Deportation Order be affirmed and the person concerned was notified of this decision on 11 October 2011. <br /><br />Representations were submitted by and on behalf of the person concerned on 21 November 2012 seeking his re-entry into the asylum process pursuant to Section 17(7) of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended). These and subsequent representations were examined and the person concerned was informed on 19 March 2013 that he be refused re-entry into the asylum process. <br /><br />The person concerned instituted Judicial Review proceedings on 8 April 2013 challenging the refusal to allow him re-entry into the asylum process.<br /><br />Again, further representations were submitted by and on behalf of the person concerned on 21 November 2012 seeking to have the aforementioned Deportation Order revoked pursuant to Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended). These and subsequent representations were examined and assessed and it was decided that the Deportation Order be affirmed and the person concerned was notified of this decision on 14 November 2013.<br /><br />The person concerned instituted Judicial Review proceedings on 16 January 2014 challenging the aforementioned affirmation of the Deportation Order made in respect of him.  As the foregoing matters are sub judice I do not propose to comment further.<br /><br />I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></p></reply>

The US authorities have provided clear and unambiguous diplomatic assurances, at the highest level, that Irish airports have not been and would not be used for the purpose of extraordinary rendition.  The Government is fully entitled to rely on these assurances.<br/><br/>There is no question of the State having been complicit in the practice of extraordinary renditions.<br/><br/>Statutory powers of search and entry are bestowed upon the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under various legislative provisions and when authorised by a judge.  However, these powers are exercised in circumstances where a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na reasonably suspects that an offence has occurred.  These powers can only be used, therefore, where a Garda has a reasonable suspicion supported by some evidence.  The mere assertion of wrongdoing by a member of the general public is clearly insufficient in this regard.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has investigated a range of complaints of alleged unlawful activity at Shannon Airport and, where appropriate, files have been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In all these cases, no further action was found to be warranted, owing to a lack of any evidence of unlawful activity. <br/><br/>Any person with credible information that Irish airports have been used for any alleged unlawful purpose should report their concerns to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

It is essential that all young people leaving care are provided with the type of transitional support that their individual situation requires.</p><p>  The Child Care Act 1991 provides that the core eligible age range for aftercare is from 18 years up to 21 years. This can be extended until the completion of a course of education and training in which a young person who has left care, or is leaving care, is engaged, up to the age of 23 years.</p><p>  Current aftercare provision incorporates advice, guidance and practical (including accommodation and financial) support. Advocating on behalf of young people to support their development as fulfilled adults in their community and, when necessary, to link them to targeted adult services, are also crucial elements of an aftercare service.</p><p>  Between 450 and 500 young people leave care annually upon turning 18. The Child and Family Agency advised that at the end of June 2014, 1,614 young people aged 18-23 years (inclusive) were in receipt of an aftercare service. Of those, 884 (55%) were in full-time education.</p><p>  The Child and Family Agency has advised that they are in the process of establishing interagency aftercare committees at local level bringing together Local Authorities, HSE and other statutory and voluntary agencies. These committees will develop interagency wrap around aftercare plans for young people, particularly for those with complex needs, including housing requirements. The situation regarding the establishment of these committees varies nationally but it is expected that all committees will be operational by mid-2015.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the legislative provisions regarding aftercare are being strengthened to respond to past concerns that there was insufficient focus in this area and that such planning was not taking place on a properly structured and consistent basis. The approach adopted is to impose a statutory duty on the Agency to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person. The aim is to create an explicit, as opposed to implicit, statement of the Agency&rsquo;s duty to satisfy itself as to the child&rsquo;s or young person&rsquo;s need for assistance by preparing a plan that identifies those needs for aftercare supports. </p><p>  It is anticipated that the Aftercare Bill will be published in the early part of 2015.</p><p>  I have also asked the Child and Family Agency to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to those elements of his question for which they have responsibility. In this regard I have been informed that a reply will issue shortly. </p></reply>

There are in the region of  4,200 childcare providers participating in the programme, providing the free pre-school provision to approximately 68,000 children each year.  This programme represents an annual investment of almost &euro;175 million. </p><p>  An advance payment is made to participating childcare providers at the end of August each year and is based on the number of children which were enrolled in that service for the free pre-school programme in the previous academic year. This payment provides for the first  8 weeks of the new school year.  In the case of new participants in the programme, a similar advance payment is made but in respect of a maximum of 3 children only.  There is provision under the programme to make an additional advance payment if a provider has a significantly higher number of children than that provided for in the initial advance payment.</p><p>  In previous years, a further payment was made in mid-October following the submission of the annual parental returns detailing the number of eligible children enrolled in each service, based on the actual number of children enrolled and covering payments up to the first week of December.  </p><p>  A new Programmes Implementation Platform (PIP) is currently being introduced which is expected to streamline the payment process for all of the childcare support programmes implemented by this Department.  Due to some initial difficulties experienced in relation to the registration of eligible children on the new system, it was not possible to issue a payment in October based on actual numbers of children enrolled.  A further advance payment was issued, covering a further 5 weeks.  Service providers were advised that they could apply through their local City or County Childcare Committee to increase or decrease the number of children for which an advance was being paid.</p><p>  The payment which issued to service providers in the first week of December reflects the amount due up to 23rd January 2015 in respect of actual number of children registered.</p><p>  Where childcare providers are in contract with my Department to provide the free pre-school year and have satisfied the terms and conditions of the programme, payments in general issue in accordance with the draft payment schedule which is published on the Department's website at the beginning of each school year.   There are exceptions where, for example, an up to date tax clearance certificate is not provided or where bank details or some other information has not been submitted.  As well as the payment dates covered in the payment schedule, a payment batch is processed every week to ensure that funding issues to providers who submit tax clearance certificates or other details after the date of the major payment.</p></reply>

A key element of the Agenda is to strengthen the national pre-school inspection system. This will result in a change of practice in a number of areas relating to pre-school inspections.<br/><br/>A number of changes have been made to the Child Care Act 1991 to underpin these reforms. The amended legislation strengthens the current inspection regime and provides a statutory basis for the registration of early years services. The new registration system, which was introduced by the Child and Family Agency on foot of the Child and Family Agency Act, requires that anyone seeking to open an early years service will be required to register with the Agency prior to the facility being opened. The proposed facility will then be inspected to ensure that it meets all the necessary criteria before registration is granted. A similar inspection will be carried out at three year intervals thereafter to ensure continued compliance.<br/><br/>The second and separate phase of inspection, which will monitor the child care-related criteria, will be carried out after the service has become operational and children are attending.<br/><br/>In addition to the above inspections, the Inspectorate of the Department of Education and Skills has been asked to lead and organise focused inspections of the quality of education provision in the 4,200 early childhood education settings participating in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme. Early childhood education is a crucial period in the development of young children and a key focus for Government is to promote best outcomes for children participating in the free pre-school programme. These inspections therefore will have a developmental focus looking in particular at the quality of children&rsquo;s learning experiences. <br/><br/>To support the childcare sector in improving quality, the National Early Years Quality Support Service - <i>Better Start</i>- is being introduced as part of the Early Years Quality Agenda.The <i>Better Start </i>programme is a national approach to quality improvement supports.  One element of this, the Early Years Specialist Service, is employing 30 graduates in early childhood care and education who will work directly with services to improve quality, including assisting services in the implementation of the S&iacute;olta Framework and the Aistear Curriculum. <br/><br/>It is considered that these initiatives, together with the reforms being implemented under the Early Years Quality Agenda, will provide for a more robust and consistent inspection regime that will address the future needs of the childcare sector.</p></reply>

This funding supports the provision of early childhood care and education to more than 100,000 children who enroll in approximately 4,300 childcare services throughout the country.</p><p>  Despite the difficult budgetary position that has prevailed in recent years, the Government has maintained the investment in these childcare support  programmes.

The Valuation Office prepares valuation lists of commercial properties, as required by the Act, and local authorities are obliged to collect rates on properties which are listed.  </p><p>  Following concerns expressed by childcare providers throughout the country, the issue of commercial rates on pre-school services was raised with the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government Phil Hogan T.D. who confirmed that, in line with existing legislative framework, local authorities have no discretion in the collection of commercial rates on properties which are on the Valuation List.  The concerns of childcare providers in relation to commercial rates were also brought to the attention of officials in the Department of  Finance. </p><p>  Officials from my Department also met with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the context of the Valuation Bill currently going through the Houses of the Oireachtas and discussed the issue of commercial rates on pre-school services.  The purpose of this meeting was for the provision of information, both historical and contextual, in relation to the childcare sector and at which my Department took the opportunity to express provider's concerns.</p><p>  The Seanad did recently approve an amendment to the Valuation Bill to exempt not-for-profit childcare providers from commercial rates. However, private commercial childcare providers continue to be subject to commercial rates except those whose funding is derived only through capitation provided under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  </p><p>  As stated, responsibility for the Valuation Acts and the Valuation Office falls within the remit of the Minister for Finance and therefore any change to the Act including any provision for exemptions is a matter for that Department.</p></reply>

The Programme is a targeted intervention aimed at school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; DEIS Action Plan for Educational Inclusion.  It provides targeted supports annually to approximately 36,000 children.</p><p>  Since 1st   January 2014, the Child and Family Agency has operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme, including the allocation of funds to local projects.  In 2014, an allocation of &euro;24.756 million has been provided for the School Completion Programme.  As with all major spending programmes, the School Completion Programme budget was subject to examination under the terms of the 2011 Comprehensive Review of Expenditure.  This process identified a requirement for savings of 6.5% per annum across the programme over the period 2012 to 2014.  The amount provided for 2014-2015 for the School Completion Programme takes account of the savings requirements in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure 2012-2014.  The Agency has approved local projects' school retention plans for the 2014/2015 academic year.  The first instalment of 2014/15 funding issued to local projects last September.  Further payments totalling approximately &euro;9.5m will issue this month, with a third instalment in May 2015.</p><p>  The estimate for the Child and Family Agency for 2015 is &euro;635 million, a 4.3% increase on its 2014 allocation.  My Department will issue a Performance Statement this month under Section 45 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013. This will include my priorities for consideration in the development of the Agency's 2015 Business Plan.  The Business Plan will set out the Agency's proposed activities, programmes and priorities for 2015, including provision for the School Completion Programme, in the light of the monies available.</p><p>  A review of the School Completion Programme has commenced.  It is being carried out by the ESRI following a procurement process managed by the Agency.  The programme has been in operation since 2002 and I believe that it is timely that a review be carried out.  The Review is an important initiative to plan for the future development of this Programme.  It is envisaged that the review will be completed during the 2014/2015 academic year.</p></reply>

It is acknowledged that delivering the range of service required of the Agency, within this budget, was challenging.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the significant level of resources provided, certain areas of expenditure, such as legal costs, have in the past proven difficult to manage within the allocated budget.

There are in the region of 4,200 child care providers participating in the programme, providing the free preschool provision to approximately 68,000 children each year.  The programme represents an annual investment of nearly &euro;175m.</p><p>  It is currently a requirement of the programme that all the preschool leaders in participating child care services must hold, as a minimum, a qualification at Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ).  A standard weekly capitation fee of &euro;62.50 is paid for each eligible child participating in the ECCE programme in these services.</p><p>  A higher capitation fee of &euro;73 for each eligible child is payable to preschool service providers where all the preschool leaders delivering the ECCE programme hold a bachelor degree in childhood/early education (minimum of Level 7 on the National Framework for Qualifications (NFQ) or equivalent) and have 3 years experience working in the sector, and where all the preschool assistants in the service hold a relevant major award in child care/early education at Level 5 on the NFQ or its equivalent.</p><p>  When a service provider applies for the higher capitation rate, the relevant qualifications are checked in my Department to confirm eligibility.  The ratios and sessions operated within the service must also be checked to ensure that all the ECCE children in the service are benefiting from the higher qualified staff.</p><p>  In the academic year 2013/2014, 1,402 child care services who provided evidence of the qualifications of their staff and who received sanction from this Department were paid the higher capitation rate in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ECCE programme.  Applications for the higher capitation rate for 2014/2015 are currently being examined by my officials and the numbers sanctioned for the higher payment are expected to be available early next year.</p><p>  The higher capitation rate is not payable to services where staff delivering the ECCE programme hold qualifications lower than Level 7 on the NFQ or where the preschool leader holds the Level 7 qualification but the preschool assistant does not hold a Level 5 or higher qualification.</p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that new qualification requirements are being introduced as part of the ongoing progression of the Early Years Quality Agenda.  This will mean that a minimum Level 5 award on the NFQ in early childhood care and education will be necessary for all staff working in early years services (no requirement currently exists).  It is expected that this requirement will apply from September 2015 in the case of existing services.  In addition, the minimum qualification requirement for preschool leaders delivering the ECCE programme will be increased from a Level 5 award to a Level 6, from the same date.</p></reply>

The schemes include the Youth Service Grant Scheme under which funding is made available on an annual basis to 31 national and major regional youth organisations, including Foroige.  Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund, Rounds 1 and 2, Local Drugs Task Force Projects and certain other programmes including the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres.  The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately, 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2014, funding of &euro;49.78m has been provided to my Department for these schemes. </p><p>  Funding is provided to For&oacute;ige under the Youth Services Grant Scheme in respect of support for the organisation at national level.  In 2014, &euro;2,651,154 was provided to the organisation under this scheme.  Foroige also receives funding for local projects around the country under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme and the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund 1 and 2. In 2014 &euro;4,557,810 was provided for these projects.</p><p>  The data on funding of youth projects is organised by reference to the local Education and Training Boards that administer the funding on behalf of my Department.  The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department in respect of the years 2010-2012.  However, details of the funding provided to Foroige for 2013 and 2014 for each of its projects, by Education Training Board area, is being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy shortly.</p></reply>

The Programme is a targeted intervention aimed at school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; DEIS Action Plan for Educational Inclusion.  It provides targeted supports annually to approximately 36,000 children.</p><p>  Since 1st   January 2014, the Child and Family Agency has operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme, including the allocation of funds to local projects.  In 2014, an allocation of &euro;24.756 million has been provided for the School Completion Programme.  The Agency has approved local projects' school retention plans for the 2014/2015 academic year.  The first instalment of 2014/15 funding issued to local projects last September.  Further payments totalling approximately &euro;9.5m will issue this month, with a third instalment in May 2015.</p><p>  This School Completion Project for the areas mentioned by the Deputy, is comprised of six primary schools and two post-primary schools.  I am advised that an amount of  &euro;214,184 was allocated by the Agency to the project for the school year 2014-2015, of which &euro;174, 024 will have been paid in two instalments by 31 December 2014, with a final payment of &euro;40,160 due in May 2015.  The amount provided for 2014-2015 takes account of the savings requirements in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure 2012-2014.  The allocation of the funding across the range of interventions planned for young people and between the local schools in the School Completion Programme project for the area is a matter for the Local Management Committee.</p><p>  The estimate for the Child and Family Agency for 2015 is &euro;635 million, a 4.3% increase on its 2014 allocation.  My Department will issue a Performance Statement this month under Section 45 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013.  This will include my priorities for consideration in the development of the Agency's 2015 Business Plan.  The Business Plan will set out the Agency's proposed activities, programmes and priorities for 2015, including provision for the School Completion Programme, in the light of the monies available.</p><p>  A review of the School Completion Programme has commenced.  It is being carried out by the ESRI following a procurement process managed by the Agency.  The programme has been in operation since 2002 and I believe that it is timely that a review be carried out.  The Review is an important initiative to plan for the future development of this Programme.  It is envisaged that the review will be completed during the 2014/2015 academic year.</p></reply>

In practice, this will mean a smoking prevalence rate of less than 5%.  The two key themes underpinning the report are protecting children and the denormalisation of smoking.  The introduction of standardised packaging of tobacco is just one of over sixty recommendations made in the policy.<br/><br/>In December 2012, Australia became the first country in the world to introduce standardised or plain packaging of tobacco products.  Research has shown that a year after standardised packaging was introduced in Australia, there was no evidence of any decrease in customers purchasing tobacco products from small retail outlets, no flooding of the market by cheap brands and no increase in the use of illicit tobacco as predicted by opponents to standardised packaging.<br/><br/>I am confident that the introduction of standardised packaging in Ireland will assist in reducing the numbers of people smoking in this country, and in particular act as a deterrent for young people from starting to smoke.</p></reply>

The additional eligible population is approximately 100,000 and, when fully implemented, 540,000 women will be included in the Breastcheck Programme.</p><p>  The extension will result in those who are already being invited to screening as part of the current programme having their period of screening extended until they are 69 years of age.  Those aged 65 will be the first to be invited.  The extension will be implemented on a phased basis in order to manage the additional screening and follow up involved.</p><p>  Women of any age who have concerns about breast cancer should seek the advice of their GP who will, if appropriate, refer them to the symptomatic breast services in one of the eight designated cancer centres.</p></reply>

Under its provisions, persons residing in Ireland who are attached to the social security system of another member state are entitled to receive health care services in Ireland at the cost of that member state, provided they are not subject to Irish social security legislation.</p><p>  Since 1973 Ireland has operated a bilateral healthcare reimbursement agreement with the United Kingdom, in respect of health services provided under EU Regulations, covering such persons as temporary visitors between the two countries, pensioners of one country and their dependants residing in the other country, and the dependant families of persons employed in the other country.  Under the terms of the agreement net liability between the two countries is calculated on a lump sum basis rather than an individual basis.  The agreement does not provide for reimbursement to, or in respect of, a particular individual.  The payment made in respect of any one year is based on an estimate of the number of persons falling within categories eligible for reimbursement and for whom each country is liable and an estimate of the average cost of providing healthcare treatment.  The amount payable is agreed following compilation of the necessary data and discussions between the two administrations.  Payments are made in advance and are subject to final settlement once all necessary statistical and financial information is complete.  </p><p>  The payments are received by the Health Service Executive as Appropriations-in-Aid and are offset against the gross funding requirements of the Executive at national level thus reducing the net liability to the Exchequer.</p></reply>

This programme will be responsible for, among others:<br/><br/>- Mapping, developing and implementing care pathways for rare diseases;<br/><br/>- facilitating timely access to centres of expertise - nationally and internationally;<br/><br/>- developing treatment guidelines for many rare disorders;<br/><br/>- developing care pathways with European Reference Centres for those ultra-rare disorders where there may not be sufficient expertise in Ireland.<br/><br/>In line with this recommendation, a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases has been established in the HSE. A Clinical Lead for this programme has also been appointed. This clinical programme will ultimately be a channel for advancing and implementing other recommendations in the plan, such as those on National Centres of Expertise for rare diseases. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, the HSE and the EU Commission plan to fund jointly a rare disease post of Information Scientist in the HSE with a number of recommendations in mind. These refer to rare disease registries and the utility of data currently captured in health information systems. <br/><br/>Finally, the Health Identifiers Bill - the publication of which was recommended in the plan - has now been enacted. A similar recommendation on the Health Information Bill is being advanced.</p></reply>

It comprises three integrated units: a clinical genetics service; a cytogenetics laboratory and a molecular genetics laboratory. The service is under the governance of OLCHC, which has recently made a decision to discontinue the separate identification of the service as the National Centre for Medical Genetics, in the interest of clarity on governance arrangements. I am assured  that there has been no reduction in the scope of the services provided.</p><p>  There have been rapid and progressive developments in genetics and genomic medicine over the past five years, and it is well recognised as one area of medicine that will continue to rapidly develop over coming years. A recently-commissioned review of the genetic services at OLCHC recommended the development of a plan for a National Genetic and Genomic Medicine Network to reflect best international arrangements for the provision of genetic services. This recommendation has been accepted by the HSE  and a Steering Group to progress it is currently being established. </p></reply>

Point-of-sale advertising, the giving of samples or any other promotional device to induce sales of infant formula  directly to the consumer at the retail level, such as special displays, discount coupons, premiums, special sales loss-leaders and tie-in sales are prohibited. Furthermore manufacturers and distributors of infant formulae are not allowed to provide, to the general public or to pregnant women, mothers or members of their families, free or low-priced products, samples or any other promotional gifts, either directly or indirectly.   </p><p>  From six months of age the diets of infants start to gradually diversify and they consume a more varied diet.  Follow-on formula must comply with specific EU composition and labelling requirements as well as other general EU food law requirements.</p><p>  These regulations were transposed into Irish law by S.I. No. 852 of 2007 and are enforced by Environmental Health Officers with the HSE under service contract with FSAI. </p><p>  The WHO recommends that infants be exclusively breast-fed for the first six months of life to achieve optimal growth, development and health.  </p><p>  The HSE is reviewing its current Breastfeeding Strategy and in its Health and Wellbeing operational plan for 2015 it is intended to develop and initiate an Action Plan for Breastfeeding for 2015-2020.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-12-16a.1064.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014121600082#WRT04100"><p>I am shocked and distressed by the revelations of extremely poor and unacceptable standards of care and mistreatment of vulnerable residents in &Aacute;ras Attracta. Every person who uses disability services is entitled to expect and receive supports of the highest standard and to live in an atmosphere of safety and care. This is particularly important for vulnerable people in residential care whose families have entrusted them to the care of professional staff. </p><p>  The allegations of mistreatment in the Prime Time programme are very disturbing and need to be fully investigated. In that regard, I welcome the immediate response of the HSE, following receipt of these serious allegations, to alert the Garda&iacute; and HIQA and for the protection of both residents and staff themselves, to put a number of staff &lsquo;off-duty&rsquo; while the allegations are being investigated. I am assured that staffing levels are being appropriately maintained to deliver safe care to all residents. </p><p>  I also welcome and support the HSE&rsquo;s initiation of both an expert investigation into these serious allegations chaired by Mr Christy Lynch and an independently chaired review of the services provided at this facility, led by Dr Kevin McCoy. </p><p>  Mr. Lynch's investigation will examine in particular the practices, behaviours and attitudes of the staff of Unit 3 and will form an important input into the disciplinary process which must be undertaken by the HSE.   </p><p>  Dr. McCoy's review will focus on assuring the quality and safety of care of residents in &Aacute;ras Attracta.  This will be informed by earlier work done by both the HSE and HIQA and will seek to identify any gaps and any contributory and/or causal factors.  It will make recommendations so as to eliminate, in any way it is possible to do so, any risk of harm occurring in the future. </p><p>  I understand that the Director General of the HSE has written to all staff informing them that the onus is on them to take personal responsibility to ensure that the individuals supported by the HSE in any setting are treated with dignity and respect. </p><p>  The HSE&rsquo;s new National Policy and Procedures for Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse, which I launched with the HSE on 5th December 2014, clears the way for staff members in HSE and non-HSE facilities, and members of the public, to refer allegations of abuse to designated reporting individuals. </p><p>  This new policy, places an onus on providers of services to vulnerable people to appoint a Designated Officer to both receive and follow up on concerns and reports of abuse. Under the new policy it is the responsibility of all staff and service providers to ensure the protection and welfare of vulnerable people. In each Community Healthcare Organisation, a Safeguarding and Protection Team will work in partnership with all relevant service providers to ensure that concerns and complaints are addressed. </p><p>  This policy complements the statutory inspection by HIQA of nursing homes and residential centres  for people with a disability and is very welcome. I also welcome the public appeal made by the Chief Executive of HIQA to encourage any persons who have concerns about the treatment of vulnerable persons in our disability services to contact HIQA. He has emphasised that the matter will be taken very seriously and looked at in the context of HIQA&rsquo;s very significant regulatory powers of inspection of residential facilities. </p><p>  A system wide process is now commencing, with the establishment of a National Implementation Taskforce.  A 6 step programme will be implemented and monitored and will focus on : </p><p>  - Implementation of Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse  - National  Policy &amp;amp; Procedures</p><p>  - Advocacy</p><p>  - Evaluation and Practice Improvement</p><p>  - National Summit (Tuesday 16 December) - to improve Client Safety, Dignity, Respect &amp;amp; Culture Change</p><p>  - Implementation plan for any recommendations arising from the assurance review of residential services in Aras Attracta when complete</p><p>  - Development of long term sustainable &amp;amp; evidence based safeguarding practices and training programmes specific to residential settings</p><p>  - Implementation of Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse  - National   Policy &amp;amp; Procedures </p><p>  I have been fully briefed by the HSE since they became aware of these allegations and I have asked it to ensure that all appropriate resources are put in place to ensure that the safety and care of residents at &Aacute;ras Attracta is maintained at the highest possible standard. I have also asked the HSE to brief me on the outcome of these investigations as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The health care of persons on temporary stay or vacation is established through the use of the European Health Insurance Card, which are issued in this country by the HSE. Holders of a European Health Insurance Card can get necessary health care in the public system of any EU / EEA country or Switzerland, should they become ill or injured while on a temporary stay in that country. The Card does not cover the cost of treatment in a private setting. Public health care systems vary from country to country, and few member states will pay the full cost of health care for holders of the Card but will provide care under the same conditions as apply to public patients resident in the state.</p><p>  Where a person travels abroad without their European Health Insurance Card and requires treatment, a Temporary Replacement Certificate, which gives the same entitlement as the Card but for a shorter period, can be issued by the relevant local HSE Health Office. In the case of the individual concerned, I am advised by the HSE Community Care office in Kilkenny that the appropriate engagement has been made with the German hospital to ensure this individual receives his entitlements under the EU Regulations.</p></reply>

Every person who uses disability services is entitled to expect and receive supports of the highest standard and to live in an atmosphere of safety and care. This is particularly important for vulnerable people in residential care whose families have entrusted them to the care of professional staff. </p><p>  The allegations of mistreatment in the Prime Time programme are very disturbing and need to be fully investigated. In that regard, I welcome the immediate response of the HSE, following receipt of these serious allegations, to alert the Garda&iacute; and HIQA and for the protection of both residents and staff themselves, to put a number of staff &lsquo;off-duty&rsquo; while the allegations are being investigated. I am assured that staffing levels are being appropriately maintained to deliver safe care to all residents. </p><p>  I also welcome and support the HSE&rsquo;s initiation of both an expert investigation into these  serious allegations chaired by Mr Christy Lynch and an independently chaired review of the services provided at this facility, led by Dr Kevin McCoy. </p><p>  Mr. Lynch's investigation will examine in particular the practices, behaviours and attitudes of the staff of Unit 3 and will form an important input into the disciplinary process which must be undertaken by the HSE.  </p><p>  Dr. McCoy's review will focus on assuring the quality and safety of care of residents in &Aacute;ras Attracta.  This will be informed by earlier work done by both the HSE and HIQA and will seek to identify any gaps and any contributory and/or causal factors.  It will make recommendations so as to eliminate, in any way it is possible to do so, any risk of harm occurring in the future.  </p><p>  I understand that the Director General of the HSE has written to all staff informing them that the onus is on them to take personal responsibility for their actions to ensure that the individuals supported by the HSE in any setting are treated with dignity and respect. </p><p>  The HSE&rsquo;s new National Policy and Procedures for Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse, which I launched with the HSE on 5 December 2014, clears the way for staff members in HSE and non-HSE facilities, and members of the public, to refer allegations of abuse to designated reporting individuals. </p><p>  This new policy, places an onus on providers of services to vulnerable people to appoint a Designated Officer to both receive and follow up on concerns and reports of abuse. Under the new policy it is the responsibility of all staff and service providers to ensure the protection and welfare of vulnerable people. In each Community Health care Organisation, a Safeguarding and Protection Team will work in partnership with all relevant service providers to ensure that concerns and complaints are addressed. </p><p>  This policy complements the statutory inspection by HIQA of nursing homes and residential centres  for people with a disability and is very welcome. I also welcome the public appeal made by the Chief Executive of HIQA to encourage any persons who have concerns about the treatment of vulnerable persons in our disability services to contact HIQA. He has emphasised that the matter will be taken very seriously and looked at in the context of HIQA&rsquo;s very significant regulatory powers of inspection of residential facilities. </p><p>  A system wide process is now commencing, with the establishment of a National Implementation Taskforce. A 6 step programme will be implemented and monitored and will focus on implementation of Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse; National  Policy &amp;amp; Procedures; Advocacy; Evaluation and Practice Improvement; National Summit (Tuesday 16 December) to improve Client Safety, Dignity, Respect &amp;amp; Culture Change; implementation plan for any recommendations arising from the assurance review of residential services in &Aacute;ras Attracta when complete; development of long term sustainable &amp;amp; evidence based safeguarding practices and training programmes specific to residential settings; implementation of Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse; national policy &amp;amp; procedures.</p><p>  I am not in a position at this early stage to indicate when the HSE will have completed its enquiries into the allegations of mistreatment in &Aacute;ras Attracta. However, I agree with the Deputy that the process should be completed as speedily as possible.</p></reply>

All community nursing units (CNUs) including those delivered in recent years will require some level of capital funding in order to meet compliance standards.  Funding will range from a few hundred euro for the more recently delivered CNUs to more considerable sums for older buildings and protected buildings such as St Joseph's Ardee.   The Executive is required to prioritise infrastructure projects within its overall capital envelope taking into account the existing capital commitments and costs of completion over the period.  The method and timescale for the delivery of health care infrastructure is a dynamic process which is constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances, including the feasibility of implementation.  </p><p>  The HSE has submitted its draft Capital Plan for the period 2015-2019 which has been approved by Minister Varadkar.  It also requires the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform which will be sought shortly. Although the Plan is multi-annual it requires annual approval and consent.

Every person who uses disability services is entitled to expect and receive supports of the highest standard and to live in an atmosphere of safety and care. This is particularly important for vulnerable people in residential care whose families have entrusted them to the care of professional staff. <br/><br/>The allegations of mistreatment in the Prime Time programme are very disturbing and need to be fully investigated. In that regard, I welcome the immediate response of the HSE, following receipt of these serious allegations, to alert the Garda and HIQA and for the protection of both residents and staff themselves, to put a number of staff &lsquo;off-duty&rsquo; while the allegations are being investigated. I am assured that staffing levels are being appropriately maintained to deliver safe care to all residents. <br/><br/>I also welcome and support the HSE&rsquo;s initiation of both an expert investigation into these serious allegations chaired by Mr Christy Lynch and an independently chaired review of the services provided at this facility, led by Dr Kevin McCoy. <br/><br/>Mr. Lynch's investigation will examine in particular the practices, behaviours and attitudes of the staff of Unit 3 and will form an important input into the disciplinary process which must be undertaken by the HSE.<br/><br/>Dr. McCoy's review will focus on assuring the quality and safety of care of residents in &Aacute;ras Attracta.  This will be informed by earlier work done by both the HSE and HIQA and will seek to identify any gaps and any contributory and/or causal factors.  It will make recommendations so as to eliminate, in any way it is possible to do so, any risk of harm occurring in the future. <br/><br/>I understand that the Director General of the HSE has written to all staff informing them that the onus is on them to take personal responsibility to ensure that the individuals supported by the HSE in any setting are treated with dignity and respect. <br/><br/>The HSE&rsquo;s new National Policy and Procedures for Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse, which I launched with the HSE on 5th December 2014, clears the way for staff members in HSE and non-HSE facilities, and members of the public, to refer allegations of abuse to designated reporting individuals. <br/><br/>This new policy, places an onus on providers of services to vulnerable people to appoint a Designated Officer to both receive and follow up on concerns and reports of abuse. Under the new policy it is the responsibility of all staff and service providers to ensure the protection and welfare of vulnerable people. In each Community Healthcare Organisation, a Safeguarding and Protection Team will work in partnership with all relevant service providers to ensure that concerns and complaints are addressed. <br/><br/>This policy complements the statutory inspection by HIQA of nursing homes and residential centres  for people with a disability and is very welcome. I also welcome the public appeal made by the Chief Executive of HIQA to encourage any persons who have concerns about the treatment of vulnerable persons in our disability services to contact HIQA. He has emphasised that the matter will be taken very seriously and looked at in the context of HIQA&rsquo;s very significant regulatory powers of inspection of residential facilities. <br/><br/>A system wide process is now commencing, with the establishment of a National Implementation Taskforce.  A 6 step programme will be implemented and monitored and will focus on :<br/><br/>- Implementation of Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse  - National  Policy &amp;amp; Procedures<br/><br/>- Advocacy<br/><br/>- Evaluation and Practice Improvement<br/><br/>- National Summit (Tuesday 16 December) - to improve Client Safety, Dignity, Respect &amp;amp; Culture Change<br/><br/>- Implementation plan for any recommendations arising from the assurance review of residential services in Aras Attracta when complete<br/><br/>- Development of long term sustainable &amp;amp; evidence based safeguarding practices and training programmes specific to residential settings<br/><br/>- Implementation of Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse  - NationalPolicy &amp;amp; Procedures <br/><br/>I have been fully briefed by the HSE since they became aware of these allegations and I have asked it to ensure that all appropriate resources are put in place to ensure that the safety and care of residents at &Aacute;ras Attracta is maintained at the highest possible standard. I have also asked the HSE to brief me on the outcome of these investigations as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This is a necessary feature of the Scheme to enable the HSE to manage the budget for the Scheme.<br/><br/>The budget for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme in 2014 is &euro;939m.  At end of October 2014 (latest figures available) 21,926 people were supported by the Scheme. I am aware that waiting times on the Nursing Homes Support Scheme placement list have grown. This is not a satisfactory situation and I am trying to address it.<br/><br/>In addition to the budget for the Scheme, in July this year, the HSE allocated &euro;5 million for an initiative to improve access to appropriate care for older people.  To date, this has funded over 300 transitional care beds for patients in acute hospitals from the placement list for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme and over 200 home care packages to assist patients in the acute hospitals who require a home care package to be discharged.<br/><br/>The Government has provided additional funding of &euro;25 million for 2015 to address delayed discharges, of which &euro;10 million will be allocated to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.In the longer term this issue requires an integrated response across primary, community, and residential services and my Department is working closely with the HSE to ensure that available resources are deployed in the most effective way possible. <br/><br/>Funding was released on 2nd December for just over 1,000 Nursing Home Support Scheme applicants, bringing the numbers on the placement list to 1,071 and reducing the waiting time for funding to 12 weeks.</p></reply>

The reduction in staff numbers since the start of this Government's term is 9,225 WTEs or 8.7% of the HSE workforce. <br/><br/>In order to mitigate the impact on frontline services of the reduction in employment numbers, the priority is to reform how health services are delivered in order to ensure a more productive and cost effective health system.  The revised working arrangements provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement are a pivotal element in this regard. Subject to approval by senior managers, arrangements are in place in the HSE to allow the recruitment of staff where it has been established that there is an urgent service requirement. This has facilitated the recruitment of key grades, allowing a focus on enhanced services in older persons, mental health and disabilities services as well as on primary care. <br/><br/>It is important to note on the figures issued that there has been a 9.4% increase in Medical/Dental numbers and an 8.6% decrease in Management/Admin numbers.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced in the budget that he intended to delegate greater autonomy to Departments and Agencies to manage their own staffing levels.  From 2015 Departments and Agencies will have discretion over staffing levels within the overall framework of their pay budget.  This policy change will give HSE management greater autonomy to manage their own staffing profile.  The change from a rigid employment control framework with a moratorium on recruitment to a focus on achieving the most cost-effective staffing profile within an allocated pay framework will allow for recruitment where it is determined that this can achieve more economical service delivery, such as through the replacement of agency staff by staff on fixed term contracts of employment.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-12-16a.1200.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014121600085#WRW00900"><p>I am shocked and distressed by the revelations of extremely poor and unacceptable standards of care and mistreatment of vulnerable residents in &Aacute;ras Attracta. Every person who uses disability services is entitled to expect and receive supports of the highest standard and to live in an atmosphere of safety and care. This is particularly important for vulnerable people in residential care whose families have entrusted them to the care of professional staff.<br/><br/>The allegations of mistreatment in the Prime Time programme are very disturbing and need to be fully investigated. In that regard, I welcome the immediate response of the HSE, following receipt of these serious allegations, to alert the Garda&iacute; and HIQA and for the protection of both residents and staff themselves, to put a number of staff &lsquo;off-duty&rsquo; while the allegations are being investigated. I am assured that staffing levels are being appropriately maintained to deliver safe care to all residents.<br/><br/>I also welcome and support the HSE&rsquo;s initiation of both an expert investigation into these serious allegations chaired by Mr Christy Lynch and an independently chaired review of the services provided at this facility, led by Dr Kevin McCoy.<br/><br/>Mr. Lynch's investigation will examine in particular the practices, behaviours and attitudes of the staff of Unit 3 and will form an important input into the disciplinary process which must be undertaken by the HSE.<br/><br/>Dr. McCoy's review will focus on assuring the quality and safety of care of residents in &Aacute;ras Attracta.  This will be informed by earlier work done by both the HSE and HIQA and will seek to identify any gaps and any contributory and/or causal factors.  It will make recommendations so as to eliminate, in any way it is possible to do so, any risk of harm occurring in the future.<br/><br/>I understand that the Director General of the HSE has written to all staff informing them that the onus is on them to take personal responsibility to ensure that the individuals supported by the HSE in any setting are treated with dignity and respect.<br/><br/>The HSE&rsquo;s new National Policy and Procedures for Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse, which I launched with the HSE on 5th December 2014, clears the way for staff members in HSE and non-HSE facilities, and members of the public, to refer allegations of abuse to designated reporting individuals.<br/><br/>This new policy, places an onus on providers of services to vulnerable people to appoint a Designated Officer to both receive and follow up on concerns and reports of abuse. Under the new policy it is the responsibility of all staff and service providers to ensure the protection and welfare of vulnerable people. In each Community Healthcare Organisation, a Safeguarding and Protection Team will work in partnership with all relevant service providers to ensure that concerns and complaints are addressed.<br/><br/>This policy complements the statutory inspection by HIQA of nursing homes and residential centres  for people with a disability and is very welcome. I also welcome the public appeal made by the Chief Executive of HIQA to encourage any persons who have concerns about the treatment of vulnerable persons in our disability services to contact HIQA. He has emphasised that the matter will be taken very seriously and looked at in the context of HIQA&rsquo;s very significant regulatory powers of inspection of residential facilities.<br/><br/>A system wide process is now commencing, with the establishment of a National Implementation Taskforce.  A 6 step programme will be implemented and monitored and will focus on: <br/><br/>- Implementation of Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse - National  Policy &amp;amp; Procedures<br/><br/>- Advocacy<br/><br/>- Evaluation and Practice Improvement<br/><br/>- National Summit (Tuesday 16 December) - to improve Client Safety, Dignity, Respect &amp;amp; Culture Change<br/><br/>- Implementation plan for any recommendations arising from the assurance review of residential services in Aras Attracta when complete<br/><br/>- Development of long term sustainable &amp;amp; evidence based safeguarding practices and training programmes specific to residential settings<br/><br/>- implementation of Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse - NationalPolicy &amp;amp; Procedures<br/><br/>I have been fully briefed by the HSE since they became aware of these allegations and I have asked it to ensure that all appropriate resources are put in <br/><br/>place to ensure that the safety and care of residents at &Aacute;ras Attracta is maintained at the highest possible standard. I have also asked the HSE to brief me <br/><br/>on the outcome of these investigations as soon as possible.</p></reply>

These include advancing reconciliation and cooperation on the island of Ireland; representing and advancing Government policies with other States and in international organisations; economic, trade and cultural promotion; frontline consular and passport services to Irish citizens; engaging with Irish communities abroad; and programme management, particularly in Irish Aid priority countries. These tasks require extensive engagement with our international partners, including through face-to-face Ministerial meetings.Trade promotion and economic messaging are key elements in all visits abroad undertaken by Government Ministers. Every effort is made to ensure that, as far as is practicable, opportunities are taken for a substantive economic and promotional dimension to all official visits.  An intensive programme of Ministerial-led trade missions is a key commitment in the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs in 2014.  Planning is underway for the programme of trade missions in 2015. It should be noted also that a substantial programme of Ministerial visits will be planned to coincide with St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day celebrations around the world.Between 14 and 19 December, Minister of State Murphy, who has responsibility for European Affairs, will attend the Foreign Affairs, General Affairs and European Councils in Brussels.<br/><br/>Next year's plans for all Ministers at my Department are still under development but I expect to travel to New York in late September 2015 to participate in the General Assembly of the United Nations and to address that body on Irish foreign policy priorities.  I will also meet with Foreign Ministers and UN leaders there, to discuss a range of international issues as well as bilateral issues and Ireland&rsquo;s candidature for election to a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in 2020. Given the importance of our economic relationship with the United States, I anticipate, as on previous visits, to prioritise opportunities to advance our economic interests and will work closely with the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Tourism Ireland on an appropriate economic promotion programme.<br/><br/>In addition, I plan to attend EU related meetings, including meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council and Informal Meetings of EU Foreign Ministers, on a regular basis<b></b>throughout 2015. I expect that my colleagues will be similarly engaged on EU and other matters.<br/><br/>My schedule over the coming months will include a visit to Kiev and, following my recent visit to Cairo to participate in the Gaza reconstruction conference, I intend to visit the Middle East at the earliest opportunity.<br/><br/>The Minister for Diaspora Affairs, Jimmy Deenihan T.D., will travel to London and Birmingham on the 15-16th January 2015.  The purpose of the visit is to engage with the Irish Communities in these cities, including members of the business community. He will also travel to Washington on 21-22nd January next where he will have a series of meetings on the issue of US Immigration Reform.  While the Minister&rsquo;s main role is to engage with Irish communities overseas, in those contacts and others, he will avail of every opportunity that arises to promote Ireland as a good place to do business and as a destination for foreign direct investment.</p></reply>

However, Ireland has a long-standing policy, under successive Governments, of not supporting boycotts or sanctions against Israel, for a number of reasons.   Firstly, we do not believe such measures are likely to prove effective and would only lessen any influence either Ireland or the EU could exert on Israel to alter its policies in relation to the continuing occupation. It would also marginalise Ireland&rsquo;s voice in discussing Middle East policy within the EU and elsewhere, which is one of the main ways in which we can seek to help the Palestinian people.</p><p>  Secondly, Ireland exists within a large free trade area in the EU. It would not be possible for us to exclude products legally available in the EU, and it is clear that there is no possibility whatever of obtaining agreement at EU level on a trade ban. Finally, although this is a minor point, it is worth noting that trade between Ireland and Israel is very much in our favour, so any disruption of this would impact largely on Irish employers, workers and consumers, rather than Israeli.</p><p>  Ireland therefore supports normal trade access for Israeli goods and services to the EU single market, consistent with the treatment of other countries with which the EU has trade and political agreements (many of whom are also the subject of serious human rights concerns). However, Ireland has argued successfully that any rights granted to Israel under these agreements cannot be applied to Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory, and in response the EU has acted in a number of ways to give effect to its disapproval of, and long standing position of opposition to, illegal Israeli settlements:</p><p>Goods from settlements are excluded from the low tariff rates applied to Israeli goods.</p><p>EU funding may not be disbursed to Israeli entities based in settlements.</p><p>  Ireland and a number of EU Member States have recently published advice to citizens and businesses against investing in, or engaging in any form of economic activity with, settlements.</p><p>  Ireland is pressing for the adoption of EU-wide guidelines on labelling of settlement products, which will enable consumers to identify settlement goods and make their own decision about whether they wish to purchase them. If preparation of EU guidelines becomes stalled, then we will actively look at issuing our own national guidelines.</p><p>  Ireland remains a strong and consistent critic of Israeli policies relating to the occupation, and in particular those connected with the construction of settlements on Palestinian land. We have stated repeatedly that we do not consider that the international community has been sufficiently active in combating these policies. We are a consistent voice within the EU in particular calling for stronger action.</p><p>  In regards your constituent&rsquo;s view that we should expel the Israeli Ambassador, every Irish Foreign Minister is regularly called upon to expel the Israeli Ambassador, although such a suggestion is almost never made in relation to other representatives. There are many states around the world in relation to which Ireland has serious human rights concerns.  Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy has always been based above all on the resolution of conflict by dialogue. We do not therefore respond to crises by expelling the interlocutor, except in very exceptional circumstances. In diplomatic language, expelling an Ambassador essentially means you are no longer interested, at least for the moment, in dialogue.</p><p>  Ambassadors exist to allow clear communication between Governments, and are more necessary in bad times than in good. The Government have continually conveyed our views to the Israeli Government through the Ambassador here, or the Irish Ambassador in Tel Aviv. The corollary of course would be the recall or expulsion of our Ambassador in Israel, and the crippling of our own Embassy. Our Ambassador in Israel, as well as communicating our views to the Israeli government, reported regularly to me on the Israeli view of and politics relating to the crisis, and was also personally engaged in the evacuation of Irish citizens and their families from Gaza.

Our programme and our development policy are centrally based on our commitment to the Millennium Development Goals, which were adopted by world leaders at the UN in 2000 and which set out clear targets in the fight to end poverty and hunger in the world.  Our commitment has been recognised internationally, and Ireland has been asked by the UN to co-facilitate the negotiations next year on the new framework for global development to succeed the MDGs after 2015. The OECD has recognised in recent weeks in the peer review of Ireland's aid programme that &quot;Ireland continues to excel in the delivery of effective aid&quot;.  Our commitment to development cooperation is clear in the Programme for Government and was further enhanced by the launch of our policy for international development - <i>One World One Future.  </i>The policy sets out our vision for a sustainable and just world in which people are empowered to overcome poverty and hunger and to fully realise their rights and potential.  <i>One World One Future</i>has a clear focus on the poorest countries and communities in sub-Saharan Africa and sets out three goals: reduced hunger and stronger resilience; sustainable development and inclusive economic growth; and better governance, human rights and accountability.  It provides a clear framework for the prioritisation of activities and for the allocation of resources across six priority areas for action deriving from those goals.  These areas are closely aligned with the objectives of the Millennium Development Goals.<br/><br/>In the context of the very difficult economic circumstances facing the country, the Government has successfully managed to stabilise allocations to Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme.  For Budget 2015, we were again determined to protect the aid programme, and we have provided a total allocation of just over &euro;600 million for next year.  This clearly demonstrates our commitment to the aid programme and represents a very significant and generous contribution on behalf of the people of Ireland to assist those less fortunate than ourselves.  I will set out the case for building further on this commitment over the coming year.</p></reply>

The report does not identify specific countries where interrogation or detention took place, nor countries through which prisoners were transferred.  No information has been provided to substantiate assertions that Ireland has permitted such activity or that any person has been subjected to extraordinary rendition through Irish airspace and airports.  It has been made clear by the current and previous Governments that such activity would be considered completely unacceptable and illegal.</p><p>  Together with our EU partners, Ireland has encouraged the US to bring about the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility in the shortest possible time and that detainees should be brought to trial or released as soon as possible.

Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that the information requested by the Deputy in relation to school transport routes operated by the Company is not readily available on a per county basis. If the Deputy has a particular county in mind the Company could undertake an exercise and furnish details for that county directly to the Deputy in respect of the last three years. The following table shows the overall numbers of primary and post primary children availing of school transport in each county, for each of the past three school years 2011/2012, 2012/2013 and 2013/2014.<br/><br/>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has confirmed that receipts from parental contributions are not disaggregated by county. Some 90% of parental contributions are paid online through a centralised system. The audited accounts for the school transport scheme show that the total receipts from parental contributions for the past five years are:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Receipts</th></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>&euro;11,628m</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>&euro;11,651m</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;11,486m</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;12,570m</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;12,772m</td></tr></table><br/><br/>The total number of mainstream primary and post primary children availing of transport in the 2013/2014 school year, the latest year available, was 48,040 and 62,749 respectively. Of these 10,517 primary (35%) and 26,623 (50%) post primary children, who held valid medical cards (GMS scheme) were exempted from paying the charge.

It also prohibits any person from publishing any information concerning an application or an award made under the Act that refers to any person (including an applicant), relevant person or institution by name or which could reasonably lead to the identification of any such other person, relevant person or institution. The legal advice available to my Department is that this provision does not prohibit applicants from recounting the stories of their childhood.The section also provides that the Board and Review Committee, shall prior to the making of an Order for their dissolution, determine the disposal of the documents concerning applications made to them. The Government agreed in principle to legislative proposals being brought forward to allow for the retention of the records of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, the Residential Institutions Redress Board and the Residential Institutions Review Committee. These proposals will include amendments to existing legislation where necessary. It is intended that the records will be retained in the National Archives and completely sealed for a period of at least 75 years.

Section 49 of the Education and Training Boards Act 2013 sets out the procedures to be followed, which are summarised as follows:<br/><br/>1. The Chief Executive prepares and submits a proposal in writing to the Board that the Board should borrow for the purposes of carrying out the board&rsquo;s functions.<br/><br/>2. The Board considers the proposal and then, if it is decided in principle that the proposal should be accepted, seeks the consent of the Minister for Education and Skills.<br/><br/>3. Once the consent of the Minister has been obtained, the Board may accept the Chief Executive&rsquo;s proposal and borrow in order to carry out the functions of the board <br/><br/>Accordingly, two meetings of the Board will be necessary; one to first consider the proposal and, if it is decided in principle that the proposal should be accepted, a second to accept the proposal, having obtained the consent of the Minister.  This Circular should be read in conjunction with Section 49 of the Act.  This circular can be accessed on the Department of Education and Skills web page: www.education.ie.

The minimum period for which an exchange may occur is one year and the maximum is five years.</p><p>  The exchange scheme was agreed under the auspices of the Teachers' Conciliation Council, a body established in accordance with the terms of the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for Teachers. The Council is comprised of representatives of teachers, school management, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, chaired by an official of the Labour Relations Commission.

Returns for September 2013 indicate that 84% of primary schools operate a book rental scheme. This compares to 83% in 2012 and 77% in 2011.<br/><br/>The position at second level is that for September 2013, 68% of schools reported that they operate book rental schemes. A more detailed analysis of the returns show that 55% of voluntary secondary schools; 66% of Community and Comprehensive schools and 88% of Education and Training Board schools are operating book rental schemes. Responses to a survey conducted in 2012 was disappointing and does not lend itself to comparisons with the returns received in respect of 2013.<br/><br/>My Department will continue to request information on book rental schemes from first and second level schools annually. The information requested by the Deputy in respect of the 2014/2015 school year is not yet available. However, the information will be available in the first quarter of 2015.<br/><br/>As the Deputy is aware Budget 2014 provided funding of &euro;5 million for three years to support the establishment of book rental schemes in primary schools that did not operate such schemes. DEIS schools will receive &euro;150 per child and non-DEIS schools will receive &euro;100 per child in seed capital to establish book rental schemes.<br/><br/>This will cost approximately &euro;6.7million of the &euro;15 million secured over the three year period, the balance of &euro;8.3 million will be divided in 2015 and 2016 among primary schools that currently operate book rental schemes. Every primary school has now been given the opportunity to benefit from the funding secured for the School Book Rental Scheme.<br/><br/>The existing &euro;15million already provided in book grants to all primary and post-primary in the Free Education Scheme will continue to be paid in 2015.</p></reply>

The appeal mechanism has been made available to all types of small school and this mechanism has been based on objective enrolment data. A school with four classroom teachers or less which is losing a teacher or failed to gain an additional teacher as a result of the Budget 2012 measures can submit an appeal to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board.  Details on the appeals process are made available in the staffing schedule for the current school year. The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p><p>  If geographic isolation was to be included as an appeal criterion, it would be challenging to provide an objective definition of geographic isolation that would be generally acceptable.  Such an objective definition would have to be devised and agreed in the interest of running an equitable appeals process.</p><p>  The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities. They will continue to be a feature of our education landscape. However, this does not mean that small schools can stand still or never have their staffing levels changed to something that is more affordable and sustainable for these difficult and challenging times.</p><p>  The staffing arrangements for the 2015/16 school year will be published on the Department website in early 2015.</p></reply>

The Patron and school authority agreed to monitor enrolments to stay within the planned capacity of the new school building which, when completed, will cater for 1,000 pupils. Given that the school will offer a transition year in due course, an enrolment of 210 first year places per year would lead to an overall enrolment of up to 1,260 pupils once the school has developed up to 6th year. It will therefore not be possible for the school to offer 210 first year places in September 2015.</p><p>  The Department must preserve a balance between enrolments in schools in an area and adjacent areas and is satisfied that there are sufficient school places to meet the demand in the area in question. This may sometimes, however, lead to pupils not being offered a place in their school of first preference. </p></reply>

This can necessitate the use of temporary accommodation, as in the case in the school referred to by the Deputy, until my Department is in a position to provide a permanent building.</p><p>  While the school's existing accommodation is being upgraded, the pupils have been temporarily relocated to a building that will host the establishment of a new post primary school in September 2015.  The school will return to its former school building when the upgrading works have been completed. The arrangements for this relocation were made by the ETB in consultation with the school, including the parent representatives. My Department has also sanctioned funding for two additional prefabricated units to cater for increased enrolments.</p><p>  My Department will continue to liaise with the school authorities regarding the school's long term accommodation needs.</p></reply>

In addition, the OPW recently made a property at Kildonan, Finglas available to Dublin City Council which will be used as residential centre to support vulnerable women affected by long-term homelessness. <br/><br/>Further properties are under consideration by Dublin City Council so as to assess their suitability and it is expected that additional properties may be utilised.<br/><br/>In the <i>Action Plan to Address Homelessness</i>which I launched last week, all Dublin housing authorities are considering properties in their area including those listed on the intra-State Property Asset Register with a view to utilising all potential properties for housing purposes on an emergency basis.Housing authorities across the country have access to this Register, currently being populated with property data, where details of all State properties including vacant properties are identified and these authorities may consider such properties for housing purposes.</p></reply>

The objective of the Regulations is to protect ground and surface waters, including drinking water sources, primarily through the management of livestock manures and other fertilisers. </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Nitrates Action Programme (NAP) was extensively reviewed in 2013 by an expert group, jointly chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The expert group also reviewed the submissions received under the public consultation component of the review process.  The expert group also considered the EPA's review of the NAP and the scientific findings of Teagasc's Agricultural Catchments Programme.  The expert group made recommendations to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and suggested measures to be included in Ireland&rsquo;s third Nitrates Action Programme. </p><p>  As recommended by the expert review group, the Nitrates Regulations were amended to require that new storage facilities for soiled water being provided on a holding on or after 1 January 2015 shall equal or exceed the capacity required to store all soiled water likely to arise on the holding during a period of 15 days.  The period since the making of the regulations in February 2014 allowed for the completion of storage facilities in the planning process or in the course of construction.  There are currently no plans to extend this requirement to existing storage facilities. </p><p>  In relation to the review group's recommendation regarding bovine access to waters, the EPA has approved funding under their STRIVE research programme for an extensive study assessing the impact of measures that prevent cattle access to watercourses.  This research is due to commence in 2015 and will inform the next review of the NAP. </p><p>  Specified closed periods for the spreading of fertilisers, including slurry, are a key aspect of the Nitrates Regulations.  They are a requirement of the Nitrates Directive and mandatory in every Member State.  The purpose of closed periods is to protect ground and surface water bodies, including drinking water sources, by prohibiting the application of fertilisers when such application poses an unacceptable risk to waters. </p><p>  The closed periods in Ireland were decided following an extensive consultation and were discussed with farming bodies and the European Commission at the time.  The findings of Teagasc's Agricultural Catchments Programme support the efficacy of the closed season.  As recommended by the expert review group, there have been no changes to the prohibition on the application of fertilisers during the closed winter months. </p><p>  The Nitrates Action Programme will be reviewed again in 2017.</p></reply>

This will include planning and overseeing local and community development funding, whether spent by local authorities or on behalf of the State by other local development bodies.  LCDCs have been structured to conform to the requirements of the LEADER programme.  In order for LCDCs to discharge their functions under the 2014 Act, it is Government policy that LCDCs should submit an E xpression of Interest (EOI) to develop a Local Development Strategy (LDS) and act as a Local Action Group (LAG) .   </p><p>  This does not preclude other groups from expressing an interest in becoming a LEADER LAG , and there will be an open call, appropriate for LCDCs, current Local Development Companies (LDCs) and any other groupings that wish to be considered.  It will be made clear in the call for expressions of interest that it is preferable that one LDS emerge from each sub-regional area in order to support Government policy for a coherent and integrated approach to local and rural development.  The sub-regional areas will be based on the 24 County Councils outside Dublin and Cork, with Cork County split into 3 sub-regional areas, and the three County Councils in the Greater Dublin area (Fingal, South Dublin and Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown) forming a sub-regional area. </p><p>  LCDCs will be required to maintain local dialogue in the expectation that all groups interested in forming a LAG in a sub-regional area will continue to be encouraged to form a single LAG.  My Department will continue to provide encouragement so that LCDCs, with LDCs as key implementing partners, can form LAGs for LEADER 2014-2020, as in order to enhance rural development, it is preferable that there be coordination between local authorities and entities supporting local development so that there are better outcomes for the areas concerned.   </p></reply>

The majority of those dwellings appear to have been constructed between 2000 and 2002.  Earl ier this year, my Department also met with a number of private homeowners whose homes are similarly affected by cracking in the blockwork.  The problems appear to concern approximately 15 houses and the period of construction for the houses involved was 1997 to 2002.   My Department has not been made aware of other dwellings affected by structural problems in the blockwork in County Mayo.   </p><p>  While I fully appreciate and acknowledge the extremely difficult and distressing situations that householders have to deal with when faced with the consequences of the use of defective materials or poor workmanship, building defects are, in general, matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, i.e. the owner, the builder, the manufacturer, supplier, quarry owner and/or their respective insurers.  In the event that the contracting parties cannot reach a settlement by negotiation the option of seeking redress in the Courts can be considered.  In this regard, I believe that the responsible parties should face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate actions to provide remedies for the affected homeowners.   </p><p>  The Pyrite Resolution Act 2013 provides the statutory framework for the establishment of the Pyrite Resolution Board and for the making of a pyrite remediation scheme.  However, the provisions of the Act apply only to dwellings affected by significant damage attributable to pyritic heave consequent on the presence of reactive pyrite in the subfloor hardcore material and not to damage arising in any other circumstance.  The Pyrite Resolution Board has no powers to investigate the alleged use of defective blocks in the construction of the houses in County Mayo and I have no proposals to amend the Act in this regard.   </p></reply>

The HAP scheme will bring all social housing supports provided by the State under the aegis of local authorities.  The schemewill r emov e a barrier to employment by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment.  HAP will also improve regulation of the rented accommodation being supported and provide certainty for landlords as regards their rental income.  <br/><br/>Further to the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 on 28 July 2014, the first phase of the HAP statutory pilot commenced with effect from 15<sup></sup>September in Limerick City and County Council, Waterford City and County Council and Cork County Council.  Subsequently, from 1 October, HAP commenced in Louth, Kilkenny, South Dublin and Monaghan County Councils. <br/><br/>I intend to sign the necessary regulations this week to enable Dublin City Council to become part of the statutory HAP pilot, with a specific focus on accommodating homeless households.  Dublin City Council will implement the HAP pilot for homeless households in its own area and on behalf of the other Dublin local authorities, South Dublin, Fingal and Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Councils.<br/><br/>There are now 382<b></b>households in receipt of HAP across the local authority areas taking part in the statutory pilot scheme.

The NPPR Charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence.  It is a matter for an owner, whether resident in Ireland or elsewhere, to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge and any late payment fees applicable.  </p><p>  Section 7(1) of the 2009 Act provides that any charge or late payment fee due and unpaid by an owner of residential property shall be a charge on the property to which it relates.  Section 7(2) provides that the said property shall not remain charged with or liable to the payment of such unpaid charge or late payment fee after the expiration of 12 years from the date upon which the amount concerned fell due.  In the normal course of events, a residential property can only be sold when a certificate of discharge or a certificate of exemption from the NPPR Charge has been provided as part of the conveyance process.  This provision will remain in force until 31 March 2025. </p><p>  The 2009 Act, as amended, places the Charge under the care and management of the local authorities, and application in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority. </p></reply>

The 2004 Act provides that rents may not be greater than the open market rate and may only be reviewed upward or downward once a year unless there has been a substantial change in the nature of the accommodation that warrants a review.  Tenants must be given 28 days' notice of new rent and can make an application for dispute resolution to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) where they feel the rent increase is in excess of the market rent.  These provisions have effect notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in a lease or tenancy agreement.  <br/><br/>In terms of the current market, apartment rents in Dublin in the third quarter 2014 were 11.6% higher than the same period last year, according to the most recent rent index from the PRTB. The average rent for an apartment in Dublin is &euro;1,170.<br/><br/>The main cause of rising rents is a lack of supply in the market and the recently published <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>sets out clear, measureable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list.  The total targeted provision of over 110,000 social housing units will address the needs of the 90,000 households on the housing waiting list in full, with flexibility to meet potential future demand. <br/><br/>My Department is working closely with NAMA, the Housing Agency, local authorities and approved housing bodies in relation to the delivery of social housing.  Detailed information in relation to the delivery of NAMA sourced units, including a full breakdown by county, by local authority and by approved housing b ody, of units delivered on a quarterly basis, is available on the Housing Agency's website: .</p></reply>

The current Programme officially ended at the end of 2013 having operated for four years with funding of &euro;281 million over that period.  It is being implemented on a transitional basis for 2014 with a budget of &euro;47 million pending the roll out of the new Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) in April 2015.<br/><br/>The SICAP is one of my key priorities and its budget for next year will be decided in the 2015 Estimates process. The Programme's target groups are:<br/><br/>- Children and Families from Disadvantaged Areas;<br/><br/>- Lone Parents;<br/><br/>- New Communities (including Refugees/Asylum Seekers);<br/><br/>- People living in Disadvantaged Communities  ;<br/><br/>- People with Disabilities;<br/><br/>- Roma;<br/><br/>- The Unemployed (including those not on the Live Register)  ;<br/><br/>- Travellers;<br/><br/>- Young Unemployed People from Disadvantaged areas  . <br/><br/>In accordance with the Public Spending Code, legal advice, good practice internationally and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of the services to clients, the Programme is subject to a public procurement process, which is currently underway.  Stage one (Expression of Interest) has been completed.  Stage two (Invitation to Tender), got underway on 20 October and will involve the successful applicants from Stage one being invited to apply to one or more Local Community Development Committees, in Local Authority areas, to deliver the programme.  Contracts for SICAP will be determined following the outcome of the procurement process.<br/><br/>The public procurement process is a competitive process that is open to Local Development Companies, other not-for-profit community groups, commercial firms and national organisations that can provide the services to be tendered for to deliver the new Programme.  In Stage one, joint applications were encouraged and organisations of varying sizes (for example smaller organisations working in consortia with larger organisations) were invited to submit joint applications.  That said, I understand that some small groups, such as the groups under the remit of the NCCWN, faced a number of challenges in competing in the Stage one process.  The results of Stage one were released on 24 September and I can confirm that none of the NCCWN groups expressed an interest either as lead applicants or as part of a consortium. <br/><br/>I am now considering the implications of that for NCCWN and my Department is liaising with other relevant Departments to find a workable solution.  I can confirm that interim LCDP funding, based on a small budgetary reduction in the order of 6.5%, on 2014 levels, will be provided to NCCWN up to end March 2015.  Regrettably, it will not be possible to arrange a meeting with the Network before Christmas.  </p></reply>

An increase in the grant for group sewerage schemes to &euro;6,500 per house or 75% of the cost of the scheme, whichever is the lesser, was announced in December 2012. The previous rate of grant available was &euro;2,031.58 per house or 75% of the cost, whichever was the lesser.<br/><br/>It was proposed, in the first instance, to carry out a number of pilot schemes based on the increased grant level.

Under HAP, the social housing tenant sources the accommodation, the housing authority pays the landlord directly and the HAP household pays a rental contribution to the housing authority.Under section 36 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014, tenancies supported under HAP are generally subject to the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004. In that context, any issues in respect of a tenancy being supported under HAP are a matter for resolution between the landlord and tenant concerned. <br/><br/>The 2014 Act provides for contact between a housing authority and the landlord of a dwelling supported under HAP in relation to, inter alia, tax compliance, payment of assistance and in relation to inspections for the purposes of compliance of dwellings with private rented accommodation standards. There is no requirement on a housing authority in Part 4 of the 2014 Act to notify a landlord about other issues relating to eligibility for HAP that are properly dealt with between the authority and the HAP beneficiary concerned.<br/><br/>To date, HAP has been rolled out in seven local authority areas, as part of a statutory pilot phase of the scheme. There are now 382<b></b>households in receipt of HAP across the local authority areas taking part in the statutory pilot. Limerick City and County Council is providing a transactional shared service to the local authorities participating in this phase and HAP households are generally required to enter into automatic electronic payment arrangements, through An Post&rsquo;s Household Budget scheme. Limerick City and County Council reports that rent collection levels in the pilot are good. <br/><br/>In common with standard practice in other schemes of financial support for social housing, local authorities are paying housing assistance to landlords monthly in arrears in the pilot phase of the HAP scheme. A full review of the statutory pilot phase of the scheme will be carried out in advance of full roll out HAP in 2015. This review will include data and learning from the pilot authorities in relation to the implementation of the statutory scheme. <br/><br/>There has been ongoing contact and information sharing with landlord representative bodies as HAP has been developed and rolled out and this will continue.</p></reply>

In 2013, the Housing Agency was asked to conduct a standalone review of the shared ownership scheme, including identification of the main difficulties and recommendations for mitigating measures. While an initial draft of the review was received from the Agency, a number of issues have been identified that need further detailed financial analysis in order to fully assess the impact on local authority finances of possible mitigating measures. For example, full information on the status of each local authority&rsquo;s loan book is required in order to accurately determine the implications of any possible solutions to shared ownership issues for local authority debt management generally.  This substantial data collection project involving my Department, the Local Government Management Agency and the local authorities themselves is under way. It will be a number of months before sufficient data has been collected in order to complete the requisite analysis to finalise   the review.</p><p>  Pending full conclusion of this review, my Department issued a circular letter to local authorities setting out some of the options and interim actions that might be explored to alleviate the difficulties of those in shared ownership distress, such as allowing use of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process and room rental for Shared Ownership mortgage holders. It is accepted that these proposals are not a complete solution to the issues that arise for such mortgage holders but are intended as an interim measure pending the outcome of the review.</p></reply>

This builds on practical experience , over many years, in the local government sector of local authorities co-operating in the performance of functions and the delivery of services, including on a regional basis.  To drive the reform agenda, and in particular shared service initiatives, in the local government sector, a dedicated Programme Management Office (PMO) has been established which reports to a high-level Oversight Group. The roll out of shared services and process improvements across the sector is supported by the use of shared expertise, a shared technical infrastrucutre supported by the Local Government Management Agency and a singular local government web portal. <br/><br/>Overall, 31 operational areas have been identified for examination for potential as a shared service or other collaborative approach that may provide efficiencies. The PMO has adopted a comprehensive methodology for the development and evaluation of projects including gathering and analysing baseline data, business case preparation and peer review of business cases. <br/><br/>Payroll/Superannuation, Building Control, Treasury Management, Procurement and Accounts Payable have been prioritised in the shared services programme in the short to medium term and the programme is being progressed using a lead authority model. A number of other shared services are currently under development including services in debt management, veterinary services, road management systems and the register of electors. <br/><br/>Following a competitive bidding process in 2013, Laois County Council was selected to provide Shared Payroll and Superannuation services on behalf of all local authorities and has established a shared services centre for that purpose in Portlaoise. This shared service commenced in January 2014 and all local authorities will transition to it in waves in the period to 2016.<br/><br/>In relation to procurement, the local authority sector is working closely with the Office of Government Procurement to deliver significant savings over the coming years.The table below shows the costs associated with each project to date, as well as the anticipated benefits. No costs were incurred for these projects prior to 2013.<table><tr><th><div>Project</div></th><th><div>Costs </div></th><th><div>-</div></th><th><div>Benefits </div></th></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>2013 </div></td><td><div>2014 </div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>MyPay (shared payroll and supperannuation) </td><td><div>&euro;1,345,606 <br /><br /></div></td><td><div>&euro; 1,784,549 <br /><br /></div></td><td>-  &euro;4.3M savings per annum anticipated. <br /><br />-Project Net Present Value ( NPV ) &euro;27,839,444 and Pay Back 7 years. <br /><br />-  Creation of a Centre Of Excellence for Payroll and Superannuation to s ervice Local Government staff and pensioners. <br /><br />-  In order to realise the savings from the Shared Service Centre, surplus staff will need to be redeployed.

As a State we have ambitious targets for 16% of our energy from renewable sources by 2020 through meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources, with 10% renewables in transport and 12% in heat. The National Competitiveness Council report correctly states that in the event of a shortfall against our 2020 targets, the Exchequer would incur significant costs in order to comply with our obligations under EU law.    Analysis undertaken by my Department, the SEAI, EirGrid and the Commission for Energy Regulation assessed the costs and value of choosing the path towards 40% renewable electricity generation in 2020, compared to a scenario where renewable electricity remained at 2013 levels. This analysis informed a report which is expected to be published shortly. </p><p>  The REFIT schemes underpin the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies. The current REFIT 2 and 3 schemes remain open for applications until the end of 2015. To date, onshore wind energy has been the most cost effective renewable technology in the Irish electricity market, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. My response to Question No. 7 on 23 October 2014 further reinforces the value of wind energy to our economy.</p><p>  The cost effectiveness of support for renewables is a central concern in the work now underway in my Department to consider the appropriateness and design of a new support scheme for renewable electricity, to be available from 2016. Any scheme would be subject to the new EU rules on State Aid adopted by the European Commission earlier this year. The commercial success of onshore wind means that we are now at the point where a gradual move to a more market based support for the technology is appropriate. Taking account of developments in EU electricity market integration, my Department will be engaging with stakeholders in this work, a key component of which will be consideration of the available technologies, their cost effectiveness and the level of any support required.</p></reply>

Weekly meetings between the Minster and the Secretary General are scheduled for Monday and Tuesday of each week but there is also regular contact outside of these scheduled meetings. The Ministers would, of course, on a day-to-day basis, have various formal and informal meetings involving one or more members of the MAC on issues across the range of Departmental responsibilities and it would not be possible to produce a complete statistical return of these.</p></reply>

Most recently, the Petroleum (Exploration and Extraction) Safety Act, 2010 conferred responsibility on the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) to set up a petroleum safety framework for the regulation of petroleum activities with regard to safety. The safety framework is now fully operational and this requires that a petroleum undertaking must submit a safety case application to the CER and have been granted a safety permit before any petroleum activities, or operations, can commence. </p><p>  The Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act was introduced in 2006 to consider certain developments which are of strategic, economic, or social importance to the State. or to a region. This means that planning applications for certain large scale private developments, generally of a scale requiring environmental impact assessment pursuant to the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive and appropriate assessment pursuant to the Birds and Natural Habitats Directive, will be made directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. Previously such applications were the remit of the relevant Local Authority, with a right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. Oil and gas development projects come within the remit of An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the 2006 Act.</p><p>  My Department continues to have a role in relation to the consideration of the potential environmental impacts of certain activities that are subject to Ministerial decision. Such decisions are informed by expert advice provided by other State bodies, such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service, along with the advice of expert external environmental consultants engaged by my Department. Details of approvals granted, together with supporting documentation, including applications for approval, expert environmental advices and decision submissions, are all published on my Department&rsquo;s website in the interest of transparency.</p></reply>

These licensing options conferred upon the holders the first right to apply for an exploration licence over the areas concerned.    The licensing option work programmes permitted the companies to evaluate the natural gas potential of the acreage largely based on desktop studies of existing data. Exploration drilling, or the use of hydraulic fracturing in exploration drilling, was not proposed by the companies concerned, nor was it permitted under the licensing options. </p><p>  As the award process and nature of the authorisations awarded did not constitute a plan or programme under the Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive a strategic environmental assessment was not required. Projects on the scale of such authorisations fall within the ambit of the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive and the Birds and Natural Habitats Directive.</p><p>  Two of the three companies, (Tamboran Resources and Enegi) have submitted applications for a follow-on exploration licence.</p><p>  Successive Minsters and Ministers of State at the Department of Communications Energy and Natural Resources have confirmed, however, that they will make no decision on such an application pending the outcome of the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s Research Programme into the use of hydraulic fracturing. This research has recently commenced and is expected to conclude in 2016. It has been made clear that no decisions will be taken on any application that proposed the use of hydraulic fracking in exploration drilling until the EPA Research Programme is complete and there has been time for the Government and other interested parties to consider its findings. The appropriate time for decision-making on the issue of hydraulic fracturing will be after there has been an adequate opportunity to reflect on the findings of the EPA research.</p></reply>

However, it is important to note that the electricity and gas markets are commercial, liberalised, and competitive and that they operate within national and European regulatory regimes. I have no statutory function in the setting or review of electricity prices. Responsibility for electricity and gas market regulation is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  Comprehensive data on fossil fuel prices is available in the recently published <i>Energy in Ireland 1990-2013 </i>report. This is published by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and is available on their website.<br/><br/>At a national level, electricity and gas prices are no longer regulated by CER. The competitive energy market results in choices for consumers and businesses in terms of suppliers, products and prices and exerts downward pressure on prices.<br/><br/>The reduction in wholesale gas prices since the beginning of 2014 has led to reductions in the wholesale electricity price. These reductions should have a knock on impact on retail prices and are reflected in the latest Eurostat figures, published by the SEAI on the 9<sup></sup>December 2014 in their report <i>Electricity and Gas Prices in Ireland</i>. The report shows that all business consumption bands in both electricity and gas experienced reductions in average prices in the first half of 2014, ranging from 0.7% to 4% in electricity and 6.7% to 12.9% in gas. <br/><br/>Similarly, Eurostat figures show a reduction of 5.7% in the average price of gas in the residential consumption band with the largest share of the market, while the average price of electricity in the residential consumption band with the largest share experienced a reduction of 1.3%.<br/><br/>Consumers can try to mitigate electricity and gas prices by shopping around to get the best possible price and service deal from suppliers and I would encourage them to do so. Measures such as comparison websites, approved by the CER, exist to assist them in this endeavour.</p></reply>

The Great Western Greenway in Mayo as an example is used by many pedestrians as well as cyclists.</p><p>  The National Trails Office of the Irish Sports Council under the remit of my Department is currently developing a revised Irish Trails Strategy to support outdoor recreational activities including walking. The development of this revised strategy will serve to strengthen the link between walking as a tourism asset and walking as an everyday mode of transport.</p><p>  Increased walking and cycling makes for safer streets and communities and the development of infrastructure to support one complements the other.</p></reply>

Prior to the recent change, this offence involved a direct summons to court and the assignment of 5 penalty points on conviction. The provisions in the 2014 Act brought this offence within the fixed charge notice system. An alleged offender will now be issued with a fixed charge notice and, on payment of the &euro;60 charge, will have 3 penalty points assigned to their licence. The driver will, of course, continue to have the option of going to court where 5 points will still apply on conviction.</p><p>  Enforcement of the relevant legislation is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. If a person&rsquo;s NCT test date is imminent, it will be a matter for the Garda to use their discretion. However, responsibility rests with owners and users of vehicles to ensure their vehicles are in compliance with the law.</p><p>  I understand from the Road Safety Authority that, last week, the NCTS experienced its highest demand ever for tests with the call centre answering over 63,000 calls. The NCTS dealt with this unprecedented demand and kept the priority list stable.</p><p>  The introduction of this change to the penalty point system has proved to be effective in bringing non-compliant people into the NCT system. This is reflected in the fact that the RSA has informed me that a considerable number of cars currently being tested are overdue and late for their test, some of them over a year late.</p><p>  The RSA has stated that the majority of car owners, including those who require an early test, will receive an NCT appointment within 28 days and additional resources have been put in place to help deal with such requests.  The RSA has repeatedly emphasised that the availability of appointments on the NCT website is not a reflection of the total number of slots available to customers. If a person is in need of an early test they should follow the advice on the NCTS website which clearly advises customers, if they cannot obtain a suitable slot online, to contact the NCTS call centre directly on (01) 413 5992.</p></reply>

The property's website attributes this decision to high property prices affecting the owners&rsquo; plans to expand the business. I understand from contact with the Deputy's office that she believes that litter and anti-social behaviour were also factors in the decision.<br/><br/>In relation to anti-social behaviour, although this is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, I am conscious of the negative impacts that such matters can have on holidaymakers&rsquo; experience and have previously raised my concerns with those responsible. Dealing with this behaviour involves issues such as drug dependency, homelessness and begging. It requires a coordinated approach from state agencies involved in social, housing, health and drug treatment services, as well as through partnership with business, community and voluntary groups.  In this regard, I understand that a High Level Group has been established, involving Dublin City Council, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and the HSE, to support efforts to enhance public safety and the overall environment of the city centre.<br/><br/>In relation to improving the overall tourist experience in Dublin, following the report of the Grow Dublin Taskforce, which <i>inter alia</i>noted the potential impact of anti-social behaviour on tourists, I recently established the Grow Dublin Tourism Alliance to implement the report's recommendations. The Group, which is being set up under F&aacute;ilte Ireland<i>, </i>will be led by the Chairman of Bord Bia, Michael Carey.<br/><br/>Thankfully, Ireland remains a very safe holiday destination generally with a relatively low rate of crime against tourists.

I am happy to again clarify the position regarding this regional road scheme.</p><p>  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993. Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants. The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p><p>  It is important to state that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement Councils like Kerry County Council in their own resources spending this area. While Councils could apply in the past for grant funding for certain road improvement projects, budgetary constraints mean that the Specific Improvement Grants Scheme has been curtailed in order to maximise the funding available for repair and strengthening work of the road network.</p></reply>

The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.</p><p>  Because of the national financial position, there have been very large reductions in roads expenditure over the past number of years. The reality is that the available funds do not match the amount of work which could be undertaken. For this reason it has not been possible to progress a range of worthwhile projects and the main focus has to be on the maintenance and repair of roads and this will remain the position in the coming years. The scope for progressing new major road improvement projects will be very much dependent on the availability of funding in the future as the economy recovers further.</p><p>  In 2011 my predecessor indicated to the NRA that it should withdraw its application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for the M20 Cork to Limerick route. I understand Minister Varadkar was concerned that to proceed any further with the scheme to build the M20 would have exposed the NRA to significant costs arising from a consequent requirement to purchase the CPO'd land within a limited timeframe. This would have had to be done without the reasonable prospect of proceeding to the construction stage quickly. Given the scale of the project I would have to consider very carefully whether the basis exists that would give confidence that a project of the scale of the M20 would be affordable or achievable and thereby justify commencing the project through planning again.</p></reply>

Payments to Kerry County Council under the regional and local roads programme in respect of the Kenmare Inner Relief were as follows:<table><tr><th><div>Year</div></th><th><div>Payment</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>2010</div></td><td><div>&euro;257</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>&euro;573,041</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>&euro;375,000</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2013</div></td><td><div>&euro;873,447</div></td></tr></table><br/><br/>The 2014 regional and local road end-of-year payments to local authorities are in the process of being finalised. The payment booklet when completed will be forwarded to the D&aacute;il library.</p></reply>

That is why F&aacute;ilte Ireland has worked closely with local authorities and local communities in the provision of signage along the route of the Wild Atlantic Way. However, it is a matter for the Local Authorities and the National Roads Authority, as appropriate, to sanction the erection of road signage.</p><p>  In relation to the particular signs in question, I have referred the Deputy's Question to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for further information and direct reply. Please contact my private office if you have not received any communication from F&aacute;ilte Ireland within ten working days.</p></reply>
