    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-18a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013071800045#WRA00500"><p>Malaria is a serious disease that kills approximately 1 million people per year in sub-Saharan Africa alone.  It is a serious threat to any military force operating in the area.The anti-malaria regime in place in the Defence Forces &ndash; including the use of Lariam &ndash; has worked.  In the decade of deployment to sub-Saharan Africa by the Defence Forces, not a single member of the Defence Forces has died from malaria and there are only three documented cases of personnel getting malaria.   The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is the statutory body that regulates medicines available in Ireland.  I am advised that the three anti-malarial medications licensed by the IMB &ndash; Lariam (mefloquine), Malarone and Doxycycline &ndash; can all have significant side effects.  To assert that any one is automatically a more effective or safer alternative to the others is a grossly misleading oversimplification.  Each of the three drugs has been used by the Defence Forces, depending on individual circumstances including the type of malaria in the destination, the duration of travel, etc.  </p><p>  I am further advised that the Defence Forces are fully aware of the range of reported side effects attaching to all anti-malarial medications. Protocols are in place to control the risk of side effects in individuals.  </p><p>  Lariam is one of the most effective medications for protection against the type of malaria prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>  Up to September 2012, Malarone was only licensed for up to 28 days continuous use and was not an option as the usual duration of deployment for the Defence Forces is 6 months.  The 28-day limit was removed in September 2012.  However, there is limited evidence as to the safety and effectiveness of Malarone usage for longer periods.  The position is currently being reviewed by the Defence Forces&rsquo; Medical Corps.</p><p>  The Minister had the various allegations surrounding the use of Lariam investigated thoroughly and have obtained the advice of leading medical experts, who concur with the prescribing practices followed by the Defence Forces. </p><p>On 1st   July 2013, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) and Roche Products (Ireland) issued a letter to all GP&rsquo;s concerning Lariam.  This letter has been circulated by the Director of the Defence Forces Medical Corps (DMC) to all Medical Officers. The DMC is considering its content and whether or not it has policy implications. Lariam remains licensed by the IMB and must remain in the formulary of medication prescribed by the Medical Corps for Defence Forces personnel on appropriate overseas missions, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa, to ensure that our military personnel can have effective protection from the very serious risks posed by this highly dangerous disease.</p></reply>

The central recommendation from the VFM Steering Committee is for the retention of the Reserve with 4,000 personnel spread countrywide to be based in barracks and in a small number of other locations. This required the consolidation of existing Reserve Units throughout the country into a smaller number of full-strength Units. The retention of all locations was not a viable or sustainable option. </p><p>  As a result of the reorganisation of the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) earlier this year a number of RDF properties were vacated as they are surplus to military requirements. </p><p>  The properties in question are now the responsibility of the Department of Defence.  Over twenty properties have been taken in charge by the Department. The Department is monitoring the condition of these properties on an ongoing basis and will continue to do so until they are disposed of. In the meantime any necessary maintenance works will be carried out as required.</p></reply>

Such requests are examined by the Department on a case by case basis and whilst there is no overarching prohibition or restriction on military involvement in religious events, this would not generally be seen as an appropriate role for the Defence Forces. There are of course exceptions to this such as, for example, Military involvement in State funerals and last year&rsquo;s participation by the Defence Forces Chaplaincy Service in the International Eucharistic Congress.</p><p>  However, as regards the provision of honour guards in a religious ceremony, the position is that it is no longer considered appropriate that the Defence Forces would provide such participation.</p></reply>

They died in an incident which occurred on 21<sup>st</sup> March 1989, whilst serving with 'C' Company, 64<sup>th</sup> Infantry Battalion, United Nations Interim Force in the Lebanon (UNIFIL). On 19<sup>th</sup> April 2011, Minister Shatter commissioned Mr Frank Callanan, SC, to carry out an independent review into matters relevant to the deaths of Corporal Fintan Heneghan, Private Mannix Armstrong and Private Thomas Walsh. Mr. Callanan was appointed to carry out the inquiry following the emergence of new evidence in the course of preparation of a legal case. The Minister has met with the families and they have been provided with a copy of the Report. On 19<sup>th</sup> September 2011, the Minister published the review.</p></reply>

The Department has been engaged on an ongoing programme of barrack consolidation since 1998. This programme has brought the number of barracks closed during that time to fourteen. In addition to the main barracks a number of other smaller properties have also been identified as surplus to military requirements. Some of these have already been disposed of whilst others are in the process of being prepared for disposal. These mainly consist of married quarters and Reserve Defence Force premises. Earlier this year, as part of the reorganisation of the Reserve Defence Force, a number of additional properties became surplus to requirements and these will also be disposed of. </p><p>  The consolidation of the Defence Forces formations into a smaller number of locations is a key objective in the ongoing defence modernisation programme and has been recommended in many reports over the past number of years. Notwithstanding this, the overall priority is to ensure that the operational capacity of the Defence Forces is maintained to the greatest extent possible.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware I have indicated to the House previously there are no plans for further barrack closures.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-18a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013071800045#WRA01500"><p>There are no plans at present for changes to the operation of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces. The primary role of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces, which is provided for in the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004, is to provide an independent appeals process for members of the Defence Forces. Such appeals arise where a complaint has been processed through the internal Defence Forces &ldquo;Redress of Wrongs&rdquo; process but the member remains dissatisfied with the outcome or the manner in which the complaint was handled. The 2004 Act also provides that, subject to certain conditions, the Ombudsman may accept complaints directly from former members of the Defence Forces. </p><p>  The office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is well established. A number of administrative and systemic issues identified by the Ombudsman have been addressed by Defence management. This has contributed to improvements in procedures and policies within the Defence Forces.   Recent trends show a significant increase in the number of redress of wrongs complaints being resolved within the military system, thus reducing the number of cases being referred to the Ombudsman for investigation.</p></reply>

The Defence Forces conducts re-skilling, training and education under three broad categories namely skills training, career training and education and collective training. Skills training is the medium through which the Defence Forces ensures that its personnel have the requisite individual, specialist, and crew skills to permit the development of organisational capabilities. Career training provides the organisation with the necessary pool of leaders and commanders at all levels from Section Commander to Brigade Commander. Collective Training allows military personnel to use their  individual, crew, specialist and career training together. This moulds Sub-Units, Units and Formations into integrated and coherent combat forces. This provides the Defence Forces with the capabilities required to fulfil its roles and missions, both at home and overseas.</p><p>  External Education at University and Institute level, both home and abroad, fulfils Defence Forces requirements by providing education and expertise, which cannot be delivered within the organisation and which ensures that Defence Forces personnel attain the required level of academic and professional qualifications. </p><p>  Training standards in the Defence Forces are constantly benchmarked against best international practice. Participation in ongoing overseas operations also necessitates multi lateral-training and assessment. This facilitates ongoing review of Defence Forces re-skilling and training methods and standards within an international military context. </p><p>  I am advised that Defence Forces personnel continue to have the most modern and effective range of equipment and technology available for their training and day-to-day roles.</p></reply>

The mission was formally launched by EU Foreign Affairs Council on 18 February 2013 and its initial mandate is to last for fifteen (15) months. The purpose of the mission is to provide military training and advice to the Malian Armed Forces in order to improve their capacity to maintain security in Mali and restore the authority of the Malian Government and the territorial integrity of the Malian State. Twenty-two Member States are contributing over 500 troops, including 250 instructors and additional military personnel to EUTM Mali. Personnel deployed to the mission will not be involved in combat operations. 26 February 2013, the Government approved the deployment of approximately eight (8) members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the EUTM Mali. Three (3) Officers and five (5) Non commissioned Officers were deployed to EUTM Mali on 23 March 2013, for a tour of duty of approximately five months. The officer, of Lieutenant Colonel rank, has been appointed Camp Commandant of the Koulikoro Training Camp, while one Commandant is employed in the Mission Headquarters in Bamako.   </p><p>  The remaining six (6) personnel also deployed to Koulikoro form part of a joint infantry training team with the United Kingdom armed forces. Training for the first group of 650 Malian Armed Forces personnel commenced on 2 April 2013 and is progressing well. The Defence Forces training team will train two platoons of Malian Armed Forces personnel during their tour of duty. The training teams are due to rotate in early September 2013.   </p><p>  No formal request has been received from the UN for Defence Forces participation in the recently established United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, known as MINUSMA. However, the UN has advised the EU and other potential troop contributors of current shortfalls in key enablers, in this mission, which include Transport, Logistics, Engineering and Medical. The potential for the Defence Forces to contribute to MINUSMA is currently under consideration by the Defence organisation. No decision has been made at this stage as to whether Ireland will participate.</p></reply>

O.N.E. receives a subvention of &euro;40,000 per annum and IUNVA receives a subvention of &euro;10,000 per annum from my Department. The Organisation of National Ex-Servicemen and Women (O.N.E.), which has enjoyed the long standing official recognition of the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, is an organisation dedicated to looking after the welfare of ex-service personnel of the Irish Defence Forces by way of providing accommodation to homeless, elderly or disabled members in need of such domestic accommodation and shelter and other assistance that may be required. O.N.E. is a limited company with charitable status. </p><p>  The funding provided to O.N.E. by the Department of Defence is to support the general overheads of the organisation and expressly not for the provision of services that are provided to citizens, including members of O.N.E., from other arms of the State.

In the period since its publication, there have been significant changes in the defence and security environment with the emergence of new and complex security challenges.

These meetings included Congressman Paul Ryan, Congressman Bob Goodlatte (Chair of the House Judiciary Committee), Leader Nancy Pelosi, Congressman Pete King (Chair of the Friends of Ireland Group), Congressman Richie Neal, Congressman Joe Crowley, Congressman Joe Kennedy, Congressman Mike Grimm, Congressman Tom Rooney, and I spoke with Congresswomen Zoe Lofgren, Ranking Member on the House Sub-Committee on Immigration by phone.  I also met with the policy director and counsel to the Majority Whip Congressman Kevin McCarthy and with Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s chief of Staff,  Mike Sommers.  In the Senate, I met with Senator John McCain, Senator Pat Leahy and Senator Dick Durbin.  </p><p>  I also met with representatives of Irish-American community groups with whom the Embassy has worked closely in the context of shared US immigration reform objectives: the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the Chicago Celts for Immigration Reform and the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform (ILIR).  That meeting was an opportunity to update them on my engagements, to reiterate the strong support of the Government for immigration reform and to hear their views and suggestions.</p><p>  The plight of the undocumented remains a top priority for the Government and I was keen to emphasise the Irish interest in the issue during my meetings in particular with Republican members of the House of Representatives.  The issue of future legal flows for Irish migrants is also important and I welcome the inclusion of provisions for an Irish E-3 visa in the Senate Bill.  </p><p>  While progress to date has been encouraging, particularly the adoption of the US Senate Bill, the focus now is in the House of Representatives and there is a challenging road ahead.  It is not possible at this stage to specify an exact timeframe for the work of the House.  The Government, through the Embassy in Washington DC, will remain fully engaged with the issue.</p><p>  In my contacts on Capitol Hill, I also took the opportunity to discuss corporate taxation, in particular with Senator McCain and Congressman Ryan.</p><p>  I also had a series of economic engagements, including a business breakfast with leading investor companies and an address on Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership at the European Institute, as well as a meeting with the IMF.</p></reply>

The three terms of reference of the review of the existing North South bodies and of North South co-operation generally which is being undertaken in accordance with the St Andrews Agreement, are to examine the existing bodies in terms of efficiency and value for money, to look at the case for additional North South bodies and areas of co-operation and at a replacement for the Irish Lights Agency.</p><p>  The review was a subject of discussion at the recent meeting of the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) in plenary format which was held in Dublin Castle on 5 July 2013 and which was attended by members of the Government and of the Northern Ireland Executive including the First Minister and Deputy First Minister.   It was noted that Term of Reference One of the review is now largely complete; that senior officials from both administrations have met and initiated a work programme to take forward Terms of Reference Two and Three; including expanding on the areas of North South cooperation, and that they will conclude their work and present a report with proposals to the next NSMC Institutional meeting in the autumn.  The potential for closer North South co-operation in the area of Further and Higher Education will of course be considered closely by the appropriate officials as part of this stage of the review.</p></reply>

Secretary Kerry has been working intensively on this issue since he took office, and is presently making his sixth visit to the region since March. He is endeavouring to get the agreement of both sides for a structure for talks and for confidence building measures on the ground to help the parties domestically, and especially the Palestinian side, to enter the process.  All of us are aware of the many difficulties in this process. Secretary Kerry is strongly committed and believes that he is making progress.  But he can only succeed if the parties are willing.</p><p>  At EU level, we considered the prospects for talks, and what we can do both to assist in getting talks started and in bolstering them once they begin.  This could include direct encouragement and support for the parties, EU actions to help build confidence on the ground and support in our political contacts with the US for what the Administration is doing on the Middle East.  The Council also continued to discuss its own analysis of the situation on the ground, and in particular the EU's strong opposition to Israeli policies in the occupied Territory which are acting directly contrary to the chances of achieving a peace agreement. </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the EU is working on guidelines for the labelling of goods produced in Israeli settlements.  The European Commission will this week publish guidelines on the non-eligibility of entities in the settlements for participation in EU funded programmes.  These are important steps and I believe the Council should do more to reinforce this work.  I expect the Foreign Affairs Council next week will continue these discussions on the Middle East, although it is unlikely that Secretary Kerry will have reached the point of presenting his plans publicly before the Council meets.</p></reply>

Recent diplomatic efforts, particularly the initiative of the US and Russia aimed at bringing both sides in Syria to a further peace conference in Geneva on the basis of the Geneva Communiqu&eacute; of June 2012, will undoubtedly be central to our discussions.</p><p>  In its May 27 Conclusions, the Foreign Affairs Council urged all sides in Syria to respond positively to the US-Russia initiative and it reaffirmed that the EU will spare no effort in helping to create the appropriate conditions for a successful convening of the conference.  Under the terms of the Political Declaration adopted at the May Council, High Representative Ashton is expected to report to the Council next week on developments related to the US-Russia initiative and on the engagement of the Syrian parties.  A number of preparatory meetings involving senior UN, US and Russian officials have taken place in Geneva to discuss plans for the Geneva II conference.  This preparatory work is continuing, though realistically it is likely to be some months yet before any actual conference takes place.</p><p>  A priority at the moment is persuading the moderate Syrian opposition to alter its current stance and agree to participate fully in any peace talks convened in Geneva.  The newly elected President of the Syrian National Coalition, Sheik Jarba, has indicated he does not envisage the Coalition attending the conference prior to the armed opposition reversing its current military fortunes on the ground.  Obviously, any prospects for a successful conference require the clear commitment of both the Syrian government and opposition to fully support the Geneva II initiative and engage constructively in it.  Ireland and its EU partners believe that there cannot be a military solution to the conflict and that any prolongation of the fighting will only reduce the chances for a peaceful political settlement.</p><p>  Promoting a power-sharing agreement between the Syrian authorities and the opposition is clearly the only way to end the violence and to respond to the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people for peace and democracy.  Ireland and its EU partners will continue to work hard to achieve these vital objectives.</p></reply>

At the end of June, receipts classed as Appropriations-in-Aid were ahead of profile, largely due to increased passport fee receipts.</p></reply>

Denmark (on behalf of the Faroe Islands), Iceland, Ireland and the UK all make claims to continental shelf in the Hatton-Rockall area.  Ireland and the UK have reached agreement on the delimitation of the boundary between them but those claims are not accepted by Iceland or Denmark, which make their own claims.</p><p>  The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea requires any State Party making claims with respect to areas of continental shelf more than 200 nautical miles from its coast to submit its claims for examination to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf within ten years of the Convention entering into force for that state.  The Convention was ratified by Denmark on 16 November 2004 and it entered into force for Denmark on 16 December 2004.  As has been indicated in previous replies, Denmark has submitted its claim with respect to Hatton-Rockall (the submission was made on 2 December 2010).  Ireland and the UK have also submitted claims (both claims were lodged on 31 March 2009), but Iceland has not done so.  The Commission's rules of procedure prevent consideration by the Commission of a submission relating to a disputed area without the consent of all the states concerned and Iceland does not currently consent to the consideration of these submissions.</p><p>  The four countries have met frequently since 2001 in an effort to resolve the overlapping claims issue, but have been unable to reach agreement.

Two new CSDP Missions were launched during the first half of 2013: the European Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali) and the EU Border Assistance Mission in Libya (EUBAM Libya).</p><p>  EUTM Mali was launched in February for the purpose of supporting the training and reorganisation of the Malian Armed Forces.  Eight members of the Defence Forces have been deployed to EUTM Mali.  EUBAM Libya was launched in May to support the Libyan authorities in improving and developing the security of Libya's borders.  In addition to the ten individuals already deployed with EU civilian CSDP Missions, Ireland deployed three further people to EU CSDP Missions in the first half of 2013.  The Missions involved were in Afghanistan (EUPOL Afghanistan), Georgia (EUMM Georgia) and the regional maritime training mission in the Horn of Africa and the Western Indian Ocean (EUCAP Nestor).</p><p>  We also sought to support the work of the High Representative in preparing for the European Council discussion on defence issues in December by hosting a series of informal meetings at Ministerial and official level.  We cooperated with the European Parliament and the European External Action Service in the organisation of a conference on the role of the EU as peacemaker and mediator.  A seminar on cooperation between e regional organisations and the UN in the areas of crisis management, peace support and peace enforcement operations was organised under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Defence.  These meetings allowed member States to exchange views on how to strengthen CSDP and how to improve the availability of the required military capabilities for international crisis management.  I hope that the outcome of these discussions will assist the High Representative in developing proposals and actions on which she is due to report in September.</p><p>  Work undertaken during our Presidency on developing a new set of Crisis Management Procedures aimed at streamlining the process of planning and deploying CSDP Missions in the future is close to finalisation.  In the area of EU-UN cooperation, good progress was made on the Plan of Action aimed at enhancing EU CSDP support to UN peacekeeping.  In January, a contract to establish a warehouse capable of delivering warehoused assets at short notice to CSDP Missions was signed.</p></reply>

It was to alleviate those concerns that the Parades Commission was established under the Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 with independent and quasi-judicial status.  I recognise that certain Parades Commission determinations are controversial but that is inevitable given the nature of its role.  In the absence of political and local agreement in Northern Ireland to resolve contentious parades, a regulatory mechanism is essential in this area.</p><p>  Last year the Commission dealt with over 4,000 parade related applications, of which it made determinations on 146 contentious parades.  As a quasi-judicial public body the Commission's activities do not fall within the agreed areas of co-operation addressed by the North South Ministerial Council.  Successive Irish Government have fully supported the Commission in its difficult work and have consistently called for its legally binding determinations to be respected and upheld. </p><p>  I have been in contact with Secretary of State Villiers and Minister Ford over the weekend in relation to the deplorable violence which broke out after the 12th of July parade in Belfast.  I have expressed the Irish Government's appreciation to Minister Ford for the work of the PSNI in protecting communities from this violence in very difficult circumstances.  The attacks on the police which have led to over sixty arrests and over seventy officers being injured are unacceptable and shameful.   </p><p>  The determinations of the Parades Commission are legally binding and respect for the rule of law must be upheld.  The Secretary of State and I are at one in our commitment and determination to uphold the law, support the police and the further development of the process of peace and reconciliation in Ireland.  I will be meeting with Secretary of State Villiers next week to further discuss parades and other issues of concern.</p><p>  I welcome the initiative on the part of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to set up an all party group under the chairmanship of Dr Richard Haass to consider a number of outstanding issues in relation to the peace process and parading is one of those.  I would call on all concerned to engage constructively in the process.</p></reply>

At this meeting, the EU also asked about measures taken so far by China to ratify the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights, which it signed in 1998. </p><p>  In February 2013, officials from my Department met with representatives of the Irish Falun Dafa Association.  During this meeting the issue of organ harvesting and ways in which human rights issues are raised with Chinese authorities by both Ireland and the EU was discussed.  Officials in my Department met again with representatives of the Falun Dafa Association and human rights lawyers on 9 July regarding the issue of organ harvesting.  A Common Position adopted by the European Council in 2008 outlines that Member States shall deny an export licence to any company if there is a clear risk that military technology or equipment to be exported might be used for internal repression.  </p><p>  In Ireland, human trafficking for the purpose of the removal of organs is criminalised under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008.  In addition, I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Health, that the removal of human organs without consent or for payment is an offence under the European Union (Quality and Safety of Human Organs Intended for Transplantation) Regulations 2012 - S.I. No. 325 of 2012.  These Regulations give effect to Directive 2010/53/EU.  Under the Regulations, it is an offence to traffic, harbour, import or export organs contrary to the Regulations and the Directive.  The Regulations set out a framework encompassing the establishment of competent authorities, the authorisation of transplantation centres and the establishment of conditions of procurement and systems of traceability.  I understand that the Department of Health is also preparing legislative proposals for a Human Tissue Bill which will set out a detailed consent framework for the removal, donation and use of organs from deceased and living persons for the purpose of transplantation.    </p><p>  Ireland, together with our EU partners, will continue to address human rights issues with China, including those related to the Falun Gong, in frequent and regular dialogue, through our contacts in both Dublin and Beijing and through the relevant multilateral channels, including at the United Nations Universal Periodic Review of human rights in China, scheduled for October 2013.</p></reply>

It has met to date on four occasions, with the most recent meeting taking place on 14 February 2013.  The next meeting will take place later this year.  I have chaired each of the meetings held to date.  The membership includes relevant Ministers, senior officials, the CEOs of State Agencies concerned with trade, tourism and investment and individuals from the private sector.</p><p>  The ETC helps to strengthen cooperation and coordination across all Government Departments and State Agencies involved in the promotion and development of trade, tourism and investment, however, it is not a funding body.  Rather, it evaluates progress made in achieving the targets for export, tourism, FDI and jobs growth set out in <i>Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy</i> and considers issues which influence the implementation of the Trade Strategy.  For example, at our most recent meeting, the Council analysed opportunities for Ireland presented by the ongoing negotiation of a number of Free Trade Agreements between the EU and third countries, and the schedule of Enterprise Ireland trade missions for 2013, which Minister Bruton and I approved, was reviewed.  Examples of other areas which have been examined in previous meetings are my Department's Africa Strategy; visa issues and their impact of trade, tourism and investment in Ireland; and the issue of education and skills, on which Minister Quinn has briefed the Council.</p></reply>

This commitment was strengthened by the publication of our new Policy on International Development, One World, One Future, which clearly sets out our vision for a sustainable and just world, and our goals and areas of focus for the coming years.  It also reaffirms the centrality of the aid programme to our foreign policy.  The new Policy restates the commitment in the Programme for Government to achieving the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) for Official Development Assistance (ODA) when economic circumstances permit.  Over the past two years, the Government has broadly stabilised the budget for development assistance.  This is a significant achievement in the context of the very difficult conditions facing the country. </p><p>  For 2013 we have allocated a total of &euro;622 million for ODA.  Of this, &euro;497 million is managed by my Department under Vote 27 - International Cooperation.  The remainder is made up of ODA eligible contributions from other Government Departments and Ireland's share of the EU Development Cooperation Budget.  This represents a very significant allocation of public funds, is a clear indication of our commitment to the aid programme and represents a genuine investment on behalf of the Irish people to assist those less fortunate than ourselves.</p></reply>

The aid programme has benefited from the contributions of generations of Irish volunteers, professionals and missionaries who have worked in the developing world.  At present, the Government's aid programme supports the work of some 1,300 development workers, volunteers and missionaries in developing countries.  In addition, the Rapid Response Corps operated by Irish Aid provides an opportunity for those with specific skills to be deployed swiftly in response to humanitarian crises and disasters.</p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to establish a civilian volunteer corps.  In line with this commitment, we plan to launch a new initiative on international volunteering in developing countries later this year.  It will strengthen support for volunteering and promote civilian participation in high quality volunteer programmes that contribute to the achievement of clear sustainable development results.  The volunteering initiative will reflect development needs in developing countries and increase volunteering opportunities for those, including job-seekers and retired public servants, who have skills and experience in short supply in the developing world.</p><p>  At EU level, a Council negotiating position for the establishment of the EU Aid Volunteers Initiative was agreed during Ireland's EU Presidency in the first half of 2013.  Working closely with the Commission and Member States, Ireland sought to ensure that the draft regulation reflected the need for this initiative to be demand-driven and cost-effective, adding value to the overall EU humanitarian effort and responding to humanitarian need.  The EU Aid Volunteers Initiative will provide an additional opportunity for humanitarian volunteers from Ireland to participate in EU funded humanitarian operations worldwide.</p></reply>

My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, has the lead responsibility for Government policy in relation to biofuels and EU policy on biofuels, including the European Commission's proposal to limit the use of foodcrop-based biofuels in transport to 5% by 2020.</p><p>  The EU Renewable Energy Directive of 2009 requires that, by 2020, 10% of transport fuels should come from renewable sources.  The Directive also provided that the ongoing effects of its implementation be monitored by the European Commission.  Following a number of studies on the Directive&rsquo;s effects, in October 2012 the Commission published a proposal to amend the Renewable Energy Directive and the Fuel Quality Directive.  The Commission included a proposal that foodcrop-based biofuels should, at most, comprise half of the 10% quota required to come from renewable energy sources.  This proposal, in conjunction with the incentives for advanced (next-generation) biofuels, signals the desire of the Commission to move towards the use of advanced biofuels made from feedstocks which do not compete with the production of food.  While Member States agree that the issue must be addressed, it remains an extremely complex matter, and agreement has not yet been reached on the 5% cap.  A progress report was submitted for the meetings of the Energy and Environment Councils in June 2013, and negotiations are continuing.</p></reply>

Most military drones do not carry weapons and are used mainly for reconnaissance purposes. Under international law, there is no prohibition on drones as such.  Their use in armed conflict is subject to international humanitarian law.   This sets specific requirements in relation to the use of force in armed conflict, including the principles of necessity, proportionality and distinction.  I am deeply concerned about any indiscriminate use of drones which would clearly be contrary to international law, and by instances where innocent civilians have been killed by attacks using drones.</p><p> Outside of an armed conflict situation, international human rights law applies.  Along with our EU partners, Ireland strongly condemns extra-judicial killings.  Not only are these contrary to international human rights law, but they undermine the concept of the rule of law, which is a key element in the fight against terrorism.  This applies regardless of the means used.  The EU has consistently argued the case internationally that combating terrorism must be conducted in full compliance with and respect for international law, in particular the law of armed conflict and human rights law. In line with the UN Global Strategy on Counter Terrorism, the EU believes that effective counter terrorism and the protection and promotion of human rights are mutually reinforcing and not competing goals.</p></reply>

EU Foreign Ministers will again discuss the situation in the DRC on 22 July and will assess recent progress to secure a durable solution to the crisis.  In particular we will consider ways to further support the 'Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework Agreement for the DRC and the Region', which was concluded in Addis Ababa on 24 February, and also the work of Mary Robinson, the UN Secretary General's Special Envoy with responsibility for overseeing implementation of the Agreement.  The European Union will continue to pursue a strategic and comprehensive approach to the crisis, working through political and diplomatic engagement, development cooperation programmes, and support for the United Nations peacekeeping operations.</p><p>  Ireland will also continue to play a constructive role.  So far in 2013, Ireland has provided &euro;3.8 million in response to the humanitarian crisis in the DRC, which brings our emergency and longer-term development funding for the DRC since 2009 to more than &euro;42 million.  We have also funded two recent high level events in support of mediation efforts with the involvement of Special Envoy Robinson.  Moreover, we are also contributing a number of military observers to the UN peacekeeping mission.  Ireland has raised the human rights situation in the DRC at the Human Rights Council on a number of occasions, including at the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> sessions in September 2011 and March 2012 respectively.  At the 22<sup>nd</sup> and 23<sup>rd</sup>   sessions, Ireland delivered strong statements on the DRC on behalf of the EU in our Presidency capacity.  These statements focused on the continuing human rights violations in the east of the DRC, and stressed the importance of the Framework Agreement in tackling the deep-rooted issues of impunity, governance, and sexual violence.</p><p>  During the DRC's examination under the Universal Periodic Review in 2009, Ireland raised its concerns and made recommendations relating to the treatment of human rights defenders and the need for an independent mechanism to identify and take measures against members of the security forces responsible for grave human rights violations.  The DRC's next examination under the Universal Periodic Review is scheduled to take place in May 2014 and Ireland will again actively engage during that review.  Ireland will continue to monitor the human rights situation in the DRC closely and will use our membership of the Human Rights Council to raise issues of concern with regards to human rights abuses and violations as appropriate, including at the upcoming 24<sup>th</sup> session of the Council in September.</p></reply>

As a result the first &euro;100,000 of any claim in such cases is covered under the DGS.  The bond itself is not covered by the ELG scheme as it predates that scheme.  Credit unions and others affected have been advised to deal with the Special Liquidator in relation to this matter.</p><p>  On the issue of why these bonds did not transfer out of the bank, I understand that tracker bonds were specifically excluded from the Transfer Order due to the complex nature of those products which contain a variety of derivative elements.  As part of their regulatory requirements, credit unions are required to maintain realised reserves for the purpose of absorbing unexpected losses, including from unguaranteed losses.

To estimate the potential yield from a Stamp Duty on probate, one would need to identify the value of all estates in probate, which is not possible from the data available at present.  I am advised by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, that probate is a legal process whereby a grant of representation is issued by the High Court Probate Office or District Probate Registry in respect of a deceased person's estate.  The grant of representation gives legal authority to a person or persons to access the estate and administer it in accordance with the law.  The Probate Office is an office of the High Court and management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions under the Courts Service Act 1998.</p><p>  Where a Grant of Representation in a deceased person&rsquo;s estate is extracted, it is subject to a Court Fee.  The Court Fee in question is calculated in accordance with the Supreme and High Court (Fees) Order (S.I. 239 of 2013) and is assessed on the basis of the value of the net estate of the deceased person.  The Courts Service has advised that in 2012 fees of &euro;1,860,967 were collected in respect of applications to the High Court Probate Office for Grants of Probate and administration.  Details of the fee income collected in the 14 District Probate Registries are not readily available.</p><p>  A Probate Tax on estates was introduced by Finance Act 1993.  The tax treated the estate of a deceased person as an inheritance taken by the executors or administrators of the estate.  The net estate &ndash; that is, the assets of the deceased valued at the date of death, less liabilities at the date of death and reasonable funeral expenses &ndash; was deemed to be an inheritance taken by the executors or administrators.  The rate of Probate Tax applied to the net estate was 2%.  One of the main difficulties with Probate Tax was that it had to be paid prior to the grant of probate or administration.  As funds in an estate cannot be released until after the grant, the imposition of probate tax placed a severe cash-flow burden on executors or administrators of estates who, if other funds were not available, had to arrange borrowings to discharge the liability.  In many cases, this caused hardship for estates that had no liquid assets and where sales of property took time.  Probate Tax was abolished by Finance Act 2001.</p><p>  Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) was introduced in 1976 and includes both gift tax and inheritance tax.  CAT is an acquisitions tax that imposes a tax charge on individuals after they receive gifts or inheritances.  The charge arises at a time when the person is in a position to pay the CAT on the gift or on the inheritance, because s/he is in possession of the benefit received.  CAT is therefore considered a more appropriate form of taxation of inheritances.  I do not intend to reintroduce a Probate Tax on estates or a Stamp Duty on probate.  However the Deputies may be aware that the rate of CAT on inheritances has been increased from 20% in 1999 to the current rate of 33%, and the tax-free thresholds have been considerably reduced since 2009.</p></reply>

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit.    Payments that are made under the Social Welfare Acts are and have always been specifically excluded from liability to USC. Accordingly, all State contributory and non-contributory pensions are exempt from the charge.  I would also draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the fact that certain payments, which are of a similar character to social welfare payments, are also exempt from universal social charge. A list of such payments is included at Appendix A, page 49, of the FAQs relating to the universal social charge published by the Revenue Commissioners and available at http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/usc/universal-social-charge-faqs.pdf.</p><p>  To estimate the potential yield from applying the USC to non-means tested State Pensions i.e. the contributory State Pension and the State Pension (Transition) it would be necessary to identify certain details in respect of each recipient of social protection payments such as the individual amount of these payments received, the amount of any other income potentially liable to USC, the age of each individual and whether there was an entitlement to a medical card etc.  This information would be essential to determine what rate of USC would apply at an individual level.  It is possible that in many cases the rate would be low. </p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that as they do hold or have access to the required information set out above, there is no basis on which an estimate of the yield from the change mentioned in the question could be compiled.  However, by way of illustration, if for example, a 1 per cent levy was imposed on social protection contributory State Pensions and the State Pension (Transition) the full year yield to the Exchequer would be &euro;41 million on the basis that the estimated provision for such payments in 2013 is approximately &euro;4.1 billion. The estimate of Exchequer yield assumes that there is no exemption threshold, allowance or personal reliefs that could be used to offset against the levy.</p></reply>

However, by making certain assumptions about the available information, it is estimated that the full-year yield to the Exchequer from confining tax relief to the standard rate of 20% in respect of pension contributions to occupational pension schemes, retirement annuity contracts and personal retirement savings accounts and confining tax relief for the Public Service pension related deduction to the standard rate of 20% would be approximately &euro;560 million.  This estimate includes &euro;90 million in respect of the Public Service pension related deduction.</p><p>This estimate does not allow for possible behavioural changes that could arise from a change in the rate of relief.</p><p><b>2008</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Estimate of the cost of certain tax reliefs for private pension provision </th><th>Estimated costs<br />&euro; million</th><th>Numbers<br />availing</th></tr><tr><td>Employees' Contributions to approved Superannuation Schemes</td><td>655</td><td>792,600</td></tr><tr><td>Employers' Contributions to approved Superannuation Schemes</td><td>165</td><td>362,700</td></tr><tr><td>Estimated cost of exemption of employers' contributions from employee BIK</td><td>595</td><td>362,700</td></tr><tr><td>Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs)</td><td>353</td><td>116,000</td></tr><tr><td>Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs)</td><td>74</td><td>53,900</td></tr><tr><td>Estimated cost of PRSI and Health Levy relief on employee contributions</td><td>255</td><td>Not available</td></tr></table></p><p><b>2009</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Estimate of the cost of certain tax reliefs for private pension provision </th><th>Estimated costs<br />&euro; million</th><th>Numbers<br />availing</th></tr><tr><td>Employees' Contributions to approved Superannuation Schemes</td><td>730</td><td>713,600</td></tr><tr><td>Employers' Contributions to approved Superannuation Schemes</td><td>155</td><td>342,200</td></tr><tr><td>Estimated cost of exemption of employers' contributions from employee BIK</td><td>560</td><td>342,200</td></tr><tr><td>Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs)</td><td>237</td><td>101,300</td></tr><tr><td>Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs)</td><td>77</td><td>56,200</td></tr><tr><td>Estimated cost of PRSI and Health Levy relief on employee contributions</td><td>230</td><td>Not available<br /></td></tr></table></p><p><b>2010</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Estimate of the cost of certain tax reliefs for private pension provision </th><th>Estimated costs<br />&euro; million</th><th>Numbers<br />availing</th></tr><tr><td>Employees' Contributions to approved Superannuation Schemes</td><td>600</td><td>625,100</td></tr><tr><td>Employers' Contributions to approved Superannuation Schemes</td><td>140</td><td>302,900</td></tr><tr><td>Estimated cost of exemption of employers' contributions from employee BIK</td><td>515</td><td>302,900</td></tr><tr><td>Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs)</td><td>180</td><td>82,200</td></tr><tr><td>Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs)</td><td>73</td><td>52,300</td></tr><tr><td>Estimated cost of PRSI and Health Levy relief on employee contributions</td><td>230</td><td>Not available</td></tr></table></p></reply>

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have no specialised knowledge of nationwide land values apart from land that is part of transactions for Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT), Capital Gains Tax (CGT) and Stamp Duty purposes.  Using the figures supplied by the Deputy, a charge of &euro;10 per hectare on 4.6 million agricultural hectares and 750,000 forestry hectares, a total of 5.35 million hectares, would have a potential yield of &euro;53.5 million, assuming no reliefs or exemptions and full compliance with the tax.  A flat tax on land as outlined by the Deputy does not take into account the market value or quality of the land in question.  It would apply to poor land with a lower market value and to forestry holdings at the same rate per hectare as to top quality arable land in productive areas.</p><p>  CAT, CGT and Stamp Duty apply in different circumstances to transfers of land.   These rates of CAT and CGT have increased in recent years and the tax-free thresholds for CAT have been significantly reduced.  Although the rates of Stamp Duty on property transactions have reduced, many exemptions and reliefs from Stamp Duty have been abolished.  The market value of property is taken into account in all three taxes.  I have no plans to introduce a flat tax on agricultural land and land under forestry.</p></reply>

This package is designed to help put the Greek economy on a path to sustainable growth and its domestic finances on a sound footing.  This package was agreed in the context of the statement by Euro Area Heads of State or Government that the scale of the Greek problem is so large that it requires special attention.  </p><p>  One of the measures agreed in November, the Securities Market Programme (SMP) measure, will see Member States pass on, to Greece's segregated account, an amount equivalent to the income on the SMP portfolio accruing to their national central bank as from budget year 2013.  Member States under a full financial assistance programme, such as Ireland, are not required to participate in this scheme for the period in which they receive financial assistance. </p><p>  It is important to note that the concessions that have been agreed are specific to Greece and are accompanied by significant additional conditionality, and must be seen in the context of the very significant debt restructuring that has taken place in the Greek programme. </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s needs, as a country close to exiting a programme, are very different to those of Greece. </p><p>  We have, during 2013, returned to the international debt markets.  Taking account of our efforts and delivery on our commitments, our spreads have considerably reduced and the interest cost of our official financing has, through sustained effort by Ireland, been significantly reduced.  We continue to work with the Troika and other Member States, but we do not see the SMP measure agreed for Greece as appropriate in our case. </p></reply>

A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits. Chargeable capital gains are taxable at the capital gains tax rate of 33%.   There are different ways of measuring the effective rate of corporation tax depending on the variables that are used.  As there is no such single internationally agreed methodology to calculate the effective rate of corporation tax, there is no reliable basis upon which to calculate the current 'effective rate' of corporate tax in Ireland without being potentially misleading.  </p><p>  Therefore, neither I, nor my Department, would be in a position to introduce a minimum 'effective rate' in Ireland in the way the Deputy has suggested.</p><p>  To illustrate the debate on the topic, I have previously referred to an estimate from a report produced by the World Bank and PriceWaterhouseCoopers which put the effective rate in Ireland at 11.9% (<i>Paying Taxes, 2013</i>).  I also referred to a study by the European Commission (<i>Taxation Trends in the EU 2011</i>), which indicates Ireland has an effective corporate tax rate which is close to or indeed higher than the statutory 12.5% rate (this is likely because of the 25% rate that applies generally to non-trading income).</p><p>  I have been clear that my Department does not take ownership of these reports, but they do indicate that the 'effective' rate of tax paid by companies in Ireland is already much higher than the 6% minimum 'effective' rate the Deputy suggests.</p><p>  Some other countries have a high headline rate of corporation tax which is then supplemented by a high number of tax reliefs which reduce the overall rate of tax paid.  By contrast, the approach in Ireland is transparent: we have a competitive headline rate of corporation tax which is applied to a broad base.  </p><p>  We therefore have only a small number of tax incentives in Ireland, and we make sure that those we do have are specifically targeted.  They are focused firstly, on the creation of additional employment as is consistent with current Government policy, and secondly on areas of innovation with a view to generating high value-added economic activity in the country.  The small number of reliefs we have include, for example, the R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit and the 3 year exemption from corporation tax for start-up companies.</p></reply>

The maximum rate of charge for such individuals was 4% irrespective of the level of their income, unless they had self-employment income in excess of &euro;100,000 for a tax year, in which case the maximum rate was increased to 7% on the amount of income in excess of &euro;100,000.

Revenue currently operates two purpose-built patrol craft (Revenue Customs Cutters), RCC &quot;SUIRBH&Eacute;IR&quot; in service since 2004 and RCC &quot;FAIRE&quot; in service since 2009.  Both craft, operated by appropriately qualified officers from Revenue's Customs service, are capable of extended patrols right around the Irish Coastline and adjacent waters.  The primary aim of coastal activity is to prevent, detect and deter smuggling and illegal importation of controlled drugs and other goods.  It involves co-operation between land-based Revenue and Garda&iacute;, the Maritime Unit and the Navy, and of course international authorities.  The Revenue Maritime Unit completes the range of responses now regarded as standard in international anti-smuggling activities.  </p><p>  Regarding recent activity, for operational reasons specific details of the Cutter activities is not made public.   </p><p>  The range of cutter activities mirrors that of land based customs officers and includes:</p><p>- Patrol of the external frontier to outer limits of Territorial Sea (12 mile limit).</p><p>- Monitoring (overt &amp;amp; covert) all vessel movements - Assess, Board, Rummage as required.</p><p>- Enforcement of import and export prohibitions and restrictions.</p><p>- Identification and securing of outstanding VAT/duty liability on pleasure craft.</p><p>- Information/Intelligence management.</p><p>- International anti-smuggling operations at sea.</p><p>- Managing and monitoring maritime information systems . </p><p>- Servicing national and international M.O.U.s and Mutual Assistance requests.</p><p>- Supporting national anti-smuggling operations.</p><p>- Developing and servicing coastal contacts (Customs Drugs Watch Programme).</p><p>- eParticipating in marine search &amp;amp; rescue.</p><p>  Cutter operations are risk-led, so they tend to be most often deployed where intelligence suggests a need, either on their own or in conjunction with other national and international agencies.  It is also important however to ensure that there is a visible presence in all parts of the country, and cutters are based in Dublin, East Coast, and North West for extended periods as well as in their &quot;home&quot; base in the South West - traditionally the highest risk area for transatlantic drug smuggling.  In addition, the cutters participate in a limited number of public events and maritime festivals to build public awareness of the Customs Drugs Watch programme.</p><p>  Each cutter has a crew of six, and is at sea for more then 200 days per annum, with 24/7/365 availability.  Each cutter carries a rigid inflatable (RIB) which can be launched at sea to enable boarding.  They are also equipped with the latest radar, satellite monitoring and communications equipment, and have constant access to Revenue and other enforcement agency databases.  </p><p>  As an island nation the provision of customs cutters to police our maritime frontiers is regarded as an essential investment.  The cost and adequacy of the present level of provision is continually reviewed.  For the moment, I am satisfied that Revenue has an effective service at reasonable cost, that meets the foreseeable needs.</p></reply>

These persons paid a total of &euro;2,319,768 in domicile levy for that tax year.  The year 2011 is the latest year for which figures are available.  Domicile Levy returns for the year 2011 were due by 31 October 2012 or 15 November 2012 (for ROS electronic filers).  This represents an increase of &euro;674,439 in the total amount of levy paid and four to the number of persons who have paid the levy since figures were last provided to the House on foot of Parliamentary Question 51696 of 2012, from Deputy Nash,<b></b>regarding the Domicile Levy on 21 November 2012.  Based on figures available to that date in 2012, ten persons had submitted returns declaring a liability in respect of the Domicile Levy for the tax year 2011 and had paid a total of &euro;1,645,329.  <b></b></p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners are currently undertaking a compliance programme on the Domicile Levy.  Inquiries are being made in a number of cases where a Domicile Levy return has not been filed and the person concerned has been identified by Revenue as having a possible requirement to file such a return.  Where Revenue identifies a liability to the Domicile Levy that has not been paid, the full levy, interest and the appropriate penalty will be sought.  Initial Domicile Levy inquiries have issued to 33 persons.  This number should increase as the programme proceeds. </p><p>  As the Domicile Levy is a self-assessment tax, with the onus on the taxpayer to declare their liability, it is not possible for Revenue to provide any estimate of the total domicile levy yield if all persons liable to pay the levy were to pay in full.  However, following finalisation of the current compliance programme and depending on the level of non-compliance uncovered, it may be possible for Revenue to provide additional information and/or estimates on the level of compliance with the levy.          </p><p>  I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that 13,093 persons filed income tax returns for 2011 and indicated they were non-resident for income tax purposes for that year.  Again, 2011 is the most recent year in respect of which this information is available. </p><p>  The circumstances of individuals who are non-resident for tax purposes but who file Irish tax returns can vary widely.  They include, for example:</p><p>- Irish nationals who have moved abroad for work reasons but who retain their home here (their tax return is generally only in respect of rental income on their Irish home);</p><p>- foreign nationals who never resided here but who have investments (including property) here;</p><p>- foreign nationals who worked here for a period and who may have acquired Irish tax residence for that period (for example, individuals who worked here on a temporary assignment) may retain an Irish tax liability, after ceasing to be resident, in respect of investments made in Ireland during their period of residence.</p><p>  Individuals who leave the State are not required to declare their reasons for leaving, on a tax return or any other document.

The EU holds regular talks on financial regulation with its key economic partners including the United States, Japan, China, India and Russia.  The EU and US also actively participate in the work of the Financial Stability Board.  The issue of financial services and financial regulation may be discussed in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) currently underway between the US and EU.  It is too early to anticipate if IBAN will feature in the eventual negotiated outcome of the Agreement.  <font color="#4F4F4F"> </font></p><p>  The IBAN uniquely identifies an individual account, at a specific financial institution, in a particular country.  The benefits of the IBAN system include quicker processing with lower risk of payment rejection.  Approximately 60 countries use IBAN format for account identification including the banks in all countries in the European Economic Area and many states in the Middle East, North Africa and Caribbean.  The United States of America is one of a number of countries that do not use IBAN at present.  There is no indication that the US will adopt the IBAN standard in the near future. </p></reply>

Under the new rules, the place of taxation for these services will shift from the Member State of the supplier to the Member State of the consumer, thereby ensuring that local VAT rates apply irrespective of the location of the supplier and that taxation will accrue to the Member State of the consumer. The new rules will be transposed into Irish law in 2014.    In December 2012, the European Commission published a proposal for an Implementing Regulation designed to ensure that the new rules are applied consistently across the Community. Having commenced discussions on the proposal, the Irish Presidency achieved political agreement on this dossier at the ECOFIN Council of 21 June 2013.  In addition to achieving consistency in the application of the new rules, this agreement will minimise the scope for non-taxation and double taxation of the services involved. Achieving early agreement on the dossier was important in allowing businesses sufficient time to prepare their accounting and IT systems for the changeover to the new rules in 2015.  </p></reply>

The capturing of such non-disposal income was not a common feature prior to NAMA&rsquo;s acquisition of the loans and NAMA has undertaken significant steps to design and implement new structures so as to achieve this objective. NAMA measures its performance on the extent to which it captures such non-disposal income on an on-going basis and not wholly on the extent to which a debtor is in compliance with the terms of legacy loan facility arrangements which predated NAMA. Despite NAMA selling over &euro;8 billion of assets to date it has maintained its weighted average cash flow loan performance at a stable level each quarter at over 30%.   The Deputy may wish to refer to the NAMA Quarterly (Section 55) Report and Accounts  for Quarter 1 2013, which were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas yesterday and which contain further detail on the performance of loans. The Section 55 Report and Accounts show a weighted average cash flow loan performance of 32%.  The Section 55 Report and Accounts show also that NAMA had generated cash receipts of &euro;11.2bn since inception to end-March 2013, of which &euro;7.2bn related to disposal activity and &euro;4bn to non-disposal and other income, mainly rental income.  These results are the most important measure of NAMA&rsquo;s performance and show the significant progress that it has made in its just over three years in existence.</p></reply>

It is important that the Exchequer should maintain a sufficiently strong cash position when the EU/IMF Programme comes to a conclusion at the end of the year, for reasons of prudence and to assure investors that they will be repaid upon redemption. The State is now well positioned to have 12 to 15 months of advance funding in place by that time. </p></reply>

While the immediate crisis that this Government inherited when it took office has been averted, it remains important for relationships between institutions to be developed and sustained, in order to allow for confidential negotiations to take place, especially on particularly sensitive issues. This is particularly the case in relation to the Irish authorities dealing with the ECB. It is normal practice for states to protect the confidentiality of these discussions, and in fact is usually enshrined in the rules of association of institutions.</p><p>  Indeed, this is reflected in the Freedom of Information Act, which provides for exemptions for records relating to, for example, information received in confidence, commercially sensitive information and the financial and economic interests of the state in sections 24, 26 and 31. These factors counterbalance the public interest, protecting the ability of the Government when negotiating or deliberating on matters of national importance. It is considered that release of the correspondence sought would impact on the integrity and viability of the decision-making process to a significant degree without a countervailing benefit to the public, and would prejudice our relationship with the ECB.</p></reply>

NTMA employees are members of the NTMA defined benefit superannuation scheme or else have Personal Retirement Savings Accounts. The pension benefits of members of the NTMA superannuation scheme prior to 1 January 2010 are based on final salary. The pension benefits of members who joined the scheme on or after 1 January 2010 are based on career average earnings.  Unlike most public pension schemes which are funded on a pay as you go basis, the NTMA superannuation scheme is a funded scheme. Pension entitlements are within the standard entitlements in the model public sector defined benefit superannuation scheme. Pension contributions are not paid to individual employees &ndash; they are paid into the scheme. The level of potential pension payments to members is dependent on length of service, based on final salary or career average earnings, with 1/80th of salary accruing for each year of service.</p></reply>

I am sure the staff will continue to work to ensure a satisfactory outcome for Irish taxpayers while they remain in employment under the liquidation process.     There are standard rules which apply to the distribution of the assets of companies in liquidation and it would not be appropriate for me to interfere with these rules.  Such interference could have the impact of diverting the assets of IBRC from one category of creditor to another outside the normal Companies Acts priorities.  Any such interference would be open to challenges in the Irish Courts by unsecured creditors.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, the State does intervene to ensure that statutory redundancy is available for IBRC staff through the Social Insurance Fund and that arrears of pay, sick pay, holiday pay or pay in lieu of statutory notice (limited to &euro;600 per week up to a maximum of eight weeks) are payable from the Insolvency Payments Scheme.</p><p>  I have been advised by the Special Liquidators that significant steps have already been taken to address staff concerns including the announcement the Special Liquidators that the majority of staff would be retained until March 2014 in order to provide for an orderly wind-down of the business.  This should provide some reassurance to IBRC staff relative to the common position in liquidations where staff contracts are terminated on liquidation. Furthermore, it is likely that some staff will, in time, gain employment by NAMA or other purchasers or servicers of the assets of IBRC.</p></reply>

NAMA is prohibited under Section 99 and 202 of the NAMA Act from disclosing confidential information, including in respect of individual debtor properties.  A full list of properties that are subject to enforcement, that is, where an insolvency practitioner has been appointed, is available on NAMA&rsquo;s website, www.nama.ie/about-our-work/properties-enforced/.  This listing is searchable by county.  Most of the loans acquired by NAMA from the Participating Institutions are secured on property.  NAMA&rsquo;s interest in this property and in the other assets underlying its loan portfolio is that of a lender holding security for its loan rather than that of an owner.  Individuals and groups who have an interest in a property that is under the control of a debtor or receiver are encouraged, therefore, to make contact with the owner of the property or the receiver, if one is in place.  They may copy their interest to NAMA at info@nama.ie and the Agency will work to facilitate engagement with their debtors/receivers and, where applicable, sales agents.  The Agency ensures that debtors and receivers are aware of any potential purchaser or lessee interest in their properties.  NAMA advises that this interest, including from charity and community groups, may often be aligned to the asset strategy identified through the business plan process.</p></reply>

However, in view of the fact that the three institutions continue to be loss making the timely delivery of such savings which will have an ongoing impact on the cost base is critical to their viability, the availability of credit to the economy and to the future employment prospects of their employees.</p></reply>

The level of rent qualifying for rent relief depends on an individual&rsquo;s marital status and age. In Budget 2011, it was announced that rent relief was being withdrawn on a phased basis.  No new claimants were allowed from 7 December 2010 but existing claimants will continue to receive the relief, on a reducing basis, with a complete cessation of the relief from 2018. This is in line with the schedule proposed for the withdrawal of mortgage interest relief.  The scheduled withdrawal of rent relief is set out in the following table:</p><p><table><tr><th>Tax Year</th><th>Reduction %</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>10% to 0%</td></tr></table></p><p>To phase out the remaining 60% of the relief over the next 3 years i.e. 2013 &ndash; 2015, would result in the following yields based on the 2010 costs of the scheme.

The full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to the tax year 2010, the latest year for which the necessary detailed information is available, is approximately &euro;1.3 million. However, this figure does not take account of the application of the high income individuals&rsquo; restriction to specified reliefs, which includes the artists' exemption and thus the actual yield could be lower. The restriction was originally provided for in Finance Act 2006 and was significantly tightened in Finance Act 2010. Individuals are now subject to the restriction where they have adjusted income of &euro;125,000 and claim specified tax reliefs of &euro;80,000 or more. Those subject to the full restriction now pay an effective income tax rate of 30% in addition to PRSI and Universal Social Charge.  In addition, it must be stressed that this estimate assumes no significant behavioural change on the part of the affected taxpayers. </p></reply>

The annual earnings cap acts, in conjunction with age-related percentage limits of annual earnings, to put a ceiling on the annual amount of tax relief an individual taxpayer can obtain on pension contributions.  A breakdown of the cost of tax relief on employee contributions to occupational pension schemes is not available by income tax rate, as tax returns by employers to the Revenue Commissioners of employee contributions to such schemes are aggregated at employer level.  An historical breakdown is available by tax rate of the tax relief claimed on contributions to personal pension plans &mdash; Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) &mdash; by the self-employed and others, to the extent that the contributions have been included in the personal tax returns of those taxpayers. There is, therefore, only a limited statistical basis for providing definitive figures.  However, by making certain assumptions about the available information, the Revenue Commissioners inform me that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer from reducing the current annual earnings cap of &euro;115,000 to the thresholds outlined in the question, and at the various specified marginal tax rates, in respect of individual contributions to occupational pension schemes, RACs and PRSAs would be as shown in the following table. These estimates take no account of any behavioural impacts which may arise from the proposed changes and which could effect the scale of any yield under the various scenarios outlined.</p><p><bu>Exchequer Yield</bu></p><p><b> Reduction in Relief Allowable at specified</b> <b>Marginal Tax Rates</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Reduced Earnings Cap <br />(below  &euro;115,000)  </th><th>-</th><th>-</th><th>-</th><th>-</th></tr><tr><td>&euro;</td><td>Current Rate</td><td>34%</td><td>30%</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;100,000</td><td>&euro;35m</td><td>&euro;155m</td><td>&euro;244m</td><td>&euro;490m</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;90,000</td><td>&euro;65m</td><td>&euro;165m</td><td>&euro;274m</td><td>&euro;510m</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;80,000</td><td>&euro;95m</td><td>&euro;210m</td><td>&euro;300m</td><td>&euro;535m</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;70,000</td><td>&euro;130m</td><td>&euro;240m</td><td>&euro;329m</td><td>&euro;555m</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;60,000</td><td>&euro;175m</td><td>&euro;265m</td><td>&euro;354m</td><td>&euro;580m</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Enforcement is an important tool to effect deterrence, achieve compliance and promote positive behaviour. The Central Bank will take enforcement action against regulated entities under its Probability Risk Impact Supervisory System (PRISM) supervisory model. PRISM represents a challenging and proportionate risk-based system of supervision for all financial institutions operating in Ireland.   During 2012, the Central Bank entered into 16 settlement agreements. The sanctions imposed included 16 fines, totalling &euro;8.5m, and 16 reprimands. The Central Bank took a total of 841 regulatory actions in 2012, an increase from 494 in 2011.

My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr Brendan Howlin T.D., and I met with the EU-IMF delegation during the 11th Review mission which is currently taking place (9 &ndash; 18 July). These meetings were also attended by senior officials from both Departments. A wide range of topics related to the progress of the Programme are covered at these meetings, including fiscal policy, financial reforms, structural reforms, and economic developments. Budget 2014 will be discussed in this context. Budget 2014 will be announced on the 15th of October 2013 and in the preceding weeks and months, as further information is available, Government policy on Budget 2014 measures will be finalised. I will not be drawn into speculation at this time, on the composition of the next budget.</p><p>  It should be noted that the most recent Programme Documents, dated June 2013, do not contain explicit requirements in relation to Budget 2014.  However, the EU Council Implementing Decision on Ireland&rsquo;s Programme of Financial Support, dated 7 December 2010, provides for the reduction of our General Government Deficit to below 3% in 2015 reflecting the Council&rsquo;s recommendation on Ireland&rsquo;s Excessive Deficit Procedure, of the same date, which sets out the path to achieve the deficit targets including 2014.</p></reply>

The purpose of the review is to assess the merits of creating a &ldquo;bad bank&rdquo; for some RBS assets and it is due to conclude in the autumn of 2013. The Chancellor made some references to Ulster Bank in the context of the future orientation of RBS in dealing with the future of the two UK banks in which the British Exchequer has a significant shareholding.  Last Friday, the UK Treasury announced the appointment of BlackRock Solutions as asset specialist advisor to the review. BlackRock Solutions will work alongside Rothschild and Slaughter &amp;amp; May, the respective corporate finance and legal advisors.</p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that RBS held an Investor Roundtable on Ulster Bank in London on 2 July 2013 during which Ulster Bank set out its business strategy and the macro-economic environment for Ireland. Ulster Bank described itself as the number three player in the Republic of Ireland with 1.3m customers- 1.26 m Retail and 80,000 Corporate. It informed investors that it has a clear strategy to create a &lsquo;Really Good Bank&rsquo; whilst tackling legacy issues; it intends to deliver a smaller, lower cost and profitable bank. Ulster Bank confirmed that it is &lsquo;cautiously optimistic&rsquo; about the Irish market. Data published at the end of June show that, having returned to growth in 2011, Ireland achieved a second successive year of growth in 2012, with GDP expanding modestly by 0.2 per cent. Ulster Bank is correct in seeing that Ireland is a place where the banking sector can expect to achieve returns which are acceptable to investors. </p><p>  The recent successful launch by BlueBay Asset Management LLP (BlueBay) and the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) of a new vehicle that will provide loans to larger SMEs and mid-sized businesses in Ireland also shows that positive sentiment has returned. The new vehicle has raised the full target amount of &euro;450 million (including an NPRF commitment of &euro;200 million) and has launched within the expected timescale. The very significant level of investment from third-party institutional investors is at the upper end of the range anticipated by BlueBay and the NPRF.</p><p>  Normal ongoing engagement between my officials and their UK counterparts now includes the possible implications of the review for Ulster Bank and any assistance that the Treasury requires with the review will be provided as part of this engagement.</p></reply>

The appointment of rent receivers to properties is a day-to-day operational decision for the Boards and Management teams of the covered institutions.  The covered institutions have provided me with the following details regarding their use of rent receivers. </p><p><b>PTSB</b></p><p><b>- Permanent tsb</b> has appointed 3 Receivers of Rent (Receiver) year to date in respect of Buy-to-Let (BTL) properties. </p><p>  - 74 BTL properties (on 52 accounts) have been affected by this appointment year to date. </p><p>  - The bank's Receiver Strategy for its BTL portfolio is centred on a case by case analysis. Appointments are made where it is deemed to be the most appropriate outcome for both the customer and the bank. The appointment of a Receiver is currently pending on 3 BTL properties (3 accounts). </p><p>  - A Receiver is appointed by the bank and operates as an agent of the borrower, assuming the role of property landlord in many respects. The Receiver collects rent from the tenant(s) and passes it to the bank, together with attending to any property related issues the tenant may have (in accordance with the Lease Agreement). The appointment of a Receiver should not negatively impact the tenant(s) as the Receiver effectively steps into the shoes of the landlord. The appointment is more likely than not to benefit a tenant as maintenance issues/concerns are more likely to be attended to in a timely manner. </p><p><b>AIB</b></p><p>  In the year to date 2013, the number of rent receivers appointed by AIB in respect of buy-to-let properties is in the low single digits. The number of properties affected by these appointments is not tracked as rent receivers are appointed at a customer level rather than on a property basis.</p><p><b>BOI</b></p><p>  In our 2012 Annual Report we disclosed a number of 1,100 rent receiver cases.  This included formal appointments in place and appointments pending at end December 2012. We will give a market update on numbers at the time of release of our interims. </p><p>  The receiver notifies the tenant of their appointment and requirement to pay rent to the receiver.</p><p>  - Any issues relating to the property, e.g. repairs will be dealt with by the receiver.</p><p>  - The tenant is not required to leave the property unless the minimum notice period based on their rights as tenants has been provided.</p><p><i>- The main impact on a tenant is that they pay their rent to the receiver and not to the landlord. The receiver will write to them to make that clear. In general the rights of the tenant under his or her lease and under legislation are not affected</i>.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the Central Bank decided to defer its examination but will keep this decision under review. Given the seriousness and sensitivity of criminal proceedings and the strength of the sanctions available to the Garda&iacute; and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE), this is the most appropriate approach to take where there is a reasonable possibility of multiple proceedings. Regular liaison with these agencies is continuing. In addition to the above, the Central Bank is carefully studying the various transcripts emerging recently in the national media. This is something that is viewed very seriously. The Central Bank is liaising with the Garda&iacute; in this regard and is also examining whether or not any breaches of regulatory requirements may have occurred arising from the information contained in the transcripts.</p><p><i>Irish Nationwide Building Society</i></p><p>  The Central Bank has advised that an investigation into historical lending practices at the INBS is at an advanced stage and, once concluded, decisions regarding any possible future enforcement proceedings will be made.</p><p><i>Quinn Insurance Limited</i></p><p>  As noted in the Central Bank's Annual Report for 2012, an investigation into certain matters within Quinn Insurance Limited is continuing.</p><p>  For legal reasons, including the Bank's confidentiality obligations pursuant to section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942, no further details can be disclosed at present.</p></reply>

One of the regulations is on the monitoring and assessment of draft budgetary plans and on ensuring the correction of excessive deficits. The other is on the strengthening of economic and budgetary surveillance and sets out explicit rules for enhanced surveillance of countries experiencing or threatened with financial difficulties (Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on the strengthening of economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States in the euro area experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability).<b><font color="#0000FF">  </font></b>The &#8220;Two-Pack&#8221; represents a significant and welcome enhancement of the euro area's economic governance regime. It is, to a great extent, a natural extension of the measures contained in the 'Six-Pack' which was introduced on 13 December, 2011. The 'Six-Pack' - comprising five regulations and one directive - was designed to reform and strengthen fiscal surveillance under the <i>Stability and Growth Pact</i> and to introduce new macroeconomic surveillance. </p><p>  The 'Two-Pack' is applicable to euro area member countries only. </p><p>  The surveillance regulation provides for surveillance under a number of circumstances - specifically - where a Member State is experiencing severe difficulties with regard to its financial stability and where this is likely to have adverse spillover effect on other Member States, where a member state is in a macroeconomic adjustment programme, and also post programme surveillance. There are specific features attaching to each of these.  </p><p>  Under the regulation, a post-programme surveillance process will be put in place and maintained for a member country until the balance outstanding under EU-sourced financial assistance falls below 25% of the total. This covers all EU funding sources, including bilateral loans.  It also provides that the Commission shall conduct, in liaison with the ECB, regular review missions in the Member State under post-programme surveillance to assess its economic, fiscal and financial situation. </p><p>  The Regulation provides that the reports generated following such missions shall be considered by the European Council which - acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission - may recommend to the Member State concerned to adopt corrective measures.  </p><p>  Post programme surveillance is a normal feature of IMF assistance programmes, and the new EU regulation provides for a similar arrangement for euro area member states in a post-programme situation.  </p></reply>

These are matters for consideration by my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p><p>  There is a special tax regime applicable to discretionary trusts which, depending on the circumstances, can include an initial discretionary trust tax levy of 6% and an annual levy of 1% of the value of the property subject to a discretionary trust. In addition, income tax and capital gains tax may arise on income and gains arising to the trustees of a discretionary trust.  There would be practical difficulties in designing an equitable basis for taxing the beneficiaries of many discretionary trusts.  This is because specific beneficiaries may not be identified in all cases, since the trustees may have discretion as to which specific beneficiaries out of a class of beneficiaries will benefit from the trust.</p><p>  Should it be brought to my attention that further measures are required to counter any particular unacceptable features of discretionary trusts, or to strengthen the powers of the Revenue Commissioners to obtain information in relation to the operation of discretionary trusts, I will consider the matter. </p></reply>

Lump sum amounts up to &euro;200,000 are paid free of tax. They are also paid free of USC. The portion of a lump sum between &euro;200,001 and &euro;575,000 is taxed on a ring-fenced basis at 20%. This means that no tax credits or other tax reliefs can be set against this portion of the lump sum. No USC is chargeable. Any amount of a lump sum in excess of &euro;575,000 is taxed at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate of tax (credits and other tax reliefs are available). In this instance, USC is chargeable on the excess. These amounts are lifetime amounts with prior lump sums aggregating with later lump sums. </p><p>  Based on certain assumptions the average annual industrial wage is estimated at about &euro;31,500 in 2012. As there is no general requirement for data on retirement lump sums of less than &euro;200,000 to be returned to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners, I am not in a position to provide definitive figures on the Exchequer impact of reducing the tax-free retirement lump sum amount from &euro;200,000 to &euro;31,500, &euro;80,000 or &euro;100,000. Furthermore, details of the marginal rate of income tax an individual would pay on a taxable lump sum pension payment in the scenario outlined in the Deputy&rsquo;s question are not available.</p><p>  Based on broad assumptions and an extrapolation of certain available data in relation to the public service, it is estimated that the additional tax yield from taxing lump sums of &euro;31,500 and over at the higher income tax rate of 41% could be about &euro;100 million in a full year. </p><p>  Similarly, it is estimated that the additional tax yield from taxing lump sums of &euro;80,000 and over at 41% could be about &euro;20 million in a full year. </p><p>  Finally, it is estimated that the additional tax yield from taxing lump sums of &euro;100,000 and over at 41% could be about &euro;10 million in a full year. </p><p>  I have no data on which to provide a similar estimate in relation to the private sector. I should point out, however, that one significant difference between public sector and private sector pension schemes is that private sector schemes invariably allow scheme members the option of commuting part of their pension fund for a tax-free lump sum. The option of receiving benefits in the form of pension only is not available to members of public sector schemes. Depending on the impact of any new tax charge on retirement lump sums, the option to commute part of a pension fund may no longer be exercised by private sector pension scheme members or may be exercised in a manner that reduces the value of the lump sum taken to minimise or avoid any immediate tax charge.</p></reply>

In the previous Budget I announced that the Minister for Social Protection, Ms. Joan Burton, T.D., would be bringing forward legislation to change PRSI contributions as follows:   </p><p>- Where modified PRSI rate payers have income from a trade or profession, such income and any unearned income they have will be made subject to PRSI with effect from the <i>1st of January 2013</i>.</p><p>- Unearned income for everyone else will become subject to PRSI in <i>2014</i>. This means that PRSI will be payable on income generated from sources such as rent, investments, dividends and interest on deposits and savings. </p><p>  This means that from this year, modified rate contributors who have income from a profession or trade and who were previously not liable to PRSI on that income, are now liable to PRSI at 4% on such income. From next year, all assessed taxpayers, that is, taxpayers who are in the self-assessment system, will be liable to PRSI on their full incomes including rental income, investment income, dividends and interest on deposits and savings. </p><p>  I should point out that PRSI is a matter for the Department of Social Protection in the first instance.  However, it is my understanding that; in general, social insurance applies to persons over the age of 16 years and under pensionable age, which is currently age 66 years.   </p><p>  Those aged 66 years and over are not liable to pay PRSI on any of their income including their unearned income.  Accordingly those over 66 years will not be impacted by the proposal to apply PRSI to unearned income such as interest on savings, shares and rents.</p><p>  It should be noted that the Revenue Commissioners have published a guide to the income tax treatment of rental income.  It sets out the amount of rental income to be taken into account of for income tax purposes and provides a comprehensive list of expenditure items that are allowable for deduction in computing the rental income for income tax purposes, which can be obtained at the following link:  <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i><font color="#0000FF">.</font></p></reply>

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit.</p><p>  There are certain exemptions and reliefs from the USC. For example, persons in receipt of a payment from the Department of Social Protection such as the contributory and non-contributory state pension are exempt from the charge. There are also concessions for medical card holders and persons aged 70 or over who are not liable to the top rate of charge if their income does not exceed &euro;60,000 per annum.  In addition, payments from the Department of Social Protection will not be taken into account in determining if an individual has exceeded the &euro;60,000 threshold. </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, delivering on a commitment in the Programme for Government, the USC was reviewed by the Department of Finance in the lead up to Budget 2012. The report is available at www.finance.gov.ie. As a result of the review of the USC, the Government decided in Budget 2012 to increase the entry point to the Universal Social Charge from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum. It is estimated that this removed almost 330,000 individuals from the charge.  </p><p>  Finally, I would point the Deputy to the Revenue Commissioners published document entitled &#8220;Universal Social Charge FAQs&#8221; which gives a comprehensive list of the incomes streams which are exempt from the USC and is available at  .</p></reply>

The marginal rate for each of these levies was 6% and 5%, respectively, or 11% in total.  The marginal rate for the USC was 7%.  Taken in isolation the introduction of the USC, therefore, would have had the effect of reducing by 4 percentage points the top marginal tax rates for both PAYE and self-employed income earners paying at those rates.  At the same time, the PRSI ceiling for PAYE taxpayers, which then stood at &euro;75,036, was abolished which had the result of increasing by 4 percentage points the top marginal tax rate for PAYE taxpayers.  So the two changes - the introduction of the USC and the abolition of the PRSI ceiling-taken together meant that the marginal tax rate for PAYE taxpayers remained unchanged.</p><p>  In the case of the self-employed, the PRSI income ceiling for the self-employed had been abolished in Budget 2001.  Therefore, without further change, the introduction of the USC would have reduced the top marginal rate for these taxpayers by 4 percentage points and would have had the unintended effect of benefiting high earning self-employed income earners, resulting in some high earning self-employed income earners actually making a gain from Budget 2011 in comparison to all other taxpayers.    </p><p>  To avoid the situation in which the top marginal rate for PAYE taxpayers remained unchanged while self-employed taxpayers benefited from a reduction of that rate by 4 percentage points, two further changes were made. A higher rate of USC of 10% was introduced for the self-employed in respect of income in excess of &euro;100,000 and an additional 1 percentage point was added to the self-employed PRSI rate.  This restored the self-employed top marginal tax rate to 55%, (41% income tax, 7% USC, an additional 3% USC on income over &euro;100,000 and 4% PRSI).</p><p>  Note (i): the 'marginal' rate of tax equates to the top rate of tax which an individual is paying.</p><p>  Note (ii): the 10% rate of USC only applies to income over &euro;100,000.

The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of the budget.</p><p>  At post primary level and in order to promote fairness in funding second level schools, a two-point increase in the pupil teacher ratio in fee-charging second level schools will be introduced in September 2013. There are currently 55 schools out of 723 post-primary schools charging fees ranging from &euro;2,550 to &euro;10,065 for day pupils.</p><p>  At present, the State pays the salaries of one teacher for every 21 pupils in these schools compared with one teacher for every 19 pupils in schools in the free education scheme. A ratio of 18.25 pupils to one teacher, applies in DEIS schools. This will rise to 23:1 in fee-charging schools from September 2013.</p><p>  However, these schools have the resources, through fees charged, to employ teachers privately, an option which is not available to schools in the free education scheme. A report on the analysis of the tuition income of fee-charging schools carried out by the Department was recently published and shows that the schools in question have &euro;81m in discretionary income that schools in the free scheme do not have.</p><p>  It is important to note that the report does not contain any policy proposals at this stage. However, even after the Budget changes are implemented, the discretionary income available to these schools will still be quite considerable.</p><p>  There are some concerns within the Church of Ireland community on the recent budget measure affecting fee-charging schools. This Government recognises the importance of ensuring that students from a Protestant or Reformed church background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos while at the same time ensuring that funding arrangements are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.</p><p>  How best to sustain education provision for widely dispersed and small local communities does present as a particular challenge, especially in any locality where enrolment is declining to single figures. The Government is intent in fostering pluralism in school provision. Supporting small communities including minorities in maintaining their schools is part of that policy.</p><p>  With regard to the fee-charging Protestant schools, an arrangement exists whereby funding is provided by my Department to the Secondary Education Committee (SEC), an organisation run by the churches involved in managing the Protestant secondary schools. The SEC then disburses funds to the Protestant fee-charging schools on behalf of pupils who would otherwise have difficulty with the cost of fees and who, in the absence of such financial support, would be unable to attend a second level school of a reformed church or Protestant ethos. Funding amounts to &euro;6.5 million annually. This fund ensures that necessitous Protestant children can attend a school of their choice.</p></reply>

My Department also provides for a July Programme for pupils with a severe/profound general learning disability. Where school based provision is not feasible, home based provision may be grant aided.</p><p>  The allocation of home based provision to siblings for July Provision is reflective of the school grouping principle. This is where one teacher is allocated to a class of six pupils at the appropriate educational level, primary or post primary. Accordingly it is considered appropriate, as in a school situation, that a tutor can provide tuition at the appropriate educational level to more than one sibling at that level simultaneously in the home. The school grouping principle does not purport to replicate or mirror all aspects of school based provision. The age or ability of siblings is reflected in their education level as determined by education and health professionals. In general where a child is receiving their education in a class setting with other children of mixed age and ability, this should carry through to their July Provision.</p><p>  However in recognition of the differing needs of some siblings, separate allocations are considered on a case by case basis. Applications in this regard require supporting documentation including professional reports from a psychologist or a letter from the principal of the school detailing the existing arrangements currently in place for the respective children and providing reasons why they cannot be tutored together in the home. Therefore there is no maximum number of siblings that will be required to share home based tuition.</p><p>  Parents who are experiencing difficulties in sourcing a fully qualified teacher have been advised to contact the officials dealing with their allocation as tutors with alternative qualifications and experience may be accepted in some instances, as has been the practice in previous years. Although the timeframe is short my officials have endeavoured to process any appeals or queries on tutor qualifications expeditiously.  The Deputy may be aware that I recently requested the NCSE to prepare Policy Advice on the Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.   A wide consultation process will be a feature of the preparation of the advice and I have specifically requested the NCSE to consult widely with parents, professionals and other stakeholders and interested parties.  The NCSE has commissioned research which will also inform much of the work in preparing the policy advice.  It is expected that their report will be finalised in early 2015. </p></reply>

I can assure the Deputy that my Department's IT Unit is constantly assessing next generation technologies, relevant to this organisation.</p><p>  Examples of current and recent projects include: Bandwidth improvements to the telecommunications infrastructure between my Department's main offices in Dublin, Athlone and Tullamore, has facilitated the replacement last year, of an ageing telephone system, with a Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) system.  Increased bandwidth has also been rolled out to my Department's 31 local/regional offices; A major PC upgrade programme is currently underway, in the three main offices, along with an upgrade to Windows 7, Microsoft Office 2013 and rollout of Unified Communications; A major project to upgrade the hardware (servers and Storage Area Network) and database software architecture underlying the Department's main datasets has just commenced; Work is ongoing on the development of PPOD (Post-Primary Online Data), an online application to facilitate the updating of post-primary pupil and school data.  This application will be rolled out to all Post-Primary schools in late 2013; My Department launched its redeveloped website in mid-2012.  This website includes a map-based find-a-school feature, improved search facilities and has since been enhanced to facilitate video, social media and surveys, such as school patronage etc.; An online application to facilitate Primary Schools submitting aggregate literacy and numeracy data was also implemented in late 2012; Business Intelligence solutions have been implemented on a number of existing datasets, for some business areas and work is continuing to broaden its use.</p><p>  Many of the above projects were included in the Department's ICT Strategy for the period 2011-2013.  Work is commencing on the development of the subsequent ICT Strategy for the period 2014-2016.  This strategy will take account of next generation technologies relevant to this organisation and its customer base, in addition to public service wide policies as regards cloud computing, eGovernment, shared services etc.</p></reply>

The framework will be  mediated through a process of strategic dialogue leading to agreement of  mission-based performance funding compacts between each Higher Education  Institution and the HEA.  In launching performance funding this year the HEA  has decided to limit the amount of funding under the Framework to &euro;5 million in  2014 as a developmental phase.   </p><p>  The HEA has also issued a request for submissions to the Universities and IoTs  under a Strategic Innovation Call of &euro;15 million. This includes a &euro;10 million  call to support reform in three priority areas - teaching learning, access,  engagement with enterprise. The balance of &euro;5 million relates to support for  work to implement the landscape recommendations - clusters, mergers etc.  This  is intended to be small projects relating to technical expertise in managing  change.  </p><p>  The HEA is also undertaking a study on the sustainability of the current  funding system for higher education. This study was initiated at my request and  an initial report has been published. This report makes it clear that immediate  work is required to prepare for a longer term approach to a system that can be  maintained through a sustainable funding base capable of addressing the  continual expansion of the sector while protecting quality of education. The  HEA is continuing its work in this area, which will help inform the  decision-making as to the future funding of the sector and I will be advised  further as this work progresses.  </p></reply>

In the 2012 Survey  of Schools: ICT in Education, which was carried out by European Schoolnet, on  behalf of the European Commission, the frequency of use of ICT in lessons was  examined. The survey showed that the use of ICT by teachers in Ireland is much  higher at all grades than the EU average. There are considerable more teachers  using ICT in more than 25% of lessons, which is above the EU average,  particularly at grades 4 (4th class) and 8 (2nd year post primary). The most  intense use is at grade 11 (5th year post primary) where nearly a third use ICT  with their students in more than 50% of lessons, higher than the EU average.  </p><p>  Further evidence of the use of ICT in teaching can be seen in the take up of  ICT training places. In 2012 13,500 teacher training places were taken up on  ICT related training.   The Professional Development Service for Teachers  (PDST) which now includes the functions of the former NCTE ensures that  opportunities for teachers to experience ICT in their learning and teaching are  a key element of all professional development events offered to teachers.  </p><p>  The investment of &euro;90m in infrastructure grants to schools in 2009 and 2010  delivered significant improvements in the infrastructural base nationally and  allowed schools to equip classrooms with a digital projector, teaching computer  and wireless keyboard and mouse and ensured that all teachers have access to  technology.  Work has commenced on the development of a new ICT Strategy for schools. The  first step in this process is the completion of an ICT census in schools. The  census results are currently being analysed and the results will provide a  sound research base which will in turn inform key policy decisions relating to  integrating ICT in teaching and learning over the next three to five years. In  the past the ICT census of schools focussed on the level of infrastructure in  schools.  The current census addresses a broad range of themes including: </p><p>  - the impact of ICT in teaching and learning and assessment;</p><p>  - school-wide planning for integration of ICT in teaching and learning;</p><p>  - continuing ICT related Professional Development (CPD) for teachers;</p><p>  - curriculum-relevant digital content and software resources;</p><p>  - exploring views on the opportunities presented by integration of ICT in  teaching, learning and assessment;</p><p>  - obstacles to ICT integration; and</p><p>  - how they could be overcome.</p><p> </p></reply>

These are detailed below. </p><p>  A 5-year School Investment Plan 2012-2016 announced on 9 March 2012, provides  for a &euro;2 billion school capital investment programme to 2016, of which &euro;1.5  billion is being allocated to fund major school projects with the balance  needed for the additional accommodation scheme, the prefab replacement  initiative, the acquisition of sites and other works.  </p><p>  The Plan prioritises major school projects in areas where future significant  demographic changes have been identified.  There are 275 projects set out in  the Plan that are expected to proceed to construction over the duration of the  Plan - 106 new school buildings and 65 extensions at primary level; 43 new  school buildings and 49 extensions at second level, and 8 new special school  buildings and extensions at 4 further special schools   In December 2011, details of 56 major school building projects to commence  construction in 2012, the first year of the Plan, were published. In December  2012, details of 50 major school building projects were announced to commence  construction in 2013, the second year of the Plan. </p><p>To ensure that accommodation is available when required, my Department has  initiated alternative methods of project delivery whereby responsibility for  planning and delivery of projects is devolved to Local Authorities, Education  and Training Boards, NDFA, OPW and directly to school authorities.  </p><p>  Following on from the success of the 2012 prefab replacement scheme which  provided funding for the replacement of over 458 prefab units, I recently  announced that a further 46 schools would be offered grants in 2013 to build  permanent accommodation to replace 115 prefabs, subject to the schools meeting  certain criteria. The overall policy goal of my Department is to ensure the  highest standard of permanent accommodation for all schools.  </p><p>  With regard to the development of an inventory of education infrastructure and  related community assets, my Department undertook a pilot study in five areas  in the country. The geographic areas included for the pilot study were Tuam,  Navan, Clonmel, Portlaoise, and part of Limerick City.  The research  information gathered from this pilot study was in a format compatible with  current Department information systems, such as the Geographic Information  System (GIS). This allows my Department to overlay the new information such as  site maps, floor plans and other data on to its current GIS mapping system.  It  is the intention that this expanded inventory data will now be developed on an  incremental basis at a national level.  </p><p>  In June 2011, I announced that up to 40 new schools are to be established up to  2017 to cater for increasing demographics across a number of locations. These  will include shared campus arrangements where appropriate and possible. Some  examples of campus arrangements include the campus development in Monaghan town  which provided a primary school, a gaelchol&aacute;iste and a further education  facility.  A campus development in Naas provided a post primary school, a  primary gaelscoil and a headquarters building for the IVEA.   </p><p>  I also wish to advise the Deputy that my Department is included among the  prescribed authorities to whom local authorities are statutorily obliged to  send draft development plans or proposed variations to development plans for  comment and sites are reserved, where necessary, under this process to ensure  as far as possible the timely delivery of any required education infrastructure </p><p>  Following the disappointing response from the Congregations to augment their  contributions under the 2002 Indemnity Agreement, following the publication of  the Ryan Report, I proposed the transfer of school infrastructure to the State  at no cost to the Exchequer for the benefit of the taxpayer as one mechanism to  allow those involved the opportunity to shoulder their share of the costs. I  have continued to engage with the Congregations to seek a greater contribution  from them. </p><p> </p></reply>

One of  the conditions is that the most junior post is the post to be made redundant  when the allocation to the school is reduced.     It is not possible to amend  the rules governing the redundancy scheme for this case. </p><p>  There have been other requests from SNAs and schools to vary the terms of the  seniority arrangement for redundancy purposes and these have been refused. </p></reply>

Therefore it is my intention that the additional resources available to DEIS schools are utilised to optimum benefit to achieve identified outcomes for the most at risk pupils. As part of the DEIS programme a total of &euro;69.1m is being provided to 665 primary schools supporting 100,595 pupils and some 930 additional teacher posts. This funding provides for Reduced Class Sizes; Home School Community Liaison Service; Support Teacher Project; DEIS and Book Grants to individual schools. DEIS Schools are also targeted for supports provided under the Department of Social Protection Schools Meals Programmes (&euro;34m) and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs School Completion Programme (&euro;26.4m). My Department continues to work to ensure that DEIS funding is used effectively. For example, it has recently provided guidelines on the appropriate use of DEIS grant funding in primary and post primary schools, emphasising a number of recommended activities such as at least 10% of DEIS grant to be allocated to Home School Community Liaison activities.</p><p>  Some of the additional DEIS grant may also be used to meet ancillary costs such as heating, lighting and other miscellaneous charges related to extended openings of school buildings remaining open to cater for clubs and after school activities. The 22 DEIS schools in Tallaght will receive &euro;0.715 million in DEIS grants in 2013/14 school year. Schools have been given the autonomy to work within the guidelines for the appropriate use of DEIS funding and to decide how best to utilise DEIS resources, including the DEIS grant to achieve maximum benefits to the most at risk pupils in line with their DEIS Action Plans and addressing educational disadvantage. These guidelines, which issued in October 2012, now place emphasis on outcomes rather than being too prescriptive in relation to recommended activities and interventions. Information on the full range of supports provided to DEIS schools is available on the Social Inclusion section of my Departments website at following link .</p></reply>

(CWT) following an open tender process. The service to be provided under this contract includes sourcing the most competitive rates for foreign travel for civil servants and members of the Oireachtas travelling abroad on official business.</p><p>  Ahead of Ireland&rsquo;s 2013 EU Presidency, Ryanair contacted the Government with a fixed-fare offer for travel on the Dublin-Brussels South Charleroi route (Brussels South Charleroi Airport is located approximately 45 km from Brussels). Following discussion between Ryanair, CWT and the National Procurement Service, agreement was reached on a fixed one-way fare of &euro;49.99 for travel between Dublin and Brussels South Charleroi for the duration of Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency. The fare included government taxes and charges, but did not include fees for baggage or for extras such as reserved seating or priority boarding. This fare was subject to a 2% credit card fee. It could be booked either online or by telephone, with a &euro;6 administration fee per person per sector for bookings made by telephone. The agreement also allowed for one change to be made to a booked ticket to an alternative flight of the passenger&rsquo;s choice on the same route. Ryanair also committed to providing an Assistance Desk at both of the airports concerned for any assistance required by travellers availing of this fare. The agreement applied only to the Dublin - Brussels South Charleroi route. This special fare was available to all officials and Oireachtas members travelling to Brussels on official business during Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency. Other options available to travellers to Brussels are the Aer Lingus service between Dublin and Brussels Airport and the standard fares available from Ryanair. In planning journeys, travellers would take account of the suitability of flight times, having regard to the timing and duration of the relevant meetings in Brussels. A further factor to be considered by Departments/Offices in choosing flights is the ground transport links from the particular airport regarding access and cost. For those officials whose work/meetings schedule allowed them to use this route, the Ryanair offer provided value for money. As a result of Ryanair's offers, significant reductions were achieved in the average cost of flights to Brussels when compared with the same period in 2012.</p></reply>

This has resulted in the issue of Proposed Valuation Certificates to the ratepayers in relation to their property. However this process is not yet complete in Waterford as a small batch of outstanding Certificates will issue shortly. Ratepayers may make representations to the Valuation Manager if they consider that the proposed valuation or any details contained in the Proposed Certificate are incorrect. The representation stage is currently under way and will not be complete for some time. Following the processing of the representations to the Valuation Manager, the Final Certificates of Valuation will be published on 31st December, 2013, when each ratepayer in Waterford and Dublin City will have a statutory right to make an appeal to the Valuation Tribunal if dissatisfied with the outcome of their representations. The Valuation Tribunal is an independent body set up to settle disputed valuations between the Commissioner of Valuation and the ratepayers of local authorities. Therefore, it will be early 2014, before the appeal stage is reached in respect of the Waterford and Dublin City rating authorities, accordingly it is not possible to provide the detailed statistical information which the Deputy is seeking at this stage. Under the Valuation Act, 2001, there is also a right of internal appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation. However, legislative proposals are currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas which would result in this appeal being removed. This is one of a number of legislative proposals set out in the Bill. However, it will be a matter for the Oireachtas to determine how such proposals proceed or otherwise.</p><p>For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, three revaluations of commercial property have been carried out to-date in the rating authority areas of South Dublin, Fingal and Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown and the number of appeals received from ratepayers in each of those rating authority areas is indicated in the following table. As already mentioned, similar information for Waterford and Dublin City will not be available until early 2014.</p><p><table><tr><th>Rating Authority Area</th><th> Number of Appeals to the Commissioner of Valuation</th><th> Number of Appeals to the Valuation Tribunal</th></tr><tr><td>South Dublin County Council</td><td>725 (11.5%) *</td><td>227(3.6%) *</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal County Council</td><td>819(14.4%)</td><td>100(1.75%)</td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council</td><td>1,148(22.2%)</td><td>302(5.84%)</td></tr></table></p><p>*% of Revaluations by the Commissioner of Valuation.</p></reply>

The application of a moratorium to a revaluation because of local authority amalgamation considerations is not provided for under the Valuation Act, 2001, as the application of such an option would not affect the valuation process. Section 21 of the Act provides that a valuation list must be published within three years of the making of a valuation order.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s Action Programme for Effective Local Government, Putting People First, indicates that in the context of reorganisation of local governance structures, the proposed new municipal districts will provide an opportunity to achieve a more coherent approach to rates and charges on a county-wide basis, having regard to funding requirements and the need to support employment and business competitiveness. The Action Programme proposes rates harmonisation to cater for differences between Annual Rates on Valuation (ARVs) of towns and counties. The approach of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to rates harmonisation will seek to ensure, that harmonisation does not lead to significant net loss of revenue in individual counties with consequential implications for services, and that any change in rates does not impact negatively on businesses and employment. It is important that local government reform drives down costs to business in order to protect existing jobs and sustain our economic competitiveness.</p></reply>

The immediate objective of the national revaluation programme is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas is conducted as soon as possible. Revaluation is conducted across all relevant properties in one or more rating authority areas at the same time. However, implementation of the national programme cannot occur across the entire country simultaneously and the programme must, accordingly, be operated on a phased basis. Following the first revaluation, subsequent revaluations of each rating authority area will then be carried out on a cyclical basis no sooner than five years and no later than ten years after the first revaluation (Section 25 of the Valuation Act 2001).</p><p>Section 9(10) of the Valuation Act 2001 provides that the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions. Section 19(1) of the said Act empowers the Commissioner to make a Valuation Order specifying a rating authority area over which a revaluation is to be conducted, after consultation with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the rating authority concerned. Steady progress is being made on the National Revaluation Programme. Between 2007 and 2010 the three Rating Authority areas of South Dublin, Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown were revalued comprising c.17,700 commercial properties which represents approximately 22% of the national rateable valuation base. Additionally, there are currently six revaluation projects in progress which include the Rating Authority areas of Dublin City, Waterford City and County and Dungarvan Town together with Limerick City and County comprising c. 38,000 commercial properties or 32.6% of the valuation base. Furthermore, the statutory consultation process, required before a valuation order can be made is under way with a further five rating authorities, Galway City Council, Kilkenny County Council, Kilkenny Borough Council, Carlow County Council and Carlow Town Council. Decisions in relation to a further set of rating authorities for revaluation are currently under consideration by the Valuation Office.</p><p>The current position as regards projects in train or pending is set out in the following table:</p><p><table><tr><th>Rating Authority<br />Area</th><th>Date Valuation Order Signed</th><th>Publication Date for the New Valuation List.</th><th>Number*  of Items</th><th>% of Valuation Base [Pre - Revaluation]</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin City </td><td>5/05/2011</td><td>31/12/2013</td><td>25117</td><td>26.62</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City <br /></td><td>12/12/2011</td><td>31/12/2013</td><td>  2548</td><td>  1.44</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford County </td><td>12/12/2011</td><td>31/12/2013</td><td>  1387</td><td>  0.39</td></tr><tr><td>Dungarvan Town </td><td>12/12/2011</td><td>31/12/2013</td><td>    621</td><td>  0.24</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City </td><td>29/03/2012</td><td>31/12/2014</td><td>  4085</td><td>  1.94</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick County </td><td>29/03/2012</td><td>31/12/2014</td><td>  4505</td><td>  1.98</td></tr><tr><td>Galway City </td><td>Valuation Order pending</td><td>  3702</td><td>  2.30</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County </td><td>Valuation Order pending</td><td>  1974</td><td>  0.92</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny Borough </td><td>Valuation Order pending</td><td>    993</td><td>  0.48</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow County </td><td>Valuation Order pending</td><td>    982</td><td>  0.38</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow Town </td><td>Valuation Order pending</td><td>    906</td><td>  0.40</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Totals</td><td>-</td><td>46820</td><td>37.09</td><td>-</td></tr></table></p><p>*2009 baseline data.</p></reply>

The OPW's role at Kilmainham is to maintain the physical fabric of the site and present it to the public through a dedicated Guide Service, explaining its 217 year history and its role in some of the key events in the formation of the State.  The site opens to the public on a fulltime basis 362 days per year, attracting significant numbers of visitors and sustaining a strong income profile.  As well as its tourist and heritage attractiveness to visitors, it is also the preferred chosen venue for frequent formal events and functions of social, cultural, artistic, civic and diplomatic significance.  However, its capacity to deal with an ever-increasing demand is severely limited currently by a number of key factors, most notably the physical limitations of the building, which was obviously constructed with a different purpose in mind and which is not ideally configured to sustain an exponentially increasing volume of visitors.  It is expected that this challenge will be further emphasised with an expected increase in visitor numbers in the period ahead, particularly in the context of the interest generated by the various commemoration events over the next few years.  At current levels, the existing Gaol building is at absolute capacity and cannot sustain further large scale increases in visitor traffic without significant risk to the fabric of the Monument and to the comfort and safety of visitors.  The OPW have been working on a suitable proposal to enhance the visitor experience at the Gaol.  Discussions have taken place with a range of bodies with a view to advance a project in tandem with the 1916 centenary celebrations.</p></reply>

This is the first time that a Directive on concessions has been developed as until now regulation at European level has been only partially developed. The Directives aim at simplifying the rules around procurement procedures, reducing the administrative burden on public authorities and potential contractors; thereby attracting a greater number of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) as well as reducing the costs of procuring and contributing to a better use of resources. I welcome this agreement as it will strengthen the generation of jobs and growth, given that public authorities across the European Union spend approximately &euro;2 trillion per annum (some 19% of EU GDP) on the procurement of goods, services and works. The easier access to such contracts for SMEs is a fundamental criterion- there are over 20 million SMEs in Europe, accounting for more than 98% of all enterprises&ndash;their exclusion from such contracts made little economic sense. The simplified administrative framework will mean the inclusion of smaller businesses for contracts that have always been clearly within their capacity to perform.</p><p>  The agreement also includes incentives for authorities to divide their requirements in lots &ndash;something which will also further attract SMEs. The gains to be had by such revisions are not confined to industry alone-by increasing and broadening access to such contracts we are helping to create competition, to drive efficiencies and ensure the public monies are being used in a cost-effective manner to provide for public need but at the same time support job creation and innovation. The negotiations were detailed, lengthy and complex, requiring significant compromise on the part of all three institutions. These compromises will now be examined in depth, ahead of final approval at the Committee of Permanent Representatives and the European Parliament.</p></reply>

Under the new arrangements, Departments now invite expressions of interest from the public in vacancies on the boards of bodies under their aegis on their websites. It is open to all members of the public regardless of gender, political affiliations or geographically location to apply for appointment to these vacancies. I am satisfied that the new arrangements introduced by the Government in 2011 have significantly improved transparency in the making of appointments to State Boards compared with the making of appointments in previous years. Since the formation of this Government 16 members have been nominated to State Boards, 25% of which being female. In view of the statutory procedures for the appointment of members of the Civil Service Arbitration Board and the Public Appointments Service, there is limited scope for me to take a factor such as gender into account when I make such appointments. I would like to make it clear that it is my intention in the limited number of appointments I have to make to increase the number of women appointees over the lifetime of the Government.

The Deputy's scenario in respect of the PRD would be particularly challenging in terms of costing on account of its complexity. This complexity arises from recourse to an eight-band tiered deduction structure instead of the current four-band structure, significant departures from existing band boundaries, and both increases and decreases in the percentage rates. Furthermore, it is possible that the Exchequer would experience net losses, not net savings, under the proposal, given that substantial rate reductions are proposed on the first &euro;60,000 of salary.</p><p>  As already indicated, my Department is not in a position to supply a detailed costing in relation to the PSPR adjustments which the Deputy has proposed. However, by drawing on previously undertaken costings work, it is possible to ascribe an approximate order-of-magnitude savings figure of a further &euro;5 million to the PSPR proposals made by the Deputy. This approximate and tentative &euro;5 million PSPR savings estimate arises very substantially from the Deputy's proposal in Question No. 36459/13 in respect of pensions awarded up to the end of February 2012. The estimate is not subject to significant variation in respect of the separate PSPR scenarios advanced in the Deputy&rsquo;s Questions No. 36460/13 and 36461/13 in respect of pensions awarded between 1 March 2012 and the end of August 2014.</p></reply>

The development work is being overseen by a Programme Development Steering Group which is chaired by SEUPB and has members representing Government Departments, local Government, trade union, business, rural, community and voluntary sectors.</p><p>  An extensive public consultation process, including a number of well-attended consultation events,  was conducted in late 2012.  Ex-ante evaluations and equality and environment assessments are underway and a mid-term evaluation of the PEACE III Programme is currently being finalised, all of which will be used to inform the development of the new Programme.  </p><p>  It is anticipated that the draft Operational Programmes for PEACE IV and INTERREG VA will be presented to the Northern Ireland Executive, the Irish Government and the Scottish Government  (INTERREG only) later this year.  Formal submission to the EU Commission will take place following the agreement of the three Governments.</p><p>  The total funding for the Programme will be decided as part of the Programme planning process.  A special ERDF allocation for PEACE IV of &euro;150m has been provided in the EU cohesion package.

We have significant strengths and advantages which we can leverage to exploit business opportunities in sectors such as renewable energy, smart grids, sustainable food, tourism, energy efficient products and services, and others.  Delivering the individual commitments outlined in the Policy Statement requires a whole-of-Government approach to maximise the growth and jobs potential.  </p><p>  As part of the delivery structure, I have established and chair a Consultative Committee on Jobs in the Green Economy, to identify emerging opportunities for Ireland. The Consultative Committee involves representatives from the enterprise sector as well as other key stakeholders, including relevant Government Departments and agencies.  A key objective of the Committee is to identify further practical actions that can be included in the 2014 Action Pan for Jobs to support the development of the Green Economy in Ireland.</p></reply>

The Plan contains a range of policy actions to assist the development of indigenous enterprise.  </p><p>  In terms of job creation in Monaghan, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s (EI) activity is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs setting up new High Potential Start-Up Companies (HPSU&rsquo;s), the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and in enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level through support of research in companies and Third Level institutions.</p><p>  EI provides a range of supports for start-ups including: the Competitive Feasibility Fund for the North East Region (Cavan, Monaghan and Louth) launched in February 2013; the Competitive Start-Up Fund; the Seed and Venture Capital and Development Capital Funds; the HALO Business Angel Partnership Programme, that is mandated to match business angels to appropriate projects; the &ldquo;New Frontiers&rdquo; Programme and the Innovation Voucher Initiative. Enterprise Ireland has 124 client companies in Monaghan employing almost 3,500 people. To date in 2013, over &euro;1.4m has been approved to Monaghan companies and &euro;599,000 paid across EI&rsquo;s suite of supports.</p><p>  In accordance with its Horizon 2020 Strategy, IDA Ireland continues to engage with its client companies in order to transform the existing foreign direct investment client base with a view to developing, retaining and growing employment opportunities. The primary opportunity for regional locations is to leverage the existing client-base and derive further investment opportunities from them.  There are 6 IDA Ireland supported companies in County Monaghan employing in the region of 350 people in full-time and part-time employment.</p><p>  IDA Ireland has invested in the provision of an extensive portfolio of property solutions in the North East Region which enhances its marketability for potential FDI opportunities.  With continuing enhancement and improvements in physical and digital infrastructure, an FDI project secured for one location within a region has a positive impact on other surrounding areas.  IDA Ireland will continue to market County Monaghan as part of its strategy for the North East Region for new inward investment through its Gateway of Dundalk, in line with the Government&rsquo;s National Spatial Strategy and will work closely with its client companies across the Region.  </p><p>  The Monaghan County Enterprise Board develops indigenous enterprise potential, stimulates economic activity at local level, promotes the establishment of micro-enterprises, provides financial support to viable projects, and provides business advice and training. Support is available, subject to certain criteria, to develop indigenous micro-enterprises and entrepreneurship at local level, with priority being given to manufacturing and internationally traded services. Job retention and creation are inherent considerations in the Board&rsquo;s activities. </p><p>  In 2012, Monaghan CEB paid out &euro;258,522 to 14 projects and 648 people availed of their training programmes. In 2013 to date, Monaghan CEB has approved grant aid of &euro;171,220 to 6 start-up and developing companies with an expected job creation figure of 15.   </p><p>Persons from Monaghan who are currently running their own business or are considering starting their own business can contact the Monaghan CEB at: www.mceb.ie.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-18a.769.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/979" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013071800047#WRU01900"><p>Space-related activities are at the forefront of knowledge generation, stimulating the development of new products and services, fostering industrial co-operation and being a driving force for innovation, growth and job creation across Europe and globally.</p><p>  The Irish Presidency secured Council Conclusions on both EU Space Industrial Policy and on the Establishment of Appropriate Relations between the EU and the European Space Agency (ESA). These Council Conclusions represent important steps in defining the future landscape of the European Space effort. They recognise the strategic importance of space for Europe, its growing role in modern society, the importance of the space industry and of the European Space Agency, and the contribution which these partners make to economic growth and competitiveness.  Progress was also made on the proposal for a Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) support programme which will ensure the security of satellite data for all sectors and users of such services. Initial discussions also took place on a proposed Regulation on Copernicus &ndash; the European Union&rsquo;s Flagship satellite-based earth monitoring programme.  </p><p>  The European Commission&rsquo;s Communication on &ldquo;Establishing appropriate relations between the EU and the European Space Agency&rdquo;, adopted in November 2012, proposed several options for the evolution of this relationship. Council Conclusions on EU/ESA relations adopted under the Irish Presidency on 18 February 2013 requested the Commission to work closely with ESA to carry out a comprehensive cost benefit analysis and impact assessment of a set of options, including those proposed in the Commission&rsquo;s Communication. At the Competitiveness Council meeting in May the Commission presented an information paper updating the Council on the status of its reflections on the evolution of EU-ESA relations. The Commission informed the Council that it had commenced an in-depth study of the options for the evolution of this relationship and informed the Council that the first results of this study are expected to be presented to Member States towards the end of this year. </p><p>Based on the European Commission&rsquo;s Communication on &quot;EU Space Industrial Policy - Releasing the Potential for Economic Growth in the Space Sector&quot; adopted on 28 February 2013 Council Conclusions on this Communication were adopted at the Competitiveness Council on 30 May. These Conclusions represent a significant advancement in defining European Space policy. They recognise the strategic importance of space for Europe, its growing role in modern society, the importance of the space industry and its contribution to economic growth and competitiveness. Ireland&rsquo;s space strategy is to build a sustainable, knowledge intensive and export focused space industry in Ireland, leading to increased levels of exports, sales and employment, to support strategic research in Irish third level institutions and to promote the use of space based systems for commercial and wider societal needs. While this is achieved mainly through Ireland&rsquo;s participation and investment in the European Space Agency (ESA), this will be further supported by the EU space industrial policy.</p><p>  Under the Irish Presidency the Commission&rsquo;s proposal for a Space Surveillance and Tracking Support Programme adopted on 28 February 2013 was examined at meetings of the Space Working Party between March and May. Space surveillance and tracking is of critical interest to countries with space assets and while Ireland has no space assets at present we are critically dependent on the security of satellite data for all sectors, actors and users of satellite-based services. The proposed SST service will increase the safety of satellite operations by reducing collision risks and helping to better predict uncontrolled re-entries of inactive satellites or space debris and increase European non-dependence levels.   Member States expressed support for the proposal, however, a number also expressed concern in relation to certain security, financing and governance aspects of the proposal. The Presidency worked intensively to progress the proposal, however, full agreement on the text was not possible and on this basis the Irish Presidency presented a Progress Report on the status of negotiations to the Competitiveness Council on 30 May.</p><p>  The Commission adopted the Copernicus Regulation on 29 May 2013 and the proposal was presented to the Competitiveness Council on 30 May and was also presented to the Space Working Party on 7 June for an initial exchange of views. Copernicus is the new name for the European Earth Observation Programme GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security). Copernicus is a European initiative for the implementation of information services dealing with environment and security. Copernicus is based on observation data received from Earth Observation satellites and ground based information. The overall objective of the Copernicus initiative is to support Europe&rsquo;s goals regarding sustainable development and global governance of the environment by providing timely and quality data, information, services and knowledge. Through Copernicus the state of our environment and its short, medium and long-term evolution will be monitored to support policy decisions or investments.  Copernicus will provide services in six sectors: Marine monitoring, Atmosphere monitoring, Climate change monitoring, Land monitoring, Emergency management and Security. A number of Government Departments, agencies and organisations have an interest in aspects of the proposal as potential users of the system and Copernicus will also provide opportunities for commercial applications in the downstream sector based on full and open access to Copernicus observation data and information products. This ambitious Earth observation programme is headed by the European Commission in partnership with the European Environment Agency and the European Space Agency and will enter its full operational phase in 2014.</p><p>  The achievements of the Irish Presidency in the development of European Space Policy will contribute to the development of a strong and competitive European space industry and will provide further support to Irish industrial space interests and provide opportunities for growth particularly in the SME sector which encompasses the majority of Irish space companies.</p></reply>

Once block exempted, certain aid can be brought into place by Member States without seeking prior permission from the Commission. </p><p>  The ninth and final meeting of the Competition Working Party took place on 07 May 2013. The Competition Working Party noted the support for a large majority of delegations for the two Presidency compromise texts. The Permanent Representatives Committee approved the Presidency compromise texts on both Regulations on 15 May 2013 and invited the Council (Competitiveness) at its meeting on 29 May 2013 to proceed to a public debate with a view to the subsequent adoption of the two Council Regulations. </p><p>  Because of the high political importance of State Aid Modernisation, the Presidency proceeded - as the opinions from the European Parliament were not yet adopted - to a General Approach on these two Regulations at the 29 May Competitiveness Council.</p><p>  The agreement will ensure more efficient and transparent monitoring of State Aid by the Commission, enhanced data-gathering processes and improved co-operation between the Commission and Member States&rsquo; national courts. The reforms will also enable the Commission to focus on large and potentially distortive State Aids, while simplifying the procedures for &lsquo;good aid&rsquo;.</p><p>  Formal adoption of the regulations will now take place under the incoming Lithuanian presidency. The Commission will aim at developing the rest of the package over the following year with a view to progressively achieving the revision of the main Commission acts and guidelines by the end of 2013. The main instruments of the package, including the Council acts, should be adopted by the end of 2013.</p></reply>

If an employee has earned income from self-employment, PRSI as a self-employed contributor is also payable on the profits from that self-employed activity as well as from any other unearned income the individual may have.  Similarly a self-employed contributor (who is not an employee) pays PRSI on both earned and unearned income.  However if an employee has unearned income only, there is no PRSI charge on the unearned income.  Unearned income includes rental and investment income as well as income from dividends, deposits and savings and from overseas investments. </p><p>  In Budget 2013 the Minister for Finance indicated that the income base on which PRSI is charged will be broadened, consequently I introduced the following measures:</p><p>  - With effect from 1 January 2013 modified rate contributors with additional earned self-employed income (from a profession or trade) and any other unearned income (such as rental income) became liable to PRSI at the rate of 4% on all such income:</p><p>  - In 2014, the exemption from PRSI applying to all employees who have no additional self-employed earned income but who do have unearned income only (such as rental income), will be abolished, such income will become liable to PRSI at the rate of 4%. </p><p>  Social Insurance applies to persons over the age of 16 years and under pensionable age, which is currently age 66 years.  Those aged 66 years and over are not liable to pay PRSI on any of their income including their unearned income.  Accordingly those over 66 years will not be impacted by this change.</p><p>  In general the rules which apply to income for taxation purposes also apply to income for the purposes of charging PRSI.</p><p>  It is not possible to identify the amount of income raised by the application of PRSI to rental income in any year.</p></reply>

The majority of defined benefit pension schemes are in deficit and face serious challenges in restoring their funding levels to enable the scheme deliver on the pension promise.  It is acknowledged that the fundamental problem, facing pension schemes is that pensions are significantly more expensive, due to increasing life expectancy and lower than expected investment returns which are reflect in increased annuity rates.</p><p>  The Funding Standard provides a benchmark against which the &quot;health&quot; of a scheme can be tested.  When a scheme fails the Funding Standard that means that unless some action is taken, the scheme will not be able to pay all the benefits promised.  The existence of the Funding Standard itself is not the central issue in relation to whether a scheme is properly funded.  Rather the responsibility rests with the employer and the trustees for ensuring that the scheme is properly funded and managed.  However, the Funding Standard does provide the regulatory mechanism for ensuring that a scheme can live up to the &quot;promised&quot; level of pension benefits.</p><p>   In addition to the range of both legislative and administrative measures introduced over the last few years to assist the trustees and sponsoring employers to restore pension provision to a sustainable position, I introduced measures last year to protect scheme members against future volatility in the financial markets.  Defined benefits schemes will be required to maintain a risk reserve with effect from January 2016 and to meet this risk reserve requirement by the end of 2023.   </p><p>  It is accepted that the requirement for a risk reserve will present an added challenge for pension schemes, however, guidance issued by the Regulator identifies options which the scheme can consider in meeting this requirement. </p><p>  The size of the funding standard risk reserve depends on the nature of the assets held by the scheme in question.  The greater the amount of lower risk assets held, the lower the reserve requirement.  The level of the risk reserve was initially set at 15% of holdings other than bonds or cash.  The occupational pension schemes (funding standard reserve) regulations 2013 reduced the risk reserve requirement from 15% to 10% and extended the range of assets which have the effect of reducing the Funding Standard reserve requirement.  These additional measures were put in place to provide further assistance to scheme in restoring the scheme funding position.</p><p>  This measure was put in to protect scheme members from exposure to financial volatility and to assist in securing the future sustainability of schemes.  You will be aware that investment losses in Ireland were the largest because of the large share of equities in pension fund portfolios, around two-thirds of assets before the crisis hit, compared with an average of 36% in the 20 OECD countries where data are available.</p><p>  There has been a decline in the number of defined benefit schemes over the last decade.  This decline is replicated in many other OECD countries and is referred to in the recent OECD Review of the Irish Pensions System.  The persistent funding difficulties experienced by defined benefit schemes have been well recognised and employers, unions and trustees have been making strenuous efforts to protect the viability of their schemes. While trustees and employers will explore a range of options to secure the sustainability of pension provision, some schemes will wind up.  The level of scheme funding at the date of the wind-up will determine the extent to which the scheme can meet all of its liabilities.  It is recognised that in situations where a scheme is severely under-funded, the expected level of benefit which an active and deferred members of a scheme will receive will be reduced.  Section 48 of the Pensions Act determines the order in which the assets of a scheme are distributed on the wind up of a scheme.  This is an issue which has been examined in some depth and is under consideration at present, along with other defined benefit issues.  I am keeping the situation under review and will report back to Government in the coming months on these issues.  Legislative proposals and additional reforms will be considered at that stage. </p></reply>

Typically, these workers provide services in rural and less densely populated areas but larger urban centres may also have a cohort of part-time workers. </p><p>  Retained fire-fighters who are otherwise unemployed are entitled to a jobseeker's payment in respect of days that they are engaged in fire-fighting or training.  They are, however, required to satisfy the statutory conditions for the receipt of a jobseeker's payment of being available for and genuinely seeking work.  Any person who fails to satisfy these conditions is not entitled to a jobseeker's payment.</p><p>  Taking account of the unusual circumstances of retained fire personnel the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 and accompanying regulations, carried amendments to both jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance that put the treatment of retained fire fighters on a legislative basis.  </p><p>  Critically, the revised provisions provide that employment as a retained fire fighter shall satisfy the availability conditionality, irrespective of the requirement that a retained fire fighter who is on call must be within a 1.5 mile radius of their respective fire station.  However, retained fire fighters are still required to be available for additional or alternative full time employment.  </p><p>  The revised provisions will exempt retained fire-fighters from having to satisfy the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit 'substantial loss' of employment rule, which means that retained fire fighters can potentially re-qualify for jobseeker's benefit without suffering any additional loss of employment.  In addition, the revised legislative provisions also state that any days of employment as a retained fire fighter will not reduce their jobseeker's claim.</p><p>  The changes contained in the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 and the accompanying regulatory amendments have effect from 10 July, 2013.  These changes will act to allow retained fire-fighters a reasonable and fair level of access to the jobseeker schemes in future.  </p></reply>

The Department is currently engaged in major transformation programmes to meet Government objectives, for example in relation to activation and supporting the provision of integrated income support and activation services through Intreo to clients of working age.  The Department has embarked on a major programme of business and system change to support these objectives and is focussing its development efforts in this regard.  The Department requires the effective use of ICT in order to deal with this increasingly broad and complex workload while reliably providing for some 87 million payments to over 2 million recipients per annum and facilitating their engagement with society as a whole.</p><p>  While not a technology research organisation per se, the Department must continually keep abreast of relevant technological advances and evaluate their potential contribution to realising gains in effectiveness and efficiency.  Professional expertise is maintained by staff training, review of technology literature, networking and monitoring industry trends.  When a technology or technique appears to have sufficient contribution to warrant further investigation, the Department explores it in more depth.  This usually takes the form of an exploratory project to evaluate the technology concerned and/or the processes necessary to take advantage of it while minimising the investment required.  One of the objectives of an exploratory project is to identify and mitigate any risks involved, should it be decided to proceed to more widespread deployment.</p><p>  Once the Department is satisfied that there is sufficient return on the investment required to deploy new technologies, it will generally commence deployment on a pilot basis to ensure that benefits are realisable and, if successful, will follow this with more widespread deployment.</p><p>  I am satisfied that my Department adapts to, and makes maximum use of, modern information and communications technologies and that any new technologies are explored with due care to maximise investments and to position the Department to deliver on its major transformation programmes. </p></reply>

This includes approximately 400 Social Welfare and Special Investigation Unit (SIU) Inspectors.  The remainder of the staff are based in scheme headquarters or other control units.  Each major headquarter scheme section has a dedicated control unit which initiates, undertakes and co-ordinates all control activities within their respective areas.  These units are also involved in data-matching projects in order to select cases for review.  While some 'desk review' work is carried out at the scheme control units, the detailed investigations are sent to Inspectors, including the SIU.</p><p>The SIU carry out a wide range of control activities and projects which include reviewing means tested claims and entitlements, investigating fraud and abuse and carrying out employer inspections.

The funding proposal must outline measures which ensure that the scheme could reasonably be expected to satisfy the Funding Standard by 2023 (in line with changes made in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2012).  Following approval of the funding proposals, schemes report to the Pensions Board on their compliance with the funding proposal on an annual basis<font color="#004080">. </font></p><p>  The suspension of the Funding Standard in 2008 meant that trustees were not required to submit funding proposals, however some schemes continued to comply during this time.     </p><p>  Therefore, not all schemes had to submit funding proposals by the 30th June deadline, depending on the last date of valuation, and some schemes may already have funding proposals in place and approved by the Pensions Board to deal with their deficits. </p><p>  With the reinstatement of the Funding Standard, approximately 300 schemes were due to send in funding proposals by the 30th June 2013.  212 of these schemes did not submit funding proposals.   </p><p>  The Pensions Board has, by now, formally written to the schemes that have not submitted funding proposals to ascertain their particular circumstances.

The Funding Standard had been suspended since 2008 with the date extended on a number of occasions, and trustees need to adjust to the fact that the regulatory structure has been reinstated.  A number of schemes have already confirmed to the Board that submission of their funding standard is imminent.  There also appeared to be an unfounded expectation that the date would be extended again and this contributed to the number that missed the deadline.   </p><p>  Following engagement by the Pensions Board and once pension schemes have submitted their funding proposals, it will then be possible within the coming months for the Board to provide a more accurate indication of the level of under-funding in DB pension schemes.

The aim of the pilot framework is to achieve sustainable and fair outcomes without the need for the borrower to enter the full insolvency process. </p><p>  The pilot scheme envisages a third party service provider, acting as an intermediary between the borrowers and the lenders, who would look at the borrowers overall debts, issues of affordability of all debts and make agreements with the banks and credit unions on new levels of repayments ( including write downs) etc.</p><p>  When the framework was announced the third party service provider hadn&rsquo;t been identified.  Facilitated by the Central Bank, a pilot working group comprising banks, credit unions and lenders bodies has been established to oversee the pilot, a sub group of which examined the proposals, from a number of applicants, submitted to manage the pilot. CIB / MABS made a detailed submission outlining how they would manage the pilot if they were successful in becoming the third party service provider. </p><p>  The CIB/MABS proposal was successful and they confirmed to the Central Bank their acceptance of the offer. However at follow up discussions with the lenders to discuss the proposal, CIB / MABS, after much consideration, decided that the proposed approach of the lenders was not the best fit for MABS at this particular point in time and notified the Central Bank of the withdrawal of their proposal. MABS felt that the pilot provides for a very specific role for the service provider, which is significantly narrower than MABS current role and provides only a limited facility for MABS to advocate on behalf of clients. </p><p>  MABS has communicated its continued commitment to the approach and principles of the pilot and its support of the comprehensive approach to multiple-debt resolution proposed.  Furthermore, MABS is willing to incorporate aspects of the pilot in its own work with borrowers and lenders and has offered to contribute to the work of the Steering Committee for the pilot. </p><p>  I am satisfied that MABS will continue to play an important role and provide a high quality personal service to assist people in overcoming their indebtedness and managing their finances.</p></reply>

While it can happen that a person may experience more than one contingency at the same time - for example, an unemployed person may become sick - a general principle applies whereby even if a person experiences more than one of the contingencies at any one time, he or she only can receive one primary social welfare payment at any time. </p><p>  In relation to those in Budget 2012 introduced changes to a provision whereby those in receipt of widow(er)&rsquo;s pensions, surviving civil partner's pensions or one parent family payment may have been entitled to half rate jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, illness benefit or incapacity supplement if they satisfied the qualifying conditions.   With effect from January 2012, these half rate payments ceased for new applicants for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, illness benefit or incapacity supplement.</p><p>  As I have sought to maintain existing core rates of primary social welfare payments in a very difficult fiscal environment, the continuation of these payments was not possible in an  environment where spending has to be significantly curtailed, and if the alternative is to deepen the level of reductions in rates of primary payments to recipients generally. </p></reply>

A reduction of &euro;5 in the weekly personal rate of all social protection payments made to persons aged under 66 years of age would save &euro; 226 million in a full year.   A reduction of &euro;10 per week in the personal rate of jobseeker's allowance for new and existing claimants with a duration of 12 months or more with a proportionate reduction for a qualified adult would save an estimated &euro;102 million in a full year. A reduction of &euro;10 per week in the personal rate of jobseeker's allowance for new and existing claimants with a duration of 18 months or more with a proportionate reduction for a qualified adult would save an estimated &euro;77 million in a full year. A reduction of &euro;10 per week in the personal rate of jobseeker's allowance for new and existing claimants with a duration of 24 months with a proportionate reduction for a qualified adult would save an estimated &euro;75 million in a full year. </p><p>  In Budget 2013, the duration for which jobseeker's benefit is paid was reduced from twelve months to nine for those with more than 260 contributions and reduced from nine months to six for those with less than 260 contributions. The estimated savings for these measures as announced on Budget day were &euro;33 million in 2013 and &euro;81 million in a full year. </p><p>  Reducing the maximum age for the qualified child increase to 18 years would save &euro;13 million in a full year. Reducing the maximum age for the qualified child increase to 19 years would save &euro;7 million in a full year. </p><p>  The saving that would be achieved from increasing the minimum number of hours worked for family income supplement from 19 to 24 hours is currently being updated and will be made available to the Deputy when available.</p><p>  An increase of &euro;4 for single people and &euro;8 for couples in the minimum contribution for rent supplement would save &euro;22 million in a full year. </p></reply>

The licence states that it does not authorise any person to enter any land without the permission of the owner or occupier of the land.    The licence also provides that the Licensee and its members must comply with Section 44 of the Wildlife Acts which relates to unlawful hunting and entry on land.   </p><p>  The conditions of the license will be reviewed for the 2013-2014 season. In that context, I am mindful of the provisions of Section 44 which already confer considerable powers on the owners or occupiers of land to protect their property from unlawful hunting.   While under section 44, it is open to aggrieved owners and occupiers of land to take summary proceedings where persons enter on land without permission for the purpose of hunting, where resources allow, my Department will investigate a number of allegations, which were recently brought to my Department&rsquo;s attention, in relation to the unlawful capturing of hares by coursing clubs during the 2012-13 season.</p></reply>

The then Government agreed to cover the full capital costs of the project, which were estimated at that time to be of the order of &euro;35m.</p><p>  It was always the intention that the Ulster Canal project would be funded from the Waterways Ireland annual allocations, as agreed through the annual estimates processes in this jurisdiction, as well as the deliberations of NSMC in relation to annual budgets.  It was a key consideration throughout the process that the Ulster Canal project would be supported by a significant level of projected income from the commercialisation of certain Waterways Ireland assets. However, as the Deputy will be aware, the economic downturn has had a negative impact on those plans.</p><p>  In the meantime, the Ulster Canal project is progressing on an incremental basis. Planning approvals have recently been secured for the project in both jurisdictions.  I welcome these developments, which, I am sure the Deputy will agree, are a significant milestone for the project.</p><p>  I am continuing to explore all possible options to advance this project within the current fiscal constraints. In this regard, an Inter-Agency Group on the Ulster Canal has been established to explore and examine ways to advance the project and to examine possible funding options for it, including existing funding streams and the leveraging of funding from other sources, including EU funding options. </p></reply>

The group from Clara Bog commenced turf cutting at the relocation site in Killeranny, County Offaly, in June 2012, where 23 qualifying turf cutters have now been accommodated. Turf cutting for the 2013 season took place on this site in April last. My Department envisages that qualifying turf cutters from the group from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog will be able to commence turf cutting in the relocation sites from the 2014 turf cutting season.</p><p>  Progress has been made with a view to the relocation of 7 qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog special area of conservation in County Kildare to Timahoe North, County Kildare, which is in the ownership of Bord na M&oacute;na. Final agreement has not yet been reached. My Department envisages that qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog will be able to commence cutting in the relocation site during the 2014 turf cutting season provided that final agreement is reached with them.</p><p>  Progress has also been made with a view to the relocation of a small group of 3 qualifying turf cutters from Ballynamona Bog and Corkip Lough special area of conservation in County Roscommon to Togher, County Roscommon, which is in the ownership of Bord na M&oacute;na. My Department envisages that this group of qualifying turf cutters will be able to commence cutting in the relocation site during the 2014 turf cutting season provided that final agreement is reached with them.</p><p>  I am advised that of the remaining 49 raised bog special areas of conservation, potential relocation sites have been identified for a further 32 bogs and work is ongoing on identifying and investigating sites. Relocation is unlikely to be required, or is likely to be small-scale, for another 16 raised bog special areas of conservation due, for example, to the small number that had been cutting turf on these sites during the relevant five year period and would qualify for the relocation option available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme.</p><p>  Relocation is a very complex process, in terms of investigating suitable sites for turf quality and quantity, the infrastructure/drainage works required, establishing the number who can be accommodated on the site, the cost and feasibility of land purchase or lease, and possible planning and Environmental Impact Assessment requirements. In that regard, Bord na M&oacute;na has assessed in the region of 50 potential relocation sites at the request of my Department. Bord na M&oacute;na is proceeding to negotiate with landowners in relation to the purchase or long term lease of sites.</p><p>  A payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, or a supply of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum is available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme to applicants while awaiting relocation to non-designated bogs. </p></reply>

The site is protected by a Preservation Order under the National Monuments Acts due to its historical importance as the location of the final Council of War and last headquarters of the leaders of the 1916 Rising. </p><p>  Because of the Preservation Order any works at, or in proximity to, the national monument require my consent under the National Monuments Acts.  As part of the consent process I have undertaken an Environmental Impact Assessment and considered all the various submissions and observations I have received in relation to the proposed works. </p><p>  My decision on the consent application approved the applicant's proposals for the creation of a 1916 commemorative centre on the site, involving the full repair and conservation of the four buildings.  However, it did not approve the demolition of any structures or the removal of any material from the site which date from or before 1916. Neither did I consent to the provision of an underground car park within the boundary of the national monument site or to the demolition of the Moore Lane facades of Nos. 15 and 16.</p><p>  The consent I have given is conditional on a revised project design being submitted to me for approval within 9 months that takes full account of the elements of the proposal for which consent has been refused and the conditions attached to the approved works.

It is highly appropriate that it would be preserved and that an appropriate commemorative centre would be put in place to mark the momentous events which took place there.  Having carefully considered all the relevant factors, I believe that the decision I have made on the consent application is the best way to ensure that work can take place to restore and conserve the national monument, to develop an appropriate commemorative centre there and also to ensure that the monument site is fully protected for future generations.</p><p>I would hope that the consent applicant can now revise the plans for the Moore Street national monument, in consultation with the planning authority, Dublin City Council, and in line with the conditions that have been set, so that an appropriate commemorative centre can be in place for 2016<i>.</i>    I will assist and support that process to the fullest extent possible insofar as my role under the National Monuments Acts is concerned.</p></reply>

Since coming into office, I have placed  a high priority on addressing the implications of a number of adverse findings against Ireland by the European Court of Justice. The European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011, which I signed into law in September, 2011 bring legal clarity in regard to obligations under these directives in respect of a range of consent processes and ensure that the transposition of these Directives into Irish law is complete and up to date.</p><p>  In addition, a comprehensive designation programme of Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special Protection Areas (SPAs), known collectively as the Natura 2000 network, being undertaken by my Department is almost complete. </p><p>  Also, measures are being taken to ensure that particular pressures on protected birds, species and habitats are addressed in terms of regulation and practice. These include a wide range of activities, including but not limited to aquaculture and fishery licensing, forestry consents, agricultural practices in certain areas, recreational activities in certain areas, turf-cutting on certain sites and arterial drainage.</p><p>  Compensation, or financial incentives, may be payable in respect of land within Natura 2000 sites in a number of ways.</p><p>  Significant amounts of EU and Exchequer funding are provided through the rural development programme, operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which provides for a range of supports for farmers, including specific payments in respect of areas selected for designation under the Birds and Habitats Directives.</p><p>  My Department administers a small-scale farm plan scheme, which supports farmers in adopting appropriate management practices in the Natura 2000 network. These include supports for sheep destocking on western hills, for managing land for corncrakes and hen harriers, and, separately, as part-contribution to schemes such as the Burren Farming for Conservation Programme. It should be noted that the main farm plan scheme operated by my Department is currently closed to new applicants.</p><p>  In addition, my Department has also put in place a comprehensive compensation scheme for those affected by the cessation of turf cutting on raised bog habitat selected as SACs under the  Habitats Directive.</p><p>  Expenditure so far this year by my Department on these schemes amounts to some &euro;3.9 million. I am not in a position, at this stage, to give an estimate for expenditure on these schemes in 2014.</p></reply>

I am pleased to report on a very successful outcome of the <i>Culture Connects</i>   Programme.  Over the six months of the Presidency, approximately 1,000 events were presented throughout Ireland, across the European Union and the world.</p><p>  The National and International elements of this Programme were designed to:</p><p>i. showcase Irish culture across Europe; </p><p>ii. highlight European culture in Ireland; and </p><p>iii. illustrate the shared nature of much of our cultural experiences.</p><p>Throughout the Presidency, the Culture Programme was strongly promoted by my Department with:</p><p> - a dedicated microsite which was regularly updated;</p><p> - the calendar of events was included in the main EU Presidency website; </p><p> - regular updates on Twitter and Facebook;</p><p> - collaboration with the Embassy Network across the EU to ensure promotion and integration with other Irish agencies;</p><p> - the commissioning of a DVD which was uploaded to the YouTube as well as the EU Presidency website.</p><p>  The programme consisted of international and domestic strands.  The international strand of Ireland's Culture Programme was delivered by my Department's Culture Ireland Division at a cost of &euro;1.55 million.  <i>Culture Connects</i>   was successful in projecting a strong, positive image of Ireland to audiences within the EU and beyond.  It demonstrated the wealth of our historic cultural engagement with Europe and also our world-class contemporary artistic strengths. with a tightly focused programme of events with special strategic engagement with key EU partners particularly Germany, France and Brussels.</p><p>  Under the international strand, my Department supported:</p><p> - 420 separate events, exhibitions and performances;</p><p> - Activity in all 26 EU Member States; and</p><p> - Activity in 11 other key territories as part of the International Culture Programme - Australia, Bosnia, Serbia, China, Croatia, Norway, Switzerland, the Russian Federation, Turkey, Australia and Hong Kong.</p><p>  Highlights of the International Strand of the Culture Programme included</p><p> - the opening concert in Brussels by The Gloaming;</p><p> - the Irish Chamber Orchestra's performance in Berlin; </p><p> - the Eileen Gray exhibition in Centre Pompidou, Paris; and </p><p> - the <i>Changing States</i>   exhibition of Frances Bacon and contemporary artists in the Bozar Gallery in Brussels.</p><p>  Audience attendance was strong and feedback and media coverage on Ireland's Culture Programme is very positive.  For instance, the Centre Pompidou attracted approx 500,000 visitors to the Eileen Gray exhibition. </p><p>  There was also a high concentration of cultural events over the course of the St. Patrick's weekend, with 25 events funded in places as diverse as Moscow, Beijing and Croatia.</p><p>  The Domestic Strand</p><p>  The domestic strand was allocated &euro;1.15 million.  Of this &euro;800,000 was dispersed through the Arts Council to support events throughout Ireland, with the balance going to the RHA, the National Cultural Institutions, and the Office of Public Works, inter alia, the domestic strand comprised the following:</p><p> - The National Gallery of Ireland   exhibited its European works including Degas and Gainsborough at the &quot;Treasured Sheets&quot; exhibition.  By end June,  it had attracted over 350,000 visitors; </p><p> - A Bloomsday exhibition by the National Library   which included participation in the Global reading of &quot;Ulysses&quot;;</p><p> - In a series of concerts, the National Concert Hall  , celebrated the work of seventeen European composers;</p><p> - An exhibition by the National Archives   celebrating Irelands' 40 years membership of the European Union was on display in Collins Barracks and is touring throughout the country for the remainder of 2013.</p><p> - The, Irish Museum of Modern Art   in association with the Crawford Gallery in Cork curated an exhibition entitled Analysing Cubism.</p><p> - The OPW, in collaboration with Embassies and various cultural organisations throughout Europe, curated the Kaleidoscope exhibition at Farmleigh which is a selection of contemporary art works from all the Member States of the Union;</p><p> - An international conference entitled <i>Eminent Europeans of Irish Origin</i> at the Royal Irish Academy ;</p><p> - An number of exhibition in the Royal Hibernian Academy   including works by Gerhard Richter and Sigmar Polke;</p><p> - The inaugural World Actors Forum   centred in the Gate Theatre.

This Charter places new responsibilities on Government Departments, agencies, cultural institutions and arts organisations in terms of providing and promoting arts education to children and young people. </p><p>  This Charter has been agreed by both Ministers.  Minister Quinn and I believe passionately in arts education and want to see a joined-up Government approach across Departments, education agencies and arts organisations.  The charter will see organisations like the Arts Council, the National Cultural Institutions, the Colleges of Education and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment working with both Departments in order to bring the arts into the classroom and learners into the institutes for the arts. </p><p>  A High Level Implementation Group was established to oversee the implementation of the Art in Education Charter earlier in the year and it will report twice a year.</p><p>  The Implementation Group is chaired by Professor John Coolahan, Professor Emeritus, NUI Maynooth.  It membership includes Orlaith McBride, Director of the Arts Council, Mary Nunan, Irish World Academy of Music and Dance, University of Limerick, Alan Wall Director, Department of Education and Skills and Niall O Donnch&uacute;, Assistant Secretary, Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  </p><p>  The Group has met on a number of occasions and has been proactive in meeting organisations from both the arts and education sectors.  Progress is being made on a number of initiatives including developing a website / portal as a key communications and information channel for both the education and arts sectors.  Suitable models for Art Rich Schools and for artists become involved in the programme are also being examined by the Arts Council and this Group. </p><p>  There is no specific funding provision in my Department's Vote for arts in education this year.  However, the Deputies may be aware that in May 2012 I announced the introduction of a new philanthropic initiative on a pilot basis for arts and culture organisations.  </p><p>  This year, &euro;210,000 will be available to arts organisations under this scheme and the majority of the Philanthropy Initiative funding will be directed towards arts and culture organisations seeking support for projects that include an education component.  The application form includes a provision that in the event of multiple applications competing for limited grant allocation, priority will be given to Arts in Education projects aimed at disadvantaged (DEIS) schools.  </p></reply>

Funding for this work has been provided for in my Department&rsquo;s vote for 2013.

All known archaeological monuments, of which there are in excess of 130,000, are entitled to protection under the National Monuments Acts.  The Acts allow me to make a preservation order where I consider a national monument to be at risk.  Protection may be extended to previously unrecorded monuments by entering them in the Register of Historic Monuments or the Record of Monuments and Places.     Many monuments are located in the more remote parts of the country and the assistance of local communities is crucial in aiding my Department in their protection.  The vigilance of local people has proved to be of crucial assistance in identifying unlawful interference with archaeological monuments and objects and in their successful investigation and recovery.  Prosecutions in respect of damage to recorded monuments are also initiated where warranted and there have been a number of successful convictions in the recent past, while several other investigations by an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are ongoing.</p><p>  My Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service and the Office of Public Works, which is responsible for care and maintenance of national monuments sites, will continue to keep security measures for such sites under ongoing review.</p></reply>

The first is a legal agreement for qualifying turf cutters who are signing up to the annual payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, for 15 years. The second is a relocation interim legal agreement for qualifying turf cutters who have expressed an interest in relocation but no relocation site is currently available for them to relocate to. This relocation interim legal agreement provides for the payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, or a supply of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum while these applicants are awaiting relocation to non-designated bogs. The third is a relocation final legal agreement. This agreement has been issued to qualifying turf cutters where a site has been assessed as suitable for relocation and is ready or can be made ready for use for domestic turf cutting.</p><p>  Turf cutters who sign and return the applicable legal agreement to my Department will also receive a once-off incentive payment of &euro;500.</p><p>  The interim legal agreement is required in the case of relocation sites because, for the majority of raised bog special areas of conservation, the relocation site and the terms and conditions applicable to those sites will take time to finalise. Turf cutters are being asked to sign the interim agreement on the understanding that when a relocation site is sourced, assessed and agreed they will be asked to sign a final legal agreement at that time. If it is not possible to find a suitable relocation site, for example, for reasons of quality or quantity of turf, planning requirements, or issues in relation to the purchase or lease of a site, then the Department will consult with turf cutters as to the best option to take at that time.</p><p>  For the avoidance of all doubt, it is the absolute aim of my Department to secure a relocation site for every person who has applied for one. That is what my officials are working to achieve, and progress is being made in that task. However, I feel it is important to be upfront with turf cutters and be clear that relocation is a complex process that does take some time to deliver. The agreements being issued reflect this reality. The interim agreement is designed to give all stakeholders the time to deliver relocation options that work for turf cutters. The clear directions that I have given my officials is to examine all relocation options with a view to securing alternative cutting locations for as many turf cutters within the shortest timeframe.</p></reply>

A particular criterion is for a site to be considered to be of outstanding universal value, defined by UNESCO as meaning of &#8220;cultural and or natural significance which is so exceptional as to transcend national boundaries and to be of common importance for present and future generations of all humanity.&#8221;</p><p>  The nomination process is initiated by the relevant State authorities drawing up a Tentative List of what they consider to be the most important heritage sites within their national boundaries.  Following a public consultation process and consideration by an expert advisory group, a new Tentative List   for Ireland was approved and submitted to UNESCO in March 2010 containing the following sites:</p><p>  - The Burren;</p><p>  - C&eacute;ide Fields and North West Mayo Boglands;</p><p>  - The Monastic City of Clonmacnoise and its Cultural Landscape; </p><p>  - The Historic City of Dublin;</p><p>  - Early Medieval Monastic Sites (Clonmacnoise, Durrow, Glendalough, Inis Cealtra, Kells and Monasterboice);</p><p>  - The Royal Sites of Ireland (Cashel, D&uacute;n Ailinne, Hill of Uisneach, Rathcroghan Complex, Tara Complex and potentially Navan Fort in Armagh);</p><p>  - Western Stone Forts (Aran Islands - 7 forts, Cahercommaun, The Burren, Caherconree, Staigue, Benagh and Dingle Peninsula.</p><p>  The nomination of a property to the World Heritage List is a significant undertaking that requires the development of comprehensive nomination documentation, including a management plan for the property.  Following submission of a nomination to UNESCO, it is evaluated by three advisory bodies:</p><p>  - the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS); </p><p>  - the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN); and </p><p>  - the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM).</p><p>  Once the site has been evaluated, the intergovernmental World Heritage Committee makes the final decision regarding the site's inclusion on the World Heritage List.  </p><p>  I believe that there are significant economic and cultural benefits to be gained from having additional Irish sites added to UNESCO's World Heritage list. I also share UNESCO's view that the nomination process must be driven at a local level and enjoy strong support amongst the communities within the potential world heritage areas.  In order to further progress the nomination process for the sites on the current Tentative List, I have arranged a seminar in the Autumn for local authorities and relevant local/community groups from areas with sites on the Tentative List.</p><p>  The objective of the seminar will be to guide and equip participants, in particular the local authorities, to produce the detailed material needed by my Department to support the preparation and submission of substantive applications to UNESCO for World Heritage inscription.  The seminar will assemble relevant experts, local authorities and other groups and provide a forum where all elements of applying for and retaining World Heritage status will be explored and explained.</p><p>  I expect that, following the Autumn seminar, there will be a substantive basis for advancing one or more sites from the current Tentative List with a view to inscription on the World Heritage list.  Against that background, my immediate priority will be to achieve progress with UNESCO inscriptions from the current Tentative List and it would be premature at this point to speculate as the when the next review of the Tentative List might take place.  However, as I have indicated, drawing up a proposal for inclusion on the Tentative List requires a great deal of research and agreement amongst all stakeholders and it would be very worthwhile for the relevant interests in the areas you have cited to make a start on that process at  local level in anticipation of the next review.</p></reply>

Clearly, this limits the influence that can be brought to bear on the gender balance of such boards. I would point out to the Deputy, however, that in the case of three sets of board appointments where such restrictions did not apply and where all members were appointed by me, as the Minister, I took steps to ensure that the gender target of 40% was, in fact, exceeded &ndash; National Concert Hall Board (60%), Heritage Council Board (50%) and Irish Film Board (42%).</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, my Department was established in June 2011 and, accordingly, it is not feasible to provide comparative data of the nature referred to in the Question.</p></reply>

Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Louth, can be found on ComReg's website at .  Under EU State Aid rules, the State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services.  The National Broadband Scheme and the Rural Broadband Scheme are examples of two such interventions.</p><p>  With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland through a combination of private investment and State interventions, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all of our citizens and businesses in advance of the EU's target date of 2020.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services.  In tandem with these commercial developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access.  The National Broadband Plan commits the Government to investing with the private sector to deliver high speed services to areas which are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market alone.</p><p>  In order to progress the State-led investment, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My officials have commenced a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to deliver high speed broadband services over the coming years.  This will culminate in the development of coverage maps which will aggregate the information provided by operators.  These maps will indicate the current and future availability of high speed broadband throughout the country, as well as where there are gaps.  The situation pertaining to County Louth will be captured within the maps, which will be made available on my Department's website.</p><p>  The results of this mapping exercise will inform the level of Government intervention that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.  </p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p></reply>

Following the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010, the Commission carried out an analysis of the legislative and regulatory situation in the European Union, and suggested a course of action, including revision of existing legislation, as well as future new proposals, strengthening EU intervention capacity, and action at regional and global levels.   Following detailed negotiations among Member States, facilitated by both the Cyprus and Irish Presidencies of the European Union, agreement was reached in March of this year during the Irish Presidency, on a proposal on safety of offshore oil and gas prospection, exploration and production activities.</p><p>  The Offshore Safety Directive provides for a new area of competence for the EU in the respect of the regulation of offshore oil and gas exploration and production activities addressing their potential to give rise to both safety and major environmental hazards.  The Directive introduces a number of very important and complex provisions for improving safety for offshore gas and oil drilling which include, in the first instance, reaching agreement on a text relating to the establishment of the Competent Authority in each Member State.  The position agreed recognises both the difference in activity levels among Member States and the potential additional burden on them, which the new Directive could give rise to. While the agreement achieved acknowledges the need to have regard to such factors, it does so without diluting the need for safety at all times.</p><p>  The issue of liability regimes is also addressed, and it was the view of the Council that it could not come to a pre-judgment on such a crucial issue pending the outcome of EU Commission studies, which are due to report next year.  Another matter of considerable significance is the inclusion of provisions with regard to public participation, ensuring that either Strategic Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Assessment would be undertaken with respect to all relevant offshore activities prior to their approval and commencement.  Other noteworthy issues that are included are confidential reporting, response effectiveness, activities in the Arctic, the role of the European Maritime Safety Agency, activities outside the EU and criminalising conduct leading to a major accident.</p><p>  The agreement reached will ensure a consistent use of best practices for major hazards control by oil and gas industry offshore operations potentially affecting Union waters or shores, implement best regulatory practices in all European jurisdictions with offshore oil and gas activities, strengthen the Union&rsquo;s preparedness and response capacity to deal with emergencies potentially affecting EU citizens or the environment, and improve and clarify existing liability and compensation provisions. </p><p>  Ultimately the goal of the safety regulation of offshore exploration activity is to improve safety in extremely challenging environments.  There will be significant safety measures arising from this Directive that will benefit our global environment.</p><p>It is a requirement of the Directive that it be transposed into, national legislation within 2 years.</p></reply>

Among the issues it identifies are the implementation and enforcement of internal market legislation, the requirement to cease the regulation of electricity and gas prices, the need to modernise the European electricity and gas networks, the need to encourage and reward demand side flexibility, the need for State support to be well-designed and targeted and the need for consumers to engage more actively in the market.</p><p>  The aim of the Irish Presidency during the first half of 2013 was to facilitate agreement by all Member States&rsquo; Ministers on various issues and to represent the agreed positions in the &quot;Council Conclusions&quot;.

My Department and the Department of Social Protection have been working closely on the legal, policy and operational issues involved in this project.</p><p>  Work has also been on-going with the County and City Managers Association (CCMA), through the Project Steering Group, in overseeing plans for the implementation of HAP. In June a Project Implementation Team was initiated, which will be responsible for detailed planning and implementation during the testing and roll-out phases. A detailed business process design for HAP is currently underway which involves input from all the relevant key stakeholders. Following the completion of the business process design the implementation team will, in conjunction with my Department, develop a plan for the test phase in a number of local authorities.</p><p>  In respect of the staff resources, the CCMA, through its involvement in both the Project Steering Group and the Project Implementation Team, is providing on-going advice in relation to the resources that will be required by local authorities to implement HAP. This input will continue as the detail of the scheme is developed further this year.</p><p>  One of the specific objectives of HAP is to facilitate better regulation of the private rented sector which it is intended would lead to improved standards of accommodation, improved levels of registration with the PRTB and strengthened processes for ensuring tax compliance by landlords. Landlords will be expected to comply with the terms of the Scheme in these regards. While I do not anticipate an issue with tenants being able to secure appropriate accommodation in the private rented sector under HAP, I will be keeping this matter under review in the pilot phase of HAP implementation.</p></reply>

Over 1,000 ships a year are recycled worldwide. Contrary to most other waste streams, ships generally have a significant financial value at end-of-life. Steel is the main material extracted in the recycling process but older ships, in particular, also contain many hazardous substances including asbestos and heavy metals. Much of the recycling is carried out in facilities that lack sufficient safety measures or environmental protection for workers, which leads to high accident rates and extensive pollution.</p><p>  It is intended that the new Regulation will provide a much-needed stimulus to raise standards for recycling all ships, in the interim period before the entry into force of the 2009 Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships. The Regulation covers the whole life-cycle of EU-flagged ships and transposes for the EU the requirements of the Hong Kong Convention. The Regulation is the first legislative instrument adopted at regional level in respect of this significant waste stream containing hazardous substances.</p><p>The new EU ship recycling regime comprises the following main elements:</p><p> - EU ship owners will be required to only recycle ships at facilities on the EU approved list, either in the EU or in third countries;</p><p> - in order to be on the EU approved list, ship recycling facilities must comply with the minimum requirements of the regulation as to worker health and safety procedures and environmental protection;</p><p>- ship recycling facilities must be approved by national authorities in the case of EU facilities and by independent verifiers with appropriate qualifications in the case of non-EU facilities. Such non-EU facilities must remain open to inspection by EU inspectors in order to verify their ongoing compliance with the requirements of the regulation;</p><p>- ships will be required to maintain an inventory of hazardous materials on board at all times;</p><p>- ships entering EU ports are to   be open to inspections by port state control authorities to verify the maintenance of the inventory;</p><p>- EU ships will be subject to surveys at 5-yearly intervals after being put in service;</p><p>- owners of EU ships will be required to engage an approved ship recycling facility to prepare a &ldquo;ship recycling plan&rdquo; prior to 	recycling, such plan to include how hazardous materials in the ship structure are to be managed and which shall be submitted to the flag state administration;</p><p>- flag state administrations will issue a &ldquo;ready for recycling&rdquo; certificate before authorising the recycling of EU ships, having - (i) verified that the hazardous materials inventory has been properly maintained, (ii) approved the ship recycling plan, and (iii) verified that the ship recycling facility where the ship is to be recycled is included in the EU approved list; and</p><p>- the ship re cycling facility must confirm the completion of the recycling of the ship to the EU flag state administration.</p><p>  I am confident that the new regulation will be effective and make a positive contribution to the proper recycling of EU ships which can be followed globally. I also hope that this new EU regulation will act as an important stimulus to facilitate the early ratification of the Hong Kong Convention on Ship Recycling which was adopted in 2009 and that, on foot of this EU initiative, other global regions will follow the EU lead in respect of this important waste stream.</p></reply>

This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body who in turn rent it to the original owners. Eligibility requirements are in line with other forms of social housing support. To date, over 1,200 cases have been submitted by lenders. Of these, 415 borrowers have been engaged with or are in the process of being engaged with by the lender. 47 sales have now been agreed or completed.</p><p>  A pilot mortgage to rent scheme for the most acute cases of local authority mortgage arrears is currently being operated by Westmeath County and Dublin City Councils ahead of national roll-out later this year.</p></reply>

The list of unfinished housing developments eligible for the exemption was compiled by local authorities utilising the categorisation employed for the purposes of the National Housing Survey 2012. The Survey was carried out over the course of summer 2012 by my Department in conjunction with local authorities and the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency.</p><p>  The categorisation methodology for the survey was different to that which was used in 2011 and which provided the basis for the waiver from the household charge. That earlier categorisation related largely to the level of on-site activity at the time the 2011 survey was carried out and had less to do with the physical character of a development. The 2012 survey was based purely and objectively on the actual state of completion of a development and established that there were approximately 1,700 unfinished developments, with 1,100 of them deemed to be in a seriously problematic condition. This represents a 37% reduction in unfinished developments since 2010.</p><p>  Only developments that were deemed by local authorities to be in a &ldquo;seriously problematic condition&rdquo;, regardless of whether a developer was on or off site, were included in the LPT regulations. For purposes of preparing the final list of developments to which the exemption from the local property tax would apply local authorities were asked by my Department to confirm or update the then existing list of estates in a &ldquo;seriously problematic condition&rdquo; as appropriate.</p></reply>

Any legislative proposals that may arise from this exercise will progress though the normal EU co-decision procedures. Decisions in relation to any additional national legislative measures that may be required to allow Ireland to ratify the Convention will arise at that point.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-18a.1301.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013071800047#WRJJ02600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 475 and 476 together. </p><p>  One of the key informants of social housing supply policy is the level of demand for social housing support nationally and individually at local authority level. Sections of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 dealing with social housing support, and related Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, contain national eligibility criteria which must be applied by all housing authorities in assessing a household's eligibility for social housing support. The Regulations provide for certain information to be gathered in respect of households which are determined to have a need, including the number, gender and ages of persons in the household. In this regard I am confident that when I directed all housing authorities to prepare a summary of social housing assessments carried out in their areas on 7 May 2013, the results to be published later this year will give an accurate reflection of the level and type of need at both local authority and national level.   </p><p>  In terms of addressing that need, Government policy is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support requirements through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. In July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing. I am monitoring expenditure under my Department's housing programme for 2013, together with the level of contractual commitments extending into 2014, with a view to a decision later this year on approving some limited new construction and house purchases over the period to end 2014. Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government's objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). My Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure the identification of suitable housing units for social purposes and this process is on-going. </p><p>  Given the current volatility of the market and different challenges to the channels of supply it is difficult to estimate the likely output of new units for social housing this year or in subsequent years. However, it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will be provided for social housing in 2013.</p></reply>

The investment priorities for this sector in any year are set out in the circular seeking proposals from authorities. In submitting their bids for funds, authorities generally list potential schemes to support the bids. However, the selection, prioritisation and approval of individual scheme proposals for advancement and funding under the programme, within the overall priorities set by my Department and subject to the block grant allocations provided, remains a matter for the water services authorities, Kildare County Council in this case.   </p><p>  My Department asked local authorities to include in their requests for funding under the 2013 Rural Water Programme proposals for pilot group sewerage schemes which might be viable. </p><p>  Following an examination of the proposals received, with particular regard to the environmental justification provided and the estimated costs, I approved grant assistance last March towards eight pilot schemes in eight different counties, including one , with an estimated cost of &euro;80,000, at Boston Cottages in Co. Kildare . The second proposal received from Kildare County Council (for Kilmacredock), which had an estimated cost of &euro;800,000, was not selected as a pilot scheme. I approved a further three pilot schemes as a result of a mid-year Review carried out by my Department recently. None of these additional pilot schemes was located in County Kildare      </p><p>  Progress on the selected pilot schemes will be reviewed in due course with a view to deciding how best to proceed with the grant scheme.   </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-18a.1329.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013071800047#WRKK02000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 485 and 486 together. </p><p>  The LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme 2007 &ndash; 2013 commenced in February 2009 after a delay of more than two years which reduced the time available to allocate funding to less than five years rather than the original seven. Two main issues have impacted on the revised allocations recently notified to Local Development Companies (LDCs). </p><p>  The first relates to overall Programme performance. During 2010 and 2011 it became evident that a significant number of LDCs, who were contracted to deliver the Programme, were not committing funds at the level required to ensure that all the funding would be allocated by the December 2013 deadline. Similarly it became clear that a number of LDCs were more than capable of allocating additional funding if it was made available. </p><p>  In this regard, in January 2012 my Department notified all LDCs that the original allocations awarded in 2009 were no longer valid and that the Programme was being opened up on a &lsquo;first-come first served&rsquo; basis to all LDCs in order to ensure that all the available funding would be allocated to eligible projects within the timeframe allowed. All LDCs were encouraged to maximise the opportunity this created for them. All LDCs had an equal opportunity to maximise funding in their respective areas, and some companies availed of this more than others. </p><p>  The second issue relates to the change in co-financing rates. During 2011, the European Commission approved a change in the maximum co-funding rate from 55% to 85% for the LEADER elements of Ireland&rsquo;s RDP but only for expenditure incurred in 2012 and 2013. This had the effect of reducing the available funding under the Programme from &euro;427 million to an estimated &euro;370 million. </p><p>  In January 2013 in light of all the changes to the Programme it became necessary to carry out a comprehensive review of the level of commitments and expenditure across the various measures of the Programme in order to apportion the remaining funds among the LDCs, taking into account the level of commitments already entered into. </p><p>  Using an estimated final programme allocation of &euro;370 million the total spend to date and outstanding contractual commitments under the Programme were established and deducted from the &euro;370 million. &euro;6 million was provided for the former MFG legacy files, new Gaeltacht projects and associated administration costs. Funding was also provided for projects that were greater than &euro;150,000 in value that had been submitted to my Department for assessment. The original percentage of the Programme which was awarded to each LDC in 2009 was then applied to apportion the remaining funding. Where an LDC would receive less than 80% of its original allocation, an adjustment was made to bring the revised allocation up to 80% of the original. </p><p>  In the case of Cavan Monaghan LEADER the revised allocation represents a decrease of 17.5% from their original allocation. The redistribution of available funding was conducted in as fair and equitable a manner as was possible with many LDCs experiencing similar reductions. </p><p>  I am committed to the continued monitoring of this situation and my Department will conduct another formal review of commitments and expenditure levels at the end of August 2013. If LDCs are not performing with regard to the Programme commitment levels, allocations will again be revised in the context of maximizing commitments to the end of the Programme by December 2013.   </p></reply>

A cadastral map is a map that shows the boundaries and ownership of the individual land parcels.</p><p>  We do not operate a cadastre in Ireland at present and no individual State organisation holds all of the relevant data. However, the data which could potentially form elements of a cadastre is established through the functions of different State Agencies, including the Property Registration Authority, the Valuation Office and Ordnance Survey Ireland. </p><p>  Our system of Land Registration, which was established in 1892 and is now under the control of the Property Registration Authority is based on an &quot;open&quot; register underpinned by a State guarantee and was designed to gradually replace a registration of deeds system which had been in place since 1707. Since its introduction, the programme of land registration in Ireland has been both extensive and very successful and almost 2.8 million land parcels, representing approximately 95% of all property in the country, are now registered in the Land Registry of the Property Registration Authority.</p><p>  When title or ownership is registered in the Land Registry, the legal ownership is entered on folios which form the registers maintained in the Land Registry. In conjunction with folios, the Land Registry also maintains Land Registry maps. Where title is registered in the Land Registry it is referred to as &quot;registered property&quot; and is open to public inspection. </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the radical streamlining of State bodies is a key deliverable of the Public Service Reform Plan, published in November 2011. As part of the implementation of the Reform Plan, the Government announced on 31 October 2012 that it would proceed with the merger of the Property Registration Authority with the Valuation Office and Ordnance Survey Ireland. Work is underway to advance the implementation of the merger under the supervision of a Project Board comprised of senior officials from the three Government Departments concerned and the Chief Executive Officers of the three Agencies. Among the issues to be examined in the context of the merger are the strategic goals and priorities of the prospective merged organisation. It is anticipated that it will be possible to derive significant added value from the bringing together of the rich data holdings of the three organisations concerned. It is possible that the development of a cadastre system for Ireland may be considered in that context. I should note that full implementation of the merger will require significant legislative change in due course, and that any move to a cadastre system could potentially have very significant implications in relation to land and property law in Ireland.</p></reply>

I am aware too of reports which have appeared about the alleged activities of other security agencies.  I raised the concerns which had been expressed about the PRISM programme with the US Attorney General Eric Holder at my recent meetings with him in Dublin.  At these meetings, the US Attorney General provided clarity on a number of issues, in particular with regard to the nature of the information collected and processed, i.e. phone numbers, duration of calls etc - but not the content of calls.  He also advised that the data was collected under judicial authority and only where there was a reasonable suspicion of serious crime.</p><p>  We cannot ignore the very important fact that there is a recognised need to protect our citizens from terrorist threats and dealing with that does require access to certain data.  I will continue to make the point at international level that in doing so it is necessary to ensure that the information used is properly obtained and subject to appropriate safeguards.  I have emphasised the importance of protecting individual rights to privacy and ensuring respect for individual human rights contained in the European Convention on Human Rights as well as the crucial need to ensure that any security surveillance undertaken is balanced and appropriate.</p><p>  It was agreed that data protection and security experts from the US and from the EU would meet to clarify remaining matters as necessary.  The Presidency in office and the responsible European Commissioner will lead on this from the European side with regard to the data protection and privacy matters within EU competence.  A first meeting has taken place to initiate this process and a further meeting is due to take place later this month to further discuss issues arising.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that in this country we have data protection legislation to protect individuals against unwarranted invasion into their privacy and a clear legal framework for the accessing of information.  In turn, that framework is subject to judicial oversight.  More generally, I can tell the Deputy that substantial progress was made during the Irish Presidency  advancing key aspects of the EU's data protection reform package.  A further indicator of our commitment in this area is the significant increases which have taken place in the resources made available to the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, notwithstanding the current difficult economic circumstances.</p></reply>

The legislative basis for the Internal Security Fund comprises the following two measures:</p><p>A proposed Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing, as part of the Internal Security Fund, the instrument for financial support for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management.  The objectives of this instrument include contributing to crime prevention, the combating of cross-border, serious and organised crime including terrorism, reinforcing coordination and cooperation between law enforcement authorities of Member States, enhancing the capacity of Member States and the Union for managing effectively security-related risks and crisis, and preparing for and protecting people and critical infrastructure against terrorist attacks and other security related incidents. (Ireland has opted into this proposed Regulation under Article 3 of Protocol 21 annexed to the Lisbon Treaty.)</p><p>A proposed Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing, as part of the Internal Security Fund, the instrument for financial support for external borders and visas.  The purpose of this instrument will be to provide contributory funding at national and EU levels for the operation of Schengen border control and visa systems, thus contributing to enhanced security throughout the EU.  (Ireland will not be participating in this Regulation as it is a development of aspects of the Schengen <i>acquis </i>  in which Ireland does not participate.)</p><p>  The Irish Presidency engaged extensively with the European Parliament in relation to these and other MFF dossiers and made significant progress, including securing provisional agreement on most technical aspects of the dossiers.  Following the Irish Presidency's success in securing an agreement between the European Council and the European Parliament on the overall MFF package, negotiations on the individual financial breakdowns within these instruments will now take place under the Lithuanian Presidency.</p></reply>

I am advised that in 2013, some &euro;19 million has been allocated to fund MABS and that sanction has been given for 16 temporary staff to be assigned to MABS for up to two years, to establish an Approved Intermediary service. In addition to this dedicated services there will  also be additional Approved Intermediaries, when authorised, located in MABS offices throughout the country. These Approved Intermediaries will not charge any fee for arranging a Debt Relief Notice. In accordance with the provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, Approved Intermediaries can only process Debt Relief Notices and do not have any role in relation to Debt Settlement Arrangements or Personal Insolvency Arrangements.</p><p>  With regard to Debt Settlement Arrangements (DSA) and Personal Insolvency Arrangements (PIA) there are two separate sets of fees. The ISI fee for applying for a Protective Certificate for a DSA or a PIA and the Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) fee.  The fee payable to the ISI in relation to the issue of a Protective Certificate for a DSA will be &euro;250 and &euro;500 for a PIA. Insofar as Practitioner fees associated with the development of DSAs and PIAs are concerned, these fees will be negotiated with an individual debtor by the PIP in advance of a case proceeding and will be deducted from the amount of money an individual debtor is calculated as having available to pay their creditors during the term of the arrangement. These arrangements could last for up to 7 years. As such this fee should have a relatively minor impact on the debtor themselves. In fact some prospective Personal Insolvency Practitioners (PIPs) have indicated that, if and when authorised by the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) to practice, they will not charge upfront fees for initial consultations with insolvent debtors. Furthermore, the Regulations relating to PIPs require them to clearly specify their level of charges and associated costs before being appointed by the debtor to develop an arrangement for a PIA or DSA.   Based on experience in other jurisdictions, I am advised by the ISI that there have been indications that the issue of fees rarely arises. It is anticipated that debtors will be able to afford the application fees. It should also be noted that the reasonable living expenses guidelines published under Section 23 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 make allowances for savings and contingencies in addition to social inclusion money. It will therefore be possible for debtors to build up  the money required for the ISI fee over a relatively short period of time.  In cases where an insolvency arrangement is not possible, it will be open to the individual debtor to petition for bankruptcy, the term of which is being reduced from 12 years to 3 years under the provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.</p></reply>

The Group was established on 30 November 2011.  I issued invitations to relevant Departments and a broad range of disability organisations to nominate a representative to become a member of the group and as a result the NDSIG now comprises representatives from across Government, a representative from the County and City Managers Association, the National Disability Authority, a range of disability organisations, and a number of individuals appointed in their personal capacity to bring their lived experience to the table.</p><p>  The disability organisations that are represented on the NDSIG are Inclusion Ireland, Disability Federation of Ireland, Mental Health Reform, National Federation of Voluntary Bodies, Not for Profit Business Association, National Service Users Executive and the Centre for Independent Living.  After significant consultation and consideration the Implementation Plan was agreed by the NDSIG at our meeting of 20 June 2013. This Plan sets out the practical measures that will be taken to advance the National Disability Strategy over the period 2013 to 2015.  It is the responsibility of each relevant Minister and their Department to make adequate resources available to meet their Departments' commitments in the Plan.</p></reply>

The situation as outlined by An Taoiseach at that time has not changed. No further contact has been made by or on behalf of the individual in question and no valid asylum application has been received which can be processed in accordance with the statutory provisions in this Jurisdiction.  The Deputy might wish to note that it is a generally accepted principle internationally, and one which Ireland applies, that a person should seek asylum in the first safe host country in which they arrive.  It would appear that the individual referred to by the Deputy is already present in a safe host country and I note from media reports that he appears to have now applied for asylum there.  In consequence of all the above, the other asylum issues referred to by the Deputy would not appear to arise.</p><p>  The processing of asylum applications and appeals in Ireland takes place within a well defined national and international (Geneva Convention, EU Directives and Regulations) legal framework.  The granting of refugee status in Ireland is considered in accordance with the definition contained in the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, as amended by the 1967 New York Protocol thereto, and as defined in Section 2 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended).    Accordingly, Ireland remains steadfast in it commitments to its international obligations in this regard.  While decisions on extradition are ultimately a matter for the courts,  I have made it clear publicly that the Irish and US authorities have remained in close contact in relation to the possible extradition of the person in question and, for its part, the Government will take any action open to it to ensure that the State's obligations in relation to extradition arrangements are met.  It would not be a matter for me as Minister to comment on any case a person might make to the courts in relation to an extradition application.  It may be helpful to add, however, in the context of a person seeking asylum here, that the Refugee Act, 1996 makes it clear that nothing in it shall be construed as preventing the extradition of a person in accordance with the provisions of the Extradition Acts.</p></reply>

The Authority will be an independent body under the aegis of the Department of Justice and Equality.  In addition to functions set out in the Charities Act, it will take on the functions of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland.  The Authority will have a staff of approximately 20.  It is envisaged that the Board of the new Authority will be designated later this year, so that the Authority can come into formal operation in 2014.  A call for expressions of interest from suitably qualified persons who wish to be considered for appointment to the Board of the new Authority will issue from my Department in the coming months.  To ensure the smooth transfer of functions of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland to the new Authority, it is envisaged that a number of serving Commissioners will also be appointed to the Board of the new Authority.</p><p>  It is intended that registered charities themselves will be asked to meet some of the cost of their regulation through payment of a modest annual registration fee.  The levying of such a fee is provided for in the Charities Act, and the ability to do this enables us to move ahead with putting this much-needed regulatory system in place.  We have consulted with the charity sector on the fee structure to be adopted and my Department will take account of the views expressed by charities when deciding on appropriate fee levels.  By adopting this approach, the regulation of the sector will in time become largely self-financing.  The outcome of the public consultation on charities regulation carried out by my Department earlier this year has been published on the Department's website at www.justice.ie.</p></reply>

In that context, during the course of 2011, I sought to develop proposals which would give effect to the commitment in the Programme for Government to legislate to end upward-only rent review clauses for leases entered into prior to 28 February 2010.   As is well known, in December of that year the Government took the difficult decision not to proceed with that commitment.  It will be recalled that the background to this decision was a substantial concern that any legislative scheme involving interference in the contractual relationships of private parties would find it extremely difficult to survive a Constitutional challenge.  In addition, the Government was advised that any model proposed would require the payment of compensation to landlords whose rights were infringed in order to ensure that the proposal would be compatible with the Constitution and with the European Convention on Human Rights.   As I have indicated in my replies to previous Parliamentary Questions on the subject of upward only rent review clauses, there are no plans to re-examine the decision which was taken in 2011 not to proceed with legislation in relation to this matter.</p><p>  On a related issue, it is widely acknowledged that one of the difficulties in regard to rent reviews is the absence of readily accessible, accurate information in order to determine the market rent payable in respect of comparable commercial properties.  The Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 provides for the establishment and maintenance of a Commercial Leases Database by the Property Services Regulatory Authority.   While there have been some delays in establishing this Database work is at a very advanced stage to ensure that it will be operational shortly.</p></reply>

The Unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current average processing time for applications is approximately 14 weeks from date of receipt. However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.    All organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.</p><p>  I remain in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner as to how best the service can continue to be delivered and improved upon, while at all times protecting the integrity of the process. Clearly, the protection of children and vulnerable adults is the primary objective of the Garda Central Vetting Unit and this must remain the case.   The possibility of introducing an e-vetting system has been assessed and the Garda authorities are now in the process of developing a system which will enable vetting applications to be submitted electronically through a secure web service.  In addition, the system will facilitate the checking and monitoring of applications.  The relevant work is being pursued on a priority basis and it will be completed as quickly as possible.</p><p>  The Garda Commissioner has informed me that there are now 1 Superintendent, 3 Sergeants and approximately 127 whole time equivalent civilian personnel assigned to the Garda Central Vetting Unit. With further assignments of staff this month, staffing at the Unit will be of the order of 140 (whole time equivalent) staff, which represents an increase in staff assigned to the Unit of almost 50% since March this year. As staff become fully trained on the vetting process I expect there will be a positive effect on vetting times.  My Department is also examining the scope for the redeployment of additional personnel from within the public service to the Unit.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by the treaty in question, including amending domestic law as necessary.</p><p>  The ongoing implementation of our National Disability Strategy in many respects comprehends many of the provision of the Convention. In addition, the Inter-Department Committee on the Convention monitors the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification. The Committee has identified, as part of its work programme, issues to be considered by various Government Departments. It is a matter for those Departments to determine whether any actions are required in relation to these issues in advance of ratification and report back to the Committee.</p><p>  Regarding Article 19 on living independently and being included in the community, this is a matter for all Departments. As some examples, I refer the Deputy to the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government's &quot;National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability 2011-2016&quot; and the Department of Health's &quot;Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion&quot;. In my Department, the services and facilities provided for the general population are available, in so far as possible, on an equal basis to persons with disabilities.</p></reply>

Following the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, the offence is now punishable on indictment by a fine or a term of imprisonment of up to 15 years.</p><p>Since 1997 the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has operated a Witness Security Programme in response to attempts by criminal and other groups to prevent the normal functioning of the criminal justice system, including threats of violence and systematic witness intimidation.   The operation of the Programme is supported by Section 40 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999 which makes it an offence for any person, without lawful authority, to try to identify the whereabouts or any new identity of a witness who has been relocated under the Programme.  The offence is punishable on indictment by a fine or a term of imprisonment of up to five years.</p><p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na rigorously enforces the provisions in the law relating to witness intimidation and protection.  In circumstances where the Senior Investigation Officer in a case has identified a witness who is crucial to the case and the evidence to be preferred is not available elsewhere, and there is a serious threat to the life of the witness or his/her family an application can be made, with the consent of the witness, to have him/her included in the Witness Security Programme.  Where a threat to or intimidation of a witness or a potential witness arises during the course of criminal proceedings, the matter may be addressed through the trial judge, who has discretion to revoke bail or place other sanctions on the accused/suspect.</p><p>The following table shows the number of proceedings commenced and convictions for offences under Section 41 of the 1999 Act for the years 2002 to 16 July 2013.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Proceedings</th><th>Convictions *</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>6</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>16</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>58</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>43</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>31</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>18</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>16</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>45</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>22</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td>30</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>2003</td><td>30</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>2002</td><td>11</td><td>2</td></tr></table></p><p>*Figures are provisional as they are recorded in respect of the year in which proceedings commenced and may change in light of the outcome of court proceedings.</p></reply>

There are currently 17 Peace Commissioners entered on the current Roll of Peace Commissioners residing in the areas referred to.

It is expected that formal adoption of the Regulation will take place in time for the system to come into effect by the end of the year.  The aim of EUROSUR is to reinforce the control of the Schengen external borders. In particular, EUROSUR will establish a mechanism for member states' authorities carrying out border surveillance activities to share operational information and to cooperate with each other and with the FRONTEX Agency in order to reduce the number of irregular immigrants entering the EU undetected, and to increase internal security by preventing cross-border crime, such as trafficking in human beings and the smuggling of drugs. It will also contribute to the protecting and saving the lives of migrants; particularly those at risk on the high seas where tragically lives have been lost of persons in small or makeshift craft seeking to reach European shores.</p><p>  The regulation will apply to the surveillance of land and sea external borders of the member states in the Schengen Area. It may also be applied to the surveillance of air borders as well as to checks at border crossing points if the member states voluntarily provide such information to EUROSUR. It is envisaged that the application of the EUROSUR regulation to the member states located at the southern and eastern external borders will start from December 2013 and to the remaining participating member states from December 2014.</p><p>  The Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part in the border provisions, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002. Ireland is therefore not bound by it or subject to its application. The United Kingdom are in a similar position. However, the Regulation provides for the possibility of close cooperation and exchanges of information with Ireland and the United Kingdom on the basis of bilateral or multilateral agreements between Ireland and the United Kingdom and one or several neighbouring Member States or through regional networks based on these agreements<b></b>which may assist in better achieving the objectives of EUROSUR.</p><p>  For the sake of completeness, it should be noted that, separately, with the objective of protecting the integrity of the Common Travel Area (CTA) arrangement, Ireland and the United Kingdom cooperate closely on a range of measures aimed at securing the external borders of the CTA. The nature of this cooperation is much the same as that envisaged under the EUROSUR arrangement and involves daily operational cooperation between the immigration authorities of both countries.</p></reply>

The relevant Protocol recognised the fact that Ireland and the United Kingdom were not parties to the Schengen Agreement and made provision to allow those Member States to accept some or all of its provisions.  The Schengen Information System is the mechanism through which Schengen-related information is exchanged electronically.  The second generation of this system was brought into operation in April 2013.</p><p>  Ireland has successfully applied to take part in certain elements of the Schengen Agreement, including police cooperation.  Our application to participate in the specified articles of the Agreement was approved by a Council Decision and, in accordance with this Decision, the provisions will come into effect only after a range of technical and legislative measures have been put in place and successfully evaluated by the Council.  Ireland has not, however, applied to participate in the Schengen arrangements to the extent that they deal with the abolition of border checks.  This is because the Common Travel Area with the United Kingdom could not continue to operate if Ireland were to remove border checks with Schengen States generally while the UK did not.  In such circumstances land border controls would appear to be inevitable and it is obviously something that no Irish Government would seriously contemplate bringing about.</p><p>  The measures which are needed to enable Ireland to meet its Schengen requirements are currently being pursued.  These include the provision of national computer facilities to be linked to the Schengen Information System and the project will be progressed in the light of available resources. </p></reply>

The Directive is expected to be formally adopted in the early autumn, once the necessary procedural steps have been completed by both institutions.</p><p>  As its title suggests, the Directive provides a range of rights for suspects and accused persons. These include: the right of access to a lawyer during police questioning and throughout criminal proceedings; the right of an arrested person to have a someone, such as a family member, informed of that arrest and to communicate with that person; and the right of an arrested person to contact their country's consulate.  Ireland is not bound by the Directive as Ireland did not exercise the option under Protocol 21 to the EU Treaties to opt in to the measure as initiated. Under that Protocol, Ireland can, however, opt in to the Directive at any time after it has been adopted. The choice of opting in to the Directive following its adoption remains open.</p></reply>

All Garda vehicles are assigned on an operational basis.  I am advised by the Garda authorities that on 30 June 2013 the Garda Fleet comprised 2,473 vehicles and that on the same date the number of new vehicles assigned in 2013 was 204.</p><p>  Overall, the Deputy will be aware that an additional &euro;3 million was made available towards the end of last year which enabled the Force to procure 171 vehicles. This brought total investment in the Garda fleet in 2012 to &euro;4 million and resulted in a total of 213 new vehicles being procured during the year.  Furthermore, a specific allocation of &euro;5 million has been provided for the purchase and fit-out of Garda transport in the current year.  This represents a very considerable financial investment in Garda transport, particularly at a time when the level of funding available across the public sector is severely limited.  It is a clear indication of my commitment to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are provided with sufficient resources to enable them to deliver an effective and efficient policing service.  In keeping with this approach, I will continue to seek to identify the potential for additional funding for the Garda Fleet.  This will, of course, be contingent on expenditure in other areas across and outside the Justice Sector.</p></reply>

At that time I explained that the independent Selection Panel, which was established to carry out this task, had confirmed to me that it had not proved possible to recruit a Chief Commissioner at that time.  The Selection Panel  suggested that the full-time nature of the position and the length of the contract (5 years) may have been issues that mitigated against the successful recruitment of a Chief Commissioner.  The position was designated as a full-time one as the Paris Principles, which govern the establishment of such bodies, contain a preference for a full-time Commissioners.  When the Chief Commissioner position was advertised it included a requirement that the person to be appointed should not have served on either the Equality Authority or the Human Rights Commission.  This requirement is considered essential to ensure that the Chief Commissioner will bring balance and neutrality to the position in a sensitive merger context and will remain as a requirement when the position is re-advertised.</p><p>  In the light of the experience gained in the recruitment process to date, I consider as already announced that future selection of persons to serve as members of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission should be vested in the Public Appointments Service (PAS).  The PAS has existed in its different forms since the foundation of the State, to ensure integrity and impartiality in the appointment of civil servants and other public servants and is independent in the discharge of its functions and would thus fully meet the Paris Principles&rsquo; requirement for a selection process independent of Government.</p><p>  This is a change in the selection process as originally adopted in the General Scheme of the Bill, which I consider is now required in the light of experience.  I note that use of the PAS was one of the other options considered by the Working Group set up to advise me on practical arrangements for establishment of IHREC in its report.  My Department is in consultation with the Public Appointment Service in relation to the detailed arrangements in that regard and I hope to be in a position to make a further announcement shortly.  Drafting of the IHREC Bill is at a very advanced stage and I expect to publish it in the autumn.</p></reply>

It is important to note that all of the necessary elements must be in place before the ISI can begin to receive applications. These elements include: the authorisation of Practitioners; finalisation of the necessary IT framework and Case Management systems to interface between practitioners, the ISI and the Courts Service; and necessary amendments to the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, as contained in the Courts Bill which is currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p><p>  I can advise the Deputy that no Personal Insolvency Practitioners (PIPs) have yet been authorised. However, the ISI is currently in the process of verifying and approving applications it has received to date. Applications for authorisations as a PIP are made through the ISI's online portal system. To date over 90 people have initiated the application process by logging onto the Portal since the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 (Authorisation and Supervision of Personal Insolvency Practitioners) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No. 209 of 2013) were published in late June. There is no set target on the number of practitioners to be authorised.  The ISI expects to begin issuing authorisations for persons to act as Personal Insolvency Practitioners by the end of this month. The names of practitioners will be published as soon as they are authorised on the relevant Register on the ISI's website, www.isi.gov.ie.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, Section 4 of the Regulations referred to above detailed the qualification criteria for application as a Personal Insolvency Practitioner. An individual may make an application to carry on practice as a PIP if that individual:</p><p> - is a Solicitor in respect of whom a practising certificate (within the meaning of the Solicitors Acts 1954 to 2011) is in force; or</p><p> - is a Barrister at law called to the Bar of Ireland; or</p><p> - is a qualified Accountant and a member of a prescribed accountancy body (within the meaning of Section 4 of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003; or</p><p> - is a Qualified Financial Advisor who holds a current qualification from the Life Assurance Association of Ireland (LIA), the Insurance Institute or the Institute of Bankers School of Professional Finance; or</p><p> - holds a qualification in law, business, finance or other appropriate similar qualification to the satisfaction of the Insolvency Service recognised to at least level 7 of the National Qualifications Framework by Quality and Qualifications Ireland (or equivalent).</p><p>  The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 (Personal Insolvency Practitioner Authorisation and Renewal of Authorisation Prescribed Fees) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No. 246 of 2013) were also published in recent weeks. These Regulations relate to the fees associated with making an application to become a Personal Insolvency Practitioner. The application fee is &euro;1,500, with an annual renewal fee of &euro;1,000.</p></reply>

The Ombudsman says in her article that her examination of a specific case, involving the HSE and the Department of Social Protection around the issue of a social welfare entitlement to a family which had been in Direct Provision, led her to comment on the asylum accommodation system more generally.  It should be noted that the Ombudsman Act, 1980 does not provide for the investigation by the Ombudsman of any action taken by or on behalf of a person in the administration of the law relating to, inter alia, asylum. Notwithstanding that, I should add that INIS has administrative arrangements in place with the Office of the Ombudsman to assist and provide information and help resolve any matters brought to its attention.</p><p>  The Ombudsman is, of course, perfectly entitled to the personal opinions expressed in the article but I do not share many of them.  In particular, I do not accept the attempted correlation between the residents of direct provision accommodation centres and past residents of industrial schools or Magdalene laundries.  It is to be expected that asylum seekers, if given a choice in this jurisdiction or elsewhere, would prefer to have independent accommodation, a right to welfare and work and so on, instead of being restricted to the system of direct provision to meet their needs.  For the avoidance of any misunderstanding, it should be noted that all EU Member States operate systems for dealing with asylum seekers which in one form or another greatly restrict their access to welfare, work or independent housing.  In reality, the system in this State is at least on a par and often significantly better than that in operation in many other Member States. In the circumstances, it is grossly misleading to characterise our treatment of asylum seekers as being akin to that meted out to subjects of abuse who had no protection of the law or relevant State bodies.</p><p>   I have recounted in responses to many D&aacute;&iacute;l Questions how the rights of residents of accommodation centres are protected both within the Direct Provision system and, of course, by the laws of our country. The Ombudsman's article, rightly, places great emphasis on the rights of children in the Direct Provision system. Again, I have explained before how children are protected in a number of ways - primarily through the Reception and Integration Agency's (RIA) Child Protection policy; its House Rules; its requirement that all centre staff are Garda vetted; and through the coordination role of a dedicated Child and Family Services unit in RIA.  Children in Direct Provision centres, of course, enjoy the same educational and health entitlements as Irish citizen children.  Sight must not be lost of the fact that applicants for refugee status, who otherwise would have no permission to be in the State, have their protection claims dealt with in accordance with a prescribed legal framework and exclusively on their merits having regard to their subjective and objective elements.  They have full recourse to the judicial review process in the courts and to the general protection of the State.</p><p>  I accept that the direct provision system is not ideal and many residents spend too long there. But it is a system which facilitates the State providing a roof over the heads of those seeking protection or the right to remain in the State on humanitarian grounds or other reasons.  It allows the State to do it in a manner that facilitates resources being used economically in circumstances where the State is in financial difficulty.  It is acknowledged that the Direct Provision system provides value for money. A key finding in the 2010 Value for Money Report on the Direct Provision system was that if we were operating a system which facilitated asylum seekers in living independent lives in individual housing with social welfare support and payments, aside from the asylum 'pull factor' it would likely create, the cost to the exchequer would be double what is currently paid under the direct provision system.</p><p>  In her article, the Ombudsman does not say that the direct provision system is in breach of international conventions. Rather, she references a number of reports critical of the direct provision system which argue that it is.  She acknowledges that, ultimately, such judgements are matters for a court.  Over the years, the direct provision system has been open to scrutiny by many international bodies. Centres have been visited by various UN bodies, including the UNHCR, and by the Council of Europe Human Rights Commissioner.  I appeared before the UN Human Rights Committee in Geneva in connection with its scrutiny of Ireland under the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) Process In October, 2011. No recommendation was made in relation to the Direct Provision system in the Committee's subsequent UPR report on Ireland.</p><p>  There is no question but that the asylum system is slow, fragmented and is in need of reform and I am determined to see this reform through.  For me, the length of time spent in the Direct Provision system, rather than the quality of provision within the system itself, is the real issue and I am committed to remedying that. Work on the details of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010 is ongoing at my Department pursuant to current Government policy which is committed, under the Programme for National Recovery, to &quot;introduce comprehensive reforms of the immigration, residency and asylum systems&quot;, which will include a statutory appeals system and set out rights and obligations in a transparent way.</p><p>  As I have outlined previously to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence, several hundred amendments to the Bill are anticipated, the majority of a technical nature.  I also expressed the considered view that instead of engaging in an extremely cumbersome process of tabling hundreds of amendments to the 2010 Bill, it would be much more efficient to publish a new and enhanced text.  Such an approach can incorporate the many anticipated amendments while addressing key outstanding issues, several of which have been of concern to Members. This proposition was broadly welcomed by the Joint Committee and work on the Bill continues, therefore, on that basis while also taking account of any intervening matters of relevance such as decisions by the Courts.  It remains my objective under this new approach, and subject to having to deal with the competing legislative demands of our EU/IMF/ECB Programme commitments, to be in a position to bring a revised Bill to Government for approval and publication before the end of the year.</p><p>  Pending the enactment and commencement of the new legislation and with a view to improving processing in the area of international protection, I am proposing to introduce new arrangements for the processing of subsidiary protection applications in light of recent judgments in the Superior Courts.  My Department, in consultation with the Attorney General's Office, is developing a new legislative and administrative framework for the processing of current and future subsidiary protection applications. This work is being given high priority and applicants will be advised of the new arrangements as soon as possible.</p><p>  In relation the accommodation centre in Millstreet, Co. Cork, issues inevitably arise in a system as complex and diverse as the Direct Provision system and it is important that they are dealt with quickly.  I am advised by RIA that there are ongoing discussions between residents and management. Senior officials in RIA have already visited the centre and will do so again today to provide any assistance required to achieve a resolution acceptable to all parties.</p></reply>

Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, is currently considering a wide range of proposals including proposals for reform from voluntary sector organisations. I look forward to receiving and examining a package of workable and effective proposals for the legislation.  The development of the consolidated and reformed legislation will be progressed as soon as possible having regard to the need for these on-going consultations and other legislative priorities in my Department.</p><p>  In advance of this wider reform, I have introduced reforms to domestic violence legislation by means of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011. That Act removed the minimum required period of cohabitation before one of a cohabiting couple may apply for a safety order (previously, the applicant was required to have resided with the respondent for at least six of the previous twelve months) and gave equal access to the protections of the Domestic Violence Act to opposite-sex and same-sex couples (the relevant provision previously referred only to couples &#8220;living together as husband and wife&#8221;). The 2011 Act also widened the scope of section 2 of the 1996 Act, which specifies who may apply for a safety order, to enable a person to obtain a safety order against a person with whom they have a child in common. <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>This is the only exception to the general rule that the protections available under the Domestic Violence Acts are for the benefit of persons who have lived together in the same household.</p><p>  Finally, I am happy to state that I have been able to retain Cosc's sub-head at almost the same level in 2013 as in 2012 - &euro;2.029m as opposed to &euro;2.091m. The Deputy will be aware that the Estimates process for 2014 is still ongoing. I would also like to state that funding for front-line community and voluntary domestic violence services is provided at present by the Health Service Executive for whom the Minister for Health has responsibility.  I understand that responsibility for funding these services will transfer to the Child and Family Support Agency, when established, and that agency will come under the remit of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</p></reply>

In exceptional circumstances, the provision of appropriate information to the public is already possible. This includes the disclosure of such information to parents. Currently, this is done on an administrative basis but, subject to Government approval, I intend to put these arrangements on a statutory footing.  Our primary objective has to be to minimise the risk posed to the public. The High Level Group which produced and published a discussion document on sex offenders was of the view that, if the Gardai have reason to believe a particular high risk sex offender poses a real and immediate danger, they should be free to tell individuals who need to know. Disclosure in such circumstances is perfectly reasonable.</p><p>  However, giving the general public unrestricted access to names and addresses on the sex offenders' register would be likely to be counter-productive. That kind of access would drive offenders underground and make it more difficult to monitor and supervise them. This was the universal view of those who responded to the discussion document and participated in the public forum on the management of sex offenders.  General access to the register would also raise issues concerning the rights of persons who have completed their sentences and pose no future threat to society.  My Department has been conducting a wide-ranging examination of the law on sexual offences. Arising from the review, l expect to seek Government approval for legislative proposals, including amendments to the Sex Offenders Act 2001 to provide a statutory basis for necessary disclosure, shortly.</p></reply>

Following full consideration, the Visa Officer decided to refuse the grant of the visa on 3 May 2013.  The decision to refuse was appealed on 16 May 2013 and was upheld by an appeals officer on 5 June 2013.  The visa appeals officer did not consider that the person concerned provided sufficient evidence of her obligations to return following a visit to Ireland and had concerns that she would not observe the conditions of a visa were it to be approved. It was noted the person concerned indicated on their application they were not employed or engaged in education. At appeal she indicated she was self employed but did not provide evidence of this.</p><p>  It is a fundamental consideration in any visa application that the deciding visa officer is satisfied that the conditions of the visa will be abided by including that the applicant will return home at the expiry of the permission to remain in the State. At the core of this consideration is an assessment of the applicant's obligations to return to their home country.  It is open to the person concerned to make a new application should she so wish. Where doing so, the applicant should be in a position to address the reasons for the refusal, in particular in this case, by showing stronger evidence of obligations to return.</p><p>  Guidelines regarding the visa application procedure are available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service - www.inis.gov.ie.  Queries in relation to general immigration matters may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

Cosc's key task is to ensure the delivery of a well coordinated "whole-of-government" response to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence against women and men. Cosc carries out its co-ordination functions primarily within the framework of the first National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence.  The strategy was published in March 2010 and covers the period 2010 to 2014.</p><p>  Monitoring of the implementation of the strategy is achieved through a six monthly exercise to establish progress to date on the activities in the Strategy. Cosc undertakes the regular monitoring. The process is overseen by the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women, the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Men and a high-level group of officials known as the Strategy Oversight Committee. Each six monthly monitoring exercise is published on the Cosc website.  In addition, a mid-term review of the implementation of the strategy was completed in 2012 and published on the Cosc website following consideration by the National Steering Committees and the Oversight Committee.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that this is a complex plan involving four objectives and 59 activities. The mid-term review of the National Strategy noted, in broad terms, that good progress had been made in relation to around a quarter of the planned activities, that a further fifty per cent of the activities were making progress with some delays and that approximately a fifth of the planned activities had limited or poor progress. The review resulted in a re-prioritisation of many of the actions of the strategy and an update of the time-frames for delivery of the actions.  An updated  table of the actions with the priority and time-frame associated has been published on the Cosc website.</p><p>  In terms of domestic abuse against children, I assume that the Deputy is referring to statistics recently published by Women's Aid in its annual report for 2012. There are a number of possible reasons for this increase. It is not, for instance, clear whether this represents a greater willingness of people who ring the Women's Aid helpline to discuss the emotional and other impacts of domestic abuse on their children, improved recording of this aspect of domestic abuse by the helpline, or an actual increase in the targeting of children in domestic situations. As one of the strategy's key aims  is to increase awareness among the general public of the incidence of domestic violence and among victims of the services available to them, increases in reporting are to be expected and indeed welcomed. There has been an increase in public debate and a range of policy initiatives in relation to children experiencing abuse, violence, neglect and bullying, which may lead to a greater willingness to discuss the impact of domestic violence on children.</p><p>  I would also like to state that front-line community and voluntary domestic violence services for those suffering from domestic violence are funded at present by the Health Service Executive for which the Minister for Health has responsibility.  I understand that responsibility for these services will transfer to the Child and Family Support Agency when established and that agency will come under the remit of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</p></reply>

As you can see from the table there were 608 prisoners on protection throughout the prison system on 30 June 2013 whereas at the end of January of this year there were 840 such prisoners. Many prisoners on protection can associate with other protection prisoners and have normal out of cell time during the day.</p><p>The number of prisoners on protection is regarded by the Irish Prison Service as an indicator of the steps taken in individual prisons, to ensure in so far as possible the safety of the offenders.

It must be borne in mind that someone&rsquo;s first period of imprisonment does not necessarily indicate a first offence. Efforts are made, where possible to segregate remand prisoners from sentenced prisoners. In addition, prisoners who are vulnerable or have requested the protection of the Governor are segregated from the general prison population. Every effort is made to ensure that those prisoners who cannot associate freely with the general prison population have the greatest possible access to services.</p><p>  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015.  There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning including Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes such as education, work training and resettlement programmes.</p></reply>

This one year permission is currently in operation and has been available to non-EEA students who have successfully completed a course of the type set out above since the introduction of the current non-EEA student immigration rules. </p><p>  In addition the Deputy may also wish to note that a six month permission under the Irish Third Level Graduate Scheme is available to non-EEA students who have successfully completed an award granted by a recognised Irish awarding body at Level 7 of the NFQ. During the period of permission under the Irish Third Level Graduate Scheme a student can work full time (up to 40hrs per week). I have no immediate plans to change these arrangements.

Part 2 of the Act makes persons convicted of a range of sexual offences subject to notification requirements.  The provisions of the Act also extend to any offenders convicted abroad of the same range of sexual offences who enter the State. </p><p>  In this regard, I am informed by the Garda authorities that, as of 16 July 2013, there were 1,280 persons subject to the requirements of Part 2 of the Act.  I am further informed that, as a matter of Garda operational and data policy, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not provide a break down of persons subject to the requirements of the Sex Offenders Act, 2001 on a county by county or Divisional basis.   All offenders subject to the notification requirements are monitored by the Sex Offender Management and Intelligence Unit (SOMIU) at the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.  The Unit is supported by Garda Inspectors nominated in each Garda Division throughout the State.  I am informed that the nominated Inspector in each Division has access to all necessary resources within his/her Division to assist him/her in carrying out his/her duties.  Where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na becomes aware that an offender subject to the notification requirements has breached those requirements, appropriate action is taken, including circulation through PULSE of their information, as well as inquiries to identify their current whereabouts.  I am confident that the appropriate level of monitoring is carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and all breaches of the requirements which come to notice are pursued.  </p><p>  I can further advise the Deputy that sex offenders released from prison, who are subject to supervision by the Probation Service under a Post Release Supervision Order, are assessed while in custody by the Probation Service using a validated risk assessment instrument. The risk and needs identified in the assessment inform the development of the case management plan, which is then monitored and supervised by the Probation Service in the community.  I am further advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na receives notifications regarding convicted sex offenders who travel to this country.  When SOMIU receives such a notification, it is recorded on the Garda PULSE system and the relevant nominated Divisional Inspector is notified as a priority.</p><p>  I am also informed that when the Garda authorities become aware that a convicted sex offender has left or is intending to leave the State, the Sex Offender Management and Intelligence Unit ensures that the relevant law enforcement agency in the country of destination is advised via Interpol.

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy,  I have had enquiries made and have been informed that the Courts Service has been reviewing all aspects of its organisational and operational structures throughout the country with the specific objective of ensuring that the Service can continue to maintain the delivery of front line court services and an appropriate level of service to court users.  I understand that no court venue has been singled out for or indeed exempted from the review.   </p><p>  In this context the Courts Service has established a general framework within which such venues are being assessed taking into account a range of criteria such as caseload, proximity to an alternative venue, physical condition of the building, availability of cells etc.  The likely impact on other Justice agencies, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service, is also taken into account.  The review identified a range of venues nationwide which, based on the criteria applied, could be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case in respect of each identified venue which has now commenced. I am informed that no decision on an individual venue is taken without prior consultation with local stakeholders. It should, however, be noted that the final decision is a matter for the Courts Service Board.  Under the statute I have no role or function in the matter. </p><p>  I am informed that a total of 16 venues have been closed since March 2011, in the following locations: Enniscorthy,  Athenry, Ballymote, Borrisokane, Boyle, Castlecomer, Castleisland, Castletownbere, Claremorris, Ennistymon, Kiltimagh, New Ross, Portarlington, Roscrea, Shannon, and Templemore.  With the exception of Enniscorthy which was closed on 1 May 2011, the venues listed above were closed on 1 January 2012. The Service has indicated that Ballyconnell, and An Spid&eacute;al  will close on 1 September 2013.</p><p>  At its meeting on 1 July 2013, the Courts Service Board approved the closure of venues at Ballyhaunis, Baltinglass, Birr, Clones, Edenderry, Kells, Kinsale, Swinford, I am advised that a date for the closures has not been determined but it is likely that they will close on or before 1 January 2014. , Also at that meeting, the Board decided to defer the decision regarding the future of Skibbereen until the autumn.</p><p>  The Service has stated that many of the smaller courthouses around the country have remained in the ownership of the local authorities. In the case of the closure of such a court venue, the building is available to the local authority for alternative use. In the case of the closure of a courthouse building which has been vested in the Courts Service, the Service will consider requests for the transfer of ownership of such buildings to other public bodies. The Service liaises with local authorities and the Office of Public Works about potential alternative uses. In recent years, four courthouses have been transferred to local authorities for use as community facilities, including as an arts centre and a youth cafe.  The Courts Service is currently reviewing its policy on the disposal of property.  There are five courthouse buildings in Courts Service ownership that are not used as court venues. Of those, one  will shortly be transferred to the Office of Public Works and another is in use for storage. In 2012, the total costs associated with the five buildings was &euro;27,000.</p></reply>

This focuses on the prisoner's resettlement needs from the moment of committal to release. Working as part of a prison-based team, the Probation Service helps prisoners to prepare for their release and to settle back into the community without committing crime.   The Probation Service works mainly with prisoners who will be under Probation Supervision after their release from custody. In this instance, where accommodation needs arise the Probation Service works in partnership with a range of organisations including local authorities whose responsibility it is to provide housing, as well as the voluntary housing sector, to provide for these needs. </p><p>  Notification requirements are provided for in Part 2 of the Sex Offender Act 2001.

The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a well established system in place for the monitoring of persons subject to these requirements. </p></reply>

However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.  All organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.  </p><p>  I remain in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner as to how best the service can continue to be delivered and improved upon, while at all times protecting the integrity of the process. Clearly, the protection of children and vulnerable adults is the primary objective of the Garda Central Vetting Unit and this must remain the case.   The possibility of introducing an e-vetting system has been assessed and the Garda authorities are now in the process of developing a system which will enable vetting applications to be submitted electronically through a secure web service.  In addition, the system will facilitate the checking and monitoring of applications.  The relevant work is being pursued on a priority basis and it will be completed as quickly as possible. </p><p>  The Garda Commissioner has informed me that there are now 1 Superintendent, 3 Sergeants and approximately 127 whole time equivalent civilian personnel assigned to the Garda Central Vetting Unit. With further assignments of staff this month, staffing at the Unit will be of the order of 140 (whole time equivalent) staff, which represents an increase in staff assigned to the Unit of almost 50% since March this year. As staff become fully trained on the vetting process I expect there will be a positive effect on vetting times.  My Department is also examining the scope for the redeployment of additional personnel from within the public service to the Unit.</p></reply>

In accordance with the provisions of Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), she was entitled to remain in the State until her application for asylum was decided.  Her asylum application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p><p>   The person concerned initiated judicial review proceedings in the High Court, challenging the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal in her case. These proceedings were 'settled' with the consequence that her appeal was remitted to a different Member of the Tribunal for a fresh determination.  This appeal was also refused so the later decision of the Tribunal, and the subsequent decision of the Minister, stood.</p><p>  The person concerned was notified, by letter dated 31st December, 2012, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her. In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for subsidiary protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.  </p><p>  The person concerned has submitted an application for subsidiary protection. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</p><p>  In the event that the application for subsidiary protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made. Once a decision has been made, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.   </p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The marriage or civil partnership must be subsisting and recognised under Irish law. Section 15A provides that the Minister may waive certain conditions for naturalisation if satisfied that the applicant would suffer serious consequences in respect of his or her bodily integrity or liberty if not granted Irish citizenship.</p><p>  Section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, waive some or all of the statutory conditions in certain circumstances i.e. where an applicant is of Irish descent or of Irish associations; where an applicant is a person who is a refugee within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees; or where an applicant is a Stateless person within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Stateless persons. </p><p>  It is open to any individual to lodge an application for citizenship if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements as prescribed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended.

This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited. </p></reply>

This represented circa 56% of all SPS applications for the year and was an increase of over 12% on the 2012 applications.

The new service provides better mobile access to the more popular areas of the Department's website.

Rules are also in force for pets brought into the EU from other countries.</p><p>  Regulation 998/2003 is being replaced primarily for legal reasons with a view to bringing provisions into line with the Lisbon Treaty.  The obligations on pet owners have not changed.  However, the opportunity has been taken to clarify certain aspects and to make some amendments to improve the practical implementation of the regime including pet owners who have to return to the EU in a hurry (sudden natural disaster, political unrest, severe personal circumstances) will now be able to bring their pets with them under special permit even where the pets have not properly prepared.  Difficulties in making travel arrangements will be eased by allowing pets to be transported unaccompanied by their owners where justified.  Exemptions from rabies vaccination may be possible between rabies free areas.</p><p>  As an addition to the strict checking regime for entry into the EU, the new regulation also makes specific provision for official pet passport checks on pet travel between Member States, thus prioritising protection against rabies for all EU citizens.</p><p>  The new regulation is more user friendly and all Member States will be obliged to provide clear and easily accessible information to the public on the requirements for travel with pets.</p></reply>

This was a world-wide forum with many countries, UN Organisations and NGOs present holding diverse views and objectives.  It represented a major logistical and diplomatic challenge for Ireland which, with the European Commission, acted as lead negotiator and spokesperson for the European Union in the multiple contact groups.</p><p>  The two week session addressed a range of important issues relating to forests and economic development including means of implementation for sustainable forest management (SFM) and a number of important emerging issues.  Long and difficult negotiations were a feature of this session as delegates aimed to reflect the core issues of most importance to them in the overall conclusions.  The importance of forests for economic development and on their overall contribution to the green economy was central.  This will facilitate a further rollout of SFM at global level.  This can only benefit all countries, both in the developed and developing worlds. </p><p>A multi-stakeholder dialogue and a high level Ministerial segment took place during the first week of the session.  The overall result of the two week session was deemed to be a success by participants and agreement on two action-oriented Draft Resolutions was delivered.  Resolution 1 addresses the implementation of the non-legally binding instrument on forests, regional inputs, economic development and enhanced global cooperation.  The second resolution dealt with agreement on emerging issues, means of implementation and the UNFF Trust Fund.  These will, in due course, go before the UN Economic and Social Council for further action. </p><p>  The Irish Presidency was particularly challenging in the Forestry arena with many major international events taking place.  In the case of the Istanbul event, it involved months of preparation that entailed developing and coordinating very detailed position papers which successfully captured the European position.  I can justifiably express a feeling of satisfaction with our Presidency&rsquo;s achievements in this complex area. Ireland has left a very sound platform for our EU and other colleagues to work from in the coming months.</p></reply>

It has been estimated that the overall benefit of the eradication of this disease is beneficial to farmers.  Notwithstanding this and taking account of the slightly longer payback period for suckler cow producers compared with dairy farmers, I have made compensation available to suckler cow farmers who have multiple cases of persistently infected calves in their herds in order to encourage the early disposal of such calves.

In order to be eligible to draw down EU funding, it is a requirement that all land eligibility inspections must take place before any payments can issue to any farmer in the country in a given year. While cross compliance inspections can be carried out after payment has been made, it is a regulatory requirement that this category of inspection must take place throughout the calendar year to take account of specific requirements at individual Statutory Management Requirement level.</p><p>  SMR 4 relates to Nitrates and specifically the requirements of EU regulations on Good Agricultural Practice for the Protection of Waters. It is a requirement of these regulations that specific records must be maintained and made available for inspection for a period of five years.  The inspection process for SMR 4 involves an inspection of the holding in the first instance and a follow-on office check of the records, which farmers are requested to submit within 14 days of the inspection.  The checking of these nitrates records is an integral part of the overall inspection process for SMR 4 and failure to complete such checks would result in adverse audit findings, putting at risk the significant EU funding available for these schemes.  While every effort is made to complete the office checking of these records in a timely manner, priority must be given to the completion of the eligibility inspections so as to allow payments to issue to farmers and the cross compliance inspections to ensure regulatory requirements are being complied with.</p></reply>

The role included notifying childminders of training opportunities, providing networking opportunities and supporting the voluntary notification system which was being developed by the CCCs.  While Childminding Advisory Officers were established in most county areas, this was not always the case and they were not always located with the local CCC.  Despite their presence and the additional supports including training, a small capital grant scheme and the introduction of a tax relief for childminding in 2006, the increase in the number of voluntarily-notified childminders since 2004, when the number was 500, has been relatively small and levelled off at 1,250.</p><p>  In recent years, the HSE made a decision to gradually reduce the level of funding and support for the Childminding Advisory Officer posts.  I would point to the fact that my Department continues to provide funding to the CCCs which are now well-established and effective bodies at local level, and that supporting the childminding sector is an integral part of their work.  My Department also provides annual funding to the seven National Voluntary Organisations, including Childminding Ireland, to provide support at local level to their members.  As a result, childminders continue to have access to support, training and advice.  Work on the development of Ireland&rsquo;s first Early Years Strategy for children aged from birth to 6 years, is already underway in my Department.  My intention is to create an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland&rsquo;s early years sector and a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to six years.  One of the specific issues of policy which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the new Strategy is the future role and regulation of the childminding sector, which is already an important component of early childhood care and education.  I expect the Strategy to be published later this year.</p></reply>

In line with the Programme for Government, my Department has made a significant commitment to maintaining this universal programme.  It is expected that the programme this year will cost up to &euro;175 million when all of the costs are taken into account.  Almost every pre-school service (more than 4,300) in the State is participating with over 68,000 children, or 94% of the eligible age cohort, availing of free pre-school this year.  No specific cost analysis has been commissioned in relation to the provision of a second free pre-school year.  However, it is estimated that the additional costs of providing a second year would be similar to the costs incurred in providing the one year free pre-school provision.  It is not anticipated that the participation rate in a second pre-school year would be as high as that currently experienced and on this basis it is estimated that the cost of the second year would be in the region of &euro;150 million to &euro;175 million.  I have on a number of occasions emphasised my commitment and that of the Government to improving quality in pre-school services, and my Department and I are working on a comprehensive pre-school quality agenda.  Improving quality represents an essential building block towards the extension of universal early years provision.  Future developments relating to early years care and education are being considered in the context of the National Early Years Strategy for children aged from birth to six  years, which is being developed by my Department and expected to be completed later this year.</p></reply>

Ethiopia is not a signatory of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.  In these circumstances, future adoptions from Ethiopia would require a bilateral agreement between Ireland and Ethiopia.  The negotiation of bilateral agreements on intercountry adoption with states who have not ratified the Hague Convention is governed by Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010 which states that "the Authority, with the prior consent of the Minister, may enter into discussions with any non-contracting state concerning the possibility of the Government entering into a bilateral agreement with that State."  The Adoption Authority delegation visit to Ethiopia in April of 2012 was an initial part of the Authority's deliberations on the feasibility and suitability of entering into discussions with Ethiopia on a bilateral adoption agreement.  The Authority forwarded a report of their visit to me in May 2012.  The Authority has also informed me that it has asked the Irish Embassy to make the appropriate contacts in the Ministry of Women's Affairs in Ethiopia with a view to verifying the stance of the Ethiopian authorities to entering into exploratory talks in relation to a bilateral agreement.  The Authority has also sought and received advice on the legal compatibility of Irish adoption law with that of Ethiopia. the AAI legal advisors have considered this and certain clarifications are now being sought.  The Authority will advise me of the position when all the information is available.  I am aware of the commitment and effort the Ethiopian Government is making towards ratifying the Hague Convention on inter country adoption and this will be taken into account when considering options in regard to inter country adoption from Ethiopia.</p></reply>

The number is currently operational in 23 EU countries and the number has been allocated and is soon to be operational in a further four countries, including Croatia, the newest EU Member State.  In Ireland the 116000 Missing Children Hotline is operated by the ISPCC in liaison with a cross-sectoral Project Team, chaired by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Funding for the operation of the line in Ireland is provided by my Department and the EU, through its Daphne funding stream.  My Department provided &euro;50,000 in 2012 and &euro;88,000 in 2013 and the funding received from both the EU Daphne fund and from my Department includes; the establishment costs, national promotion and advertisement of the service.  In common with all Exchequer funding, requirements for the operation of the service in future years will be considered in the context of the usual Estimates process.  The Missing Children Hotline has been operating on a limited hours pilot basis in Ireland since December 2012 and on a full-time 24/7 basis since end April, 2013. The service was officially launched on 7 June 2013.</p><p>  A key component of the service is a successful awareness programme. It is vital that those who could benefit from the service know that it exists and that users are aware of the scope of the service.  During the initial set-up phase of the service, the ISPCC focused on community based promotion of the service.  This included presentations to local community groups.  Posters, flyers and business cards have been distributed to all Garda stations from Garda headquarters, and promotional material has been distributed to a variety of community based projects in various locations throughout the country.  Further, the ISPCC has made extensive use of social media such as Facebook and Twitter to advertise this service on an ongoing basis.  The successful launch of the service on 7 June 2013 also provided the opportunity to further promote the service.  The 116000 Missing Children Hotline website, <i>www.missingchildrenhotline.ie</i>, has also been launched to promote the service.  To date, an amount of some &euro;35,000 has been spent on awareness measures.  This amount will be doubled for further awareness measures in the remainder of 2013.  It is important to note that the 116000 number is not an emergency number.  Emergency calls should always be directed to the 999/112 number in the first instance, where the relevant emergency responses, including the recently launched Garda Missing Children Amber Alert mechanism, may be activated.  The establishment of the 116000 line will, however, be of valuable support and assistance to families of missing children and to missing children themselves.</p></reply>

Funding of &euro;53.498m, which includes &euro;1.75m capital funding, has been made available in 2013 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities. Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects. These funding schemes support national and local youth work projects and services provided by the voluntary youth work sector. It is estimated that some 400,000 young people participate in the programmes and services which are provided by approximately 1,400 paid staff and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country. Since its establishment, my Department has provided funding for the youth sector as follows:  2011: &euro;60.954m which includes &euro;800,000 capital funding and  2012: &euro;58.306m which includes &euro;1.5m capital funding.</p><p>  My Department, as with all Government Departments, has been required to achieve significant savings in recent years, with consequent reductions in funding in all  major programmes on account of the economic challenges facing the country at this time. The savings required under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure for the Youth Affairs budget from 2012 to 2014 inclusive amount to &euro;11.987m. In implementing the savings required,  I and my Department have tried to ensure that, in the determination process for the allocations, the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people, are protected as far as is possible from the impact of any necessary reductions in funding. I have asked youth organisations and projects to consider the scope for reducing administration and overhead costs as far as is possible and to focus the services for those young people who are most vulnerable. </p><p>  I have met, and continue to meet with, many youth organisations and groups to try to identify ways to minimise the impact of these necessary savings in order to ensure that the provision of quality youth services to young people is sustained in these challenging times.  There are ongoing meetings at official level with youth sector organisations to share information on the challenges facing services and young people.</p><p>  A comprehensive Value for Money and Policy Review of youth funding has been commenced in my Department and it is anticipated that the findings of this review will inform the future development of youth programmes and services. </p><p>  My Department is developing a new youth policy framework for publication later this year. The new youth policy framework will aim to enhance the provision of youth services and activities and it will, inter alia, promote coordination between government departments and youth sector organisations with a view to maximising the effectiveness of the State funding available to support services for young people in future years. </p><p>  The breakdown of  funding is not available in the format requested by the Deputy. The Youth Affairs Unit administers funding to some 30 funding bodies including the Education and Training Boards and other agencies.  A breakdown of funding per funding body in recent years is being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it is available.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-18a.1776.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013071800047#WRXX03300"><p>The Adoption Authority of Ireland is the central authority in Ireland for intercountry adoption. Agencies are accredited by the Adoption Authority to provide mediation services in relation to intercountry adoption to assist prospective adoptive parents with the adoption process in respect of particular countries.  The operation of such bodies is seen as an additional safeguard for countries in the conduct of the adoption process and is considered good practice by the Hague authorities.  Monitoring and oversight of these agencies is solely a matter for the Adoption Authority. </p><p>There are currently three agencies accredited by the Adoption Authority for intercountry adoption purposes.  All three were established on a non-profit basis and, although accredited by the Adoption Authority, they are not public bodies. The financial model underpinning the operation of these agencies was based upon the recoupment of costs from prospective adoptive parents at the different stages of the process.   However, due to trends in adoption world wide, the numbers of adoptions upon which the plans and financial projections of these agencies were developed have not materialised. International developments have also seen an increase in the time taken to complete an adoption.  These trends and developments have raised questions for the sustainability of these agencies in their current format.  <font color="#0000FF"> </font></p><p>I have met with these agencies and discussed the situation.  My interest, which is shared by the agencies, is to achieve a solution which responds to the current situation but also assists in introducing the changes required to resolve the underlying issues of sustainability.  My Department has now undertaken an examination of the policy considerations relating to agencies accredited for mediation purposes and the operational and financial situation of the three agencies.  Government has considered the conclusions of this examination.  An important conclusion reached is that there is a strong public policy rationale for public funding contributing towards core organisation costs of mediation services as part of a mixed system of funding.  This mixed funding would also entail the recoupment of specific costs from prospective adoptive parents reflecting the level of service provision related to individual cases.  A commitment in principle to public funding is an important development since up to now the provision of funding has been once-off and temporary in nature.  Such a commitment recognises the additional safeguards which such accredited agencies provide in the conduct of the adoption process.  It also recognises that increasingly countries of origin require that adoptions are mediated through accredited bodies.</p><p>However, public funding also demands that organisational arrangements provide value for money and avoid unnecessary duplication.  Therefore, Government has also agreed that significant cost efficiencies on the current three agency model are required.  The decline in the numbers of children eligible for adoption and the responsibility to ensure effective use of public funding for core organisational costs mean significant revision to current arrangements will need to be introduced in the coming months to reduce duplication or unnecessary expenditure.</p><p>In the context of the need for reforms to be introduced in this area I have sought and received Government approval to provide transitional funding to the end of 2013 to the three existing agencies, in advance of the development and implementation of revised arrangements next year which will provide a more sustainable model for the future. Provision of this funding is based upon the positive participation of the agencies in developing the revised arrangements.  </p><p>I am very happy to advise that the agencies have willingly given commitments to actively engage in developing revised arrangements and my Department, the Adoption Authority and the HSE are working closely with the agencies on a revised model with the objective of introducing new arrangements from 2014.  Enhanced cooperation between the three agencies is also to be welcomed.  </p><p>Further detailed work and significant change will be required. An important consideration will be continuity of service provision especially in relation to access to particular countries of choice for prospective adoptive parents. I am pleased with the progress made to date in successfully addressing the immediate financial challenges faced by the agencies and look forward to the continued co-operation of the Adoption Authority and the AAI and accredited agencies with the efforts of my Department in this regard.</p></reply>

The areas I have identified are:</p><p>-  Increasing the qualification requirements for all staff in pre-school services to a minimum standard at FETAC Level 5</p><p>-  Improving the quality and curricular supports for pre-school services when implementing the Siolta Framework and Aistear Curriculum </p><p>-  Implementing the new National Pre-School Standards</p><p>-  Introducing a registration system for all pre-school services </p><p>-  Taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust</p><p>-  Publishing inspection reports on-line as soon as possible</p><p>-  Ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance</p><p>-  Increasing and widening the sanctions which can be taken for non-compliance</p><p>  It is my intention to introduce new qualification requirements for the sector starting in September 2014.  This will be an important new development as, at present, staff working in childcare services other than under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, are not subject to any requirement in respect of qualifications.</p><p>  The  ECCE programme introduced the first-ever requirement for minimum qualifications for staff working in the childcare sector.  The current requirement under the programme is that the pre-school leader delivering the pre-school provision must hold a qualification in childcare/early education at a minimum of Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ), or an equivalent nationally-recognised qualification or a higher award in the childcare/early education field.  </p><p>  The minimum requirement of Level 5 for pre-school leaders delivering the pre-school year will be increased to Level 6.  In addition, all pre-school assistants, and all other staff caring for children in a pre-school service, will be subject to a minimum requirement of Level 5.  This requirement will be effective from September 2014 for new services, and from September 2015 for existing services. </p><p>  While I recognise the valuable experience which many childcare staff may have accrued, it is now essential that all staff have qualifications on a formal recognised basis.  My Department is currently examining measures to support training for childcare staff in line with the increased qualification requirements.  </p><p>  Pre-school services are governed by the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No 2) Regulations 2006 as provided in the Child Care Act 1991. Under the Regulations the Health Service Executive has responsibility for the inspection of services and the enforcement of the regulations. Inspection is carried out to monitor compliance with the Regulations thereby ensuring the health, safety and welfare of children and the promotion of their development.   </p><p>As I have outlined in recent weeks, a number of steps are being taken to improve the current inspection system.  These include the introduction of National Quality Standards for pre-school services later this year as part of the inspection process.  In addition, my Department is working with the Pre-School Inspectorate to develop new protocols on regulatory compliance so that there is greater clarity and consistency of approach as to how inspection reports deal with findings of serious non-compliance as opposed to minor breaches and full compliance.    My Department is also undertaking a review of the penalties currently in place for breach of the Child Care (Pre-school) Regulations, as provided for under the Child Care Act 1991.  The review will look at increasing the range and severity of the existing penalties including the actions which can be taken by Inspectors without recourse to court prosecution.  </p><p>  In relation to the publication of pre-school service inspection reports, the HSE has begun the process of publishing retrospective reports on-line, and this process will continue over the coming weeks and months.  All new inspection reports from 1st July will be published on-line on completion.  The publication of these reports is being hosted by Pobal, and the reports are available on the Pobal website.</p><p>A new registration system will be introduced in September of this year and new services wishing to open will be required to register with the HSE.  The HSE will determine whether the childcare service is compliant in terms of suitability and service design <i>before</i>   the service will be permitted to operate.  Following commencement of the service, actual care and welfare practices will be inspected.</p><p>  My Department is currently developing a new Children and Young People's Policy Framework which will set out high level goals for both my own and other Departments for the next five years. The Policy Framework is expected to be published later this year and will build on Our Children - Their Lives, Ireland's first Children's Strategy which was published in 2000. This is relevant to the Early Years Strategy as the Strategy is one of three, more detailed strategies which will be developed under the Framework.</p><p>  The Early Years Strategy, which will be Ireland's first ever national strategy for early years, is under development. It is expected that it will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as child health and well-being, parenting and family support, learning and development, play and recreation and early childhood care and education. </p></reply>

Consequently direct comparisons with social work numbers for previous years are not meaningful.</p><p>  It should be noted that there are a variety of reasons for fluctuations in employment census figures at any given time, particularly as the employment census is based on a snapshot of staff who are on the payroll at the date of the census. Among the reasons for staff being removed from the payroll thereby causing changes in employment census numbers (aside from retirements and recruitment) are deaths, career breaks and other unpaid leave, resignations and unpaid sick leave.</p></reply>

However, only 16 of the certified 24 male bed spaces in Trinity House School are currently available for use due to staffing shortages.  The Irish Youth Justice Service, which is based in my Department, is currently in discussions with management, staff and unions on the Oberstown campus on initiatives to reconfigure the detention places and staff resources, in order to address the increased demand for male bed places from the courts.  This is being progressed so as to achieve its earliest possible solution.  The issue is complex and it is not possible to provide a more definitive timeframe at this stage.</p><p>  I have also noted a substantial increase in demand for male bed spaces on the Oberstown campus in 2013 compared to 2012.  This has been primarily but not exclusively driven by an increase in the number of boys aged 16 years old on admission detained in Oberstown.  The Irish Youth Justice Service has identified a trend since late 2012 of a higher number of such children being detained in Oberstown compared to the situation which applied when this age group was the responsibility of St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  This increase in demand from the courts merits further consideration, particularly since the Central Statistics Office has recently recorded a general reduction in crime trends overall in the community.</p></reply>

I recently met with experts and representatives of organisations working with young people in care to discuss the best approach to this amendment.</p><p><b>Organisational Reform</b></p><p>  The Child and Family Agency will be an essential vehicle for ensuring that the ethos of quality and accountability called for by the ICDRG is strongly reflected in children's services.  </p><p><b>Operational Reform </b></p><p>  A central feature of the new Agency will be a new Service Delivery Framework which will prioritise serious child protection referrals while providing for development of new 'Local Area Pathways' which will involve a greater use of community-based services to address child and family welfare concerns in a timely &amp;amp; effective manner.  Significant work has taken place in relation to this service redesign.  </p><p>  A group has been established in the HSE to work with the Irish Youth Justice Service on the needs of the most vulnerable youths, in line with the needs highlighted in the Child Deaths Report.  In addition the multi-disciplinary ACTS (assessment and therapeutic care) team has been established to provide specialised support for children in special care or detention.</p><p>  Work is progressing on development of a National Child Care Information System to comprehensively address issues of record keeping and data management.  The procurement process is now at contract stage.  </p><p>  Two out-of-hours pilot projects in Donegal and Cork were commenced and independently evaluated.  The HSE has reviewed the Evaluation Report and prepared a business case for a National Out of Hours Social Work Service.  The HSE is in discussion with relevant staff representative associations.</p><p><b>Aftercare Services</b></p><p>  As of the end of December 2012, 1457 young people were in receipt of an aftercare service.  My Department is currently examining options in the context of the Child and Family Agency to strengthen legislation regarding the provision of aftercare.  I have met with experts and representatives of organisations working with young people in care or aftercare to discuss these options.</p><p><b>Workforce Development</b></p><p>  This Government completed the recruitment of 260 additional social workers proposed in the Ryan Report Implementation Plan.  Over 1,400 social workers are employed in Children and Family Support Services and the introduction of 260 additional social workers represents a significant strengthening of the workforce.  </p><p>  Arrangements for the induction, training and supervision of these staff have been put in place.  </p><p>  Support for all staff includes the introduction of national guidance, such as Child Protection and Welfare Practice Handbook, and supervision of the implementation of this guidance.</p><p><b>Oversight </b></p><p>  Last July, I launched the first-ever HIQA 'National Standards on Protection and Welfare of Children'. HIQA recently announced the commencement of inspections of child protection services, in line with new standards.  </p><p>  10 cases identified in the ICDRG report have been referred for independent review under Dr. Helen Buckley.  </p><p>  Specific work is proceeding in relation to the Review Group's recommendations regarding mechanisms for the independent review of child deaths.  It is necessary to ensure that any such arrangements are developed in a manner that is fully consistent with the major organisational reforms currently in train including the transfer of child protection services from the HSE to the CFA and the recent expansion of HIQA's inspection regime to cover all child protection services.  My Department has also consulted with colleagues in the North in order to share learning from the respective approaches to child death review.</p><p>  I trust these details illustrate the seriousness with which the ICDRG report is being advanced.  Finally, my Department has also used the detailed research undertaken in the report to highlight more general policy issues across Government, including for example discussions on the preparation of a National Substance Misuse Strategy.</p></reply>

Almost every pre-school service (more than 4,300) in the State is participating with over 68,000 children, or 94% of the eligible age cohort, availing of free pre-school this year.  Children are eligible to avail of the free pre-school year where they are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months at 1 September in the relevant year. </p><p>  It is a requirement that service providers who are participating in the ECCE programme submit a return to my Department which gives details of children who, during  one 'snap shot'  week at the commencement of the school year, are enrolled for the programme.  The PPS number for each child is then verified with the Department of Social Protection before payment is made. </p><p>  The  ECCE programme introduced the first-ever requirement for minimum qualifications for staff working in the childcare sector.  The current requirement under the programme is that the pre-school leader delivering the pre-school provision must hold a qualification in childcare/early education at a minimum of Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ), or an equivalent nationally-recognised qualification or a higher award in the childcare/early education field.  Therefore the qualification details of staff providing the ECCE programme are also required as part of the return made by the provider.</p><p>  I propose to increase the qualification requirement for pre-school leaders from Level 5 to Level 6 for new services from September 2014, and from September 2015 for existing services.</p><p>  It is a condition for childcare services participating in the ECCE programme that they adhere to the terms and conditions of the programme and also undertake to comply with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements which include planning legislation, employment legislation, health and safety legislation and data protection requirements.  Only services which meet the standards set out in the Regulations and undertake to comply with the terms and conditions of the free pre-school scheme are permitted to participate in the ECCE programme.</p></reply>

Significant resources have been invested in recent years in the health sector in these services and the HSE provides a range of community and residential services including therapeutic services and respite.  The HSE is currently engaged in a reconfiguration of existing therapy resources to geographic based teams for children and young people with disabilities under its Progressing Disabilities Programme for Children and Young People (0-18 years).  This aims to increase the level of consistency and standardisation in the way both early intervention services and services for school-aged children with disabilities are delivered.  A detailed action plan is being implemented with the following objectives:</p><p>-  One clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need</p><p>-  Resources used to the greatest benefit for all children and families </p><p>-  Health and education working together to support children to achieve their potential.</p><p>  The health and education sectors co-operate on a regular basis with a view to integrating their services for these children as much as possible and targeting them to areas of greatest need.  At the same time, there is a need to strengthen this co-operation and I am personally committed to this issue.  I have established the Children, Adolescents and Young People with Complex Disabilities Unit in my Department, led by a Principal Officer.  This important development aims to foster greater collaboration between my Department, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on children&rsquo;s disability issues including autism and to build on the cross-sectoral working arrangements that are already in place.  A dedicated Cross-Sectoral Team, comprising representatives of my Department, the HSE, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs plays a key role in this regard.   </p><p>  A sub group of this Cross-Sectoral Team has been set up to examine the issues around integration of children with disabilities into mainstream Pre-School Settings, building on previous analysis in this area.  Representatives of the Departments of Health, Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills, the Health Service Executive and of the City and County Childcare Committees are members of this group and it is chaired by the Department of Health.  It is envisaged the work of this Sub-Group will be completed later in the year, at which point it will report to the Cross Sectoral Team.  </p><p>  I welcome discussion and debate around this or any other matter which will assist in meeting the future requirements for all children special needs.</p></reply>

When a medical card comes up for review, the current circumstances of the medical card holder are evaluated by the HSE to ensure that he/she continues to hold eligibility and that this involves a standard review process. In the interest of probity, the HSE is obliged to ensure that a person&rsquo;s eligibility is correctly recorded in line with the eligibility legislation and the national guidelines. Medical card reviews/renewal forms are issued to medical card clients three months in advance of their eligibility review date in order to give clients sufficient time to complete the review form and to provide the required evidence of income, etc. </p><p>Clients are requested to return completed review forms at least one month in advance of the review date in order to give the HSE sufficient time to carry out the review and/or to contact the client if the application is incomplete or further information is required. The    HSE will issue a reminder letter to the client if the review form is not received by the Executive within one month of the review date. Where a review is not completed by the review date, it is HSE policy to extend the eligibility of the client until the review is carried out and a final decision is made on the client&rsquo;s eligibility status at that time.</p><p>  The renewal process is an important quality assurance aspect of the management of the various schemes operated by the HSE.</p></reply>

The aim is to establish a Hub to drive collaboration between the health system and the enterprise sector leading to the development and commercialisation of new healthcare technologies, products and services, emerging from within the health system and /or the enterprise system.  The Hub model has the potential to address the jobs agenda; it also has great potential to help improve how we do things in the health system and most importantly improve health outcomes for patients.</p><p>  A National Project Team, which consists of a multidisciplinary team spanning the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Health, as well as representatives from the Health Services Executive, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, was formed and charged with the establishment of a demonstrator (pilot) project. A demonstrator project has been in operation since 2012.  The purpose of the demonstrator project is to test the Hub model and inform the development of a National Health Innovation Hub.</p><p>  A local Steering Group was established to oversee the demonstrator's operation and reports to the National Project Team.  Currently the Demonstrator project has brought together six innovative Irish healthcare companies with the health service by providing dedicated contact points, facilitated project management, office space, advice and access to the hospital and primary care system in Cork.  Detailed project plans are in place for each of the projects and milestones are being measured and assessed. Reports on the demonstrator project indicate that there has been good progress made.</p><p>  The steps deemed necessary to progress the establishment of the Hub are outlined in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013, with the accompanying Table of Actions providing more detail. This includes actions to monitor and assess the performance of the Cork Demonstrator Project throughout 2013.  Details of the Jobs Action Plan and the accompanying Table of Actions are available on the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation website (  . It is envisaged that the quarter two progress report on the Action Plan will also be published soon.  The first progress report is available on the the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation website.</p></reply>

All Ministers attending the Informal meeting agreed that childhood obesity is a priority issue on the health agenda in Member States and that it needs to be addressed in an EU wide context. It is proposed that the EU Childhood Obesity Action Plan will be launched in 2014 and will be evaluated at the end of 2020.</p><p>  As Minister for Health, I have made overweight and obesity a public health priority and have established a Special Action Group on Obesity (SAGO) with whom I meet regularly to progress the obesity agenda. The Special Action Group on Obesity comprises key stakeholders and is chaired by my Department.  The range of measures being implemented by my Department seek to promote a healthy lifestyle, to encourage people to make healthier food choices, to become more active and take the first steps towards reducing obesity.  </p><p>  SAGO is working on a combination of priority actions which, taken together, should make a difference in the long term.  These measures include: Calorie posting in restaurants; Healthy Eating Guidelines; Marketing of Food and Drink to Children; Treatment Algorithms; Opportunistic Screening and Monitoring for overweight and obesity and Vending Machines in Schools.  SAGO is also currently looking at ways to promote healthy eating, in accordance with this Department's Healthy Eating Guidelines.</p><p>  Healthy Ireland, a Framework for Improved Health and Well-being, forms the basis of how a whole-of-government and whole of society approach to health and well-being will be delivered. It sets out 64 actions under a number of thematic areas which provide for the development of inter-sectoral and cross government plans to address risk factors and social determinants of health.  It provides a  structured mechanism to engage all different sectors of society to channel measures and actions around individual health and lifestyle  issues, and to measure, monitor and evaluate implementation.  Healthy Ireland describes supportive mechanisms to ensure effective co-operation between the health sector and other areas of Government and public services concerned with social protection, children, industry, food safety, education, transport, housing, agriculture and the environment. The implementation of Healthy Ireland is now focused on the development of an outcomes framework and a physical activity plan. In this regard  the Health and Well-being Programme in the Department of Health will work closely with relevant policy divisions in the Department of Health and with existing cross-government and cross-sectoral groups, such as SAGO.</p></reply>

In 2002 the Forum on Fluoridation, which was established to review this policy, concluded that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure. </p><p>  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects. It advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and is the safest and most cost effective method of protecting the oral health of the population. The opinion of the Expert Body is supported by the World Health Organisation; the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the Public Health Service and the Surgeon General of the United States; the World Dental Federation; the International Association for Dental Research; the Royal College of Physicians of England and by major international scientifically validated reviews in many countries. The effects of fluoridation on health and related matters are kept under constant review.</p></reply>

There is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with a specific illness, such as cancer, nor has the criteria applied to medical card applications by cancer patients been amended or reviewed.</p><p>  However, under the legislation, there is provision for discretion by the HSE to grant a medical card where a person's income exceeds the income guidelines. The HSE takes a person's social and medical issues into account in determining whether or not &quot;undue hardship&quot; exists for a person in providing a health service for themselves or his or her dependents. </p><p>  The HSE has an effective system in place for the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are terminally ill, or who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care that they cannot afford. They are issued within twenty-four hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant. With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card. As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months. </p><p>  For persons with a terminal illness, no means test applies.  Once the terminal illness is verified, patients are given an emergency medical card for six months. Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure that the person gets the card as quickly as possible. </p></reply>

At the end of June 2013 there were 7,280 public residential beds.  Of these 5,412 were long stay &amp;amp; 1,868 were short stay beds.</p><p>The HSE has responsibility for the delivery of services set out in the National Service Plan and to ensure that services are delivered within budget.   The demand for these services will continue to grow with changing demographics, and the associated complex needs of an ageing population.  At the last Census, there were over 535,000 people over the age of 65 in Ireland. This was an increase of 14.4% since 2006. It is estimated that by 2041, there will be about 1.4m people over the age of 65 in Ireland, with the greatest increases in the over 80 age group.  We will therefore have to ensure that the funds that are available are used to best effect for our older people. </p><p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme was introduced in October 2009 with a commitment to review its operation after three years.     This review is now underway and will consider the long-term sustainability of the Scheme as well as looking at the community based services with a view to completion by end 2013/early 2014. In conjunction with this the Department is working closely with the HSE to develop an overall plan regarding future public nursing home provision for the Minister's consideration.  This Plan will take account of the priorities identified in recent HSE analysis and of the broad examination of future services, both residential and community, for older people which will be carried out under the current review of the Scheme.   Following on from the review a longer-term plan for public residential facilities is therefore expected to be completed by mid-2014.</p><p>On-going consultation with all stakeholders and the public in general is already a standard feature of our approach across policy areas.  Both my Ministerial colleagues, myself and officials from the Department regularly meet with stakeholders from across the public, private and voluntary sector to discuss policies, services and developments including those for Older People.  In fact officials of the Department have recently met and are always happy to receive suggestions and other input from Nursing Homes Ireland (NHI), which has called for the establishment of a forum of this nature.  The establishment of an additional formal consultation forum such as that suggested by NHI is not considered necessary given the very effective level of consultation that already takes place and to which we remain committed for the future.</p></reply>

Getting the structure right will be a complex task and as such, each phase of the transition will be evaluated carefully as we progress towards UHI.  The Government has committed to a major programme of reform, involving the dissolution of the HSE and the assuming of its functions by other agencies including a Healthcare Commissioning Agency (previously described as an Integrated Care Agency), independent Hospital Trusts, a health and well-being agency and other bodies as appropriate.  This structural change represents a major programme of work. Each element of the structural reform will need to be addressed in a co-ordinated manner; none of them can be considered in isolation. The establishment of a Healthcare Commissioning Agency is currently being examined in this context, and will be advanced as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This new funding model will mean that hospitals will be funded on the basis of the quantity and quality of the services they deliver to patients and not the size of last year&rsquo;s budget.  Encouraging hospitals to use the resources at their disposal more efficiently is one of the central objectives of the MFTP system.  </p><p>  A pilot prospective funding programme has been in place for certain elective orthopaedic work (four DRGs covering primary hip and knee replacements) since July 2011.  Seven hospitals initially participated with a further five hospitals joining from January 2012.  The pilot operates by reducing current budgets by an amount of money that relates to the four DRGs.  This portion of the budget is then &ldquo;earned&rdquo; back based on work carried out in the hospital.  There is no change to any other portion of the hospital budget.  </p><p>  The project has been reviewed twice, with the most recent report completed in December 2012.  This report highlighted a number of efficiency related benefits including significantly reduced average lengths of stay, increased numbers of day of surgery admissions, and an increase in the number of discharges at the weekend.  While the level of improvement varied across the different hospitals and the different DRGs, all showed significant improvements in these key determinants of hospital efficiency and productivity.  </p><p>  This pilot is the first example of Money Follows the Patient in operation in Irish hospitals and is a useful exercise in highlighting the benefits that can accrue as a result of these types of funding arrangements.  It also provides useful lessons in terms of systems and process requirements as well as the need for stakeholder buy-in ahead of roll-out to the wider hospital system.  It is intended that the orthopaedic project will continue until the end of the year at which time the aim is to commence full phased implementation of MFTP.  </p><p>  While it is not possible to specify a percentage increase in efficiency that will result when MFTP is rolled out across all public hospitals, I am confident that its introduction will drive efficiencies in similar areas to those evident in the orthopaedic project.  This will help to deliver a more efficient and productive hospital system.  </p></reply>

The fee for pharmacists of &euro;15 was set in accordance with the provisions of the Community Pharmacy Contractor (CPC) Agreement.   This provides a choice for those to whom this vaccination is recommended either to have the vaccine administered by their GP or by a participating pharmacist.  Based on HSE vaccine delivery statistics, thus far, the majority of those vaccinated  have opted to have their seasonal influenza vaccination administered by their GP.  </p><p>  Under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act  2009, I am preparing legislation to bring the fees for GP administration of seasonal influenza in line with those set for pharmacists. This will result in further savings expected to be in the region of &euro;5m in a full year.</p><p>  There are no plans to transfer responsibility for administration of seasonal flu vaccine to community pharmacists.   Seasonal Flu vaccination forms part of the Adult Immunisation Programme operated by the HSE.   Seasonal Flu vaccination is available every year as the vaccine changes every year to suit the strain of the circulating virus.    The vaccine is free to those in at risk groups.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-18a.2006.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013071800047#WREEE02000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 719 and 747 together.</p><p>The Government is committed to introducing, on a phased basis, a universal GP service without fees within its first term of office, as set out in the Programme for Government and the Future Health strategy framework. This policy constitutes a fundamental element in the Government&rsquo;s health reform programme. The current Government is the first in the history of this State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. </p><p>  It has become clear that the legal and administrative framework required to provide a robust basis for eligibility for a GP service based on having a particular medical condition is likely to be overly complex and bureaucratic. Relatively complex primary legislation would be required in order to provide a GP service to a person on the basis of their having a particular illness. The assessment system for such an approach would have to be robust, objective and auditable in order to have the confidence of this House as well as the general public. This legislation would have to address how a person could be certified as having such an illness, and who could do this, and how to select the diagnostic basis for medical conditions. As well as primary legislation, there would be a need for secondary legislation to give full effect to this approach for each condition. While it would not be impossible to achieve this, it would take several months more to finalise the primary legislation, followed then by the preparation of statutory instruments. In my view, this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what is only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population. </p><p>  However, the Government is firmly committed to introducing a universal service within this term. The Cabinet Committee on Health has discussed the issues relating to the roll-out of the universal GP service. In doing so, it has considered the delay in the initial step and the importance of weighing the balance between, on the one hand, resolving the legal issues but with a further delay and, on the other hand, with the need to bring forward an important Programme for Government commitment with the minimum of further delay. </p><p>  It has been agreed that a number of alternative options should be set out with regard to the phased implementation of a universal GP service without fees.  Minister Reilly and I have updated the Taoiseach on this matter and we expect to report back to the Cabinet Committee in the near future. As part of this work, consideration is being given to the approaches, timing and financial implications of the phased implementation of this universal health service.  </p><p>  The Government has already made clear its commitment to delivering on the implementation of a GP service for the entire population by providing additional financial resources in the two most recent Budgets. The HSE Vote now contains funding of &euro;30 million for this year for an initial phase of the provision of GP services as part of this Programme for Government commitment.</p><p>  To conclude,this Government is determined to expedite the implementation of a national GP service for the entire population, something to which no previous Government has ever aspired.</p></reply>

In order for discretionary medical circumstances to be taken into consideration, a medical report is required. Where an applicant has indicated on their application that there are discretionary medical circumstances present, and where no medical report has been provided, PCRS will issue a medical report to that applicant for completion and return.</p><p>  In certain circumstances, where it is considered necessary to make a final assessment of an application for medical card/GP Visit Card eligibility, PCRS may request further detail in the form of an additional medical report.</p><p>  If, at any time after a decision on their application is reached, an individual feels there has been a change in their circumstances material to their medical card eligibility, that person may submit to PCRS a new medical card application complete with all relevant supporting documentation, including an up-to-date medical report where appropriate. A new assessment of their eligibility will then be undertaken on the basis of the information provided.</p></reply>

The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations.</p><p>  It is not possible to estimate the savings that would be achieved from excluding households with an income greater than &euro;100,000 because this would require income data which the HSE's Primary Care Reimbursement Service does not hold (as the Drug Payment Scheme is not means-tested).

Under the Act, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is responsible for the assessment for interchangeability of medicines. The IMB will review an initial 20 active substances, which equates to approximately 1,500 individual medicines. They include statins, proton pump inhibitors, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers.</p><p>  It is expected that the first List of Interchangeable Medicines, containing groups of atorvastatin products, will be published in mid-August at which time generic prices will fall by 20%. The IMB will publish subsequent lists for other groups of medicines on an ongoing basis.</p><p>  The Act also provides that the HSE may set a reference price for each group of interchangeable products published on the List of Interchangeable Products. Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines. It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine's prices.</p><p>  The Act provides that when the HSE is setting a reference price for, or reviewing a reference price set for, a relevant group of interchangeable medicinal products it shall take into account the following criteria:</p><p>- the ability of suppliers to meet patient demand for the relevant item;</p><p>- the value for money afforded by the relevant item;</p><p>- the equivalent prices of the relevant item in all other Member States where the product is marketed;</p><p>- the prices of therapeutically similar items; and</p><p>- the resources available to the HSE.</p><p>  Once the IMB publishes the first list of interchangeable products, the HSE will commence the process of setting a reference price for that group in accordance with the timeframes set out in the legislation.  The first reference price is expected to be implemented by November.</p></reply>

The 1991 and 1997 Consultant Contracts provided for consultants working 33 hours per week, while the 2008 Consultant Contract provided for consultants working 37 hours per week.</p><p>  However, under the Haddington Road Agreement the working hours for public servants, including consultants, with a working week of 35 hours or less (net of rest breaks) have been increased to a minimum of 37 hours per week with effect from 1 July 2013.  Staff who previously had a net  working-week of more than 35 but less than 39 hours (net of rest breaks) move to a 39-hour week, with the first two hours 15 minutes taking effect from 1 July 2013 and any balance being applied from 1 July 2015.</p><p>  Irrespective of contract, many consultants are liable to provide on-call services and attend on-site outside of contracted hours. Consultants employed on the 2008 Contract may be required formally to provide up to five additional hours on Saturdays, Sundays or Bank Holidays.</p><p>  The revised salary rates for medical consultants can be found in my Department's Consolidated Salary Scales which issued on foot of the Haddington Road Agreement in recent weeks and which are published on the Department's website www.doh.ie.</p><p>  The HSE has responsibility for implementation of the terms of the contracts held by consultants working in the public health service.  I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to the enforcement of compliance with the contractual provisions regarding private practice.</p></reply>

These measures included the extension of the remit of the Task Forces to include alcohol addiction and the establishment of a National Coordinating Committee for Drug and Alcohol Task Forces, which will replace the Drugs Advisory Group.</p><p>  As measures to address the abuse of alcohol remain under consideration by the Government, I am not yet in a position to provide clear time-scales for the establishment of the new National Coordinating Committee.  However, the Government remains fully committed to the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy, including at the local level.  To this end, I intend to arrange a series of bilateral dialogues in the coming weeks with Government departments and agencies, the community and voluntary sector and the drugs task forces in order to assess how the inter-agency approach to the National Drugs Strategy can be maintained and strengthened.  Reinvigorating the multi-sectoral approach to the National Drugs Strategy is key to the successful implementation of the Drugs Task Force reforms in my view.</p></reply>

In recent years, community pharmacists have broadened their range of services to include flu vaccinations, emergency hormonal contraception services, advice on healthy eating, support with smoking cessation, and continue, most importantly, to provide advice and support for patients in managing their medications.</p><p>  Implementation of the <i>Future Health: A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012-2015</i> document, which was published in late 2012, is a priority for Government.  Delivering on the Government's goals in primary care will impact on primary care health professionals, including community pharmacists.  As part of implementation of <i>Future Health, </i>  pharmacists will be expected to identify and contribute to implementing evidence-based and cost-effective solutions to ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of the healthcare system, by addressing key medication issues such as medicines wastage, inappropriate usage of medicines, supporting and improving chronic disease management and patient adherence to medication.</p><p>  In particular, the Department is supportive of a further expansion in the role of the community pharmacist into areas such as health screening and intends to engage with pharmacists in this context as plans to introduce Universal Primary Care are further developed.</p></reply>

Such a decision would have cross Governmental implications and could only be taken after an extensive consideration. However, the National Roads Authority has carried out preliminary work on the issue of HGV road charging detailing the options available given that there are a number of European Directives in this area; the international experience and trends on road user charging; and the issues that will need to be considered in an Irish context.

The aim of the proposal is to contribute to the reduction of the number of aircraft accidents and related fatalities, using civil aviation occurrences for correcting safety deficiencies and prevent them from reoccurring. Extensive discussions on this dossier were held at the Aviation Working Group of the European Council, Chaired by the Irish Presidency. A separate group of experts was established to consider the technical annexes to the proposal. </p><p>  At the June Transport Council a General Approach was reached on this proposal.  However, further work was required in relation to the technical annexes and considering the importance of the annexes to the Regulation, a decision was taken to adopt these as Commission implementing acts, allowing further involvement of Member States experts.  The Lithuanian Presidency will now enter into negotiations with the European Parliament on this proposal.</p><p>   In terms of the implications of this proposal on the Irish aviation industry, this proposal is updating and enhancing an existing Directive on occurrence reporting, the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) is the competent authority in the State for the purposes of implementing this Directive.  The IAA have already established both a mandatory and a voluntary occurrence reporting system, the new proposal will extend the reporting requirements to the wider aviation community.</p></reply>
