    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-01-17a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011700068#WRA00600"><p>All claim decisions taken by the Department&rsquo;s deciding officers are appealable to the Chief Appeals Officer.  In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded and just 1% are appealed.  Nevertheless the Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible. Accordingly, significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017.     The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with appeal officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the higher courts and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  </p>  <p>  Other factors that influence appeals times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decision&rsquo;s process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  I expect that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.</p>  <p>  In addition, a number of new appeals officers have joined the appeals office over the past year, to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise.  This changeover in staff has led to a slightly longer time to conclude appeals in 2017.  However, I am advised by the Chief Appeals Officer that she expects performance to improve further in 2018.</p>  <p>  Firstly, it should be noted that an appellant can claim supplementary welfare allowance pending the outcome of their appeal and that any favourable decisions are backdated to the original date of claims. </p></reply>

The scheme will complement and sit alongside other opportunities developed by the Department of Education and Skills, such as the new Career Traineeships and Apprenticeships, and will broaden the choice available to young people. </p><p>The qualifying payments are Jobseekers&rsquo; Payments, One Parent Family Payment, Jobseeker Transition Payment, Disability Allowance, Blind Person&rsquo;s Pension or Supplementary Welfare Allowance.  In some cases, candidates who have been in receipt of a payment for less than 12 months, but who are considered by a case worker to face significant barriers to work will be granted access to the scheme.</p><p>Young people, like other groups vary in terms of skills, aptitudes, and background so the scheme will aim to offer them a wide variety of work experience options to meet their particular needs.  </p><p>The scheme will be open to employers across the private, community and voluntary sectors who meet the eligibility criteria.  Public sector organisations will be excluded.</p><p>The range of skills that a participant may acquire will be dependent on the type of placement offered and the skills level of the person on commencement.</p><p>A Learning and Development Plan will be at the core of each placement and progress will be supported and monitored by a case worker in my Department on an ongoing basis. </p><p>Apart from relevant &lsquo;hard&rsquo; or specific skills, there will be a focus on the acquisition and demonstration of &lsquo;soft&rsquo; employability skills that will improve the participant&rsquo;s employment prospects, such as interpersonal and communication skills, teamwork, punctuality, time management, and customer service.  Onsite work experience can be complemented by off-site training, as appropriate.</p><p>The key determinant will be whether the placement can provide a meaningful learning and development opportunity for the potential candidate.</p><p>The Host Organisation will complete an assessment for the participant at the end of the placement.  Employers will be encouraged to hire participants who have performed well, and will qualify for a financial subsidy under JobsPlus Youth.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-01-17a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011700068#WRA01200"><p>The State pension contributory is paid from the Social Insurance Fund.  Accordingly, it is important to ensure those qualifying for that pension have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement, all contributions, paid or credited, over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account.</p>  <p>  The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension contributory easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or caring for incapacitated people over that age, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.</p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for another payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult, amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State pension non-contributory, which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.</p>  <p>  Due to the redistributive nature of the Social Insurance Fund, women generally get more back from their PRSI contributions than men on an actuarial basis, particularly those with lower earnings and shorter contribution years.</p>  <p>  I plan to introduce a total contributions approach to the calculation of the State Pension (Contributory) to replace the yearly average approach from around 2020.  The position of homemakers will be carefully considered in the context of that reform.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-01-17a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011700068#WRA01600"><p>There are 93,000 clients currently engaged with JobPath of which 483, or 0.5%, currently have a penalty rate applied to their claim. This figure is consistent with the overall level of penalty rate applied across all Job Seekers.  In total since the JobPath service commenced,  approximately 6,500 or 4.6% of the 141,000 clients who had engaged with the JobPath service (between July 2015 and December 2017) have had, at some point during their engagement period, a penalty rate applied to their payment.  JobPath providers do not apply or recommend the application of a penalty rate of payment.  They simply advise the Department if a jobseeker is failing to attend activation meetings.  Officials in my Department then contact the Jobseeker and seek to arrange a meeting to discuss the matter directly with them.  The application of penalty rates is entirely a matter for my Department and officials involved will take all relevant factors into account.</p>  <p>  In the interests of natural justice, a jobseeker who fails to participate in the activation process, whether that is provided directly by the Intreo Service or via a contracted service provider, is given both written and verbal warnings and an opportunity to comply before a reduced rate of payment is applied.  Furthermore, Jobseekers can, through co-operation with the activation service of my Department, benefit from early re-instatement of the full rate of Jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.</p>  <p>  The legislation underpinning the application of reduced rates of payment is provided for in the Social Welfare Act 2010.   All decisions on the application of reduced rates of payment are made by Deciding Officers and are based on all the available evidence and the circumstances of each case.  The Jobseeker can appeal the Deciding Officer&rsquo;s decision through the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).</p>  <p>  Reduced rates are only applied where a job seeker fails to engage as requested, and following at least two warnings, with the Department&rsquo;s employment services. </p></reply>

The Department is committed, under Pathways to Work, to incentivise the take-up of activation opportunities, including implementing sanctions for failure to engage. </p>  <p>  The application of penalty rates is provided for in Social Welfare legislation.  The application of the penalty provisions can only be applied in specific circumstances and the decision to impose a penalty can only be made by a Deciding Officer of the Department. If dissatisfied with that decision it is open to the Jobseeker to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  </p>  <p>  The number of instances of Penalty Rates in 2017 was 16,451, involving 13,503 individuals. </p></reply>

The first phase of implementation is underway in the areas of South Dublin, North Leinster (Kildare, Longford, Louth, Meath and Westmeath) and South Munster (Cork &amp;amp; Kerry).   CIB is providing regular updates on the restructuring programme directly to all CIS and MABS Chairpersons and staff.  Information sessions are being organised for Chairpersons of local services, providing an opportunity to seek clarifications on the process of transfer to the new regional companies and the wind up of the existing companies.  </p>  <p>  Implementation of the new eight region model, with the establishment of a new regional CIS and MABS company in each region, is expected to take up to two years to complete.  </p>  <p>  It is not envisaged that there will be cost savings in 2018. Cost has never been a driver of this change.  The aim is to improve existing governance arrangements and to optimise the benefits from operating a more modern and streamlined citizen-focused service delivery model.  For 2018, the focus for CIB and its service delivery partners is to maintain existing levels and standards of service provision to citizens during the transitional period.  No major new service development initiatives are planned during this period of change. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It must be remembered that citizen centric CIS and MABS services are 100% funded by the Exchequer.  It is essential that each company operates to modern and evolving standards of corporate governance, including compliance with necessary financial and audit requirements.</p>  <p>  Under the current unwieldy arrangements, each of the 93 services operates as independent entities and considerable administrative effort is required in the maintenance of each individual company.  As many common services are delivered to citizens across the country, opportunities exist to improve service standards and consistency nationwide.  Reducing the administrative burden on local service managers and re-direction of valuable resources to front line services will improve services for those who rely on them.  </p>  <p>  In parallel, improved monitoring of service delivery will assist CIB in identifying weaknesses and assist regional services in getting appropriate and suitable supports in place.  </p>  <p>  A reduction in the number of individual, yet similar, CIS and MABS companies from 93 to 16 will better facilitate adherence to required governance standards, assist CIB in meeting its legislative responsibilities as direct funder and bring CIS and MABS organisations more into line with modern public service governance guidelines and requirements.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The survey also shows that social transfers play a very significant role in reducing poverty and that Ireland continues to be among the best performing EU countries in reducing poverty and inequality through spending on social protection.   In 2018, expenditure on illness, disability and carers payments will amount to over &euro;3.9 billion or almost one fifth of the total Departmental spend.  This includes a &euro;5 per week increase in the maximum weekly rate for recipients of disability allowance, invalidity pension and carer&rsquo;s allowance, with proportionate increases for adult dependents and an increase of &euro;2 per child per week for qualified child dependents.</p>  <p>  Given the continuing economic recovery throughout 2017 and the measures introduced in Budgets 2016, 2017 and 2018, it is reasonable to expect future poverty statistics to show improvements. I will continue to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that the economic recovery is experienced in all regions and by all families, households and individuals.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that the best route out of poverty and social exclusion is through paid employment. My Department manages a range of employment support programmes for people with disabilities, including the wage subsidy scheme, the EmployAbility service and the reasonable accommodation fund.  The partial capacity benefit is also available to support people on invalidity pension or illness benefit (of more than 6 months) who have some capacity for work and who choose to return to employment.  The Department&rsquo;s Intreo service is also available to provide employment support services for people with disabilities who wish to engage with the service on a voluntary basis.  Expenditure on these programmes will amount to some &euro;50 million in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to increasing the employment opportunities for people with a disability.  The Comprehensive Employment Strategy for people with disabilities adopts a cross-government approach that brings together various measures, to be taken by different Departments and State agencies, in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on the employment of people with disabilities.  The aim of the strategy is to increase the numbers of people at work, and the proportion of people with disabilities in a job.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy for addressing poverty and social exclusion is set out in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  The Strategy identifies a wide range of targeted actions and interventions to achieve the overall objective of reducing consistent poverty.  The Department is reviewing the Plan, as it reached the end of its term in 2017, with a view to developing an updated plan for future periods.  The Department will also review the national social target for poverty reduction.  This review will be undertaken in consultation with relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that a reduction in measured poverty rates for people with a disability is a key priority of the Government.  We will continue to keep the range of supports under review as well as implement the comprehensive employment strategy in order to secure better income and employment outcomes for people with disabilities.</p></reply>

Recent research by the ESRI and the OECD has drawn attention to the prevalence of mental health conditions in the working-age population.  Both an effective income support system and health services are key to addressing these difficulties but the research has also demonstrated that work can be an important factor in recovery, in particular for people with mental health issues. The Make Work Pay report for People with Disabilities, published last year, identified the need for flexibility in the income support and medical card system where a person with a disability takes up a job and options available if that job does not work out.  This anxiety can be particularly pronounced amongst those with mental health issues, given the episodic nature of such conditions.  One of the recommendations of the report was to put in place and promote a system for fast-track reinstatement of disability allowance, illness benefit or invalidity pension to people with disabilities who have returned to work, and have subsequently had to leave their job within one year.</p>  <p>  As a first step in implementing this recommendation a fast-track return to disability allowance protocol has now been put in place.  In addition to this initiative, people who are participating on the partial capacity benefit scheme may return to illness benefit or invalidity pension if they find that they cannot continue to work.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides a wide range of work related supports for people with disabilities, including people with mental health difficulties that they or where appropriate their employers can access while in receipt of income support payments.  These include the Wage Subsidy Scheme, the EmployAbility service and employment support grants for people with disabilities. </p>  <p>  Most recently, my Department was a partner organisation in the Integrating Employment and Mental Health Service project, which ran between 2015 and 2017.  The aim of this project was to demonstrate how existing mental health and supported employment (EmployAbility) services could fulfil the best practice Individual Placement and Support (IPS) model of supported employment for clients with mental health issues.  An evaluation report is currently being finalised and this shows that overall, the project demonstrated good outcomes through improved integration between mental health services and employment support services.  Following on from this work, my Department has been collaborating with the Department of Health and the Health Services Executive to consider how best to embed this learning within the social protection and the health systems. </p></reply>

The plan will include measures relating to the introduction of a &lsquo;Total Contributions Approach&rsquo; to the State pension for new pensioners, reform and simplification of the current supplementary pension landscape and measures required to transpose the EU &lsquo;IORP II&rsquo; Pensions Directive. Perhaps the most fundamental reform measure contained within this plan will relate to the development of a new automatic enrolment supplementary retirement savings system for employees without pensions coverage.  Auto enrolment would see a transition from the current and purely voluntary supplementary pension system to one which will, subject to certain parameters, automatically enrol employees into a quality assured retirement savings system.  This reform, where the saver will maintain the freedom of choice to opt-out, will encourage long term saving and asset accumulation amongst those who may otherwise suffer a reduction in living standards at retirement.  It will increase the wellbeing, financial security and independence of future retirees.</p>  <p>  Following publication of the reform plan, I intend that detailed evidence building and consultation will be undertaken to inform fundamental choices which are required regarding the preferred operational structure and organisational governance for a new system as well as many design elements such as contribution levels, financial incentives and target membership.  Correctly positioning / designing each of these will be critical to the success of any system. </p>  <p>  Subject to any Government decision regarding the manner in which this project should be progressed, it is my objective that first members would be enrolled in the new system by 2022.  This project timeframe reflects the scale of such a programme and its importance as being the most fundamental reform of the Irish supplementary pension system in generations. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

On 7th December 2017, I published the <i>Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017</i>.  The Bill delivers on the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to tackle the problems caused by the increased casualisation of work and to strengthen the regulation of precarious work.

It is important that all schemes operated by the Department, including State Pension (non-contributory), are subject to ongoing control reviews and continuing eligibility checks.  This includes conducting fraud and error surveys which serve to reaffirm the entitlement of randomly selected recipients to their ongoing social welfare payments. Fraud and error surveys are an integral part of the Department&rsquo;s overall approach to control.  They provide the Department with an indicator of the risk of non-compliance with scheme rules at a point in time and provide evidence on where control activities should be focused and inform risk assessment models for schemes.</p>  <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;AG) reports annually on the regularity of social welfare payments.  These reports are based on the outcome of fraud and error surveys undertaken by the Department.  In recent years, the C&amp;AG has made recommendations in relation to the methodologies underpinning the surveys which have been adopted by the Department and the implementation of actions to address control weaknesses identified as a result of surveys.  Surveys involve sample cases and sample sizes representative of the specific scheme claim load.

First, the State pension non-contributory is a means-tested pension funded from taxation.  Second, the State pension contributory, which is not means-tested, is paid from the Social Insurance Fund, and is funded via the PRSI system.  The third main state pension available to some people over 66 is the Widows/Widowers Contributory Pension.</p>  <p>  It is important to ensure those qualifying for the contributory pension have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  Such contributory pensions, with rates of payment linked to contributions made into a fund, are the norm internationally.</p>  <p>  To ensure that people can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions, paid or credited, over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.</p>  <p>  The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension contributory easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or caring for incapacitated people over that age, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of his or her pension.</p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult, amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for the means-tested State pension non-contributory, which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.</p>  <p>  When all payments across the State pension system are taken into account, the difference in the average direct payment to men and women is approximately 1% in Ireland.  This would be very low by European standards, and as a result CSO figures show that poverty levels among those over 66 are very low for both men and women, and are at parity.  In the latest figures, the rate of Consistent Poverty for men over 66 was 1.79% for men and 1.36% for women, compared to 8.3% for the general population.</p>  <p>  Later this year, I plan to propose legislation to introduce a total contributions approach to the calculation of the State Pension (Contributory), replacing the current yearly average approach.  The position of homemakers will be carefully considered in the context of that reform.</p>  <p>  Finally, last year I instructed my Department officials to undertake an in-depth examination of 2012 changes to the rate bands of the State Pension (contributory), with a view to identifying equitable options for reliefs where a person's PRSI gap resulted from a period of caring for children or older people, or for those with homemaking periods prior to the introduction of the Homemaker&rsquo;s scheme in 1994.  I am pleased to say, that this work has been completed.  Later this week I will bring this report to a Cabinet Committee for discussion, with a view to bringing a proposal to Cabinet in the near future.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies. </p></reply>

The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) which was available to people aged 65 who satisfied the qualifying conditions.  This measure standardised the State pension age for all at 66 years. This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.</p>  <p>  In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to State pension age. Where this is not possible, there are specific measures which apply to someone claiming Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit from a date after their 65th birthday.  Where qualified, these recipients may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age.</p>  <p>  We are all well aware that people are living for much longer.  Life expectancy at birth has increased significantly over the years &ndash; and is now at 78.4 years for men 82.8 years for women.  This is very positive.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.</p>  <p>  The Deputies should note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies. </p></reply>

The most recent data show that unemployment has fallen from a peak of 15% in 2012 to 6.2% by mid-2017.  Numbers at work have increased from just over 1.83 million in Quarter 2, 2012 to 2.06 million in Quarter 2, 2017 &ndash; an increase of 227,000 persons.  Within the South East region, which includes Wexford, unemployment has fallen from 19.0% to 8.1% over the same period, and numbers in employment have increased by 29,000 to 214,900. While data from the QNHS are not available at the county level, trends in the Live Register can give an indication of underlying trends in local unemployment. Overall, the Live Register in Wexford has fallen by almost 42% in the 5 years to December 2017, close to the reduction of 44% nationally.  In the year to December 2017, the Live Register in Wexford has fallen by 1,707 people, or almost 14%, again closely in line with the national trend.   The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle unemployment since 2012 is twofold:  </p>  <p>-    Firstly, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs.  This policy now includes a specific regional Action Plan for the South East Region that has seen over 8,000 jobs created in the region in the last two years. </p>  <p>-    Secondly, through Pathways to Work, my Department ensures that as many new jobs and vacancies as possible are filled by people taken from the Live Register.  Under this policy, employment services and activation supports are heavily concentrated on the areas of highest unemployment, including those in Wexford.</p>  <p>  To date, these policies have been effective in reducing unemployment, both nationally and in Wexford and I am confident that they will continue to do so.</p>  <p>  Currently, there are 11 Activation Case Officers in Wexford.  This is an increase of one in comparison to January 2017, when there were 10.  Prior to the roll-out of Intreo, there were 8 Activation Case Officers in Wexford, including former FAS personnel and DSP Jobs Facilitators.</p>  <p>  The Case Officer capacity is supplemented by referrals to Turas Nua under the Job Path programme and to Wexford Local Development which operates the Local Employment Service (LES) on behalf of the Department.  Wexford Local Development is contracted to provide intensive supports to 960 customers and employs 8 mediators to support LES operations. </p>  <p>  A total of 9,114 customer engagements were scheduled by Activation Case Officers in 2017 in addition to their work with employers.  Local records indicate that approximately 5,300 referrals to Turas Nua took place over the course of the year. </p>  <p>  My Department is required to operate within a staff ceiling figure and the focus remains on ensuring that the best use is made of all available resources.  Against that background, and a falling Live Register, there are currently no plans to increase the number of Activation Case Officers. However, the matter is kept under constant review in light of changing circumstances. </p></reply>

The Government has provided &euro;36.42 million for these payments in 2018.</p><p>Nearly all of the expenditure incurred by the Department, including that for exceptional payment, is demand-led.  Demand for the Department's schemes is driven by demographic trends and economic factors such as developments in the labour market.  Where additional moneys are required to meet demand on overall expenditure for the year, the Department may seek a Supplementary Estimate.  The Government had provided &euro;31.5 million for ENPs and UNPs in the Revised Estimates for 2017 with an additional &euro;5.7 million made available through the recent Supplementary Estimate giving a total allocation of &euro;37.2 million in 2017.  </p><p>The legislation does not confer a statutory right or entitlement to ENPs.  The guidelines issued to staff administering the ENP scheme assist them in the decision making process.  The principle consideration in making a payment under the ENP scheme is to address a particular once-off and exceptional need which is not of an expected or recurring nature and is therefore by its nature generally unforeseen.  The guidelines do not affect the discretion available to officers in issuing an ENP to assist an individual or household in any particular hardship situation which may arise, so that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  </p><p>Statistics are maintained relating to payments under the ENP scheme, however they are not maintained on the number of applications or the outcome of those applications.  Details of the number of payments and expenditure made under the ENP scheme in County Tipperary for 2014 to 2017 are set out in Table 1 and the total number of payments for the years 2015 to 2018 are set out in Table 2 of the following tabular statement.  For reporting purposes this data also includes the numbers of urgent needs payments (UNP).  </p><p>Any persons who consider that they have an entitlement to an ENP should contact my Department. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p><p><b>Tabular Statement</b></p><p><b>Table 1 - Number of Exceptional Needs Payments and Exchequer Outturn made in Co.

However, generally speaking, trustees of pension schemes have duties and responsibilities under trust law, under other relevant legislation and under the Pensions Act.  They must administer the trust in accordance with the law and the terms of the trust deed and rules.    The provisions of the Pensions Act are enforced by the Pensions Authority so any issues or complaints in relation to a particular scheme should be notified to the Authority for action.  The Pensions Authority will assess if there has been a breach of any legal obligations and take any necessary action if such a breach is found.</p>  <p>  I intend to introduce a number of amendments to the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill at Committee Stage which will ensure that a sponsoring employer cannot &ldquo;walk away&rdquo; at short notice from the company pension scheme.</p>  <p>  The amendments will provide for a 12 month notification period where an employer is seeking to cease making contributions to a scheme.  They will also provide that, where a scheme is in deficit and a funding proposal is not been put in place in a timely manner, the Pensions Authority may direct a funding obligation to be paid by the employer to the  scheme.  </p>  <p>  There was not adequate time to include these technical and complex measures in the text of the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017 at Second Stage.

The report found that the changes to the one-parent family payment scheme made over the last number of years increased employment and reduced welfare dependency.  It also found that the changes increased the probability of employment and higher employment income for lone parents. The report also concluded that assisting lone parents to enhance skills also needs to be seen as a key objective as low paid employment will not, on its own, ensure a reduction in the risk of poverty.The full impact of the economic recovery is not reflected in these 2016 figures.</p>  <p>  Unemployment has fallen from 7.5% in November 2016 to 6.1% in November 2017, its lowest level in 9 and a half years.  The positive impact of recent Budgets on lone parents and the full impact of the increases in employment are also not reflected in these SILC figures.  Continued economic recovery, together with these Budget measures, is likely to have impacted positively on poverty rates since 2016 and this improvement is expected to continue over the coming years.</p>  <p>  In 2017, further Budget improvements were implemented, and I have continued to emphasise improvements for lone parents in particular.  My Department&rsquo;s social impact assessments of Budgets 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 are an indicator of this improvement.  These show a cumulative increase of &euro;36.75 in the average weekly household income of employed lone parents and &euro;33.60 for unemployed lone parents.  This compares favourably with a weekly increase of &euro;34.45 for the average household.</p>  <p>  Budget measures that I announced and that will take effect from 29th March 2018 (specifically the increases to the income disregard, the primary rate and the increase for a qualified child) will see a lone parent on the one-parent family payment and jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment working 15 hours a week on the National Minimum Wage better off by almost &euro;1000 per year.</p></reply>

This was an ambitious target, particularly during a time of economic recession, but one to which the Government has remained committed.Data from the CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) indicate that consistent poverty rose sharply after 2010, to a peak of 9.1% in 2013.  The latest SILC 2016 data, released by the CSO in December 2017, indicate that this had reduced to 8.3%.  A reduction of 6 percentage points would now be required to meet the 2020 poverty target.    The impact of the recovery is not yet fully reflected in these most recent data, which reflect income conditions in 2015-2016.  Macro-economic and labour market indicators have shown continued economic and employment growth since then.  Unemployment has fallen from 9.4% in mid-2015 to 6.1% towards the end of 2017.  The number of people in receipt of working-age income and employment supports has also continued to fall.  </p>  <p>  In addition, Budget 2018 introduced increases in a range of supports including &euro;5 per week increases in the maximum weekly rate for working-age people and young jobseekers and for pensioners, with proportionate increases for adult dependents and an increase of &euro;2 per child per week for qualified child dependents.  These increases will assist those individuals and families who are most in need.</p>  <p>  Given the continuing economic recovery and measures introduced in Budgets  2017 and 2018, I expect the figures for 2017 and 2018, when they become available, to show further improvement over the 2016 outcomes.  I will continue to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that the economic recovery is experienced in all regions and by all families, households and individuals.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy for addressing poverty and social exclusion is set out in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  The Plan identifies a wide range of targeted actions and interventions to achieve the overall objective of reducing consistent poverty.  My Department is currently reviewing the Plan, with a view to developing an updated plan for future periods.  As part of this update, the Department is also reviewing the national social target for poverty reduction.  This review will be undertaken in consultation with relevant stakeholders.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-01-17a.94.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011700069#WRB02800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 46 together.</p>  <p>  The current rate bands applying to the State pension contributory were introduced from September 2012, replacing previous rates introduced in 2000.  The rate bands prior to 2000 were less generous, and the improved rate bands introduced in 2000 were a feature of the economic and political environment at that time.  The economic crash changed the focus and while other payments were reduced as a result, the core rates of the pension, which many pensioners were solely dependent on, were maintained.  Instead, the rates for people who had additional means and lesser PRSI contribution records were reduced. </p>  <p>  The 2012 rate bands more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place between 2000 and 2012.  The current rate bands still provide pensions to people which are very favourable in comparison with their level of contribution over their working lives.  A person with only 20 years of contributions over nearly 50 years will still get an 85% pension.  Where they have limited additional means, they may instead be paid a non-contributory pension of up to 95% the maximum contributory rate, and over 70% of such pensioners are paid that pension at that rate.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that to revert to the previous bands from January 2018 would result in an annual cost of well over &euro;70 million extra in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10 to &euro;12 million extra each following year.</p>  <p>  I committed to examine in depth various options that may provide some relief to those who would have a higher contributory pension had the rate bands not been amended in 2012.  Officials in my Department have completed a report on this matter, which I intend to bring to a cabinet committee later this week.  Following that meeting, and subject to any necessary amendment or further discussions, I will bring the report to Government for consideration.</p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework proposed that a total contribution approach should replace the yearly average approach to the calculation of the State Pension (contributory).  It is intended to introduce a total contributions approach for new pensioners from 2020.  This will make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  It will also have significant homemakers provisions that will assist those pensioners who spent significant periods caring for their children, or adults with a caring need.  </p>  <p>  A discussion paper is being drafted by my Department and it is hoped to start the consultation process with relevant stakeholders including interest groups, representative bodies and the Oireachtas shortly.  Following the consultation period, a proposal to Government will be submitted seeking approval of the new approach. </p>  <p>  The main aim of Government policy on pensions is to make sure that pensions are affordable, sustainable and keep their value in the coming years.  The reforms that are planned will result in a more inclusive and fairer pension system for all citizens.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

My Department, like all Government departments and agencies is required to operate within a staff ceiling figure and a commensurate administrative staffing budget, which for this Department has involved reductions in staff.The staffing needs for all areas within the Department, including the Social Welfare Appeals Office and all areas involved in the processing of appeals, are continuously reviewed, taking account of workloads, management priorities and the ongoing need to respond to new increasing demands in a wide range of services.  This is to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources with a view to providing an efficient service to those who rely on the schemes operated by the Department.</p><p>Appeal processing times are kept under constant scrutiny by the Chief Appeals Officer.  The Deputy will be aware that significant effort and resources have been devoted in recent years to reducing the length of the time taken to finalise an appeal and that as a consequence processing times have improved quite considerably.</p><p>The overall average processing time, across all schemes, for appeals requiring an oral hearing reduced from 52.5 weeks in 2011 to 25.5 weeks in 2015, and 24.1 weeks in 2016.  The overall average time taken to finalise appeals decided by way of a summary decision has also improved in recent years from a peak of 25.1 weeks in 2011 to 18.1 weeks in 2015, and 17.6 weeks in 2016.</p><p>I understand from the Chief Appeals Officer that there has been a slight increase in overall appeal processing times to date in 2017 with appeals requiring an oral hearing taking an average of 26.4 weeks and summary decisions taking 19.8 weeks to finalise.  However she is hopeful that this will be addressed in the coming months as a number of newly appointed Appeals Officers become more experienced in their roles.</p><p>The time taken to process an appeal reflects all aspects of the appeal process including time spent in the Department preparing the appeal submission.  The quasi-judicial nature of the appeals system means that there are inevitable time-lags involved.  The time taken is proportionate to the complexity of many of the issues under appeal which require a high level of judgement, and the need to ensure due process and natural justice.  The system is designed to be flexible and fair and allows for review and submission of further information at all stages which is to the benefit of the appellant. </p><p>The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that appeal processing times will continue to be a priority for her office. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Appeals Processing Times by Scheme 01/01/2015 &ndash;

Both schemes provide significant support to individuals so that they can work up to 3 days a week and still retain access to a reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  The 2018 Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes of &euro;2.17 billion.At present an individual can earn a little over &euro;19,760 per year and still retain a small jobseeker's allowance payment, while the equivalent threshold for an individual with a qualified adult is almost &euro;33,975 if they are both working.  Where a person&rsquo;s part time employment ceases they can apply for jobseekers allowance which is a means tested payment or if they have the required number of contributions they may have an entitlement to jobseekers benefit.   An Taoiseach, in his previous role as Minister for Social Protection, gave a commitment at D&aacute;il report stage of the Social Welfare Bill 2016 that he would ask officials to examine the issue of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the treatment of part-time and seasonal workers, including those categorised as having subsidiary employment. My officials have recently completed this report on these issues which I will consider in detail.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently collating data in relation to those who qualify for Jobseekers Benefit and who are in subsidiary employment.

My Department&rsquo;s priority in supporting CE is to ensure access to good quality work experience and training qualifications on schemes for jobseekers and other vulnerable groups in order to support their progression into employment.  In the context of the economic recovery, my Department undertook a review of the work programmes in 2016.  While the primary focus was on CE, the review also looked at other employment programmes such as T&uacute;s.  Arising from the review, the Government agreed to implement changes to the qualifying conditions for CE in order to broaden access to a wider range of people.  These new rules were implemented from July 2017.  The qualifying age was reduced to 21 years.  In addition, while in general all placements will now be for one year only, if a CE participant is undertaking training to achieve a major  award, their time can be extended by up to 2 year to allow them to complete the training which will enhance their overall employment prospects.     This allows for 3 years continuous participation on CE. Those over 55 years of age can also remain on CE for three years.  In addition, the reference year for CE participation was moved from 2000 to 2007 which ensures that more people can re-qualify for the programme.  Overall, these changes improve the way the schemes operate and will allow more people who are long-term unemployed to access them.  </p>  <p>  The Government is very mindful of the large number of work programme places involved in service delivery and other valuable services around the country.  In this regard, if any scheme is experiencing particular recruitment difficulties, they should contact their local Department Intreo Centre for assistance</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The arrangement of maintenance is therefore a matter between both parents regardless of whether or not either parent is in receipt of a social welfare payment.      My Department has previously indicated its intention to review the current maintenance and liable relative procedures in light of the changes to the one-parent family payment scheme, and work had commenced on this review.  Since April 2017, however, work on the review of the one-parent family payment, which was required to be completed over a short timeframe, took priority given the statutory nature of the review.</p>  <p>  That review (the Indecon Report) was completed in October 2017and the Report was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Work has now re-commenced on the review of maintenance as it relates to my Department. This review will necessitate my Department liaising with the Department of Justice and Equality as the Family Law Acts, which place a legal obligation on parents to maintain their children, are under the remit of that Department.</p>  <p>  This is a complex area however I expect to have a paper from my officials on this shortly.  </p></reply>

Significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times improved between 2011 and 2016 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 24.1 weeks in 2016 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 17.6 weeks in 2016.I understand from the Chief Appeals Officer that there has been a slight increase in processing times in 2017 with oral hearings taking, on average, 26.4 weeks and summary decisions taking 19.8 weeks to finalise.  A number of factors have contributed to the increase including the retirement of six experienced Appeals Officers during the first half of 2017.  However, she is hopeful that processing times will improve as a number of newly appointed Officers gain experience in their roles.</p><p>Specific actions taken to reduce processing times include: liaising with HR to ensure that vacancies are filled quickly; ensuring that training is given to new Appeals Officers as early as possible; working with the Department to reduce time in submitting appeal files. </p><p>It is open to an appellant to claim supplementary welfare allowance pending the outcome of their appeal if their means are insufficient to meet their needs. </p><p>The Chief Appeals Officer assures me that processing times are a priority.  However, the drive for efficiency must be balanced with the competing demand to ensure that decisions are consistent and of high quality. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Appeals Processing Times by Scheme 01/01/2015 &ndash;

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade&rsquo;s processes for dealing with bullying, sexual harassment and related complaints are outlined in the 2015 &ldquo;Dignity at Work&rdquo; policy &ndash; an anti-bullying, harassment and sexual harassment policy for the civil service.  The policy aims to promote respect, dignity, safety and equality in the workplace. Prior to 2015, such complaints were dealt with under the &ldquo;Positive Working Environment&rdquo; policy.</p>  <p>  Since 2011, the HR Unit of the Department has conducted or facilitated formal investigations into a small number of complaints under the specific categories mentioned.

Our priorities are clearly laid out in the Government&rsquo;s development policy, &lsquo;One World One Future&rsquo;.  In line with our commitment to the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, our aid programme is sharply focused on delivering our goals of reducing poverty and hunger, promoting inclusive and sustainable growth and building more equitable and better systems of governance.</p><p>My Department provides development assistance to over eighty of the world&rsquo;s least developed countries, supporting their development needs and responding to emergencies and protracted crises with humanitarian assistance.  Sub-Saharan Africa is our priority region, where we direct assistance to the poorest communities, delivering real and sustainable improvements to the lives of some of the world poorest and most vulnerable people in the areas of basic health, education, agriculture, and food production. </p><p>We focus in particular on a small number of key bilateral countries where we have a resident embassy and a team of development specialist and advisors who manage and oversee those country aid programmes.  Our engagement with our partner countries is at a strategic level, and we provide support for their long-term development.  These countries are Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique, Sierra Leone and Vietnam.  Smaller more focused programs are delivered in countries and territories such as Zimbabwe, South Africa, Liberia, Kenya and Palestine.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme is delivered through a wide range of partners and channels, including partner government systems, Irish and international Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and missionary organisations, and UN and other multilateral agencies and organisations.  We engage with UN and multilateral agencies whose core mission and objectives are closely aligned to Ireland&rsquo;s aid priorities, allowing us to work with and support vulnerable communities across most developing countries. </p><p>The full list of ODA eligible countries is published annually by the OECD Development Assistance Committee and is available at the following link:</p><p>www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DAC%20List%20of%20ODA%20Recipients%202014%20final.pdf</p><p>The total Bilateral ODA provided by my Department to each ODA eligible country requested by the Deputy for the period 2011 to 2016 is detailed in the following table.  2017 figures are currently being finalised and compiled.

A tax administration may ask for specific information on a particular case from another jurisdiction.  When this happens, it is known as EOI on request. Alternatively, a jurisdiction may freely offer information it believes to be of interest to another tax authority.  This voluntary sharing is known as spontaneous EOI. Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) is the exchange of information between countries without having to request it.  AEOI exists to reduce global tax evasion.</p>  <p>  Ireland has implemented the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) which provides for the automatic exchange of financial account information between tax authorities. The first information exchange began in September 2017. </p>  <p>  Financial institutions, for the purpose of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and CRS, include banks, investment traders, fund management companies and trust managers. Credit Unions are considered financial institutions for CRS but not for FATCA. </p>  <p>  Revenue has published a detailed guide to exchange of information, available at the following link: www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-35/35-01-01a.pdf. </p>  <p>  The Companies Act, 2014 includes provisions for the sharing of information in specified circumstances with appropriate investigative and supervisory authorities both domestically and in other jurisdictions.  This includes, for example, the power to share information with the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Bank.  The ODCE has in place a number of Memoranda of Understanding with relevant bodies in Ireland which outline the arrangements for information sharing and other cooperation.</p>  <p>  Further queries in relation to the ODCE or the Companies Act should be directed to my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.</p></reply>

To recap, the review of the Capital Plan highlighted some key themes which will closely inform and be incorporated into the analysis leading to the finalisation of the new ten-year plan for public capital investment 2018-2027.  These themes include:- </p>  <p>  -  confirmation of the central role of public capital investment in underpinning the economy's long-term growth potential and addressing overheating risks as well as supporting social progress;</p>  <p>  -  the need to align public capital investment priorities to a changing demographic profile;</p>  <p>  -  the critical importance of public capital infrastructure in meeting the essential requirement for balanced regional growth and promoting the societal transformation required to achieve climate action objectives;</p>  <p>  -  the mechanisms through which public investment can strengthen the economy&rsquo;s resilience to major risks such as Brexit; </p>  <p>  -  the central importance of robust mechanisms to support the efficiency and value for money of public capital investment; and </p>  <p>  -  the strong business case for ensuring that public capital spending is balanced between new projects and maintaining the quality and capacity of existing public capital infrastructure. </p>  <p>  Based on the analysis, the review of the capital plan identified a number of key sectors as priorities for investment, including transport, education, housing and health.  The findings of the review assisted Government in selecting priorities for the allocation of the additional &euro;4.3 billion capital expenditure allocated in Budget 2018 over the period to 2021.  </p>  <p>  Consequently, between 2014 and 2021, public capital expenditure in Ireland will have more than doubled and as set out by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, this will see public investment in Ireland moving to among the highest in the EU.  Capital expenditure is projected to reach &euro;8.4 billion in 2021 which is equivalent to 3.8% of GNI*. </p>  <p>  The new ten-year capital plan is currently being finalised.  I can, however, confirm that the plan will set out the Government's priorities in relation to public capital investment beyond 2021 and it is my objective that the plan will demonstrate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to remaining amongst the highest investors in public capital investment in the EU over the period 2022 to 2027.</p>  <p>  Public investment over the period 2018 &ndash; 2027 will be a key factor in delivering on the objectives of the new National Planning Framework (NPF) detailed in the Ireland 2040 Plan, which sets out a new model and approach to spatial planning in Ireland.  The lack of progress in implementing the National Spatial Strategy launched in December 2002 resulted, in part, from a failure to ensure that our public investment plans were strictly aligned with delivering the spatial planning objectives.  The investment plans which will be set out in the new 10-year capital plan will clearly demonstrate how public investment will help deliver the Strategic Outcomes detailed in the Ireland 2040 Plan.</p></reply>

The report outlines the discussions and conclusions of the Group in relation to each of the six recommendations. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the CSO that it continues to engage with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to a number of actions outlined in the report, including:</p>  <p>  - Work on a new public facing document to explain to users of crime statistics the rules governing the recording and counting of crime incidents in Ireland.  This document will include detail on recording, classification, invalidation, reclassification, counting rules and detection rules.</p>  <p>  - A revised Memorandum of Understanding between the CSO and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to guarantee the CSO access to both crime and non-crime data was signed in 2017.  The CSO also receives technical documentation regarding updates, which affect how crimes are recorded.</p>  <p>  - The CSO continues to examine PULSE data in order to improve the quality of crime data recording and inform users about related concerns.  The CSO engages with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na via its High Level Liaison Group to outline and discuss data quality concerns.</p>  <p>  - The CSO has outlined to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na its data requirements for a detailed assessment of PULSE data quality which will be carried out during 2018, based on incident and associated data reported during 2017.</p>  <p>  Some &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021.  This major investment will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime and will facilitate progress on important reforms arising from the Garda Inspectorate's report on Crime Investigation, including those relevant to the compilation of crime statistics.</p></reply>

That was done on 29 November last.  The report was also referred to the Office of the Attorney General in order to seek advice in relation to the matters contained in the document and the appropriate course of action.  </p>  <p>  I wrote to the Commissioner and requested a report under section 41(2) of the 2005 Garda Act 2005 addressing all of the issues raised in the document in so far as it relates to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Commissioner's responsibilities.  In late December, an initial report was forwarded to my Department where it is under consideration.</p>  <p>  My Department is examining the document and the Commissioner&rsquo;s response to determine what further actions may be appropriate on foot of it. </p>  <p>  As I have stated the Commissioner's report has been referred to the Disclosures Tribunal which is currently engaged in its work.  If the Deputy has any concerns about any of these issues, the Tribunal has wide discretion and its terms of reference allow it to investigate contacts between members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and State entities in the course of its work.  In this context, it is of course open to any person to bring matters to the attention of the Tribunal.</p></reply>

Following the  review of the existing Capital Plan, which was carried out during 2017,  I was pleased to announce as part of Budget 2018 that an additional &euro;157 million had been allocated for capital expenditure in the Justice Sector in the period 2018 to 2021.  This will give rise to a total capital investment of circa &euro;820 million in the Justice area over the next four years in relation to the Garda, Courts, Prisons and other key strategic areas such as Forensic Science Ireland.  This funding will enable the completion of projects such as the new Forensic Science Laboratory, the development by the OPW of a new building to replace the current Garda DMR Headquarters in Harcourt Square and significant levels of investment in Garda ICT, Garda transport fleet and continued Garda station refurbishment.  It is expected that the National Development Plan will reflect the requirement for continuing capital investment in the Justice Sector in period after 2021 given that an efficient and effective criminal justice system is vital to the realisation of the strategic outcomes of the Ireland 2040 Plan.</p></reply>

In additional a significant portion of the funding provided is through competitive calls on an annual or bi-annual basis.  </p><p>The mid-term capital review process was completed in Spring of 2017.  My Department highlighted four main priority areas in our submission to the review;</p><p>- Delivering on the Government&rsquo;s Regionalisation Agenda;</p><p>- Transformational supports for indigenous enterprise to respond to Brexit challenges;</p><p>- Immediate ramping up of R&amp;amp;D investment in support of Government&rsquo;s science strategy &ldquo;Innovation 2020&rdquo;;</p><p>- &ldquo;Access to Finance&rdquo; contingency funding packages over 2 years needed to support firms most at threat in the face of Brexit.</p><p>The four priority areas are primarily underpinned by the capital programmes of the enterprise agencies spanning across Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, Inter-Trade Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices.  Other strategically important funding of relevance to the mid-term capital review included the Brexit Loan Scheme, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, Ireland&rsquo;s membership of various international research organisations, a successor to Cycle 5 of the Programme for Research in Third-Level Institutions, the Interreg programme, the National Standards Authority of Ireland and funding to the Tyndall National Institute.  Some of these funded areas also involve significant private industry investment to grant awards as well as the utilisation of enterprise agency own resource income as part of enterprise development.</p><p>The mid-term capital review is now feeding in to the Government&rsquo;s proposed &quot;National Development Plan&quot; (NDP) which is to cover the period 2018 to 2027.  The NDP is an ongoing process being co-ordinated by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The NDP will underpin the strategic outcomes which are to be set out in the forthcoming &ldquo;National Planning Framework - Ireland 2040&quot; (NPF), which is being overseen by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. </p><p>Over recent months my Department has been actively engaged in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the NDP to highlight the centrality of enterprise and innovation supports to Ireland&rsquo;s future economic development and to ensure sustainable employment growth. </p><p>My Department has emphasised the need to ensure sufficient multi-annual capital allocations are in place to support future economic development and job creation, particularly in a regional context and in light of the significant challenges posed by BREXIT and the evolving global foreign direct investment landscape.</p><p>Discussions are ongoing and it is anticipated that the NPF and NDP will be completed in the weeks ahead during the first quarter of 2018.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-01-17a.276.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011700078#WRL02000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 and 127 together.  </p><p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS), commonly referred to as <i>A Fair Deal,</i>is a system of financial support for people who require long-term residential care.  Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  </p><p>The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are: </p><p>- Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;</p><p>- Bed and board;</p><p>- Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and</p><p>- Laundry service.  </p><p>A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  In determining  the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice.  For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.  </p><p>Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing.  In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income.  The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory).  An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.  </p><p>Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home.  This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged.  Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract.  The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and the private or voluntary nursing home.  </p><p>Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes.  The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.  </p><p>I have met with both Nursing Homes Ireland and Age Action to discuss this issue in detail.  In order to improve the transparency of these additional charges, I outlined that a schedule of charges should be provided to potential residents on enquiry to an individual nursing home, rather than at the point of admission.  Nursing Homes Ireland undertook to advise their members to do so.  I have also recently met with  the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the Office of the Ombudsman and HIQA  to discuss this matter further.</p><p>I have asked the Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group established to oversee the implementation of certain recommendations contained in the 2015 Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme to also consider this matter and examine the options that might be available, as part of its ongoing work.  </p><p>A small group of representatives from the Department of Health and the HSE are to preform  an examination of the issue of additional charges in nursing homes.  They will report their findings and recommendations to the Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group.  </p><p>I am committed to ensuring that our older population are protected, that they get the care that they deserve, and that they have access to all of the information they need in order to be able to make an informed decision, especially at such a vulnerable stage in their lives.  </p></reply>

The Deputy may wish to note that this data is extracted from the overall waiting list figures which does not differentiate transgender patients from other patients on the waiting list.</p><p>Reducing waiting times for the longest waiting patients is one of this Government's key priorities.

The HSE, however, points to two significant sources in this respect.</p>  <p>  The UK based Gender Identity Research and Education Society (GIRES) have estimated that 1% of individuals may experience some degree of gender variance or non-conformity and approximately 0.2% may undergo transition.</p>  <p>  In a recent study, researchers from the Department of Endocrinology in St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital (SCH), Loughlinstown, Dublin reviewed the medical records of 218 patients and estimated prevalence of gender dysphoria at one in 10,154 male-to-female and one to 27,668 female-to-male individuals in the Irish population. These figures, however, only include individuals seeking medical services from that hospital and exclude those who are seeking treatment elsewhere or who do not medically transition.</p>  <p>  A proposed model of care for transgender children, adolescents and adults was submitted by the HSE Quality Improvement Division to the HSE Divisions of Primary Care, Mental Health and Acute Hospital programme for consideration in January 2017. The model was developed in consultation with key treating clinicians, planners, policy makers, advocates and service users. The model outlines key services required to ensure the needs of the transgender population including children and adolescents are addressed. It details current service provision and emerging service demand in relation to adults and separately in relation to children and adolescents.

Where files are requested, data controllers should have careful regard to the nature of the request and the purpose for which the files are being requested. The rights of the patient regarding their personal health data and with whom that data can be disclosed should be of paramount importance in any consideration. Current data protection legislation clearly sets out strict rules regarding the processing of sensitive personal data (which includes data concerning health) by data controllers. Processing of personal data includes the collection, use and disclosure of data. A number of conditions are set out for the fair processing of sensitive data concerning health including consent and where such processing is necessary for a number of different reasons. These are detailed in Sections 2 A and B of the Data Protection Act 1988 (as amended).  The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) takes effect on 25 May 2018 as the legal instrument for regulating the collection, use and disclosure of personal data.</p></reply>

The Division assigned a Service Improvement Lead to progress the initiative.  The HSE has advised us that they initially mapped the entire 114 Adult Mental Teams to determine the existing level of 7/7 service provision.  The results of this exercise showed that there is  currently approximately 60% coverage across the 9 Community Healthcare Organisations of 7/7 cover comprising of a combination of Assertive Outreach, Home Based Treatment Teams and Nurse provided cover. </p>  <p>  The HSE then estimated the level of resources required to provide a 7/7 service across the service.  As a result of this exercise &euro;4.5 million was granted for the recruitment of staff, facilities and non-staffing costs associated with the enhanced Service which will initially be for known service users. </p>  <p>  A consultation process with all 9 CHOs took place to agree staffing numbers and professions and the HSE is now in the process of recruiting the additional staff indicated. The HSE are also developing a more detailed model of care and set of key performance indicators to assess the value and impact of a 7/7 Service which they expect will inform the development of 24/7 Mental Health Services including Crisis Intervention. </p>  <p>  The recruitment process for  the additional staff has commenced and given the recruitment timelines the HSE expects that the enhanced 7/7 Services will commence on a phased basis from April/May this year.</p></reply>

However, there are no supports or grants currently available to support domestic battery storage systems in Ireland.  My Department is currently developing a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) which is being designed to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contribution to EU-wide targets out to 2030. The design of the new scheme has included an extensive independent economic appraisal which compared the cost of supporting a range of commercial renewable technologies at various scales including micro-generation, to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply.</p>  <p>  Micro generation, which typically involves an element of self-consumption and storing or selling of excess electricity to the grid, was also appraised as part of the RESS economic assessment. The analysis identified a number of challenges that may need to be addressed before a support scheme for micro generation can be developed.</p>  <p>  I am committed to further exploring opportunities for supporting micro generation, as I believe that micro-generation could have an important role in Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low carbon economy, in assisting Ireland meet its renewable electricity targets, and increasing social acceptance of and promoting renewable energy projects right across the country. In October 2017 my Department and SEAI hosted a workshop on micro generation which discussed a number of these challenges with relevant stakeholders and identified a number of potential options to incentivise greater uptake of micro generation in Ireland, including the linking of supports for micro generation and battery storage. Micro generation support policies will be developed further throughout 2018.</p>  <p>  Domestic battery storage technology forms part of on-going research and development funded by the SEAI on behalf of my Department.</p></reply>

The European Environment Agency (EEA) publishes an annual report on Air Quality in Europe with estimates on health impacts.  The latest report, covering the year 2014, was published in October last year and is available to download at the following link:  </p><p>The report indicates that for 2014, there were approximately 1,510 premature deaths in Ireland that could be attributed to air pollution, and over 18,000 years of life lost.  While this EEA report does not calculate a cost for this health impact, a 2015 World Health Organisation report (&quot;Economic cost of the health impact of air pollution in Europe&quot;) estimated a cost to Ireland of over US$2.5 billion for the year 2010.  Further information on the impact of air pollution across Europe is available from a Commission impact assessment (available at ) which indicates 121,378,612 lost working days across Europe arising from particulate matter pollution. </p><p>While the health statistics do not disaggregate the impact according to the source of pollution, we know that transport is an important contributor of pollutants, including PM2.5 and especially NOx.  In relation to pollution along the M50, Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) is currently undertaking indicative particulate monitoring and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) monitoring at two locations adjacent to the M50.  The first monitoring station is located by the eastern quadrant of the N4/M50 interchange. The second monitoring station is located to the western quadrant of the Sandyford interchange. Monitoring commenced at both stations in February 2014.  Both stations were established to monitor trends in emissions of PM10 and NO2 in the vicinity of the upgraded M50 Motorway as per modification 3(2) of the An Bord Plean&aacute;la decision to approve the scheme. </p><p>The measured concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 at both monitoring stations are significantly below the limits set out within the Air Quality Standards Regulations (S.I. 180 of 2011).  At the monitoring station established in the western quadrant of the Sandyford interchange, the measured NO2 concentrations are below the limits set out within the Air Quality Standards Regulations.  At the monitoring station in the eastern quadrant of the N4/M50 interchange, six separate locations have been monitored.  At five of these locations, the measured NO2 concentrations are below the limits set out within the Air Quality Standards Regulations.  However, the annual average limit value has been exceeded at one roadside NO2 monitoring location.</p><p>In light of the health concerns arising from air pollution, my Department is working on the first ever National Clean Air Strategy which will provide an overarching policy framework within which clean air policies can be formulated and given effect in a manner consistent with national, EU and international policy considerations and priorities.  The Clean Air Strategy will address priority air pollutants in Ireland, including vehicle emissions, in an integrated manner.  I intend to launch the Strategy in the coming months.</p><p>I am also supporting the development and rollout of a new national Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme (AAMP) by the Environmental Protection Agency.  The AAMP will double the number of ambient air quality monitoring stations in Ireland by 2022, and enhance the provision of real time air quality data to the public.</p><p>In relation to noise, it should be noted that Dun Laoghaire Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin County Councils operate a County Dublin Environmental Noise Information website which can be accessed at .  A number of monitors are situated close to the M50.</p><p>Motorways, including the M50, fall within the scope of EU Directive 2002/49/EC (the Environmental Noise Directive, or END), relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise.  This Directive aims to provide &ldquo;a common framework to avoid, prevent or reduce, on a prioritised basis, the harmful effects of exposure to environmental noise&rdquo;.  A key source of noise covered under the END is road traffic noise.</p><p>The Environmental Noise Regulations 2006 transpose the END into Irish law.  The Regulations designate noise-mapping bodies and action planning authorities for the production of strategic noise maps and action plans. Primary responsibility for both noise mapping and action planning is assigned to local authorities.  A number of other bodies also have noise mapping functions which are carried out on behalf of the local authorities concerned.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII - formerly the NRA &ndash; National Roads Authority) is a designated noise mapping body under the 2006 regulations.</p><p>The regulations also designate the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as the national authority for the purposes of the regulations.  The Agency's role includes supervisory, advisory and coordination functions in relation to both noise mapping and action planning, as well as the reporting requirements for the purpose of the Directive.</p><p>The regulations set out a process for addressing environmental noise.  Firstly, noise must be assessed through the preparation of strategic noise maps every 5 years for areas and infrastructure falling within defined criteria, e.g. large urban areas (referred to as agglomerations), major roads, railways and airports.  The third round noise mapping process is almost complete and joined up maps for the four authorities in the Dublin agglomeration should be available in the coming weeks.  These maps will present modelled noise levels within the Dublin agglomeration including along the M50.  </p><p>A period of public consultation will be organised to make these noise maps available at relevant Local Authorities and other mapping bodies.  Existing noise maps for the first and second round of the END are currently available on the EPA website and Local Authority websites. </p><p>Following on from the third round mapping process, Action Planning Authorities (including relevant Local Authorities) are required to prepare Noise Action Plans to address noise levels identified through the mapping process.  The action plans are designed to act as a means of managing environmental noise by controlling future noise by planned measures, such as land-use planning, systems engineering for traffic, traffic planning, abatement by sound-insulation measures, and control of noise sources through measures such as noise barriers or low noise road surfaces.</p><p>It is important to note that the END does not set limit or target values, nor does it prescribe the measures to be included in the action plans, which are matters for the national authority in each Member State.  The EPA has previously produced guidance for Local Authorities on the content of such plans (at )</p><p>I would encourage members of the public to participate in this consultation process and engage with the relevant mapping bodies regarding areas where elevated noise levels are being experienced, and assist in identifying mitigations measures (such as road barriers) that could be included in Noise Action Plans.</p></reply>

Climate mitigation and adaptation are cross-cutting priorities for Government and for me. The National Policy Position on climate change identifies the achievement of a climate resilient economy and society by 2050 as a key objective.  In line with the Government&rsquo;s National Mitigation Plan, investment in the key sectoral areas of transport, agriculture, energy and housing will be prioritised at an accelerating rate over the lifetime of the Plan.  Action now will position Ireland to harness a range of benefits into the future, in terms of the creation of sustainable green jobs, sustainable food production, deepening our energy security, improving the quality of our lives and making our working and built environments healthier. </p>  <p>  In my Department, a significant expansion of investment in energy efficiency upgrades, including deep retrofitting of housing, commercial and public building stock, will accelerate the contribution of the built environment to the collective effort to reduce CO2 emissions.  Measures to progressively decarbonise electricity generation and to promote the electrification of heat and transport will be central to the achievement of national transition objectives.  We also need to ensure that we develop appropriate levels of energy interconnection to cater for growing demand and diversify our sources of supply. </p>  <p>  Delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the National Broadband Plan remains a key priority. Fast, secure, high capacity and reliable digital connectivity will underpin balanced regional development, allow new businesses and services to emerge and increase Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and attractiveness as a place to live and do business. </p>  <p>  Investment in waste management infrastructure, air quality and biodiversity will be critical to our environmental and economic well-being, and to achieving EU circular economy and climate objectives.</p></reply>

The cost of the biofuel component in fuels are absorbed into the price of the fuel by the industry and hence it is not possible to state a cost  per tonne of emissions savings.</p><p>The 2009 Renewable Energy Directive specifies a set of strict sustainability criteria which biofuels must meet in order to be counted towards a Member State&rsquo;s renewable energy transport target.  Under these criteria, biofuels may not be made from raw materials originating from tropical forests or recently deforested areas, drained peatland, wetland or highly biodiverse areas.  </p><p>Under the European Union (Biofuel Sustainability Criteria) Regulations 2012, obligated parties must demonstrate compliance with these sustainability criteria in order to claim certificates for biofuels placed on the road transport fuel market.  There are no plans at this stage to amend these criteria.</p><p>In relation to the use of B7 (diesel blended with 7% biodiesel), all diesel vehicles can operate with this fuel.  However there are some concerns with performance of the fuel in winter and, for this reason, this blend is generally only available for part of the year.  I do not have exact figures for petrol vehicles compatible with E10 (petrol blended with 10% ethanol), however I understand that a significant proportion of the Irish petrol vehicle fleet can operate with this fuel. All vehicles manufactured since 2011, and the majority of pre-2011 vehicles, can operate effectively using E10.  There are no issues with any petrol vehicle using E5, which is the highest blend of petrol biofuel currently available.  Any plans to move to E10 in the future will require consideration as to how to accommodate vehicles not compatible with E10. My Department is currently holding a public consultation on the Biofuels Obligation Scheme which is seeking feedback on the best way forward if higher blends of biofuels in petrol or diesel are to be deployed. Details on the consultation, which closes on 19 January 2018, can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i><i>www.dccae.gov.ie</i></i>.</p></reply>

In the coming weeks, my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport will be launching a new grant scheme to incentivise the uptake of electric vehicles in the Small Public Service Vehicles industry.  I expect this incentive will result in more electric taxis and other small public service vehicles on our roads over the coming years.</p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA) has engaged in a preliminary market consultation exercise on the various Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) bus technology types available.  The NTA will analyse the suitability of the different bus technology types, such as natural gas and electric buses, in an Irish context.  Under the new BusConnects Programme, there is a commitment to the uptake of new low emission vehicle technology in the bus fleet.  It is anticipated that by 2023, half of the Public Service Obligation (PSO) bus fleet (approximately 500 buses) will be low-emission vehicles.  The development of this measure will be progressed by the NTA in conjunction with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p></reply>

My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in areas where commercial operators will not provide this service. That procurement process is now at an advanced stage. "Detailed Solutions" submitted by two bidders on 26th September are being evaluated by the NBP specialist team. This is the last stage of the procurement process before moving to the final tender stage, which will be followed by the appointment of a preferred bidder(s) and contract signature.</p>  <p>  In the interim, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention. The Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce the December 2016 report available on my Department's website, which contains 40 actions to alleviate some of the deficits.</p>  <p>  I published the third Taskforce Quarterly Progress Report in November 2017, which demonstrates that good progress has been made in delivering the actions. I plan to publish an Annual Report shortly. These reports show continuing progress and also the sustained level of engagement between actions owners and industry. The Annual Report will also contain a work programme for 2018, with new actions identified that will lead to improvements for consumers across Ireland. </p>  <p>  Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.

The purpose of the project is to address current capacity limits at peak hours on the Luas Green Line and to cater for future demands along the line. The project will cost approximately &euro;90 million and is proposed in the National Transport Authority's (NTA) Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016-2035.  It includes the lengthening of the existing green line tram fleet, the purchase of additional trams to meet future passenger demand and modifications to Sandyford Depot to stable and maintain these trams. A complementary investment project to lengthen the platforms at the Green Line stations was completed last year. </p>  <p>  The capacity increases at peak periods provided by the project will assist in reducing crowding on the Green Line and enhance accessibility for mobility and sensory impaired users during these periods. The NTA have advised that the first of the new 55 metre long trams is expected to be deployed in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  In relation to the provision of new park and ride facilities in Dublin, I wish to advise the Deputy that future provision is being made under a number of programmes. The recently announced 4 Year Capital Plan provides for investment of over &euro;770 million to progress the BusConnects programme to address growing congestion in the Dublin region in the short to medium term, including the provision of bus based Park and Ride facilities. BusConnects was launched last summer by the National Transport Authority (NTA) and work is ongoing on the redesign of the bus services network and also on infrastructure proposals for Core Bus Corridors which will be an integral part of the programme.  When this work is completed the proposals will be launched for public consultation in the first half of this year.  The results of the public consultation will inform the final decisions to be made on the network redesign, Core Bus Corridors and park and ride facilities.</p>  <p>  The NTAs Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area also includes the planned development of a network of strategic rail-based park and ride facilities where rail services intersect with the national road network. It is proposed that these facilities would be located at Swords, Finglas, Dunboyne, Liffey Valley, Naas Road, Carrickmines, Woodbrook and Greystones.  The Strategy indicates that further development of local park and ride facilities will also be considered at appropriate locations on the rail network in the outer parts of the Dublin metropolitan network and hinterland.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan published in 2015 provides for investment of over &euro;700 million to progress new Metro North. Based on the outcome of the recent Fingal/North Dublin Transport Study, the National Transport Authority has recommended that a revised metro project be selected as the appropriate public transport project to address the transport needs of the Swords/Airport/City-Centre Corridor. This Metro line will run from Dublin&rsquo;s south city centre via Dublin Airport and terminating at Estuary that will be served by a strategic Park &amp;amp; Ride. Arising from an option analysis and selection study of possible metro alignments and station locations, a final route and station location will be established, after which a public consultation process will be undertaken on the Emerging Preferred Route in early 2018.</p></reply>

A Marginal Abatement Cost Curve approach (MACC) was used to compare &lsquo;business-as-usual&rsquo; economic activity to &lsquo;low carbon&rsquo; options. The MACC tool was developed by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). An estimated marginal cost per tonne of carbon abated was attributed to certain mitigation measures.  This technique allows for comparative analysis of &lsquo;low carbon&rsquo; alternatives across the key sectors in the NMP.  An overview of costs and emission reduction potential of sector specific mitigation measures can be found in the NMP <i><i>(</i></i><i><font color="#0000FF">).</font></i></p><p>The Strategic Research and Analysis Division within my own Department employed the MACC tool to help model the economic and environmental impact of reducing speed limits on motorways from 120km/h to 110km/h for cars/vans and from 90km/h to 80km/h for heavy duty vehicles.  They estimated that such a measure would be associated with a marginal cost of &euro;573 per tonne of carbon abated. Reducing speed limits lessens energy use; it is estimated that this measure could potentially reduce CO<sub>2</sub>emissions by about 1.9Mt CO<sub>2</sub>between 2017 and 2030. The introduction of this measure would require extensive consideration of economic impact, traffic flows, implications of traffic transfer on to secondary networks, enforcement requirements, and potential modifications to the design of existing motorway infrastructure.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the cost per tonne of carbon abated through measures that encourage modal shift to either public transport or active travel modes is not currently available in the format sought.  Limitations in ascertaining robust baseline data and selecting representative modal shift scenarios hinder meaningful analysis; however, further work on modelling scenarios will continue over the lifetime of the NMP, and in the future it may be possible to do similar technical modelling work on these options.</p><p>In the meantime, modal shift towards public and sustainable transport continues to be usefully measured using other tools such as the National Travel Survey and the Canal Cordon Report.  Findings from these sources show that in Dublin alone, over 67% of all journeys in to the city centre are now made through sustainable means (walking, cycling, public transport) - a dramatic increase from 59% of journeys in 2010; while cycling and walking have grown greatly in popularity increasing by over 16% and nearly 9% respectively between 2014 and 2016.  Nationally public transport accounts for 5.5% of all journeys taken, with the number of passengers using public transport increasing to 251 million in 2017 - a 7% increase since 2016.  Promoting modal shift away from the private car results in fewer CO<sub>2</sub>emissions as well as a reduction in vehicle volume and so is an integral measure in decarbonising the Transport sector.</p></reply>

It is open to individuals to make provision for a pension by way of PRSA which all employers are obliged to facilitate.  </p>  <p>  My Department was neither party to or bound by the Labour Court Recommendation (LCR19293).  Nevertheless, it should be noted that the issue of CE supervisors&rsquo; pension provision is currently being examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  My Department is represented on this group, as are IMPACT, SIPTU, Pobal and other relevant Government Departments.  </p>  <p>  The Forum last met on 23 November 2017 and I understand that a paper outlining the costs involved was presented.

The main reason cited for this is an increase in claims frequency by such schemes.  In the first instance, my Department recommends that schemes seek alternative quotes to ensure they get value for money.  Also, if CE schemes are not filling their contracted number of participants, it is recommended that they align their insurance requirement with actual participant numbers.  Schemes are also asked to be especially mindful of their obligations under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005. </p>  <p>  The annual budget provided to CE schemes is based on a detailed appraisal of their actual annual expenditure levels in previous years and includes an amount to cover consumable services and materials, including insurance, necessary for the effective operation of the project. </p>  <p>  If a scheme is experiencing particular difficulties with insurance costs, the Sponsor should contact their local DEASP Intreo Centre and the matter will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Of these, some 29.49 million households (17.3% of the total) were jobless - that is, no adult in the household was working.</p><p>For Ireland, the total number of relevant households was 1,440,600, and of these some 253,000 (17.6% of the total) were jobless.</p><p>Although the figure for Ireland has fallen from a high of 23% in 2012 as a result of the economic recovery, government remains concerned about aspects of household joblessness that go beyond the standard measures of unemployment and receipt of jobseeker's payments.  Relevant groups, not normally considered to be unemployed, include economically inactive lone parents, people with disabilities, and the adult dependants of unemployed people, all of whom might benefit from closer attachment to employment and the labour market.  A range of policy reforms has been taken affecting these groups, and further reforms were considered in consultation with representative bodies for those involved.  These policy developments are set out in the <i>Pathways to Work Action Plan for Jobless Households</i>which I published on 25, September 2017.  Development of the Action Plan fulfils a commitment in the Programme for Government and in the overall <i>Pathways to Work 2016-2020</i>strategy.  It also responds to concerns about the level of household joblessness raised in Country-Specific Recommendations to Ireland by the EU. </p><p>The <i>Action Plan for Jobless Households</i>is an example of one of the many measures that Government is implementing, with a view to assisting people and families to become work ready and gain employment.  The Plan aims to extend activation services to people who are not working, but are not defined as unemployed by traditional measures.  It focuses in particular on improving employment rates of households with children &ndash; both the traditional &lsquo;nuclear&rsquo; family and the lone parent family.  A number of key policy initiatives to achieve that goal are identified as follows:</p><p><b>- Extend active engagement</b>with the Intreo employment service to additional groups of economically inactive working age adults;</p><p><b>- Improve incentives and remove barriers</b>for people transitioning from welfare to employment; </p><p><b>- Pilot a family focused case management approach</b>in five geographical areas to improve employment rates and reduce joblessness in households across Ireland.</p><p>Progress against each of the reform actions and milestones will be monitored and reported on quarterly to the Cabinet Committee on the Economy and Jobs.  Implementation of these policy measures should see the level of joblessness fall more rapidly than is already anticipated over the next few years.  These targets are in addition to the existing <i>Pathways to Work</i>targets 2020 &ndash; bringing unemployment down to between 5% and 6%, bringing long-term unemployment below 2.5%, and bringing youth unemployment below 12%.</p><p>The <i>Action Plan for Jobless Households</i>aims to identify and remove barriers that are currently preventing people from getting a fair chance, thus building a Republic of Opportunity for all.</p></reply>

The research conducted during this review demonstrated that the numbers returning from self-employment to the Live Register, after participating on the scheme, are low.  Based on the comparison of the BTWEA participants to a control group of similar jobseekers who did not choose the scheme as an option, the BTWEA participant was over twice as likely to remain off the Live Register six months after the payments on the scheme had ceased. This trend continues when examined following an 18 month period after the payments ceasing. One of the considerations of the review was the period of payment and it was deemed not necessary to amend the current 2 year period in light of the success of participants exiting the live Register. </p><p>The part played by the BTWEA in supporting the long-term unemployed and other welfare recipients to take up self-employment opportunities is significant.</p><p>It is estimated that cost of extending the scheme to a third year, assuming that the payment in year 3 would be equivalent to year 2, would be approximately &euro;50m.</p><p>There are no plans to amend the scheme at this time.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is also available to people who are under 66 years of age who are living alone and are in receipt of long-term illness and disability payments. The payment of the living alone allowance is considered secondary, or non-primary, in nature which is incorporated into the person&rsquo;s qualifying payment.   The effect of the allowance is to increase the rate of payment to such people, recognizing that there are economies of scale associated with living with another person.  </p>  <p>  Significant costs would arise if the criteria were relaxed in the manner suggested by the Deputy, particularly as many existing domestic arrangements could fall within the definition of the living alone allowance criteria, as many adult children of older people live with them, and might become homeless if they had to leave the family home.  There would also, clearly, be significant administrative challenges in determining whether such co-residents of pensioners would in fact become homeless if they could not reside in their current address.</p>  <p>  In addition to the living alone allowance my Department makes a range of other payments, both cash and non-cash on a weekly, monthly or less frequent basis. These payments are considered secondary, or non-primary, in nature.  In addition to the living alone increase a person may also be eligible for household benefits (worth &euro;580 per year), fuel allowance (worth &euro;607 per year) or supports under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme such as rent supplement. These secondary payments are in some cases are subject to a means or household composition test, which are valuable supports for recipients.</p>  <p>  The adult child of a householder moving back into the family home might reduce such additional allowances previously held by the householder. However, the economies of scale from living together should mean that a weekly contribution by the person moving in would more than compensate for any such reduction in payments from my Department which are, as I said, to compensate for the greater costs associated with living alone. </p>  <p>  The criteria for the Department&rsquo;s supplementary schemes are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  The guidelines for supplementary schemes are kept under review.  However, any decision to change the requirement for these schemes would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Action Plan for Jobs supports continuing strong economic recovery and employment growth.  Policies and actions to ensure that unemployed people benefit from the increase in employment are set out in the strategy paper Pathways to Work 2016-2020. </p><p>To date, these policies have been effective in reducing both youth and long-term unemployment.  </p><p>For example, the most recent data shows that Irish youth unemployment has fallen from a peak of 31.2% in 2012 to 14.8% in September 2017.  Irish youth unemployment has thus fallen from well above the EU average in 2012 (23%) to well below the current EU figure of 19.1%. </p><p>Latest available data shows that the long-term unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of 9.5% in 2012 to 3.1%  in Q2 2017.  The long-term unemployment rate for young people has fallen from over 15% at peak to below 5% in mid-2017.</p><p>Both the youth and long-term figures can be expected to fall further this year in line with the continuing forecast fall in overall unemployment. Additionally, Ireland is on course to bring youth unemployment below 12% and long-term unemployment below 2.5% in accordance with <i>Pathways to Work</i>targets for 2020.</p><p>Policy continues to focus on support for the long-term unemployed and young unemployed.  For example, the <i>Pathways to Work 2016-2020</i>strategy prioritises long-term unemployed people &ndash; most notably through the roll-out of JobPath to engage more systematically with this group; through targeted wage subsidies under JobsPlus; and through reserved places for long-term unemployed jobseekers on employment and training programmes.  </p><p>Under the Youth Guarantee process there is monthly engagement by case officers with unemployed young people to assist them to prepare and implement personal progression plans for employment.  Where young people do not find work quickly, additional supports are offered through places on employment and training schemes.</p><p>Later this year I will be introducing a new work experience programme targeted specifically at young jobseekers who are long-term unemployed or who face significant barriers to gaining employment &ndash; people who even during the Celtic Tiger years would have found it difficult to get a foothold on the career ladder.  The new Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) will  provide them with the opportunity to learn basic work and social skills in a supportive environment while on a work placement. Host Organisations will be encouraged to hire participants who have performed well and will qualify for a financial subsidy under <i>JobsPlus Youth</i>.  YESS will compliment other initiatives such as the expanded range of Apprenticeships and Career Traineeships.</p><p>These current and planned measures, together with the continuing strong performance of the economy, will support further reductions in long term unemployment and youth unemployment.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-01-17a.590.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011700098#WRFF00400"><p>There are three main State pensions.  Firstly, the State pension non-contributory is a means-tested pension funded from taxation.  Secondly, the State pension contributory, which is not means-tested, is paid from the Social Insurance Fund, via the PRSI system.  The third main state pension available to some people over 66 is the Widows/Widowers Contributory Pension.</p>  <p>  It is important to ensure those qualifying for the contributory pension have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  Such contributory pensions, with rates of payment linked to contributions made into a fund, are the norm internationally.</p>  <p>  To ensure that people can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions, paid or credited, over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the rateband changes introduced in 2012 did not impact upon a person&rsquo;s ability to qualify for a pension, as they introduced new rates of payment for reduced rate State pension (contributory) pensioners.  Nor did those changes impact upon a person&rsquo;s ability to qualify for a maximum rate contributory pension, as such pensioners would not have had enough contributions to qualify for a full rate pension before the changes were introduced under the previous ratebands introduced in 2000.</p>  <p>  The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension contributory easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or caring for incapacitated people over that age, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of his or her pension. </p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult, amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for the means-tested State pension non-contributory, which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.</p>  <p>  When all payments across the State pension system are taken into account, the difference in the average direct payment to men and women is approximately 1% in Ireland.  This would be very low by European standards, and as a result CSO figures show that poverty levels among those over 66 are very low for both men and women, and are at parity.  In the latest figures, the rate of Consistent Poverty for men over 66 was 1.79% for men and 1.36% for women, compared to 8.3% for the general population.</p>  <p>  Later this year, I plan to propose legislation to introduce a total contributions approach to the calculation of the State Pension (Contributory), replacing the current yearly average approach.

The rate bands prior to 2000 were less generous, and the improved rate bands introduced in 2000 were a feature of the economic and political environment at that time.  The economic crash changed the focus and while other payments were reduced as a result, the core rates of the pension, which many pensioners were solely dependent on, were maintained.  Instead, the rates for people who had additional means and lesser PRSI contribution records were reduced. </p>  <p>  The 2012 rate bands more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place between 2000 and 2012.  The current rate bands still provide pensions to people which are not proportionate with their level of contribution.  For example, a person with only 20 years of contributions over nearly 50 years will still receive an 85% pension, whereas someone who paid into the system every week of those 50 years receives the 100% rate.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that to revert to the previous bands from January 2018 would result in an annual cost of well over &euro;70 million extra in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10 to &euro;12 million extra each following year.</p>  <p>  I committed to examine in depth various options that may provide some relief to those who would have a higher contributory pension had the rate bands not been amended in 2012.  Officials in my Department have completed a report on this matter, which I intend to bring to a cabinet committee later this week.  Following that meeting, and subject to any necessary amendment or further discussions, I will then bring the report to Government for consideration.</p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework proposed that a total contribution approach should replace the yearly average approach to the calculation of the State Pension (contributory) from 2020, which would remove anomalies created by the current system in 1961.  It is hoped to start a consultation process regarding this reform with relevant stakeholders shortly.  Following this process, a proposal to Government will be submitted seeking approval of the new approach. </p>  <p>  This reform will make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  It will also have significant homemakers provisions that will assist those pensioners who spent significant periods caring for people with a caring need.  </p>  <p>  The main aim of Government policy on pensions is to make sure that pensions are affordable, sustainable and keep their value in the coming years.  The reforms that are planned will result in a more inclusive and fairer pension system for all citizens.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These alterations, implemented in stages following the introduction of the State Pension, resulted in substantial migrations of recipients between schemes with accompanying changes in expenditure and recipients on these schemes.  The most significant transfers of recipients were those involving State Pension (Contributory) which was formerly known as the Old Age Pension (Contributory) and State Pension (Transition) which was formerly known as Retirement Pension.</p><p>Since 2006, recipients of Widow/Widower&rsquo;s Pension, Deserted Wife&rsquo;s Allowance, Blind Pension, and One-Parent Family Payment have transferred to State Pension (Non-Contributory) upon reaching 66 years of age, resulting in some decreases in recipients and expenditure on such schemes and associated increases on State Pension (Non-Contributory).  Recipients of Invalidity Pension are now automatically transferred to State Pension (Contributory) at 66 years of age.</p></reply>

As a result, appeal processing times improved between 2011 and 2016 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 24.1 weeks in 2016 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 17.6 weeks in 2016.  </p><p>I understand from the Chief Appeals Officer that there has been a slight increase in processing times in 2017 with oral hearings taking, on average, 26.4 weeks and summary decisions taking 19.8 weeks to finalise.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-01-17a.609.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011700099#WRGG00400"><p>There are three main State pensions.  Firstly, the State pension non-contributory is a means-tested pension funded from taxation.  Secondly, the State pension contributory, which is not means-tested, is paid from the Social Insurance Fund, via the PRSI system.  Thirdly, the Widows/Widowers Contributory Pension is available to some people over 66.</p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult, amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for the means-tested State pension non-contributory, which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.  Therefore, the State pension system ensures that those of State pension age do have an adequate standard of living, with a safety net under the non-contributory pension of &euro;227 per week, plus additional payments such as Household Benefits, Fuel Allowance, and a Rent Allowance where required.  While there is a means-test, there are generous disallowances which mean that over 70% of such pensioners qualify for that pension at the maximum rate.  Therefore, people in receipt of reduced rate contributory pensions below the 98% rate would have significant additional means, over and above their State pension payment, as they would otherwise qualify for a non-contributory pension at a higher rate instead.</p>  <p>  It is important to ensure those qualifying for the contributory pension, which is funded by the Social Insurance Fund and is based upon contributions to that fund, have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  Such contributory pensions, with rates of payment linked to contributions made into a fund, are the norm across the world, and underpin the PRSI system in this country.  To ensure that people can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions, paid or credited, over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.</p>  <p>  The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension contributory easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or caring for incapacitated people over that age, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of his or her pension.  Backdating it in respect of periods before its introduction in 1994 is estimated to cost &euro;290 million per year, and this figure would rise at a faster rate than the overall cost of State pensions.</p>  <p>  The State pension contributory rate bands introduced from September 2012 more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place before that.  The current rate bands still provide pensions to people which are very favourable in comparison with their level of contribution.  For example, a person with only 20 years of contributions over nearly 50 years will still receive an 85% pension.  It is estimated that, to revert to the previous bands with effect from January 2018, would result in an annual cost of well over &euro;70 million extra in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10 to &euro;12 million extra each following year.</p>  <p>  When all payments across the State pension system are taken into account, the difference in the average direct payment to men and women is approximately 1% in Ireland.  This would be very low by European standards, and as a result CSO figures show that poverty levels among those over 66 are very low for both men and women, and are at parity.  In the latest figures, the rate of Consistent Poverty for men over 66 was 1.79% for men and 1.36% for women, compared to 8.3% for the general population.</p>  <p>  I committed to examine in depth various options that may provide some relief to those who would have a higher contributory pension had the rate bands not been amended in 2012.  Officials in my Department have completed a report on this matter, which I intend to bring to a cabinet committee later this week.  Following that meeting, and subject to any necessary amendment or further discussions, I will then bring the report to Government for consideration.</p>  <p>  I expect to start a consultation process shortly with stakeholders on the introduction of a Total Contributions Approach to replace the yearly average approach to State Pension calculation.  Thereafter, a proposal to Government will be made. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Measures of unemployment from the QNHS are based on International Labour Office (ILO) definitions.  To be &lsquo;ILO unemployed&rsquo; a person must in the week before the survey be without work but available for work and have recently taken specific job-search steps.  The Live Register, which captures those registering for unemployment benefits (including those working part-time and in casual work who draw partial unemployment payments), is an administrative record.  It is not the official measure of unemployment, but can give indicative trends.  My Department uses both Live Register and QNHS data for reporting and monitoring trends and adjusting policies accordingly at national level. </p>  <p>  This includes providing data and trends broken down by age categories and by duration of unemployment.  The QNHS data, being prepared as part of the EU-wide Labour Force Survey, also allow Irish trends to be compared with international developments. </p>  <p>  The Pathways to Work strategy, the key document setting out policy to facilitate the unemployed of all ages back into work, is underpinned by analyses of the labour market situation based on the statistical sources mentioned above. </p>  <p>  By allocating activation resources to persons on the Live Register, the government&rsquo;s policy tends automatically to focus on those areas and age-groups in which unemployment is most concentrated.  The focus on those most in need is further reinforced by the use of profiling to identify, among the newly unemployed, those most likely to face severe difficulties in re-entering employment.  People identified as having a low PEX (probability of exit from unemployment) score are prioritised for intensive engagement and support from the Intreo employment service</p>  <p>  In addition, the Youth Guarantee initiative is specifically aimed at those aged under 25 who are unemployed with specific targeting of those who are either long-term unemployed or are most at risk of becoming long-term unemployed.</p>  <p>  Summary statistical information on the clients&rsquo; age, duration of unemployment, and last held occupation together with other demographic and regional information is published on the Central Statistics Office website.</p></reply>

Overall, the review found that the scheme offers effective support for people who are long-term unemployed and who are interested in self-employment as a route to entering the labour market.  The scheme plays a useful role in supporting the development of new enterprises.  </p>  <p>  Research demonstrated that the numbers returning from self-employment to the Live Register, after participating on the scheme, are low.  Based on the comparison of the BTWEA participants to a control group of similar jobseekers who did not choose the scheme as an option, the BTWEA participant was over twice as likely to remain off the Live Register six months after the payments on the scheme had ceased. This trend continues when examined following an 18 month period after the payments ceasing. </p>  <p>  One of the amendments following the review was the participants who take up self-employment are able to access the BTWEA after 9 months, down from 12 months.  This enables access to the supports to those wishing to commence self-employment at an earlier stage of their unemployment.  </p>  <p>  The Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) is an educational opportunities scheme for persons in receipt of certain qualifying social welfare payments wishing to pursue second or third level courses of education in order to improve their employment prospects.  It is primarily designed to support second chance education.</p>  <p>  Entitlement to BTEA is conditional on a person having an on-going entitlement to the qualifying scheme payment.  The BTEA scheme has been amended in recent years to ensure that the conditions are in line with the qualifying payment and consistent with the rules governing student grants funding through SUSI.  Changes were introduced over the past number of years followed a review carried out on employment supports schemes in 2012.  Stakeholders were also afforded an opportunity to contribute to the proposed recommendations at that time.  </p>  <p>  Overall, the priority for my Department is that the BTEA scheme remains focused, targeted and suitable for the needs of jobseekers and of the future skills needs of the economy.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Nevertheless, my Department recognises that abuse of the welfare system is an ongoing reality and must be tackled proactively.  Anti-fraud and control measures are set out in the Department&rsquo;s Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy 2014 &ndash; 2018 and are designed to prevent and detect fraud, to ensure effective oversight of schemes, to pursue prosecution of offenders and the recovery of any overpaid entitlements identified.  The Strategy and annual reports on implementation is published on the Department&rsquo;s website &ndash; www.welfare.ie.  The report for 2017 is expected to be published in early April 2018.</p>  <p>  While data for 2017 is currently being compiled and verified, provisional indications are that the target set for last year for control savings of &euro;510 million will be met.  It is estimated that for 2017, as a whole, some &euro;111 million in overpayments were recorded (compared to just over &euro;110 million in 2016).  Of this, some &euro;38.3 million related to 10,500 cases of suspected fraud.  The value of overpayments recovered during 2017 is estimated at approximately &euro;82 million - similar to the level recovered in 2016.  The Department&rsquo;s Prosecution Service and Special Investigations Unit considered nearly 300 cases for prosecution during 2017 which is also similar to the previous year.</p>  <p>  Control and anti-fraud activities are an integral part of the functions of all staff and systems of the Department.  No additional costs were incurred during the year on these activities.  During 2017, the Department funded an awareness campaign to highlight its anti-fraud activities and the role members of the public can play in reporting potential fraudulent activity.  The cost of the campaign before VAT was &euro;163,000.  Control savings arising from the campaign continue to accrue and will be included in the overall figures for 2017.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The farm assist scheme is a means tested payment and the means test is flexible so as to allow for significant income fluctuations from one year to the next.  It may also be noted that farm assist customers continue to receive more beneficial treatment than other self-employed persons. </p>  <p>  Farm assist recipients retain the advantages of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme such as the retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.  The 2018 Revised Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure of approximately &euro;74.1 million on the farm assist scheme.    </p>  <p>  Farm Assist recipients will benefit from the following measures which I provided for in Budget 2018; the &euro;5 per week increase in the maximum weekly rates of payment, proportionate increases in weekly payments for qualified adults and a &euro;2 per week increase for each qualified child.  In addition, farm assist recipients are eligible to avail of the 250 additional places on the Rural Social Scheme which I announced as part of the Budget 2018 package.      </p>  <p>  The Working Family Payment (WFP), formerly known as Family Income Supplement, or FIS, is an in-work support which provides an income top-up for employees on low earnings.  The WFP is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependants, and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment. </p>  <p>  To qualify for payment of the WFP, a person must be engaged in insurable employment which is expected to last for at least three months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week. Therefore, self-employed people are not eligible for the WFP.   However, where the spouse/partner of the farmer is in insurable employment, they may qualify for WFP/FIS, subject to meeting the criteria outlined above.   </p>  <p>  Other support payments offered by my Department include the jobseeker's benefit (JB) and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) schemes which provide income support for people who have lost work and who are available for and genuinely seeking full-time employment.   Jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is a means tested social assistance payment whereas jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is a contribution based insurance scheme.  </p>  <p>  To qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit a person must be unemployed, be available for and genuinely seeking work, have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7.  The jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit scheme provides significant support to individuals who can work up to 3 days a week and receive a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the combination of the jobseekers schemes, the working family payment and the farm assist scheme provide adequate income support options for families living on uneconomic holdings.</p></reply>

The levy will be applied by planning authorities, commencing on 1 January 2019 in respect of sites which were vacant and on the vacant site register during the year 2018 and will subsequently be applied on an annual basis thereafter, as long as a site remains on the vacant site register in the preceding year.</p>  <p>  Planning authorities are presently engaging in the necessary preparatory work, prior to the application of the levy with effect from January 2019 in respect of sites identified on the register in 2018.  As required under the Act, this includes the identification of specific vacant sites for entry on the register as well as the registered owners of the sites in question along with undertaking a site valuation.  </p>  <p>  My Department does not maintain a central register of vacant sites as each local authority administers the vacant site register in respect of their functional area.  On foot of a recent review of the online vacant site registers across all local authority areas, I understand that there is collectively over 180 sites on the registers. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to monitor and engage with local authorities in relation to the implementation of the vacant site levy and as recently as 8 November 2017 held a seminar with authorities in this regard. </p></reply>

Contractors in such cases are paid on a staged basis as the project advances.</p>  <p>  Local authorities may also acquire social housing either through acquisitions of second-hand or newly completed houses, or through turnkey developments.  In these circumstances payment is made on delivery, which has been the approach utilised for a number of years.  However, options do exist for local authorities to agree staged delivery with developers.  Where suitable, this can facilitate the early delivery of completed housing and earlier payments to the developer.</p></reply>

Having consulted with relevant local authorities, my Department is currently developing the criteria for accessing the Fund and I expect to be in a position make a call for proposals to local authorities in the near future. </p>  <p>  In the interim, prior to any further affordability measures being finalised, I encourage approved housing bodies, local authorities, industry professionals and banks to work together in a collaborative and proactive way to frame proposals, so that optimum delivery of much needed affordable homes will be achieved from the Fund without delay.</p></reply>
