The measures detailed in the Programme include the provision of next-generation broadband, addressing the renewal of the post office network, supporting local jobseekers, and the provision of services in areas such as education, health and security.  These services fall under the remit of a number of Government Departments and agencies. </p><p>I am currently finalising an Action Plan for Rural Development that will act as an overarching structure for the co-ordination and implementation of initiatives across Government which will benefit rural Ireland.  In developing the Action Plan, my Department conducted a consultation process with stakeholders to identify issues that are impacting on rural Ireland and to seek inputs to the Plan.  The implementation of the Action Plan will contribute significantly to the protection and enhancement of local services and social inclusion in rural areas. </p><p>I intend to publish the Action Plan in the coming weeks.  In the meantime, I have already introduced a number of practical measures to support rural communities, including through the roll out of initiatives such as the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, the expansion of the REDZ initiative and the reintroduction of the CL&Aacute;R Programme.  My Department is also working directly on proposals for the renewal of the post office network, as well as measures to facilitate the roll out of high speed broadband in rural areas once Government contracts are awarded next year under the National Broadband Plan.</p></reply>

There are 1,131 post offices nationwide, 51 of which are operated directly by An Post, with the rest being run under contract to An Post by postmasters and postmistresses.</p>  <p>  In the course of a recent appearance before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on 9th November 2016, a representative from An Post indicated that 600 post offices are required to satisfy the company&rsquo;s contract with the Department of Social Protection, leaving approximately 530 offices which would not be required to deliver this, their largest, contract.  These offices would not be considered sustainable by An Post. </p>  <p>  While commercial and operational decisions are a matter for the Board of An Post, the Government would ideally like to see the maintenance of a full national network of customer-focused post offices in the community. </p>  <p>  The postal sector is undergoing significant change both nationally and internationally, with the increased use of electronic communications leading to a 38% decline in core mail volume for An Post from its peak in 2007.  In recent years, there has also been a 17% decline in Department of Social Protection payments and a 20% reduction in Billpay transactions, both of which have been key revenue lines for the post office network.  </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to working with all stakeholders to find solutions to the sustainability of the post office network in the changing business environment in which they are operating.  This end, the Post Office Network Business Development Group, was established to examine the potential for the delivery of additional Government services through the post offices and to identify new business opportunities for the network.  </p>  <p>  Following the publication of the Group&rsquo;s report in January of this year, two further Working Groups were established to progress its recommendations.  These Working Groups are currently finalising their reports.  In addition, my officials have been examining the potential for the post office network to deliver other services, including motor tax and financial services. </p>  <p>  I intend to report to Government on these matters in the coming weeks.    </p></reply>

Following consultation with the relevant institutions under the aegis of my Department, it is a shared view that the amount being sought for this one letter &ndash; between &euro;1m and &euro;1.5m - was not justifiable in terms of expenditure of public monies and in the context of historical material already held.</p></reply>

There are currently 6 vacancies on the Council.  The Public Appointments Service, which operates a dedicated website, www.stateboards.ie, through which it advertises vacancies on State Boards, recently called for expressions of interest in these vacancies.  Following an assessment of the expressions of interest received, the Public Appointments Service notifies me, as Minister, of the applicants who are qualified.

Funding of &euro;7.5 million has been approved for a total of 120 projects under the 2016 scheme.  </p>  <p>  It is my intention to announce a further call for proposals under the Rural Recreation Scheme in 2017.  I have secured an additional &euro;8 million in funding for the National Rural Development Schemes under Budget 2017, to ensure that these schemes continue to have a positive impact on the economic, social and cultural development of rural Ireland.

The Post Office Network Business Development Group was established in late 2014 to examine the potential for the delivery of additional Government services through the post offices and to identify new business opportunities for the network.  </p><p>The Group published its report in January of this year and, amongst its conclusions, recommended that An Post should review and amend the five-year strategy for the post office network, following appropriate consultation with postmasters and other stakeholders.</p><p>Two further Working Groups were also established this year to progress the wider recommendations of the Business Development Group.  The Post Office Network Implementation Group has been examining issues such as the number and spatial distribution of Post Offices, branch modernisation, the streamlining of products and services, postmaster payments and contracts, and training and qualifications for post office employees.  The Implementation Group is nearing the conclusion of its work and its recommendations will be issued to the Board and management of An Post in the next few weeks.  It will be a matter for An Post, as a commercial State company, to consider these recommendations and to bring their proposals to the appropriate Government Ministers for discussion. </p><p>Separately, I established the Post Office Hub Working Group to identify potential models under which the post offices could act as community hubs, especially in rural areas.  This Group has recently concluded its deliberations and is finalising its report. In addition, my officials have also been examining the potential for the post offices to deliver other services, including motor tax and financial services. </p><p>I intend to report to Government on these matters in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

I understand also that the data is not standardised and is not comparable across countries.  For example, local authority expenditure on the arts, the artists' exemption tax relief, expenditure on public service broadcasting and the Irish language are not included in the figures for Ireland but comparable figures are included in the data for some other countries. </p><p>I have previously stated that further research on this issue is warranted.  The issue of a definition of culture and of capturing public expenditure on culture is an element of the draft <i>Culture 2025</i>framework policy, which was forwarded to the Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs for input in July last. </p><p>In Budget 2017, I secured a series of funding increases across the arts and cultural bodies under my remit.  These include</p><p>-an additional &euro;5 million for the Arts Council, an 8% increase in its annual budget;</p><p>-increased funding for all of the National Cultural Institutions;</p><p>-  an increase of &euro;2 million for the Irish Film Board and &euro;1 million for Culture Ireland;</p><p>-an additional &euro;1 million to the Heritage Council;and</p><p>-a new funding stream of &euro;5m for the implementation of a <i>Culture 2025</i>/Ireland 2016 Legacy Programme, details of which I will be announcing shortly.</p><p>These increases will have a positive and distinct impact on arts provision around the country.  I have retained the majority of the &euro;18 million current funding which was provided for the 2016 Commemorations for arts and culture.  It will, therefore, become part of the baseline figures for my Department, meaning that it will carry forward into future years. </p><p>All of this represents real and substantial funding increases across the arts and cultural area and has been welcomed across the sector.  It also re-affirms the commitment of t his Government to progressively increase funding for the arts as the economy improves, as set out in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government.</i></p></reply>

In recent years, there has also been a decline in Department of Social Protection payments and a reduction in Billpay transactions at post offices.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to working with all stakeholders to find solutions to the sustainability of the post office network in this changed business environment.  The Post Office Network Business Development Group was established in late 2014 to examine the potential for the delivery of additional Government services through the post offices and to identify new business opportunities for the network.  </p>  <p>  The Group published its report in January of this year and, amongst its conclusions, recommended that An Post should review and amend the five-year strategy for the post office network, following appropriate consultation with postmasters and other stakeholders.</p>  <p>  Two further Working Groups were also established this year to progress the wider recommendations of the Business Development Group.  The Post Office Network Implementation Group has been examining issues such as the number and spatial distribution of Post Offices, branch modernisation, the streamlining of products and services, postmaster payments and contracts, and training and qualifications for post office employees.  The Implementation Group is nearing the conclusion of its work and its recommendations will be issued to the Board and management of An Post in the next few weeks.  It will be a matter for An Post, as a commercial State company, to consider these recommendations and to bring their proposals to the appropriate Government Ministers for discussion. </p>  <p>  Separately, I established the Post Office Hub Working Group to identify potential models under which the post offices could act as community hubs, especially in rural areas.  This Group has recently concluded its deliberations and is finalising its report.  In addition, my officials have also been examining the potential for the post offices to deliver other services, including motor tax and financial services. </p>  <p>  I intend to report to Government on these matters in the coming weeks.    </p></reply>

Feedback from members of the public and the media clearly indicated the very positive engagement of the general public with the commemorative events, as well as the extent to which citizens felt a great sense of national pride and respect during this historic time.</p>  <p>  The Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme has met with widespread support across the political, academic and community sectors.  It has engaged our communities at home and abroad in an unprecedented way and the benefits at community level and indeed nationally cannot be underestimated.  The inclusive nature of the programme has enabled citizens to really examine our history and has encouraged them to consider the future of their communities.  The local authorities developed their own individual programmes based on the national programme and this has encouraged active citizenship at local level and has leveraged economic benefits right across the country.     </p>  <p>  Of course, the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme is a year-long initiative, with a huge diversity of programmes and events running throughout 2016.  While a large number of the key events took place around the Easter period, the programme has continued through the remainder of 2016, with many exciting and innovative programmes and initiatives, including a large number of activities at local level.  A landmark, national conference was hosted by NUIG earlier this month, entitled 1916 - 2016: The Promise and Challenge of National Sovereignty.  Next month, members of the Defence Forces will be presented with specially commissioned medals in recognition of their professional service during this centenary year.     </p>  <p>  I believe that it is important to continue the momentum to build on the positive legacy of the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme.  My Department has, therefore, been developing a cross-Government initiative to mainstream culture and creativity in the life of the nation and to promote individual, community and national wellbeing.  This will focus on boosting cultural provision and participation in communities and harnessing the goodwill and engagement generated by the commemorative programme this year.  It will also act as the main vehicle to take forward the priorities identified in Culture 2025.  I have secured funding of &euro;5 million in Budget 2017 to underpin this new initiative and I intend to announce further details in the coming weeks.   </p></reply>

There are Creative Europe Desks covering culture and media in Ireland, which provide information, advice and technical assistance to arts and heritage organisations in Ireland that are interested in applying to the Creative Europe Media and Culture Sub-programmes.  The Creative Europe Culture Sub-programme has granted over &euro;13 million to projects with Irish partners in its first three years.  Over &euro;2 million of this has been awarded to Irish-led projects.  Recent statistics show that Ireland's participation is improving and organisations are now more likely to look to Europe for funding.

Ireland&rsquo;s success rate was 13%.</p><p>In respect of the Creative Europe Media Sub-programme, since the Creative Europe Programme commenced in January 2014, the Irish audiovisual sector has received some &euro;5.338 million in direct funding from the Media Sub-programme.  In the first 2 years, 1.7% of the total Creative Europe Media Sub-programme budget of some &euro;216 million was allocated to Ireland<b>.</b>As Ireland represents less than 1% of the population of the EU and, given that non-EU countries also participate in the programme, Ireland has significantly outperformed on a population ratio by more than 50%.</p><p>A complete list of funding results is published on the Education, Audio-Visual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) website at .</p></reply>

This may result in discussions with the local coursing club and the Irish Coursing Club.  I will be happy to make relevant reports available following the completion of this process.</p>  <p>  In August this year, my Department issued licences under the Wildlife Acts to the Irish Coursing Club, covering its affiliated coursing clubs, to capture and tag hares for use at regulated hare coursing meetings for the 2016/17 coursing season, which extends from the end of September 2016 to the end of February 2017.</p>  <p>  There are a total of 26 conditions which are associated with the licences issued to the Irish Coursing Club.  These conditions which have been developed and refined over a number of years cover a wide range of issues including prohibition on coursing hares more than once a day or coursing sick or injured hares, the need for adequate escapes for hares during coursing and releasing hares in daylight hours after meetings.</p></reply>

In the case of all Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas, including R&aacute;th Chairn and Baile Ghib in Co. Meath, organisations will be given up to 2 years from the date on which &Uacute;dar &aacute;s na Gaeltachta selects them, to submit a language plan to me, as Minister, for approval in line with the language planning criteria prescribed under section 12 of the Act.</p><p>Once a plan has been approved under the Act, organisations will be given 7 years to implement the approved language plans with the assistance of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  My Department will periodically review the implementation of the plans during that period.</p><p>In accordance with the provisions of section 7(3) of the Act, a notice was published in September 2015 in respect of the Gaeltacht Language Planning Area of <i>R&aacute;th Chairn agus Baile Ghib,</i>effectively kick-starting the language planning process in the Meath Gaeltacht.  It is anticipated that a language plan for <i>R&aacute;th Chairn agus Baile Ghib</i>will be submitted for approval by September 2017.</p><p>In the meantime, as is the case with all other Gaeltacht areas, my Department, in the context of its own remit, and acting in concert with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and other relevant stakeholders, will continue to advance the interests of Gaeltacht na M&iacute; by means of the range of schemes, programmes and initiatives currently being deployed to foster language and economic development in the Gaeltacht.</p></reply>

Key to the programme is that applications are good for Ireland, good for jobs and are in the public interest and that the funds invested are legally acquired and owned by the investor (i.e. not borrowed).  It is also essential that applicants be of good character. </p><p>The Programme is open to non-EEA nationals who commit to an approved investment in Ireland.  The benefit to the applicant is that they and their immediate family members will be granted rights of residence in the State which will allow them to enter the State on multi-entry visas and to remain here for an initial period of 2 years and renewed for 3 years subject to certain criteria being met (i.e. the investment has not been withdrawn, they continue to be law abiding and self sufficient). </p><p>The following options are available under the programme:</p><p>- Enterprise Investment: &euro;500k invested in an Irish Enterprise for 3 years,</p><p>- Investment Funds: &euro;500k invested in an approved fund,</p><p>- Endowment: &euro;500k philanthropic donation by an individual,</p><p>- Real Estate Investment Trusts: Minimum &euro;2m. investment in any Irish REIT listed in the Irish Stock Exchange,</p><p>- Immigrant Investor Bond:<b>*</b>&euro;1m invested in the bond at 0% interest rate,</p><p>- Mixed Investment:<b>*</b>Minimum Investment of &euro;450k in a residential property &amp;amp;  &euro;500k into the immigrant investor bond.</p><p><b>*</b>The Immigrant Investor Bond and the Mixed Investment were both suspended in July 2016 as they no longer provided value.</p><p>All applications under the Immigrant Investor Programme are considered on their merits in a qualitative examination by an independent interdepartmental Evaluation Committee, established under the programme, comprising of appropriate officials from the IDA; Enterprise Ireland; Dept of Finance; Dept of Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade; Dept of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation, and the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (which also provides the administrative assistance to the Committee) who have the required skills and experience to evaluate the applications. </p></reply>

The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 commenced its second stage reading in the D&aacute;il on 5 October.  When enacted, the Bill will reform Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights. Achieving the necessary balance between those rights and ensuring appropriate protection is crucial.</p>  <p>  Work is underway on drawing up the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to progress miscellaneous legislative amendments necessary to proceed to ratification.  It is intended that the Bill will address issues such as the Convention's requirements in relation to reasonable accommodation and deprivation of liberty, as well as removing archaic references in existing legislation relating to mental health.  The General Scheme of the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is available on the Department's website.

The Act provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. </p>  <p>  The Act is being commenced on a phased basis and it is my intention that the new decision-making support options provided for in the Act will be substantially implemented during 2017.  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (which is a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act come into force.  Careful planning and groundwork, and not just funding, has to be put in place to ensure that the commencement of the Act is correctly, appropriately and effectively handled.  My Department is working carefully on this at present in consultation with the Department of Health and the Mental Health Commission.  A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from my Department, the Department of Health and the Mental Health Commission is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service.  My Department is liaising with the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the finalisation of funding for the Decision Support Service in 2017.</p>  <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 1 (Preliminary and General) and Part 9 (Director of the Decision Support Service) of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016.  These provisions were brought into operation in order to enable the process of recruitment of the Director of the Decision Support Service to begin.  Sanction for the appointment of the Director of the Decision Support Service has been sought by the Department of Health and the intention is that the Mental Health Commission will begin the process of recruiting a Director as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.  The Minister for Health, under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) (No. 2) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 517 of 2016), brought into operation on 17 October 2016 some provisions of Part 8 of the Act relating to advance healthcare directives.  The commenced provisions provide for the establishment by the Minister for Health of a multi-disciplinary group to advise in relation to codes of practice on advance healthcare directives.</p></reply>

The records show that the applicant was requested, in January 2014, to submit certain documentation in relation to his application but that no further correspondence was received from him until October 2016.  The records also indicate that the person's permission to reside in the State expired in December 2014.  All non-EEA nationals are required to keep their permission to remain in the State up to date at all times and failure to do so may result in the individual being removed from the State.</p>  <p>  Following the receipt of the recent correspondence from the person concerned a letter issued to him on 3 October 2016 requesting his national passport, endorsed with the relevant permission to reside in the State, and his Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) card.  A reminder issued on 9 November  2016 granting him an extension of 6 months to provide the relevant documentation.  Upon receipt of the requested information, or in the event that the person does not respond, the case will be further processed.  I understand from INIS that applications are regularly received from nationals of the country concerned which are supported by appropriate documentation, including passports.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.  The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

The Courts Service envisages a courthouse comprising four courtrooms and related facilities as being required to meet future demand in Tralee and this will require a building significantly larger than the current courthouse.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  The Divisional officer for each Garda Division allocates personnel within his or her Division as appropriate.</p>  <p>  Maynooth Garda Station is in the Leixlip Garda District which forms part of the Kildare Division.  As on the 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 307 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na assigned to the Kildare Division, of these 12 were assigned to Maynooth Garda Station.  The Kildare Division is supported by 22 members of the Garda Reserve and 29 Civilian Staff.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Garda National Drugs and Organise Crime Bureau.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p>  <p>  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of whom 35 have been assigned to the Kildare Division.  No doubt the Kildare Division. like all Garda Divisions and activities will benefit from the increased resources coming on stream.</p></reply>

In seeking that report, I have not sought to circumscribe in any way the information which the Garda Commissioner would provide.  I will fully consider this report when it is available.</p>  <p>  I have also made it clear previously that should anything emerge from the findings of the UK's undercover policing inquiry that would be relevant to policing in this jurisdiction I will consider it fully and take any action that may be required.</p></reply>

My Department is in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, having regard to the constitutional and legal aspects arising, as indicated in the Government's Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness published last July.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, priority was given to getting the new national Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service (Abhaile) up and running, and this was formally launched in October 2016.

This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.  I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties and are on the ground in communities nationwide.</p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based  training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.  The importance of appropriate support and supervision was highlighted in the O&rsquo;Higgins Report.</p><p>For the Deputy's information the table sets out the details provided by the Commissioner of the assignment by Division of the 145 probationer Garda who attested on 17 November 2016.</p><p><b>Assignment of Probation Garda who attested on 17 November 2016</b><table><tr><th>DIVISION</th><th>DISTRICT HQ</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>D.M.R.

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p>  <p>  The target of 4,000 civilians  will effectively double the number of civilians undertaking administrative and technical duties within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at present and represents a medium term target of 20% civilians by 2021.  This will bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, currently with 14% civilians, more into line with international norms and ensure that trained Garda&iacute; are not engaging in administrative and technical duties which could be done by suitably qualified civilian staff.  The Garda Inspectorate, in its 2015 report  "Changing Policing in Ireland", has estimated that there may be up to 1,500 Garda&iacute; currently in such posts and the Government&rsquo;s plan aims to return as many of these Garda&iacute; as possible to front-line duties over the next five years.  With this in mind, the Garda Commissioner, in conjunction with the Policing Authority, has been requested to identify posts suitable for redeployment by the end of the year and to prepare a 5 year plan for reaching the 20% medium term target.</p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of up to 500 civilians provided for in Budget 2017 will facilitate the Garda Commissioner in addressing capacity and critical skills gaps across the organisation including in corporate supports, change management, human resources and financial management at the national, regional and Divisional level.  These appointments will make an important contribution to the delivery of the ambitious reform agenda set out in the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 and will facilitate deeper civilianisation in the coming years.</p>  <p>  In addition, and again flowing from the recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate, the Commissioner has commenced the roll-out on a pilot basis of a Divisional model of policing to replace the current District model.  The benefit of the Divisional model is that responsibilities will be allocated on a functional rather than geographical basis which will facilitate greater flexibility in the deployment of resources in response to policing needs.  It also will have the benefit of reducing duplicate administrative tasks currently done at both the District and Divisional level.  In this regard the Commissioner has estimated that 10 Garda&iacute; will be freed up for front-line duties in each Division once the model is fully rolled out.  The roll-out will be done on a phased basis and in such a manner as to ensure that the close relationship between Garda&iacute; and local communities is maintained.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to be aware  that under section 19 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 as amended, the appointment of civilian staff of grades equivalent to, or above, that of chief superintendent are made by the Policing Authority while the appointment of civilian staff equivalent to, or below, that of superintendent are made by the Garda Commissioner.  Arranging for the recruitment of civilian staff is a matter for the Commissioner in accordance with section 26 of the 2005 Act as amended.</p></reply>

It sets out a ten-year approach to ensuring that people with disabilities who are able to, and want to, work are supported and enabled to do so.  It is a cross-government approach that brings together actions by different Departments and State agencies in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on employment of people with disabilities.  In tandem with that, it seeks to ensure there will be joined-up services and supports at local level to support individuals on their journey into and in employment.  Implementation of the Strategy will be subject to regular monitoring, and there will be a review and renewal every three years.</p><p>  The Strategy's six strategic priorities are to:</p><p>- Build skills, capacity and independence;</p><p>- Provide bridges and supports into work;</p><p>- Make work pay;</p><p>- Promote job retention and re-entry to work;</p><p>- Provide coordinated and seamless support</p><p>- Engage employers.</p><p>The Comprehensive Employment Strategy Implementation Group convened for the first time in October 2015, and has met on seven occasions to-date.  I understand that the Group's first Annual Report, detailing progress made to-date, will be presented to me shortly, and I will arrange to have it published as soon as possible thereafter.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division. </p><p>Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.  In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  It is expected that Community Policing and all other Garda activities, will undoubtedly benefit from these resources now coming on stream. </p><p>The use of forms of communication in particular circumstances are operational matters for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and policy and practice in this regard are a matter for the Garda Commissioner to determine.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-29a.257.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112900063#WRG01100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 120 together.</p><p>I wish to inform the Deputy that there is no particular delay in the Garda employment vetting process; rather, there has been a very significant improvement in vetting processing times in recent months.</p><p>The conducting of Garda vetting is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner.  It is carried out by the Garda National Vetting Bureau in accordance with, <i>inter alia</i>, the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012 to 2016 which sets out the arrangements to provide vetting by the Bureau under the charge of a Chief Bureau Officer and operating a National Vetting Bureau database system.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that at present, 80 percent of vetting applications are processed by the Garda National Vetting Bureau in under five working days.  This represents a dramatic improvement in turnaround times for the processing of vetting applications in recent years, falling from an average of 14 weeks in mid-2013.  This improvement has come about as a result of an unprecedented investment by the Government and the Garda Authorities in providing this service, including an increase of over 80 percent in staffing levels and the roll out earlier this year of an e-Vetting system.</p><p>In April this year I commenced the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012 to 2016 and in tandem with that, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na launched the e-Vetting system.  E-Vetting facilitates the on-line processing of applications and this has significantly streamlined the vetting process and contributed to a sustained reduction in processing times for vetting applications.  I am further informed by the Garda Authorities that the vast majority of vetting applications, over 85 percent of applications, now received by the Vetting Bureau are received and processed via the e-Vetting system.</p><p>One very important feature of the e-Vetting system is that the individual applicant can track the progress of their own vetting application on-line and can, therefore, see when their application has been processed and returned to the relevant registered organisation.</p><p>There are a small number of registered organisations who are not yet operating the e-Vetting system and continue to use the old paper format for applications.  For vetting applications that continue to be submitted in paper format, the average turnaround time is in the order of four weeks from the receipt of the application by the Vetting Bureau and this represents a minimum time frame given the administrative input required.  The Garda Authorities continue to work with the organisations who are not yet operating the e-Vetting system to encourage and support them to do so.</p><p>Processing times for any given application can be longer in individual cases when, for example, additional enquiries may be necessary or where errors have been made in the application.  It is important to note that delays can also occur in other aspects of the application process which are outside of the control of the Garda Authorities, for example, in the submission or return of applications by the registered organisations.</p><p>The primary purpose of the vetting service is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults.  Accordingly, the vetting process demands rigorous procedures to safeguard its integrity and to maintain the highest level of confidence by the public and organisations availing of the service.  Any vetting process will take a certain minimum amount of time to complete and, taking into account the importance of protecting children and vulnerable adults while providing an effective and efficient service, the current processing period is not unreasonable.  </p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that, as on the 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 293 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na assigned to the Sligo Leitrim Division.  The Sligo Leitrim Division is supported by 24 members of the Garda Reserve and 25 Civilian Staff.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Garda National Drugs and Organise Crime Bureau. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.  I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response.  I am also informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of whom 10 have been assigned to the Sligo/Leitrim Garda Division. </p>  <p>  In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is also a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.  The importance of appropriate support and supervision was highlighted in the O&rsquo;Higgins Report.  </p></reply>

If the Deputy has a specific person in mind they should advise the person to write to Unit 2, Residence Division, INIS where the details of the person's case will be assessed.  A work permit holder would be given a Stamp 1 by INIS and in the normal course of events, a person must be continuously resident in the State to enable them to renew their immigration permission.  Continuous residence means living in the State for a period covered by their permission, but allowing for reasonable periods of absence from the State for holidays and exceptional family circumstances.  Without the specifics of the case I cannot comment further.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been established for this purpose.

The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.  </p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>   I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that, as on the 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 307 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na assigned to the Kildare Division.  The Kildare Division is supported by 22 members of the Garda Reserve and 29 Civilian Staff.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Garda National Drugs and Organise Crime Bureau.</p>  <p>   While there are currently no Garda&iacute; specifically assigned to the role of Community Garda attached to the Kildare Division, the Commissioner has advised that it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises.  In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.  In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p>  <p>  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.  I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response.  I am also informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties and that 35 of these probationer Garda have been assigned the Kildare Division.  It is expected that Community Policing and all other Garda activities, will undoubtedly benefit from these resources now coming on stream. </p>  <p>  In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is also a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.  The importance of appropriate support and supervision was highlighted in the O&rsquo;Higgins Report.  </p></reply>

With a view towards increasing the supply of new housing, the relief will only be available in respect of 'new builds'. To be eligible to apply for the Help to Buy incentive, a first-time buyer must take out a mortgage of at least 70% of the value of the purchase price, or in the case of a self-build, 70% of the valuation approved by the mortgage provider.</p>  <p>  The full conditions of the scheme are provided for in Section 8 of the Finance Bill 2016 as published, the commencement of which is subject to the approval of the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

The restructuring of the credit into the SPCCC achieves such an outcome.  I would also point out that there is no specific tax credit for children in the tax code.  Therefore, married or cohabiting couples are unable to avail of any additional credit to assist them in the financial maintenance of their children.  </p>  <p>  It is possible for a qualifying Primary Claimant to surrender (relinquish) his or her entitlement to the credit, in favour of a Secondary Claimant where the child resides with that Secondary Claimant for at least 100 days per year.  It should be noted that a Secondary Claimant does not qualify for the SPCCC in his/her own right. Rather it is the primary carer of the child who is entitled to the credit subject to meeting the qualifying criteria and, should he/she choose, may subsequently surrender the credit to a Secondary Claimant who has care of the child for at least 100 days in a year.  Where the child's primary carer is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting they would not be entitled to the SPCCC (or indeed the previous One Parent Family Tax Credit), on the basis that the relevant child is not, in the main, being cared for by a single person. In such circumstances the Primary Claimant cannot relinquish the credit to a secondary carer.</p>  <p>  However should the Secondary Claimant become the primary carer of the child in the future, he/she may be entitled to apply for the SPCCC in his/her own right.</p></reply>

The Regulations are under the remit of the Minister for Social Protection and prescribe the conditions for transfers to arrangements established outside the State.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Revenue that many transfers of pension benefits overseas are made for legitimate reasons and are fully compliant with the transfer Regulations and Revenue requirements.  The issue of seeking to recoup the tax relief provided to such individuals in building up their pension benefits here does not, therefore, arise. </p>  <p>  Since 2012, all overseas pension transfer requests must be accompanied by a declaration signed by the individual concerned to the effect that the transfer is for bona fide reasons and conforms to all of the relevant transfer obligations.  As I mentioned recently in my response to Deputy McGrath's Parliamentary Question No. 77 of 24 November 2016, since 2014 Revenue has been involved in an ongoing  compliance program in relation to the transfer of pension funds off-shore with the objective of seeking to ensure the legitimacy of such transfers.  I also mentioned in that reply that seeking to move pension funds or PRSAs overseas in an effort to circumvent the requirements of Irish tax legislation may fall foul of the conditions under which they were approved by Revenue and that this could result in the withdrawal of approval, the effect of which would be the claw back of the tax relief previously given.  I also made reference to the fact that, to date, no withdrawal of approval has taken place.</p>  <p>  Finally, my Department has been engaged in a review of the whole area of pension transfers abroad in conjunction with Revenue, the Department of Social Protection and the Pensions Authority with a view to establishing what additional safeguards may be required in this area.  This review is not yet completed.  However, I am conscious of the need to ensure that any amendments to the existing arrangements do not impede or interfere with legitimate overseas transfers that allow individuals leaving the State permanently to simplify their tax affairs by taking their pensions savings with them, so that they can continue to save to provide an income in retirement. </p></reply>

This independence is seen as critical to maintaining the integrity of the taxation system and forms a key pillar of Revenue's Governance framework, and it would therefore be neither appropriate nor possible for a Minister for Finance to instruct the Revenue Commissioners to review their policy with regard to the administration of tax legislation.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that patronage shares were received by suppliers of milk as a consequence of and in proportion to the quantity of milk supplied.  Where the number of shares is based on and dependent on the level of business between the members and the cooperative or nominated purchaser and where the cooperative does not receive the market price for the shares issued, then the profit accruing i.e. the difference between the market value of the shares issued and the price paid for these shares, to the member is a trading receipt of the member's farming income.  This is no different to the general tax treatment that applies to other forms of share based remuneration.  Employees are liable to income tax on share awards for similar reasons the share award is linked to their work and as a consequence the value of any shares awarded is treated as taxable employment income.</p>  <p>  Capital Gains Tax (CGT) applies to the growth in the value of a capital asset.  For example, if an individual sells a share that grew in value after it was acquired, CGT would apply, subject to the availability of any exemption, on the increase in value between it being acquired and being sold.  The matter at issue in the particular case, however, is the initial value of the shares received by farmers as a result of their trading relationship with the co-op.  The shares were a form of payment received for the milk supplied by the farmers and therefore the value of the shares forms part of the trading income for the relevant years.</p>  <p>  I am assured by Revenue that there has been no change in policy with regard to the imposition of income tax or CGT to share awards and they have emphasised that the matter at issue in this instance is the original market value of the shares received by farmers as a result of their trading relationship with the co-op.</p>  <p>  I am further informed by Revenue that the letters which issued to certain farmers were invitations to engage with Revenue as regards their tax position for the years 2011 to 2013.  The letters in question are in the first instance enquiries with the farmers concerned as to whether the value of the shares received has been included in the accounts for the years in question.  Farmers who did include the share value in their accounts will not have any additional income tax liability in relation to the specific matter raised in these inquiries.</p>  <p>  Early engagement with Revenue, where the share value received has been included in the accounts for the years in question, will mean an early conclusion of Revenue's enquiries.  Early engagement with Revenue, where the share value received was not included in the accounts for the years in question, will facilitate a discussion between the individuals concerned and Revenue with a view to agreeing a mutually satisfactory arrangement, including if necessary, a phased payment arrangement, to deal with any tax liability involved.  I am advised by Revenue that there have been extensive contacts with them in regard to this matter generally and they are and will be responding very quickly to those contacts in order to assist farmers to bring matters to an early conclusion.</p>  <p>  I would ask the Deputies to encourage any farmers who have received a letter from Revenue in this matter to engage with Revenue without delay.</p></reply>

The Central Bank sought to conduct a broad examination of tracker mortgage-related issues covering, among other things, transparency of communications with and contractual rights of tracker mortgage borrowers.</p><p>This review is now underway, and the Central Bank is working with the banks to conduct a comprehensive examination of customer mortgage accounts with regard to tracker rates, including any instances where banks may have failed to deliver on their obligations to customers.  Such instances may include cases where the bank was not sufficiently clear with customers on their terms and conditions, or where they have failed to honour contractual commitments.</p><p>The Central Bank has laid out a detailed and rigorous process for each institution to follow.  The identification of affected customers, implementation of any appropriate rectification actions, as well as the calculation of any appropriate interest redress or compensation, are all processes currently being worked through by the banks.  The review also involves oversight of each bank's work by an independent third party, and the establishment of an independent appeals process.  Further, the Central Bank continues to review and monitor each institution's progress at every stage.  It is possible that different banks will progress through the review process at different speeds.</p><p>I expect that the Central Bank, and each of the institutions involved, will provide information periodically on steps taken and progress made.  The tracker mortgage review is an ongoing process involving the banks, their regulator and any affected customers; I have no direct role in its implementation.  It is therefore not possible, nor appropriate, for me to speculate at this time on the number of customers that may be affected.</p><p>For completeness, I have requested a brief update from each of the banks in which the State is a shareholder:</p><p><b>AIB</b></p><p>&quot;AIB is conducting a comprehensive review of customer mortgage accounts with regard to tracker rates.  This process is ongoing. AIB s review has found the bank fell short on its obligations to some customers.  In order to prevent further detriment for the customers identified to date, AIB has in the first instance begun correcting interest rates on these accounts and writing to customers to outline their new interest rates and repayment amounts.  As the review progresses, AIB is commencing refunds to customers who overpaid interest and is paying compensation. Details of a set payment towards the cost of independent professional advice will also be made available to customers and the bank will establish an independent appeals process.  An independent third party, KPMG, is reviewing key aspects of AIB s work.  These steps are in line with the principles outlined by the Central Bank.  The overall review will take some time to complete and other customers may be identified through this ongoing process.  AIB has put in place a customer Freephone Helpline, 1800 235 460 (Mon-Fri, 8:00am-7:00pm), to assist with any queries its customers may have.&quot;</p><p><b>PTSB</b></p><p>&quot;As part of its response to the Central Bank initiated review of Tracker Mortgages in all Irish banks, Permanent TSB is reviewing all Tracker Mortgages issued by the bank.This review is comprehensive and complex and we are not currently in a position to state with certainty when the matter will conclude.</p><p>Separately in July 2015 Permanent TSB concluded an investigation into certain specific identified issues in respect of Tracker Mortgages.  This review identified d 1,372 cases where customers had lost an entitlement to a tracker mortgage through a failure at the bank.  The bank has written to all impacted customers to offer redress including compensation for this failure.  To date over 90% of impacted customers have accepted this redress and compensation.  Customers have various options to challenge the amount of redress / compensation offered whether by availing of specific independent appeal panels established for this purpose or by bringing a case to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO) or by initiating court proceedings.  </p><p>As of 28 October last, 194 (14%) of impacted customers have lodged an appeal with the independent appeals panels while 1,178 (86%) have not.  The bank does not have complete information on how many customers may/have lodged an appeal with either the FSO or the Courts.&quot;</p><p><b>BOI</b></p><p>&quot;In 2015 the Central Bank of Ireland announced that it would conduct a Tracker Mortgage Examination with all lenders in Ireland.  This examination is underway, and Bank of Ireland is co-operating fully with it.&quot;</p></reply>

Following this report, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) appointed Promontory Financial Group to further investigate these allegations.  Promontory's work along with the involvement of the FCA, led RBS to recently announce redress for certain SME customers of RBS's Global Restructuring Group.  The final details of the redress scheme remain to be agreed with the FCA.</p>  <p>  As I have previously answered, Ulster Bank Ireland Limited undertook an independent review into the relevance of these allegations to its corresponding division, namely the Global Restructuring Group Ireland (GRGI).  On the 19th December 2014, Ulster Bank published the findings of the independent review by Mahon Hayes Curran into practices at GRGI.  The investigation found no evidence to support the allegations and suggested that GRGI's driving policy was to manage its customers through the cycle, supporting them where possible to return them to viability.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank is the statutory body with responsibility for the investigation of any such allegations in an Irish context and I consider this as a matter properly for the Central Bank.  I am confident that legislative changes since the financial crisis have equipped the Central Bank with an array of investigative, regulatory and enforcement powers to ensure that regulated financial service providers adhere to the requirements of financial services legislation.  </p>  <p>  These changes include significantly enhanced powers for the Central Bank to gather information under the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 which broadened the Bank's information gathering and authorised officer powers.  It is evident that the Central Bank is properly undertaking its enforcement role by the recent sizeable settlements in enforcement cases.</p></reply>

These mortgage lending control measures apply to any Central Bank regulated financial provider which provides a mortgage loan which is to be secured on residential property located in the State.  However, those regulations do not place any particular residency or currency requirement on relevant loans which would specifically impact on cross border workers resident in the State.</p>  <p>  However, the Deputy may also wish to note that the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016, which transposed the Mortgage Credit Directive into Irish law, contains certain consumer protection provisions governing the provision of the foreign currency mortgage loans.  In particular, it provides that, at the time the foreign currency mortgage agreement is concluded, the consumer borrower will have the right to convert the loan into an alternative currency or that other arrangements be in place to limit the exchange rate risk to which the borrower is exposed.  This is a mandatory requirement of the Directive and the transposing Regulations provide that a lender shall ensure that at least one of these options will be available where applicable.  It is accepted that this new provision will impose some additional regulatory requirements on an Irish bank when providing foreign currency mortgage loans, but this will also need to be considered against the additional protections which will now be available to consumer borrowers who enter into such credit contracts.  While it is and remains a commercial matter for individual lenders to decide on the type and nature of credit it wishes to offer consumers, either in general or in an individual case, I would expect lenders to be in a position to adjust their systems and practices to take on board evolving and legal requirements which have the primary objective of increasing the protections available to consumer mortgage borrowers including those in relation to foreign currency mortgage loans as provided for in the Mortgage Credit Directive.</p></reply>

It is not therefore appropriate for my Department to determine whether or not the caretaker referred to by the Deputy should be facilitated with continued employment.</p>  <p>  In relation to funding to schools for the pay of grant-funded school secretaries and caretakers, my Department accepted the findings of an arbitration process.</p>  <p>  The detailed arrangements are set out in Circular 0076/2015 that was published in December 2015 on the Department's website. </p>  <p>  In March 2016 the ancillary services grant paid to primary schools was increased by &euro;6 from &euro;147 to &euro;153 per pupil to enable them pay the first phase of the arbitrator's findings.  The next phase of the pay increase is due to take effect from 1 January 2017.  A circular will be issued by my Department later in 2016 with the revised rate of grant funding to facilitate the payment of the next phase of the arbitrator's finding.</p></reply>

Other options include a predominantly State-funded system or a State-funded system supplemented with continuing student fees. </p>  <p>  As committed to in the Programme for Government, I have referred the report to the Oireachtas Education Committee and this engagement will form part of the process for formulating a plan for the future funding of the sector.  I do not want to pre-empt the work of the Committee, however, I look forward to working with it as it analyses all of the options put forward by the Expert Group and hears the voice of all stakeholders.</p>  <p>  While Cassells deals with the medium and long term funding needs of higher education we also have to consider the immediate challenges and in that context I am pleased that we placed a particular focus on this area in Budget 2017.  I secured additional funding for the sector for the first time in recent years.  In 2017 an additional &euro;36.5 million will be made available with &euro;160 million additional over the next three years.  This will allow the sector keep pace with demographic increases and introduce targeted initiatives in areas such as disadvantage, skills, research and flexible learning.  Among those who will benefit from the additional third level funding being made available are, students from disadvantaged backgrounds, lone parents and Travellers.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2017 the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I, announced a policy review with the aim of designing and implementing a sustainable and predictable multi-annual funding model for higher and further education and training involving increased Employer and Exchequer contributions from 2018.  This review will be undertaken as part of the overall response to meeting the anticipated skills needs in the economy over the coming years, in line with the policy framework set out in the National Skills Strategy.</p>  <p>  This review will include an analysis of the business case for enhanced investment in the higher and further education and training sectors.  In this context it will identify key elements of the new funding model and of the expected impacts including those on employers.  The review will include consultation with stakeholders. </p>  <p>  The policy review will be published by the end of April 2017, and will complement the ongoing work by the Oireachtas Committee in relation to the Cassells report.</p></reply>

Instead, the more effective way to deal with this particular issue is to require all schools to publish their admissions policy, so that communities and parents can scrutinise and compare them.  This requirement is being enacted through the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016, which recently passed second stage.</p>  <p>  Schools are not permitted to discriminate against an applicant for admission on any of the grounds set out in the Equal Status Act, 2000.  However, Section 7 (3)(c) of the Equal Status Act 2000 provides that an educational establishment does not discriminate where the establishment is a school providing primary or post-primary education to students and the objective of the school is to provide education in an environment which promotes certain religious values, it admits persons of a particular religious denomination in preference to others or it refuses to admit as a student a person who is not of that denomination and, in the case of a refusal, it is proved that the refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school. </p>  <p>  The Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) published a report &ldquo;Adapting to Diversity: Irish Schools and Newcomer Students" in 2009.  This report looked at a broad range of issues in relation to the integration of newcomer pupils in schools. </p>  <p>  An element of the overall research considered the effects of admission practices and policies on the distribution of newcomer pupils across schools.  It reported that at second level 80 per cent of principals said that all students who apply are usually accepted for admission and at primary level 81 per cent of principals said that all students were accepted.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill was published on 6th July 2016 and passed second stage on 17th November 2016. </p>  <p>  Publication of the Bill reflects the commitment in the Programme for Government to publish new School Admissions legislation taking account of current draft proposals and addressing issues including publication of school enrolment policies, an end to waiting lists, introduction of annual enrolment structures, and transparency and fairness in admissions for pupils and their parents. </p>  <p>  In bringing this legislation through the Oireachtas, there will be opportunities for members to raise and fully debate all of the relevant issues and I look forward to working with the Houses in this regard.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-29a.464.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112900068#WRM01100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 192 and 193 together.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that this Government is committed to ensuring that all children with Special Educational Needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network.</p><p>Such placements facilitate access to individualised education programmes which may draw from a range of appropriate educational interventions, delivered by fully qualified professional teachers, with the support of Special Needs Assistants and the appropriate school curriculum. </p><p>Almost 14,000 students in schools have been diagnosed with autism.  The Department of Education and Skills invests over &euro;300m annually in providing additional resources specifically to support students with autism in schools enabling:</p><p>63% of students to attend mainstream schools;</p><p>23% to attend special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools; and</p><p>14% to attend special schools.</p><p>Resources which are provided to schools to support children with Autism include the following: </p><p>2,200 extra teachers in mainstream schools specifically to support children with Autism;</p><p>889 special classes for students with autism &ndash; up from fewer than 80 in 2001;</p><p>20 special schools specifically for students with Autism;</p><p>One teacher and a minimum of two Ss for every primary special class of six students with ASD and 1.5 teachers and a minimum of two Ss for every post-primary special class;</p><p>S support &ndash; About 69% of all students with ASD access S support;</p><p>Assistive technology;</p><p>Professional development for teachers;</p><p>Access to the Special School transport scheme;</p><p>Access to special equipment and furniture where required;</p><p>Enhanced capitation grant;</p><p>Adapted school buildings;</p><p>Access to the extended school year scheme (July Provision).</p><p>The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required.  Special classes are part of a continuum of educational provision that enables students with more complex special educational needs to be educated, in smaller class groups, within their local mainstream schools. </p><p>Special classes offer a supportive learning environment to students with ASD who are unable to access the curriculum in a mainstream class, even with support, for most or all of their school day.  Special class for students with ASD are staffed with a lower pupil&ndash;teacher ratio of 6:1 at primary level and 6:1.5 at post primary level, and also have Special Needs Assistant support normally amounting to 2 Ss for a class of 6 children.</p><p>Students enrolled in special classes should be included in mainstream classes to the greatest extent possible, in line with their abilities.</p><p>The NCSE continues to engage with schools in opening special classes where there is an identified need for special class provision.</p><p>Progress in developing this network has been significant and in addition to the special school placements there are 1,153 special classes available, which is an increase of over 100% in the number of special classes which were available in 2011, which was 548.</p><p>This includes 127 ASD early intervention classes, 525 primary ASD classes and 237 post-primary ASD classes, which represents an increase of approx. 16% on 2015/16 classes for children with autism.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) published its policy advice on Supporting Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder in Schools in July.  The report is available on the NCSEs website www.ncse.ie In the course of preparing this policy advice, the NCSE commissioned two research papers and conducted extensive consultations with stakeholders including students, parents, teachers, principals, academics, experts, psychologists, HSE officials, officials from Departments of Health, Children and Youth Affairs and Education and Skills and others in developing this policy advice.</p><p>The NCSE found that Students are generally well supported in schools with appropriate curriculum; extensive teacher and S supports; improving range of educational placements supported by improved accommodation and equipment; improved teacher knowledge and understanding and a generally good standard of provision at primary and post primary levels. </p><p>Notwithstanding this, the NCSE acknowledged that while most schools welcome and enrol children with special educational needs, some continue to erect overt and/or soft barriers to prevent or discourage parents from enrolling their children. </p><p>The Department and the NCSE continue to work with, schools, patron representatives and management bodies to address these challenges.  Where barriers to opening classes are identified the Department will address these barriers with the schools Patrons and Boards of Management with a view to overcoming the difficulties and establishing the required classes. </p><p>The Department retains records of the number of children with Autism for whom school placements are not available at a given time through its home tuition schemes.  The Department also retains records of children who appeal schools' decisions to refuse enrolments.  It is not possible however to identify the number of children in respect of whom soft barriers may have impacted their enrolments as in many cases alternative enrolment options are availed of by parents.  </p><p>The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill was published on 6th July 2016.  The Bill contains a provision which will empower the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to designate a school for a child who has no school place for reasons related to the child&rsquo;s special educational needs and for the Child and Family Agency to designate a school for a child who has no school place (other than a child with special educational needs). </p><p>In line with recommendations from the NCSE in policy advices provided in 2011, it is the policy of the Department to include a Special Needs Unit in the accommodation brief for new school buildings, unless local circumstances indicate that it will not be required.  In addition, the Department may also provide capital funding to schools to establish special needs provision e.g. re-configure existing accommodation to provide a special class where this has been approved or recommended by the National Council for Special Education.</p></reply>

It is my Department's intention to fully implement these programmes to completion. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the decision as to when an individual school project can commence the tender and construction stage depends on factors such as the stage reached by the project in the architectural process, the extent of contractual commitments and availability of funding under the programme at that time.  I also wish to advise the Deputy that my Department is liaising directly with each of these schools in relation to their projects.  Details of the schools that are approved to advance to tender and construction stage over the course of 2017 will be updated to my Department's website www.education.ie at the appropriate time.</p></reply>

The manner in which any school ensures that the right to opt out of religion classes is upheld is a matter for the school concerned. </p>  <p>  Each individual school must determine the particular arrangements which are most appropriate in its individual circumstances having regard to local issues such as available space, supervision requirements and how the school concerned organises classes etc. </p>  <p>  The Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the primary school sector (2012) recommended steps that could be taken to ensure that the education system can provide a sufficiently diverse number and range of primary schools to cater for children of all religions and none. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to increase the number of multi-denominational schools to 400 by 2030.  However, existing schools will continue to be expected to cater for the full range of traditions, religions and beliefs in the community. </p>  <p>  A public consultation on inclusiveness in primary schools was carried out in 2013. Views were sought on issues such as how best to accommodate students of various belief systems and traditions and having school policies on the conduct of religious celebrations and the display of religious symbols.  A paper, entitled "Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector: Progress to Date and Future Directions", which took account of the public consultation, was published in 2014.  The paper outlined good practice and options for promoting diversity in schools in a number of areas, including the right to opt-out of religious classes.</p>  <p>  The paper gives an overview of current practice in schools in relation to the right to opt-out of religious classes and states that each school should arrive at solutions that suit its own particular context and to engage in dialogue with parents about the arrangements to be put in place before the child starts school.  Schools are encouraged to develop their own practices and policies in this regard.</p>  <p>  Subsequently, the Catholic Schools Partnership (2015) developed a resource for Catholic schools entitled &lsquo;Catholic Primary Schools in a Changing Ireland: Sharing Good Practice on Inclusion of All Pupils&rsquo;.  It gives suggestions on developing polices and sharing best practice with regard to inclusion of all pupils, which gives practical suggestions to schools in how to engage positively in inter-cultural dialogue.</p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016, which passed second stage on the 17th November 2016, also includes a specific requirement that school enrolment policies must include details of the school's arrangements for any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction. </p>  <p>  I believe this is an important measure which will help ensure transparency from the outset as to how a school will uphold the rights of parents in this regard.</p>  <p>  The Department has also been working on draft legislation to provide for replacing the current Section 28 of the Education Act, 1998.  The legislation will provide the statutory basis for ministerial guidelines which will form the framework for a Parents&rsquo; and Students&rsquo; Charter in every school following consultation with parents, students, recognised school management bodies and staff associations representing teachers and other appropriate bodies. </p>  <p>  The Parents and Students Charter Bill essentially deals with how schools communicate with parents and will provide an opportunity for dealing with such issues.</p></reply>

The NCSE has also advised that the current model can lead to unnecessary labelling of children from a young age.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has proposed a new resource teaching allocation model which will, when introduced, remove the formal requirement for diagnostic assessment to access additional support and which will provide resources to schools based on school profiles.</p>  <p>  Some 66 schools were invited to participate in this pilot. 19 schools, including 15 primary schools and 4 posts primary schools, declined to participate in the pilot project.  These schools were unable to participate for a number of reasons, such as due to the time required to be involved in the project, or involvement in a range of other projects or pilots.  </p>  <p>  The pilot of this new model was therefore conducted in 47 schools over the course of the 2015/16 school year. 28 at Primary School and 19 at Post Primary School. </p>  <p>  A review of this pilot has been completed and a report of the review is currently being finalised. </p>  <p>  I understand that the review will indicate that the new model has been positively received by schools and parents. </p>  <p>  Schools indicated that they welcomed the increased flexibility and autonomy provided by the model to allocate resources based on need.  Most schools believe the model allows more scope for team teaching, targeted interventions, mix of in-class and group work, with less focus on withdrawal and one to one teaching.  Schools welcome the move away from the unnecessary labelling of children in order to secure resources.  Schools also welcomed that they no longer need to wait for diagnosis and that this facilitates intervention at an earlier stage based on the schools identification of need.  In addition schools indicated a belief that they were broadly well supported in meeting the needs of children with Special Educational Needs.</p>  <p>  As part the recent Budget announcements, I announced that following development and piloting over the past number of years, a new model for the allocation of teaching resources for children with special educational needs will be implemented from September 2017.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;18 million will be provided in 2017 to provide for around 900 resource teacher posts.</p>  <p>  Further details regarding implementation of the new model will be announced in the coming months.</p></reply>

The Government has published the key actions that will be taken to address the contingencies arising from the UK's decision to leave the EU. </p>  <p>  My Department participated fully in and contributed to the preparation of this framework for the education sector.  Contingency planning and stakeholder consultations are being led and managed by the EU/International unit of the Department.  This Unit reports regularly to the Management Board, the Secretary General and myself on Brexit planning.  Their role included participation in cross-Departmental planning and co-ordination Groups.</p>  <p>  Following the British Prime Minister&rsquo;s announcement of the intention to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty by March 2017 the Government on 4th October 2016 detailed further actions to ensure continuing effective management of, and engagement on, Brexit issues.  Six working groups were established to deepen the analysis already undertaken by Departments of the sectoral implications of Brexit.  Their purpose is to advise Government on the sectoral and thematic contexts and priority recommended Government actions both in terms of negotiation process and policy measures. </p>  <p>  Among these, the Economy and Trade Workgroup has five sub-groups concerned with specific sectoral issues including education.  Chaired by my Department and representative of a number of agencies and other Departments, the Education subgroup met on 28 October 2016 to consider key issues and priorities for the Irish education sector in the context of the future discussions and negotiations should the UK Government proceed as announced to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty in early 2017.  Further meetings of the Education Subgroup will be held in the coming weeks and will reflect on the outcomes of the stakeholder engagement process that is under way.</p>  <p>  In seeking to respond to these issues dialogue and consultation with stakeholders and interested parties form an integral part of our Brexit planning.  In that regard I opened a Brexit information event for the education sector on 14 November 2016 in Dublin.  At this event I set out the latest Government position and actions to prepare for Brexit, and outlined the format of further consultations to take place to confirm our priorities in preparation for the negotiation phase in 2017. </p>  <p>  To that end I have asked my Department to convene consultative fora for the schools sector, the further education and training sector and the higher education sector in December 2016 and January 2017.  My intention is that these events will facilitate the widest possible involvement of stakeholders across our education system and help us achieve a fuller understanding of their issues and concerns as we continue to plan for the UK's exit from the EU.</p></reply>

The Bill clarifies the power of the Minister to make regulations and sets out clearly matters relating to enrolment that regulations may address.</p>  <p>  The Bill aims to strike an appropriate balance between school autonomy and the interests of parents in our education system.</p>  <p>  In relation to a school providing priority in admissions to children of past pupils, the approach taken in the draft regulations, which were published with the General Scheme in September 2013  by the then Minister for Education Mr. Ruair&iacute; Quinn, aimed to strike a balance by limiting the number of places that could be allocated by an oversubscribed school to children of past pupils to a maximum of 25%. </p>  <p>  At present the Admissions Bill is silent in relation to any power to determine a limitation on priority for children of past pupils where a school is oversubscribed either by setting a percentage or otherwise. </p>  <p>  I consider that in bringing the Bill through the Oireachtas, there will be opportunities for members to raise and fully debate this matter, which I plan to deal with in primary legislation by way of an amendment to the Bill.</p>  <p>  My view is that the previous proposal by the then Minister Quinn, that this limitation be set at 25%, is broadly where I see consensus being possible.  However, I intend to listen to all views on this matter.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the 30 September 2015.  The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board. </p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy submitted an application for consideration by the Appeals Board at its October meeting under the Small Schools criteria.  The requirements set out in the staffing circular under this criteria state that the school must have the required enrolment on 30th September 2016 for the appointment of an additional teacher for September 2017 in order to be granted an appeal post for this school year.  In the case of this school, an enrolment of 19 was required on 30th September 2016 to meet this criteria.  As the school had an enrolment of 17 on that date, the Appeals Board determined that the appeal did not satisfy all of the published criteria as set out in Circular 0007/2016.  The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p>  <p>  The measure announced in Budget 2017 provides a capacity for one teacher mainland schools to make an appeal to the Staffing Appeals Board for an extra teacher, where the single teacher has children across 6 or more class groups.  Before a school can make an appeal to the Staffing Appeals Board it must have a minimum enrolment of 15 pupils.  The detailed arrangements for this measure will be set out in the staffing schedule Circular for the 2017/18 school year i.e. the date this measure is effective from.  The circular will be published early in 2017.</p></reply>

This gives effect to the Government decision of 2011 which revised the employment and pension arrangements for teachers who became Oireachtas members so that any member of the Oireachtas who holds a teaching post in a primary, secondary, community, comprehensive or vocational school would have the option of applying for a career break of up to 10 years.  This replaced then existing leave arrangements.  The decision also applied to lecturing staff of Institutes of Technology.  The December 2015 Government decision extended these career break/unpaid leave provisions to all staff in the education and training sector.</p>  <p>  Prior to the 2011 Government decision, teachers who were elected to the Oireachtas could enjoy beneficial leave arrangements.  Under these arrangements, a teacher who was elected as a T.D. or Senator was paid full salary.  A temporary replacement teacher was employed and the Oireachtas member teacher repaid the salary of that replacement teacher to the Department/ their employer, together with the appropriate superannuation and employer&rsquo;s PRSI contributions.  The Oireachtas member teacher retained any surplus amount.  The Oireachtas member teacher continued to accrue incremental credit in their teaching post.  In addition to this, Oireachtas member teachers in primary, voluntary secondary and Community and Comprehensive schools continued to accumulate pensionable service in both their teaching post and as a member of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  The 2011 Government decision is communicated to school management and teachers in Chapter 4 of the Terms &amp;amp; Conditions of Employment for Registered Teachers in Recognised Primary and Post Primary Schools - Career Break Scheme where it states: &ldquo;The main objectives of this scheme below, which are not exhaustive, is for employers, wherever possible to facilitate applicants in the areas of: &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; Public Representation".</p>  <p>  To permit Oireachtas members to job share in a teaching post whilst still members of the Oireachtas would mean such members receiving two public salaries at the same time.  One as a public representative and one as a teacher with consequent reduced hours for the existing replacement teacher. </p>  <p>  The reason public representation is not stated in chapter 5 of the Terms &amp;amp; Conditions of Employment for Registered Teachers in Recognised Primary and Post Primary Schools &ndash; Job Sharing Scheme is because public representation is already covered in Chapter 4 of the book.</p>  <p>  The effect of the Government decisions is that the only means by which a person employed in the education and training sector who takes up a seat in the Oireachtas can temporarily take leave from their post and subsequently return to it is through taking a career break/period of unpaid leave.</p>  <p>  I am aware that a number of Oireachtas members are employed as teachers or at other grades in the education and training sector.  The career break/unpaid leave arrangements apply to all such individuals while they are sitting Oireachtas members.  I am sure that you, along with all members of the Oireachtas, will appreciate the thinking behind the Government decisions in this matter and to allow an Oireachtas member to job share in a teaching post whilst at the same time attend the Oireachtas as a member would not be in keeping with the Government decision.</p></reply>

Curriculum choice is important in motivating students to learn and to remain in school to completion of senior cycle.  The vast majority of schools already offer History and Geography and the vast majority of students choose these subjects although they are currently compulsory in only half our schools.  The popularity of subjects depends on the quality of teaching, the passion of the teachers for their subjects and the engagement of their students. I see no reason why the popularity of History will change in the future.</p>  <p>  History will begin implementation in schools from September 2018, with the new specification being made available in mid 2017. </p>  <p>  My Department met with representatives of the History Teachers' Association of Ireland in early 2012 and the discussion at that meeting helped to inform the design of the JC Framework.  I have every confidence that the changes envisaged in Framework will ensure that the place of historical study will be retained and given a new impetus across the junior cycle curriculum. Such an impetus should help to improve take up of History at senior cycle also.    </p></reply>

Receipts went from a high of &euro;413m in 2008 to &euro;299m in 2012.  Receipts then increased to &euro;364m in 2015 and are expected to be up to &euro;383m this year.  It is expected that there will be a surplus of &euro;217m in the fund at year end and &euro;272m at the end of 2017.</p>  <p>  A total of &euro;362million was allocated from the National Training Fund for training and services this year and a similar amount has been provided for 2017.  It should also be noted that NTF funding forms part of the Department&rsquo;s annual overall expenditure ceiling and any increase in NTF expenditure would have to be offset by reductions in expenditure elsewhere.</p>  <p>  In 2016 the allocation from the NTF is almost &euro;83 million for training for the employed and almost &euro;279 million for training for unemployed people.  There will be a rebalancing of this funding in 2017, with greater provision for programmes for people in employment such as apprenticeship and programmes run by Skillnets.  Demand for these programmes are rising as apprenticeship registrations rise, new apprenticeships are developed and greater numbers of employers engage with Skillnets.  Demand for training for unemployed people is reducing as unemployment continues to fall.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the NTF Act the surplus remains in the accounts of the National Training Fund.  In the past, the accumulated surplus in the fund has been important in maintaining expenditure levels, particularly in the provision of training for the unemployed, in periods when receipts fell. </p></reply>

This arises primarily due to the smaller level of income received by IoTs from non-State sources as against the Universities which have a higher proportion.  The Deputy will appreciate the recent economic crisis and continuing constraints on Government as a result of EU fiscal rules on expenditure and debt levels has to date prevented the agreement of a borrowing framework for the IoTs.</p>  <p>  However, my Department is continuing to discuss with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform the possibility of agreeing a borrowing framework as part of broader deliberations arising from the report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education and the recently published Financial Review of the IoTs by the Higher Education Authority (HEA). </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the HEA has been closely monitoring the financial position of all of the IoTs and in particular are working closely with those Institutes that are experiencing financial difficulties in order to ensure appropriate mechanisms are put in place to eliminate any deficit as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  The Financial Review of the Institutes was carried out by the HEA in order to provide an overview of the financial health of the IoT sector, to consider capacity issues and to examine the challenges for the institutions given their respective plans for the future.  The report makes a number of recommendations on how some of the issues which contribute to funding problems in the IoT sector can be addressed, including the introduction of a borrowing framework to facilitate campus development in IoTs.  All of the policy recommendations will feed into the work currently being undertaken on developing a sustainable funding model for the sector. </p></reply>

Thereafter schools will have the flexibility and autonomy to choose from 18 other subjects, including History.</p>  <p>  Schools will be given flexibility to shape their own junior cycle programme by including a selection of subjects, short courses and other learning experiences that will allow their students to meet the requirements of the twenty-four statements of learning outlined in the Framework. </p>  <p>  Overall, I am in favour of leaving the decision on what is offered at the discretion of the school.  Curriculum choice is important in motivating students to learn and to remain in school to completion of senior cycle.  The vast majority of schools already offer History and Geography and the vast majority of students choose these subjects although they are currently compulsory in only half our schools.  The popularity of subjects depends on the quality of teaching, the passion of the teachers for their subjects and the engagement of their students.  I see no reason why the popularity of History will change in the future.</p>  <p>  The new specification for History will be available to schools from September 2017. </p>  <p>  My Department met with representatives of the History Teachers' Association of Ireland in early 2012 and the discussion at that meeting helped to inform the design of the JC Framework.  I have every confidence that the changes envisaged in Framework will ensure that the place of historical study will be retained and given a new impetus across the junior cycle curriculum.  Such an impetus should help to improve take up of History at senior cycle also.</p></reply>

In addition, additional flexibility above the existing HAP rent limits was made available to all local authorities operating HAP from the same date.  These changes have had the effect of providing further targeted supports to those households in most need; providing prospective HAP recipients with access to a greater number of properties in the market; and reducing the number of households falling into homelessness.  </p>  <p>  More than 2,500 pre-existing households being supported by HAP have received an increase in their level of support since the introduction of the new rent limits in line with costed projections.  All local authorities where HAP is operational can now exceed the prescribed rent limits (by up to 20%), on a case by case basis, subject to guidelines. </p>  <p>  HAP is now available to all qualified households in 19 local authority areas, with over 15,500 households currently being supported by the scheme and over 10,000 separate landlords and agents providing accommodation to those households.  Furthermore, HAP will be available from 1 December 2016 in the following local authorities &ndash; Cavan, Kerry, Laois, Leitrim, Longford, Roscommon, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied the HAP rent limits, in combination with the discretion available to local authorities operating the scheme, is sufficient to provide housing support while meeting market demands.  My Department continues to keep the operation of the scheme, including the effectiveness of rent limits, under review.  In general, I am satisfied with the operation of HAP scheme and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under Rebuilding Ireland: An Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.</p></reply>

This demand had been previously highlighted by public library user surveys carried out in 2002 and 2007.</p>  <p>  The &lsquo;My Open Library&rsquo; initiative has been identified as an innovative approach to meeting the demand for additional opening hours.  In this regard, it allows library members the freedom and flexibility to use the library at times that suit them.  It provides additional opening hours from 8am to 10pm, seven days-per-week, ensuring access to library services for users who cannot avail of them during regular staffed hours.</p>  <p>  The initial &lsquo;My Open Library&rsquo; pilot was introduced in Tullamore, Banagher and Tubbercurry libraries from November 2014.  The pilots were established to examine the feasibility of the open library model for Ireland.  I am satisfied that the learning from the original pilots, and the very positive feedback from library users, justifies extending the pilot phase to a further 23 library branches from January 2017.  The extended pilot phase will inform and shape the future development and implementation of the service across the broader library network.</p></reply>

A scheme exists whereby a local authority (LA) can acquire ownership of properties with unsustainable local authority mortgages, thus enabling the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant.  The second scheme provides for an Approved Housing Body (AHB) to acquire ownership of a property with an unsustainable private mortgage from a lender, which also enables the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant.  Both schemes are part of the overall suite of social housing options and an important part of the mortgage arrears resolution process.</p><p>Information in relation to Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) scheme applications during its pilot phase in Dublin City Council and Westmeath County Council in 2013 and from the national roll out of the scheme in 2014 to the end of 2015, including by local authority and by year, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:  <i><font color="#0000FF">-</font></i></p><p>. </p><p>To date in 2016, 59 LAMTR cases have been received and approved and a further 19 claims are currently being processed.  Local authorities are responsible for submitting valid LAMTR applications to my Department and all applications received were approved.</p><p>In relation to activity under the AHB Mortgage to Rent scheme which was introduced in 2012, up to the end of Quarter 3 2016, a total of 3,498 cases had been submitted.  Of the 3,498 cases submitted, 2,642 were ineligible or terminated during the process.  The reasons for this are varied and can depend on the lender, the property, the household and the ability of the AHB sector to increase their involvement in the scheme.  Of the remaining cases submitted, 669 are actively being progressed and 187 have been completed.  Further statistical information relating to the scheme since its inception, including a breakdown by local authority and by year, is available on the Housing Agency&rsquo;s website at the following link: www.housingagency.ie/Our-Services/Housing-Supply-Services/Mortgage-to-Rent.aspx.</p><p>A number of amendments were made to the AHB Mortgage to Rent Scheme in July 2015 to enable more properties to qualify and to make the scheme more flexible and accessible to borrowers.</p><p>Notwithstanding the amendments already made to the scheme, the Government has included a review of the AHB Mortgage to Rent Scheme as an action in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  The review, currently underway, is examining what further amendments can be made to the scheme to make it work better for borrowers and my Department is consulting with key stakeholders in this regard.  The review is to be completed by the end of the year.</p></reply>

The elected members of a local authority have direct responsibility in law for all reserved functions of the authority, which includes adopting the annual budget, and are democratically accountable for all expenditure by the local authority.  Local authorities are required to adopt budgets which are sufficient to meet the expenditure arising in the year in accordance with the terms of section 10A of the City and County Management Act 1955.</p></reply>

The main focus of social housing supports is on meeting the most acute housing needs among the population, within the resources available.  Thus, State-funded housing supports will continue to be targeted at those people who are unable to provide for their accommodation from their own resources, as measured by their annual net income.</p>  <p>  The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 prescribe maximum net income limits for eligibility for social housing supports in each housing authority, in different bands according to the area, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of income needed to provide for a household's basic needs plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.  The limits also reflect a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn and thereby promote sustainable communities.   </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current income limits generally provide for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households unable to provide accommodation from their own resources.  However, these limits will continue to be kept under review by my Department, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda set out in the Social Housing Strategy 2020-Support, Supply and Reform and Rebuilding Ireland-Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness. </p>  <p>  Action 4.6 of Rebuilding Ireland provides for the introduction of a new pilot affordable rental scheme to enhance the capacity of the private rented sector to provide quality and affordable accommodation for households currently paying a disproportionate amount of disposable income on rent.  The objective of the scheme is to provide long-term affordable residential accommodation for low to moderate income key-worker households in urban areas of high demand and provide an economic incentive to increase supply of rental accommodation. Consideration of the pilot affordable rental scheme is being progressed within the context of the comprehensive strategy for the rental sector which is due for publication before the end of 2016.  Consideration of relevant research in the field forms an inherent part of the development of the Strategy.</p>  <p>  I am mindful that we need to consider every policy instrument at our disposal to tackle the many challenges in the housing market.  In this context, I expect that the recently announced changes to the Central Bank rules governing mortgage lending will ease the burden on those trying to secure their own home for the first time.</p></reply>

Rebuilding Ireland takes a holistic approach in addressing the many interacting structural constraints affecting the housing market by including actions to streamline the planning system, remove infrastructure blockages and support the delivery of affordable housing.  These measures should help make new developments economically viable in areas where supply constraints and price pressures are particularly acute.</p><p>Earlier this month, I announced details of 23 Major Urban Housing Development Sites with the potential to deliver up to 30,000 additional homes on existing zoned lands and close to the key areas of demand over the next 3-4 years.  These sites will be highlighted as exemplars for the co-ordination and delivery of plan-led housing development and active land management. </p><p>In order to quickly get key sites moving, a &euro;200 million Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) has been established.  Twenty-one local authorities, working in conjunction with housing providers, submitted proposals for funding which are currently being evaluated.  Successful bid proposals will be announced in December. </p><p>Separately, the National Treasury Management Agency and Ireland Strategic Investment Fund are currently exploring opportunities to support the delivery of housing-related on-site enabling infrastructure in large-scale priority development areas with a view to kick starting the development process.</p><p>Given the particular challenge faced by first-time buyers in accessing the housing market, my colleague, the Minister for Finance recently announced a Help-to-Buy initiative as part of Budget 2017.  The Help-to-Buy initiative has been designed to complement the structural measures announced in Rebuilding Ireland, by providing immediate and targeted support for first-time buyers of new homes in meeting their deposit requirements, greater certainty regarding the pool of available purchasers is provided to the housebuilding sector, encouraging the construction of new housing units.</p><p>The combined effect of these and other actions under the Plan will help reduce costs and deliver more housing at affordable prices, where it is most needed.</p><p>In addition, there are currently two house purchase loan offerings available to lower income first time buyers from local authorities.</p><p>The first is a standard annuity mortgage available from all local authorities.  A first time buyer unable to get a loan from a building society or a bank, may be eligible for a mortgage from the local authority concerned to purchase a new or second hand property or build their own home.  The loan can be up to 97% of the price of the house subject to a maximum loan of &euro;200,000.  A local authority mortgage is an annuity mortgage with variable interest rates so repayments will go up and down in line with interest rate changes.  The relevant terms and conditions applying to local authority housing loans are set out in the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2012.  Key eligibility criteria provide that a loan applicant must be a first time buyer and must be able to show their local authority that they cannot get a loan from a bank or building society.  Also, the gross income (before tax) of a single income household in the previous year must be &euro;50,000 or less and the combined gross income (before tax) of a two income household in the previous year must be &euro;75,000 or less.  Prospective applicants should contact their relevant local authority for further information.</p><p>The second option is the Home Choice Loan, a Government backed mortgage for first time buyers.  The relevant terms and conditions applying to the Home Choice Loan are set out in the Housing (Home Choice Loan) Regulations 2009.  First time buyers can apply for a Home Choice Loan to purchase a new or second hand property or build their own home.  Home Choice Loan provides up to 92% of the market value of a property purchased, subject to a maximum loan amount of &euro;285,000.  The loan is a normal capital and interest bearing mortgage which is repaid on a monthly basis.  Home Choice Loan offers one variable interest rate.  The rate is currently set at 3.25% variable, APR 3.30%.  Further information is available at . </p><p>To support local authorities in operating their housing loan schemes in a consistent and efficient manner, the Housing Agency provides a central underwriting service to local authorities.  The credit underwriting process considers the impact that family circumstances may have on the loan applicant&rsquo;s capacity to make loan repayments.  The final decision on loan approval is a matter for the relevant local authority and its credit committee on a case-by-case basis and in accordance with the relevant statutory Credit Policy that underpins the scheme and aims to ensure prudent lending.</p></reply>

HAP is now available to all qualified households in 19 local authority areas, with over 15, 5 00 households currently being supported by the scheme and over 10,000 separate landlords and agents providing accommodation to those households.  HAP will be available from 1 December 2016 in the following nine further local authorities - Cavan, Kerry, Laois, Leitrim, Longford, Roscommon, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow.  A breakdown of the number of households supported by HAP in each local authority area at the end of Quarter 3, 2016 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:.</p><p>The flexibility of HAP as a form of social housing support is one of the scheme&rsquo;s key elements and an important benefit envisaged for many households with a housing need.  The movement of households, including movement between local authority areas, for the purposes of employment, further education or other reasonable reasons is facilitated for households under the scheme, while retaining HAP support.  The movement of HAP approved households between neighbouring local authority areas has been facilitated to date in a small number of cases.  However, the phased implementation of the HAP pilot scheme has afforded my Department opportunity for learning and it is in this context that the need for greater ease in the provision of flexibility of movement of HAP households between local authority areas has been identified.

Proposals for individual solar farm developments are subject to the statutory requirements of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, in the same manner as other proposed developments.  Planning applications are made to the relevant local planning authority with a right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, each planning authority&rsquo;s development plan must set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned. Section 10 of the Act requires a development plan to include, inter alia, objectives for the provision or facilitation of the provision of infrastructure, including energy facilities and many local authorities have developed renewable energy strategies for their areas in this context. </p>  <p>  In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities and the Board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the development plan, any submissions or observations received and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any relevant guidelines issued by my Department.  Planning authorities must then make their own decision based on the specific merits or otherwise of individual planning applications.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the planning code is sufficiently robust to facilitate the assessment of individual planning permission applications for solar farm developments.  However, the matter will be kept under review, in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, and his Department - which leads on renewable energy policy - in the context of the Government&rsquo;s White Paper on Energy Policy, entitled Ireland&rsquo;s Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future, which was published in December 2015, the development of a Renewable Electricity Policy and Development Framework and the launching of a new subsidy support scheme for renewable electricity by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, expected in late 2017.</p></reply>

The NPPR Charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence.  The self-assessed charge is set at &euro;200 per annum and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.  It is a matter for an owner to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge and any late payment fees applicable.  Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect Non-Principal Private Residence Charges, and late payment fees due to it and all Charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned.  Section 6 of the 2009 Act, as amended, provides that the owner of a liable property who fails to pay the Charge, in addition to him or her being liable to pay the Charge, is liable to pay to the relevant local authority a &euro;20 late payment fee in respect of each month or part of a month in which the Charge, any late payment fee, or any part of such Charge or fee, remains unpaid.</p><p>Part 12 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 also deals with the collection of undischarged liabilities relating to the NPPR Charge.  The Act provided for a period from 2 March 2014 to 31 August 2014 during which time no new late penalties were applied to existing liabilities.  If payment was not made in full or if settlement terms were not agreed by the end of that period, an additional late payment fee of &euro;120 per liability date applied on 1 September 2014.  As the Charge applied in each of the years from 2009 to 2013, there were five liability dates - 31 July 2009 and 31 March for each of the years 2010 to 2013.  In addition to this late payment fee to be applied per liability date, the entire NPPR liability is then increased by a factor of 50% and frozen; the legislation does not provide for further penalties to apply after this date.</p><p>The table outlines the liabilities of property owners who have not discharged their NPPR Charge.  No additional late payment fees apply in subsequent years as the liability is frozen as of 1 September 2014.<table><tr><th>Liability Year </th><th>Liability if Payment was made on or before 31 August 2014 </th><th>Additional Late Payment Fee post 31 August 2014 </th><th>Liability if Payment made on or after 1 September 2014 </th></tr><tr><td>2009 </td><td>&euro;1,260 </td><td>&euro;810 </td><td>&euro;2,070 </td></tr><tr><td>2010 </td><td>&euro;1,100 </td><td>&euro;730 </td><td>&euro;1,830 </td></tr><tr><td>2011 </td><td>&euro;860 </td><td>&euro;610 </td><td>&euro;1,470 </td></tr><tr><td>2012 </td><td>&euro;620 </td><td>&euro;490 </td><td>&euro;1,110 </td></tr><tr><td>2013 </td><td>&euro;380 </td><td>&euro;370 </td><td>&euro;750 </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>&euro;4,220 </td><td>&euro;3 , 010 </td><td>&euro;7,230 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Regulations specify requirements in relation to a range of matters, such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, natural light and safety of gas and electrical supply.  With very limited exemptions, these regulations apply to local authority and voluntary housing units as well as private rented residential accommodation.  To ensure that the standards reflect the requirements of a modern rental market, a review of the Standards Regulations has been initiated.  The review is at an advanced stage with new regulations currently being finalised.</p>  <p>  Pillar 4 of Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, which deals with the Rental Sector, commits to developing a comprehensive strategy for the sector in Q4 2016.  The strategy will be structured around 4 key areas: security, standards, supply and services.  In terms of supply, the strategy will focus on maintaining existing levels of rental stock and encouraging investment in additional supply.  All the main issues that affect the availability of dwellings in the rental market, including the issue of short-term lettings, will be considered during the development of the strategy, which will be informed by submissions received from the recent public consultation process that concluded on 7 November.  The overarching objective of the strategy will be to increase supply and support the development of a stable, strong and viable rental sector offering true choice for households, investment opportunities for providers and reflecting the rights and responsibilities of tenants and landlords.</p>  <p>  In the context of the recent determination by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in relation to the exclusive use of an apartment as a commercial letting through Air BnB, I have asked my Department to examine the decision, which is of course primarily a matter for planning authorities to determine, and consider the appropriate steps, including the provision of statutory planning guidelines, to provide clarity and consistency of approach by all planning authorities in terms of planning requirements for such commercial lettings.  In this regard, I will provide guidance to local authorities by way of circular letter before the end of the year.</p></reply>

In the latter category, local authorities acquire houses that range in condition from those that require minimal refurbishment prior to re-letting, to those that may be largely derelict and require extensive refurbishment and building works.  It is appropriate that local authorities have the scope to acquire all types of second-hand properties, from those that can be made available for early letting to those that require considerable refurbishment.  Given the range of different scenarios that are faced by local authorities when acquiring houses, my Department does not collect statistics on the time they take for refurbishment.

It provides additional opening hours from 8am to 10pm, seven days-per-week, ensuring access to library services for users who cannot avail of them during regular staffed hours.</p><p>On foot of a successful initial trial of the service in Tullamore, Banagher and Tubbercurry libraries from November 2014, it is now planned to roll-out the service across a further 23 pilot library branches from January 2017.  I am satisfied that the learning captured to date justifies extending the pilot phase.  The extended pilot phase will inform and shape the future development and implementation of the service across the broader library network, working through any service delivery issues that might arise in the meantime.</p><p>&lsquo;My Open Library&rsquo; has operated very successfully to date and the data captured by local authorities support this position.  Library usage and number of items borrowed has increased significantly.  In Offaly, for example, some 1,700 people have registered to use the service since January 2015, with a 91% increase in &lsquo;My Open Library&rsquo; use in Tullamore and Banagher so far in 2016.  This equates to almost 20,000 visits during the &lsquo;My Open Library&rsquo; hours.</p><p>Feedback from users has been very positive.  &lsquo;My Open Library&rsquo; has made community spaces and collections available to library members and communities, providing access to commuters, students and families at times when the library would be otherwise unavailable.  Each library is now open to the community for 98 hours per week, an increase from 47 hours and 14 hours per week in Tullamore and Banagher, respectively, since the introduction of the service.</p></reply>

Similar concerns have also been expressed to me by the Association of Irish Local Government. </p>  <p>  In this connection, I wish to outline that, under the proposed new procedures, applications for planning permission in respect of large-scale housing developments will only be considered on lands that have already been zoned for residential development in the relevant city or county development plan, as determined by the elected members in the process of the adoption of the development plan.  This remains a reserved function of the elected members and will not change under the new procedures.   </p>  <p>  Furthermore, it is intended under the proposed new procedures that local authorities will be centrally involved in the pre-application consultation consideration of proposed large-scale housing developments with the developers in question and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  When a planning application in respect of a large-scale housing development is subsequently submitted to the Board, local authorities will be further required to submit a report - including making recommendations indicating their view on whether proposed development should be granted or refused permission - to the Board as part of the proposed new arrangements. </p>  <p>  Taking account of the concerns expressed to date and the respective reserved and executive functions of local elected members and the local authority executive, I have indicated that I am supportive of tabling a Government amendment to the proposed new arrangements so that elected members are informed of any strategic housing developments proposed for their local areas at an early point in the process thereby facilitating them to make submissions on any such proposed developments.  This would enhance the involvement of elected members in the proposed new procedures relating to large scale housing developments, giving them an opportunity to input to the process and to represent the views of their constituents in accordance with their democratic mandate.  I am proposing an amendment to the Bill to this effect at Report Stage in the Seanad later today.   </p>  <p>  I will continue to engage with members of both Houses on all provisions of the Bill as it progresses through both Houses so that the measures contained in it are pragmatic and workable, while also ensuring that local authorities and elected members are involved in, and can input to, the proposed new procedures.   </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-29a.754.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112900075#WRT01900"><p>The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) involves a three way contractual relationship between the landlord, the tenant and the housing authority.  There are two types of contractual arrangements which may be entered into between landlords, housing authorities and tenants under the Scheme - one is known as a Tenancy by Tenancy agreement and the other is known as an Availability Agreement.</p>  <p>  Under the Tenancy by Tenancy arrangement a Residential Tenancy agreement is completed by the landlord, the housing authority and the tenant.  In this specific arrangement, there is no on-going availability agreement between the landlord and the housing authority - the arrangement continues to exist for as long as the existing tenant resides in the property.  However, the tenancy contract between the landlord and the tenant is subject to the provisions and protections of the Residential Tenancies Act and can therefore endure for an unrestricted period.  When the tenant leaves the property the contractual relationship between the landlord and the local authority comes to an end.   </p>  <p>  Under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 all tenants who are allocated RAS accommodation after 1 April 2011 are deemed to have their housing need met and will no longer remain on the main social housing waiting list.  However, it is recommended that local authority allocation schemes provide a &ldquo;transfer pathway&rdquo; for RAS tenants, where RAS households can apply to transfer to other forms of social housing support, and many tenants have availed of the transfer option and have moved on to other forms of social housing support.   </p>  <p>  Local authorities apply the same differential rent scheme to all of their tenants regardless of whether the property provided is owned by the local authority, or secured for social housing use under other arrangements such as a long term lease or rental accommodation agreements.  When a tenant&rsquo;s income increases due to increased level of employment, including full-time employment, their differential rent will increase in accordance with the local authority&rsquo;s rent scheme.  While differential rent can exceed market rent for high income households under some local authorities&rsquo; rent schemes, an increase in a tenant&rsquo;s income has no direct effect on their tenancy arrangement.  In such a case, it is open to the tenant to leave local authority housing and find alternative housing in the private market; however, this is a matter for the tenant and they are under no onus to do so. </p>  <p>  Similarly, when a RAS tenancy ends and the landlord does not wish to renew the tenancy agreement, the household remains a local authority tenant and the onus is on the local authority to find alternative accommodation for them.   </p></reply>

Section 2(3) of the Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2007, specifically provided that: </p>  <p>  &ldquo;The Minister shall not be, or be deemed to be, an employer, within the meaning of the Terms of Employment (Information) Acts 1994 and 2001, by virtue of the provision of funding to a person or persons under any scheme&rdquo;.  Each funding Department is responsible for its funding and contractual arrangements with the Local Development Companies (LDCs).  </p>  <p>  However, the Government recognises that, like all other sectors of our economy, the community and voluntary sector has had to deal with reduced funding and financial shortages in recent years and issues have arisen around the capacity of the sector to pay enhanced redundancy payments.   </p>  <p>  Having considered the outcome of the competitive process for the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP), and the resulting impact for a number of LDCs who failed to secure SICAP contracts, it was agreed in 2015 that, as part of the closing arrangement for LCDP, provision would be made to allow for certain redundancy costs to be charged to LCDP funding, from within the voted Programme allocation, subject to written agreement to the limits of spend.  Sixty Six employees, equating to 52 full time equivalent employees, benefitted from this approach.   </p>  <p>  Separately, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform provided limited funding to my Department&rsquo;s vote in 2014, 2015 and 2016 for a redundancy scheme to compensate certain former community workers who lost their jobs as a result of reductions in programme funding from 2009.  My Department understands that the employers involved fulfilled their statutory redundancy obligations to the employees concerned.  Some of the employees in question subsequently made claims for enhanced redundancy payments through the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court and non-binding Labour Court recommendations, to provide additional benefits, were made in certain cases.</p>  <p>  My Department has received comprehensive legal advice in relation to the establishment of the enhanced redundancy scheme subsequently proposed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It has been in the context of the legal issues identified that discussions between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office have taken place.  Consideration of the matter will be finalised in light of the outcome of these consultations.</p></reply>

The 2016 Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes of &euro;2.8 billion. </p><p>It is accepted that periods of unemployment are a normal feature of the acting and artistic professions and people in these professions can qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment when they are unemployed.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s payments compensate for periods of involuntary unemployment only and it is not the function of my Department to provide income support through the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes to any group, including artists during periods of unemployment, which are voluntary.  </p><p>For this reason, social welfare legislation provides that all jobseekers must satisfy certain qualifying conditions in order to be entitled to an unemployment payment including, being available for full-time work and be genuinely seeking work.  All unemployed persons should avail of reasonable employment opportunities and artists are treated no differently to any other unemployed person.  </p><p>The jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme can provide income support to artists.  For instance artists including self-employed artists who satisfy the scheme&rsquo;s conditionality and the means test can qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment.  Artists who are working part time and are categorised as casual jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients or those who are self-employed and in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance are not currently activated by my Department. </p><p>I have had discussions with my colleague the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in relation to supports for working artists and on foot of these our respective officials are in further discussions.  The Arts Council, of course, is the main mechanism, through which the Government directs funding to the arts and to artists and the 8% increase in its annual budget will allow the Council to enhance support to artists and arts organisations around the country on both a small and large scale, from locally-based groups to the Abbey Theatre.</p><p>It should be noted that in Budget 2017 funding increases across the arts and cultural bodies under the remit of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs were announced including:</p><p>- an extra &euro;5m for the Arts Council - an 8% increase;</p><p>- &euro;2m extra for the Film Board;</p><p>- an extra &euro;1m for Culture Ireland;</p><p>- an additional allocation of &euro;3.5m for the national cultural institutions; and</p><p>- a new funding stream of &euro;5m for the implementation of a Culture 2025/Ireland 2016 Legacy Programme.</p><p>All of this represents real and substantial funding increases across the arts and cultural area and has been welcomed across the sector.  It also re-affirms the commitment of this Government to progressively increase funding for the arts as the economy improves, as set out in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government.</i>These increases will have a positive and distinct impact on arts and cultural provision around the country, especially for artists and other creative workers.</p></reply>

The BTEA scheme is aligned with the student support schemes under the Department of Education and Skills.  The Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) grant payable by the Department of Education and Skills represents the primary support for persons pursuing education.  In general, most BTEA customers pursuing full-time course will also have certain registration and related college fees paid by SUSI.</p>  <p>  The Part-Time Education Option (PTEO) allows a jobseeker to retain their Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance or Benefit and attend a part-time day or evening course of education or training.  The participant must continue to meet the conditions for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance or Benefit.  This means that they must be able to show they are actively looking for and willing to take up work and that the course is likely to improve their chances of getting employment.  If work is offered while on the course they will be expected to accept the job offer.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection does not pay any course fees or relocation costs for full-time or part-time studies.</p>  <p>  One of the measures announced in Budget 2017 is a new &euro;500 annual Cost of Education Allowance to be made available to full time Back to Education Allowance participants with children.  This allowance will incentivise people with children to participate in full time second and third level education and is in line with the Programme for Government commitment to support low-income families.

The report is an output of the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s and the Economic and Social Research Institute&rsquo;s research programme on monitoring poverty trends.</p>  <p>  The briefing states that comprehensive measures such as adequate income support, inclusive labour markets and access to quality services are needed to address the complexity of the challenges facing such vulnerable groups.  It adds that previous research has shown that social transfers are effective at reducing poverty in Ireland and that there may be limited scope for further improvement in this area.  The briefing does not propose the introduction of a cost of disability or identify it as a measure to address consistent poverty.  Rather, the briefing identifies the need for broader integrated actions and interventions such as those outlined in the updated National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.</p>  <p>  The primary role of the social protection system centres on providing income support and assistance with taking up employment where this is appropriate; it is not the function of the income support system to address the additional costs associated with a disability.  Accordingly, I have no plans to establish a cost of disability payment within the social protection system.  </p>  <p>  In any event, people with disabilities are not a homogeneous group and as such would have widely differing needs with the result that  the extra costs of disability would not therefore arise to the same extent in all cases.  There is no single comprehensive payment available in respect of the additional costs of disability.  However, some of these additional costs are addressed across schemes provided by a number of agencies such as the health service and also the Revenue Commissioners through certain tax reliefs and other supports.  </p>  <p>  I hope that clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Deputies on all sides of the House are fully aware of the positive benefits derived from schemes like the Rural Social Scheme.  While communities benefit from the skills and talents of local farmers and fishermen, participants also have the opportunity to improve existing skills, or develop new skills, while performing valuable work in their local communities.  Community groups have benefitted from the many projects undertaken through the scheme with minimal cost to the Exchequer.  The scheme has also played an important role in sustaining rural communities.</p>  <p>  As part of the social welfare budget package for 2017, I announced an increase of &euro;5 a week in the personal rate of payment for rural social scheme (RSS) participants from March 2017.  I also announced an additional 500 places on the scheme to be rolled out in 2017.  This will increase the overall number of places to 3,100.  My Department intends allocating these places as early as possible in 2017, taking into account a number of factors.  These include the number of places already allocated, the demand for places in particular areas, work opportunities available and the numbers of farmers and fishermen and women in receipt of income support.</p>  <p>  Eligibility for participation on the scheme will continue to remain limited to those in receipt of certain specified social welfare payments and all participants must be also actively engaged in farming or fishing.  In future, all new entrants to the RSS will have to be over 25 years of age and, in addition, a 6 year overall participation limit will be introduced on the scheme.  This will ensure that there will be a throughput of places available and that younger people will have an opportunity to explore other training or education options before a long term work programme.  Almost 50% of the current participants have been on the RSS for over 10 years.  </p>  <p>  It is proposed to allow the existing cohort of RSS participants to remain on the scheme as long as they continue to satisfy the eligibility conditions of the scheme and the new conditions outlined above will only apply to new RSS entrants. </p>  <p>  The rate of RSS payment is currently linked to the participant&rsquo;s primary social protection payment with a minimum weekly rate of &euro;210.50 increasing to &euro;215.50 from March 2017.  Participants may receive extra allowances in respect of qualified adult dependent and qualified child dependents.  It is proposed to continue to pay RSS participants in this manner.</p></reply>

The new service has been available since 28th July 2016, replacing an older site that enabled jobseekers to search for job opportunities based on job type and location, but did not facilitate employers to search for suitable jobseekers on the site &ndash; they had to rely on candidates finding and applying for a job from among the many thousands hosted on the system.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the Department commissioned the development and implementation of a new service that would enable both employers and jobseekers to search for each other using competencies and skill sets as well as the traditional job-type classifications.  As part of the new service, candidate profiles will be automatically matched to job specifications posted by employers with both candidate and the employer notified when a suitable match is found. Candidates can also use the site to apply for the jobs advertised.  The system will also integrate with the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s Intreo service and will include other new features such as allowing jobseekers to post CVs and video profiles if they wish.</p>  <p>  The service is being implemented on phased basis which means, unfortunately, that there is some service disruption while work is ongoing.  There have also been some teething problems with the first phase implementation, but the Department is working with the supplier to resolve these and improve and add new functionality over the coming weeks and months.</p>  <p>  A significant upgrade was implemented on the weekend of 26/27 November.  This upgrade has resolved many of the teething issues and is now expected that service performance will improve markedly.</p>  <p>  Employers or any person experiencing difficulties with the website can contact the Department&rsquo;s National Contact Centre on 1890 800 024 for assistance.

These supports include the JobPath service and employment programmes such as the Community Employment (CE) scheme.</p><p>The JobPath service is provided for jobseekers only, whereas CE schemes provide part time temporary work in communities for people in receipt of a range of social welfare payments including jobseekers.</p><p>JobPath aims to place people into full-time sustainable employment.  The period of engagement with the service for any individual is typically 52 weeks.  During that time they receive intensive individual support to help them to overcome barriers to employment.  During the year if a person is placed into a job they will continue to receive support for at least three months and up to an additional twelve months while in employment.</p><p>CE schemes are a stepping stone back to employment but are not full time sustainable jobs.  People who have completed their year long engagement with JobPath may, if eligible, apply to partake in a CE Scheme after they have been assessed by a departmental case officer.</p><p>In general, people are not allowed participate in two separate schemes at the same time.  Given the need to manage the allocation of places to all schemes in an effective manner, the Department does not facilitate or encourage jobseekers to leave one scheme early in order to take up a place on another. </p><p>The welcome reduction in the unemployment rate to 7.5% (Oct 2016), which has fallen from a peak of 15% (Feb 2012) is a factor in recruitment to all programmes never the less despite this reduction, the table below shows the number of people on CE schemes is relatively stable.  In addition, as participation on JobPath is limited in most cases to 12 months, people on JobPath are becoming available to other schemes as their period of engagement with JobPath comes to an end.</p><p><b>Number of CE participants and supervisors: for the period 2015 and 2016:</b><table><tr><th></th><th>CE Participants  </th><th>CE supervisors</th></tr><tr><td>Oct 2015</td><td>22,488</td><td>1,388</td></tr><tr><td>Oct 2016</td><td>22,040</td><td>1,387</td></tr></table></p><p>It should be noted that CE Schemes are not restricted to those in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  If there is a CE scheme experiencing particular difficulties in recruitment, the sponsor should contact their local DSP office so that the matter can be reviewed.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The programme will bring participants with a disability who are not ready for work without further assistance, closer to the labour market through engagement in training and personal development activities.  Its focus will be on young people with disabilities (aged 16 &ndash; 26) who require that additional help to assist in their transition from school to post-school life.  It is envisaged that the programme will support community and voluntary groups to deliver a range of activities such as the development of participant&rsquo;s soft skills, (for example using public transport independently), work preparation, placements and sampling that are designed to assist people with disabilities to obtain and sustain employment.</p>  <p>  The operational arrangements of this programme are currently being assessed and will take into account the recommendations of a working group established under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy chaired by the NDA and comprising of the Departments of Education and Skills, Health and Social Protection, together with the HSE.  The group was established to develop an effective co-ordinated policy approach and interdepartmental protocols to assist individuals with disabilities, including those who require a high level of support, to obtain and retain employment.  This working group is due to report by the end of the year and this will assist in determining decisions relating to the provision of services of this nature at a national level.</p></reply>

This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, paternity benefit and adoptive benefit.  In line with the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to support entrepreneurship, I announced, in Budget 2017, the extension of cover for invalidity pension to the self-employed on the same basis as employees, with effect from December 2017.  Gaining access to invalidity pension will provide the self-employed with a much stronger safety net to protect them in the event of long-term incapacity for work.</p><p>  I also announced that the self-employed will have access to the treatment benefit scheme which provides partial dental, optical and aural services to qualified people, from March 2017.  Treatment benefit entitlements will be extended further from October 2017 for both the self-employed and employees through the provision of additional dental and optical benefits.  There will be no change in the PRSI contribution rate payable by the self-employed in 2017.</p><p>  In 2017, my Department will carry out detailed work to establish how to provide a better safety net for self-employed workers who become unemployed.</p><p>  Payment of contributions by the self-employed on a voluntary basis for benefits for which they are not covered for was examined by the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare.  In their report published in 2013, the Group concluded that extension on a voluntary basis, through either an &lsquo;opt in&rsquo; or &lsquo;opt out&rsquo; basis, could lead to the selection of bad risks and would undermine the social solidarity and contributory principles that underline the social insurance system.  This recommendation will be further considered in the examination to be conducted by the Department.  The outcome will be considered in a Budgetary context.</p></reply>

The application of a three-day waiting period avoids the disproportionately high administrative costs involved in processing large numbers of claims of a very short duration.  The waiting day rule is not applied in every case.  For instance, a &ldquo;period of interruption of employment&rdquo; exists where a person is unemployed or sick for any three days (consecutive or not) within six days.  Where a person is subject to intermittent spells of unemployment it would clearly be unreasonable to impose the three waiting days for each such claim.</p>  <p>  Accordingly legislation enables, by means of a "linking rule", the aggregation of spells of unemployment so that the waiting period is confined to the first three days of the aggregate period of interruption of employment.  Specifically, this linking rule provides that any two such periods of unemployment not separated by more than 26 weeks are treated as one such period.  Consequently, where a person makes a repeat claim for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit within 26 weeks of their previous claim, the repeat claim links to the earlier claim and no waiting days apply.</p>  <p>  I would emphasise that people who need financial support are not left without such support during &lsquo;waiting&rsquo; days.  A person who has no other income may claim supplementary welfare allowance in respect of the days in question.</p>  <p>  While schemes and procedures are under continuous review, I have no plans at present to change the waiting days rule in respect of the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes.</p></reply>

In assessing means derived from payments received from non-European Monetary Union (EMU) States, the Department uses the conversion mechanism provided for under Article 107 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 574/72 on Social Security for Migrant Workers.  The exchange rates for converting sterling and other non EMU currencies are published quarterly in the Official Journal of the European Union.  The Department obtains this rate at the beginning of each quarter and uses it in all conversions during the course of that quarter irrespective of whether the value of the currency concerned rises or falls in that period.</p>  <p>  It is open to any person in receipt of a social assistance payment to request that his/her entitlement be reviewed if they wish.  It is important to note, however, that any such review will involve a full reassessment of all of the customer&rsquo;s means to ensure that the person continues to receive the correct payment in line with their overall entitlement and such reviews cannot of their nature just focus on the income derived from the UK.  When conducting such a review, the conversion rate used is that applicable to the date of last increase in the sterling payment of the UK State Pension or the rate applicable in the subsequent quarter if that rate has been published by the date of the decision and is more favourable to the customer.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This practice is unjust and illegal, and in most cases is intended to push the inhabitants from their homes and land in order to give it to Israeli settlers.  This is wholly contrary to the protection that should be afforded a people under military occupation.  Ireland and the EU have consistently opposed and condemned this practice for many years, but regrettably the tempo of evictions and demolitions has continued to increase markedly.</p>  <p>  A growing aspect of this issue is the question of the demolition by Israel of humanitarian relief structures, including tents and water and power structures, funded by the EU or its member States.  The issue of asking for compensation for confiscated or demolished EU assets in Area C of the West Bank is a matter that is currently under discussion at EU level.  Ireland has argued for a stronger response to demolitions and confiscations and, in my view, the EU should request compensation in such instances.  However, not all EU partners are of the same mind.  Agreement on this point has not been reached, but I will continue to advocate for compensation.</p>  <p>  Regarding the publication of the report by the EU Delegation to the West Bank and Gaza on demolitions and confiscations of EU-funded structures in Area C, the standard assumption is that such reports are not published, and they are prepared on this basis.  I have no objection to this specific report being published, if agreed with EU partners.  However, there is extensive information on demolitions and confiscations available through other sources.  </p></reply>

The approach to this case is under continuous review and is informed and shaped by, inter alia, constant coordination and dialogue with Ibrahim&rsquo;s family and his legal representatives, by the experience and expertise of officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, by our consultations with other States who have had citizens in similar situations, and by advice from legal and human rights experts with knowledge of Egypt.  </p>  <p>  I can confirm that the Taoiseach wrote to the President of Egypt on 17 November to convey again the Irish Government&rsquo;s strong concerns about this case, and to reiterate our call for his return to Ireland without delay.  In his letter, the Taoiseach specifically requested that Ibrahim be considered for release under the &lsquo;Youth Amnesty&rsquo; Scheme.  On the same day, I contacted the Egyptian Ambassadors in Ireland and also discussed this issue and request with her. </p>  <p>  Details of this amnesty scheme are opaque.   The official Egyptian Government statement on the 17 November indicates that the 82 beneficiaries of the amnesty had received &lsquo;final judicial verdicts&rsquo; and were being pardoned under Article 155 of the Egyptian Constitution.  </p>  <p>  Article 155 relates to the Presidential Pardon mechanism whereby the President has the power, having consulted with the cabinet, to set aside or mitigate sentences.  Article 155 does not give the President the power to intervene in the judicial process or release prisoners who have not been convicted.</p>  <p>  It is not clear if or how the current youth amnesty scheme may apply to detainees, such as our young Irish citizen, who have not been convicted of any offence.    </p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Cairo is seeking further information and clarification about the operation of this scheme.</p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to engage with this citizen&rsquo;s family and Irish-based lawyers, and has strongly advised them to liaise closely with his Egyptian legal team on this matter and to seek their advice and guidance on how the issue can best be pursued. </p></reply>

Of this, &euro;129.4 million was in voluntary contributions and &euro;8.8 million in assessed contribution.  </p><p>It is not the Government&rsquo;s policy to donate goods in kind to the UN in lieu of part payment of Ireland&rsquo;s assessed contributions.  However, Ireland does pre-position and stockpile humanitarian relief supplies in UN Humanitarian Response Depots (UNHRD) under the Rapid Response Initiative, which is managed by Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  These hubs are strategically located near crisis and disaster-prone areas, in Accra, Brindisi, Dubai, Panama City and Subang, in Malaysia to enable the rapid dispatch of supplies in case of a crisis. </p><p>The relief items stockpiled by Ireland in these hubs have been selected in close consultation with UN and NGO partners, which, distribute them in response to a crisis to those most in need to save and protect lives and alleviate suffering.  They include UN standard-approved items which are most urgently needed by people in humanitarian crises or emergency situations.  These include shelter items, such as family tents, tarpaulins, and rope; basic household items such as blankets, mosquito nets, cooking sets, solar lamps and family hygiene kits; and water and sanitation items such as soap, jerry cans, water tanks, latrine plates and spades.  So far in 2016, we have airlifted over 350 tonnes of Ireland&rsquo;s stockpiled relief supplies into humanitarian crises in Ethiopia, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Niger, Nigeria, Iraq, and most recently in response to Hurricane Matthew in Haiti.</p><p>As well as storing the items in Depots, the UNHRD procures the relief items through a competitive tendering process which is regulated by the World Food Programme (WFP).  The Government&rsquo;s policy for international development, <i>One World One Future, </i>reaffirms our commitment to providing &ldquo;aid that is not conditional on procurement of goods and services from Ireland&rdquo;<i>.</i>Ireland&rsquo;s aid to developing countries is untied and our continued long term commitment to untied aid remains firm.  I would strongly encourage all Irish manufacturers of humanitarian relief supplies to apply to become registered suppliers to the WFP Registered Supplier Roster and to register through the United Nations Global Marketplace.</p></reply>

It formerly operated within the auspices of the Office of the Attorney General and is now contained within the Government Reform Unit of my Department.  Its purpose is to modernise and simplify the Statute book by removing spent and obsolete pieces of legislation, thereby reducing its size and thus making it more understandable and accessible to those who use it.There has been a particular need for such revision in Ireland because our unique legislative past has left us with a complex stock of legislation, with enactments from the Parliaments of Ireland, England, Great Britain and the United Kingdom as well as our own Oireachtas.</p><p>To date, the Oireachtas has passed five Statute Law Revision Acts as follows:</p><p>- The Statute Law Revision (Pre-1922) Act 2005, which repealed a selection of pre-1922 statutes;</p><p>- The Statute Law Revision Act 2007, which was a comprehensive revision of pre-1922 Public General Acts;</p><p>- The Statute Law Revision Act 2009, which revised all Private Acts up to and including 1750 and all Local and Personal Acts up to and including 1850;</p><p>- The Statute Law Revision Act 2012, which revised all Private Acts from 1750 to 1922 and all Local and Personal Acts from 1850 to 1922; and</p><p>- The Statute Law Revision Act 2015, which revoked Secondary Instruments made before 1 January 1821.</p><p>A sixth Statute Law Revision Bill, covering primary legislation enacted between 1922 and 1950, is currently progressing through the Houses.</p><p>The progress we have made with the Statute Law Revision Programme has been considerable.  To date, over 60,000 pieces of legislation have been either expressly or implicitly repealed under the programme. Collectively this is the most extensive set of repealing measures in the history of the State and the most extensive set of statute law revision measures ever enacted anywhere in the world.  I propose, however, in view of the progress made, to pause the Statute Law Revision Programme at this time in order that my Department can progress other priorities.</p></reply>

The cost of these changes is estimated at about &euro;90 million on a full-year basis from 2018.</p><p>As we move beyond FEMPI and PSPR restoration towards more normal pay and pension setting conditions in the public service, the issue of how to adjust the post-award value of public service pensions through appropriate pay or other linkages will be considered by Government.</p></reply>

PRD applies to the pay, including any non-pensionable pay elements, of pensionable public servants. Specifically, section 2(1)(b) of the Act provides that any public servant who is a member of a public service pension scheme or who is entitled to benefit under such a scheme or receives a payment in lieu of membership of such a scheme is subject to PRD. PRD is applied equally across all public servants liable to the deduction irrespective of the individual pension terms that apply to those public servants.</p>  <p>  I understand from my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government that retained firefighters have historically qualified on retirement for a one-off, non-recurring gratuity calculated at one eighth of their annual retainer payment multiplied by the number of years of actual service, up to a maximum of four times the annual retainer.  To qualify for the gratuity, a retained firefighter must have a minimum of two years' service.  The maximum gratuity payable is four times the annual retainer and retained firefighters do not pay any contribution to that gratuity.</p>  <p>  Retained firefighters in place in 2008 and those hired thereafter until the end of 2012 were given the option of joining the Local Government Superannuation Scheme and receiving a pension and retirement lump sum based on their pensionable remuneration and length of service. All retained firefighters appointed after 1 January 2013 must join the Single Public Service Pension Scheme. </p>  <p>  The payment of the one-off gratuity at retirement to those retained firefighters who are not members of the Local Government Superannuation Scheme or the Single Public Service Pension Scheme constitutes a payment in lieu of pension scheme membership of the pension scheme and, as such, gives rise in principle to PRD exposure.</p>  <p>  A gratuity arrangement of this kind, by way of payment in lieu of pension, is not unique to retained firefighters.  It should also be noted that a significant amelioration of PRD is provided for under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2015. This amelioration means that, from 1 January 2016, all persons with annual public service earnings of up to &euro;26,083 are exempt from PRD, and from 1 January 2017, this exemption threshold will rise to &euro;28,750.</p></reply>

A minority of pensionable public servants may be employed in two public service posts simultaneously, for example holders of two part-time jobs in teaching or in the health sector.  In any such case, it is fair and reasonable that the combined pay from both employments is subjected to PRD on a basis which gives a monetary outcome equal to what would arise if the person received the same pay from just a single post.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that all PRD-impacted public servant persons are benefitting from a significant PRD amelioration provided for under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2015.

A key consideration in this process has been to ensure that any additional flows released out of Lough Allen, which would be required to draw levels in the Lough down to a lower level, must not cause flooding downstream of Lough Allen.</p><p>A protocol has been developed and is currently being finalised for the operation of the Bellantra Sluices at the outlet of Lough Allen to reduce the levels in the Lough over this winter.</p><p>I am happy to say that the testing of the new regime has already begun, and the levels in the Lough were reduced to the new, lower minimum level in October this year, with releases having been made since then as and when possible to try and maintain this level.</p><p>While the impact of this initiative may be quite small, this demonstrates the continued commitment of the agencies to work in a coordinated way to explore all measures that may benefit the communities along the River Shannon.</p></reply>

These include recommendations in relation to the renewal of the post office network, the development of a basic payment account, the provision of motor tax services, and the creation of hubs around which local economic and social activity could revolve.  The report also recommended that An Post should, following appropriate consultation with postmasters and others, review and amend the five-year strategy for the post office network.</p><p>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>commits to acting on the recommendations in the report of the Post Office Network Business Development Group.  A number of Working Groups have been established to progress the recommendations, including through the establishment of a Network Renewal Implementation Group, which is being independently chaired by Mr Bobby Kerr.  This Group is examining the number and spatial distribution of post offices, branch modernisation, the streamlining of products and services, postmaster payments and contracts, and training and qualifications for post office employees.  I anticipate that this work will conclude in the next couple of weeks.</p><p>I have separately established the Post Office Hub Working Group to identify potential models under which the post offices could act as community hubs, especially in rural areas.  I have chaired a number of meetings of this group since July.  The Group has concluded its deliberations and is currently finalising its report.  In addition, my officials have been examining the potential for the post offices to deliver other services, including motor tax and financial services. </p><p>I intend to report to Government on these matters in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Indeed, I was particularly pleased to participate with the Taoiseach and Minister Bruton at the launch on 28 October last in An Cheathr&uacute; Rua of the new <i>Policy on Gaeltacht Education</i>, which sets out how the education system will contribute to supporting and promoting the future use of Irish as a living indigenous language in the Gaeltacht.

As stated in these replies, by way of supporting the maintenance and development of the Irish language as a community and household language in the Gaeltacht, the implementation of the <i>20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 </i>is recognised as a key priority in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>.  Other measures outlined in the Programme include: - a focus on job creation in the Gaeltacht, through &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta;</p><p>- encouraging the attendance by children in Irish-medium pre-schools or na&iacute;onra&iacute; in Gaeltacht areas;</p><p>- recognising the importance of the status of Irish as a full working language of the EU institutions and working towards ending the derogation, as circumstances allow; and </p><p>- increasing the investment in the Irish language.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that my Department, together with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, administers a range of schemes, programmes and initiatives targeting language and economic development in Gaeltacht areas.  Further details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.ahrrga.gov.ie</i>and on the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta website at <i>www.udaras.ie </i></p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that in order to further underpin the implementation of the 20-Year Strategy and the language planning process, as set out in Acht na Gaeltachta 2012, a specific allocation of &euro;1m was provided in the current year.  As announced in Budget 2017, this allocation is being increased to &euro;1.25m for next year and will further enable my Department, acting in co-operation with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and relevant stakeholders at community level, to implement a range of specific and practical measures aimed at both supporting the implementation of the Strategy, as well as the language planning process in Gaeltacht areas. </p><p>In relation to the economic development of the Gaeltacht, as Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht, I very much appreciate the importance of job creation in helping to retain sustainable communities in Gaeltacht areas.  In that context, I wish to acknowledge the very important enterprise and employment function of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta as the regional economic agency for the Gaeltacht.  In its regional enterprise role in the Gaeltacht, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland and the IDA, will continue to work towards attracting investment to the Gaeltacht, in addition to supporting micro-enterprises and developing the skills base in the Gaeltacht.  In order to enable &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to fulfil its job creation and job retention role in the Gaeltacht, an overall allocation of capital funding totalling &euro;6.687m has been provided by the Exchequer to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s in 2016, in addition to its own resources from the sale of assets and investments.  I have also secured &euro;2.4m in additional capital for an t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s in 2016.  This additional funding will allow an t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s to progress a number of capital projects on hand, thereby protecting existing jobs and assisting in the creation of new jobs in the Gaeltacht.  In addition, as announced in Budget 2017, an increased capital funding baseline of &euro;6.687m will be provided by the Exchequer to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s in 2017.</p></reply>

In this regard, I secured significant additional funding for the Arts Council as part of Budget 2017.  This will see an increase in the Arts Council allocation in 2017 of &euro;5m, or 8%, and will assist the Council in implementing its 10-year strategy <i>Making Great Art Work</i>(2016-2025).  This strategy places specific emphasis on the need to plan and provide for children and young people.  The 5 high-level values of the strategy include a commitment to excellence, as well as respect for diversity of artistic practice, of public engagement, and of social and cultural traditions.  The strategy also commits to working to achieve full implementation of the <i>Arts in Education Charter</i>.  The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government </i>committed to the publication of <i>Culture 2025</i>as a priority and the draft framework policy <i>Culture 2025/&Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach</i>was forwarded to the Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in July. </p><p>The <i>Culture 2025/&Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach </i>framework policy sets out:</p><p>- a series of high-level objectives under the heading of <i>Enrich, Engage, Participate</i>to establish Government vision in relation to culture and society in Ireland;</p><p>- a set of key values including the intrinsic value of culture, the right to participate in the cultural life of the nation, and the role of culture in fostering a more sustainable future in Ireland; and</p><p>- a series of priority measures for implementation across Government and public bodies.</p><p>I understand that the Committee is currently preparing a report on the draft framework policy, which I look forward to receiving.</p><p>In the meantime, I believe that it is important to continue momentum in terms of delivery of the priorities set out in the framework policy and to build on the positive legacy of the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme. </p><p>My Department has, therefore, been developing a cross-Government initiative to mainstream culture and creativity in the life of the nation and to promote individual, community and national wellbeing.

In this regard, my Department provides significant support for arts and film through the Arts Council and the Irish Film Board, as well as through its capital supports for the development of arts and cultural infrastructure.  I am keenly aware of the potential of the creative sector to contribute to sustainable jobs growth and my Department continues to work with other Departments, in particular with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, across a range of areas as set out in the Action Plan for Jobs.  Much of this work responds to relevant issues identified in the report referred to, particularly in relation to the audio-visual sector and maximising the contribution of this sector to the Irish economy.  Earlier this month, I announced the commissioning of an economic analysis of our screen- based creative industries.  This study will examine the economic impact and potential of the Irish film, TV and animation sector.  A steering group led by my Department, with representatives of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Irish Film Board and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland will liaise with the consultants on this project.  This economic analysis will consider the scale and economic contribution of the screen-based creative industries and examine its potential to expand further.  The study, when complete, will help to inform Government strategies and initiatives as we seek to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a home of creative talent.</p><p>The creative industries are of significant relevance in the development of Ireland's first national cultural policy<i>. </i>The draft framework policy <i>&Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach/Culture 2025 </i>was forwarded to the Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in July.</p><p>I believe that it is important to continue momentum in terms of delivery of the priorities set out in the framework policy and to build on the positive legacy of the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme.

Its statutory remit is to assist and encourage the making of film in the State and the development of a film industry in Ireland.<font color="#333333"> </font>In Budget 2017, I secured an increase of &euro;2 million for the Irish Film Board, representing a 14% increase in its annual budget.  This increase in funding will allow the Board to invest more in Irish talent in the year ahead and it follows on from a very successful year for the Irish film sector, particularly the indigenous film sector, in 2016.  The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>contains a very important commitment to work to progressively increase funding to the arts, including the Arts Council and the Irish Film Board, as the economy continues to improve.</p><p>In addition to the funding provided to the industry by the Irish Film Board, section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides tax relief towards the making of film in Ireland.  The twin approach of direct funding and tax expenditure measures maximises the benefits of Government&rsquo;s support to the audiovisual industry.</p><p>The Irish Film Board also supports the Irish screen industries at major international markets and festivals, promotes inward investment, promotes the use of Ireland as a location for international production and provides support for companies filming in Ireland.  The Board liaises with IDA Ireland and Tourism Ireland to maximise joint opportunities for promotion of Ireland as a location for film productions.

The scheme is currently operated on the basis of three grant rounds per year.  Applications are considered in relation to all forms of the arts as defined in the Arts Act 2003.  The following basic eligibility requirements apply:</p><p>1. Applicant must be in respect of an Irish (or based in Ireland) professional artist or arts organisation;</p><p>2. The application must relate to the international presentation of non-commercial work;</p><p>3. The work to be presented must be an art form defined under the Arts Act 2003; and</p><p>4. The event must be accessible to an open public audience.</p><p>All applications are initially examined by the staff of my Department with responsibility for operating the Culture Ireland Programme to determine whether they meet the above eligibility criteria.  Applications which meet the eligibility requirements are then commented upon by independent external experts in various art forms, drawn from a panel established on the basis of a recommendation by the Culture Ireland Expert Advisory Group (EAC) in 2014.  The panellists act as an aid to the EAC, which is comprised of arts interests and representatives of relevant State bodies (see www.cultureireland.ie/about for details of the membership).  The panellists&rsquo; input ensures that there is specialist expertise in different art forms available as applications are being evaluated in line with the relevant criteria, which are set out as follows:</p><p>1. Artistic quality of work and track record of artist/company;</p><p>2. Profile of international venue/festival;</p><p>3. Financial and operational viability of the event (including artists' fees and level of support from presenter/venue/other partners);</p><p>4. Proven capacity of applicant to present work internationally; and</p><p>5. Wider promotional and media impact.</p><p>The Embassy network is also invited to give its views in relation to the local venue and promoter and whether there might be wider benefits for Ireland arising from a proposed event. </p><p>Taking account of Embassy and expert panel views, geographic priorities and strategic impact, recommendations on funding are submitted for consideration by the EAC, which in turn submits its recommendations for Ministerial approval. </p><p>In the 2016 summer round, 124 applications were received seeking funding in the amount of &euro;1.4m.  A total award of &euro;626,000 was made to support 86 applicants, of which 45 had previously been awarded funding.  The projects, which include artists and companies presenting circus, dance, film, literature, music, theatre and the visual arts, will enable Irish artists to showcase and export their work to over 28 different countries around the globe.  Through this support, increasing numbers of worldwide audiences will experience the strength and diversity of Ireland's artistic excellence and Irish artists will develop relationships with their international counterparts and grow their career both at home and abroad.</p><p>A total of 169 eligible applications were received under the winter 2016 grant round, which is currently under consideration.</p><p>On average, Culture Ireland receives 450 applications annually, of which approximately 55% are successful. Unsuccessful applicants are provided with advice and feedback on their applications on request and officials are available to meet should an applicant wish to discuss an application.  It is, of course, open to applicants who are unsuccessful to make subsequent applications under another grant round.</p></reply>

This may result in discussions with the local coursing clubs and the Irish Coursing Club.  I will be happy to release any reports of these meetings following completion of this process.</p>  <p>  In August this year, my Department issued licences under the Wildlife Acts to the Irish Coursing Club, covering its affiliated coursing clubs, to capture and tag hares for use at regulated hare coursing meetings for the 2016/17 coursing season, which extends from the end of September 2016 to the end of February 2017. </p>  <p>  There are 26 conditions in total associated with the licences issued to the Irish Coursing Club.  These conditions, which have been developed and refined over a number of years, cover a wide range of issues, including prohibition on coursing hares more than once a day or coursing sick or injured hares, the need for adequate escapes for hares during coursing and releasing hares in daylight hours after meetings.</p>  <p>  The muzzling of greyhounds at coursing meetings is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is my understanding that the Irish Coursing Club has implemented mandatory muzzling of greyhounds at regulated coursing meetings since the early 1990s.  The muzzling of greyhounds appears to have proven effective in reducing the number of hare injuries and deaths at coursing meetings.  For example, the percentage of hares released back into the wild after coursing meetings last season was 99.33%.   </p></reply>

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures.  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.  As Minister, I draw on information provided by the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, maintained by my Department, to recommend structures for inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures.  However, the final decision is a reserved function of the planning authority.   </p>  <p>  Under Section 54 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, a planning authority may add to or delete from its Record of Protected Structures, a structure, a specified part of a structure or a specified feature of the attendant grounds of a structure.  Such a structure, specified part of a structure, or specified feature remains on the Record of Protected Structures until such time as the planning authority deletes it.  Provision is made in the Act for the carrying out of works to protected structures either by way of planning permission or on the foot of a declaration received from a planning authority that certain works that would not materially affect the character of a structure are exempted development.  There is a duty of owners and occupiers to protect structures from endangerment.  Where structures become endangered or unauthorised development has been or is being carried out, the planning authority has the powers to take appropriate action.</p>  <p>  There is a number of ways in which my Department acts in respect of possible heritage sites/buildings deemed to be at risk.  One of these is the receipt of applications for funding for the repair, conservation, preservation or safeguarding of protected structures, sites or monuments.  Financial support is being provided by my Department through a number of structured schemes for the conservation and protection of heritage buildings, such as the Structures at Risk Fund and the Built Heritage Investment Scheme.</p>  <p>  I do not consider that any useful purpose would be served by the setting up of a commission to identify buildings at risk.  The management of endangerment is a statutory function already undertaken by planning authorities.  The publication of general lists of structures at risk might, in fact, have the adverse effect of drawing attention to the vulnerability of particular structures, which may be unsecured or inadequately secured and may typically contain valuable historic and artistically important fixtures and features, as well as lead, copper and other metals for which there is an illegal market.   </p></reply>

Waterways Ireland engages in promotion, including marketing and development of the tourism and commercial potential of the inland waterways for which it has responsibility.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has no statutory function in relation to the canals.</p>  <p>  Waterways Ireland works strategically with Tourism Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, sports bodies and associations, and local authorities to actively develop the tourism and economic potential of the inland waterways.  Waterways Ireland is currently working with these and other bodies in developing blueways as a means to attract new visitors to use the waterways and in response to the growth in demand for recreational activities, such as walking, canoeing, cycling and stand-up paddle boarding. </p>  <p>  The Canals Act, 1986, (Bye-laws) 1988 provide for the management of canal and canal property and regulate the use of boats on the Royal Canal, the Grand Canal and the Barrow Navigation.  There is no provision in these bye-laws for house boats or for allowing persons to live on board a vessel. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently progressing, within the Heritage Bill 2016, amendments to the Canals Act 1986 so as to allow for the subsequent making of bye-laws to better regulate boating on the canals and to manage the use of the canals.  The proposed changes to the Canals Act 1986 would introduce a provision for the regulation of the type or class of boats (including its dimensions) that may be used on the canals.  The provisions would also provide for the regulation of berths and moorings on the canals.  This would include house boats.  The proposed changes would allow Waterways Ireland to make new bye-laws to proactively manage the Royal and Grand Canals, as well as the Barrow Navigation.  Following enactment of the legislation, Waterways Ireland would intend to bring forward proposed new bye-laws for consideration.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Grand Canal Basin area, Waterways Ireland, through the Action Plan for Grand Canal Dock and Spencer Dock, is considering opportunities to increase access to Grand Canal Dock and Spencer Dock to reflect their importance as the gateways to the inland waterways network of Ireland.  One of the actions being considered is opening access into Grand Canal Dock from the Grand Canal Dock DART Station on Barrow Street.  This would leave Grand Canal Dock directly accessible by rail, just one stop from Trinity College, which would significantly increase the Dock's potential to attract both residents and visitors from this central location in the city.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that Waterways Ireland will continue to work through a partnership approach with stakeholders, including State bodies, local authorities, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and, most importantly, local communities to create opportunities to increase the use of these valuable public assets.</p></reply>

In recent years, there has also been a decline in Department of Social Protection payments and a reduction in Billpay transactions at post offices.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to working with all stakeholders to find solutions to the sustainability of the post office network in this changed business environment.  The Post Office Network Business Development Group was established in late 2014 to examine the potential for the delivery of additional Government services through the post offices and to identify new business opportunities for the network.  </p>  <p>  The Group published its report in January of this year and, amongst its conclusions, recommended that An Post should review and amend the five-year strategy for the post office network, following appropriate consultation with postmasters and other stakeholders.</p>  <p>  Two further Working Groups were also established this year to progress the wider recommendations of the Business Development Group.  The Post Office Network Implementation Group has been examining issues such as the number and spatial distribution of Post Offices, branch modernisation, the streamlining of products and services, postmaster payments and contracts, and training and qualifications for post office employees.  The Implementation Group is nearing the conclusion of its work and its recommendations will be issued to the Board and management of An Post in the next few weeks.  It will be a matter for An Post, as a commercial State company, to consider these recommendations and to bring their proposals to the appropriate Government Ministers for discussion.</p>  <p>  Separately, I established the Post Office Hub Working Group to identify potential models under which the post offices could act as community hubs, especially in rural areas.  This Group has recently concluded its deliberations and is finalising its report.  In addition, my officials have also been examining the potential for the post offices to deliver other services, including motor tax and financial services. </p>  <p>  I intend to report to Government on these matters in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

This may result in discussions with local coursing clubs and the Irish Coursing Club.  I will be happy to release any reports of these meetings following completion of this process.</p>  <p>  In August this year, my Department issued licences under the Wildlife Acts to the Irish Coursing Club, covering its affiliated coursing clubs, to capture and tag hares for use at regulated hare coursing meetings for the 2016/17 coursing season, which extends from the end of September 2016 to the end of February 2017. </p>  <p>  There are 26 conditions in total associated with the licences issued to the Irish Coursing Club.  These conditions, which have been developed and refined over a number of years, cover a wide range of issues, including prohibition on coursing hares more than once a day or coursing sick or injured hares, the need for adequate escapes for hares during coursing and releasing hares in daylight hours after meetings.</p>  <p>  The muzzling of greyhounds at coursing meetings is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is my understanding that the Irish Coursing Club has implemented mandatory muzzling of greyhounds at regulated coursing meetings since the early 1990s.  The muzzling of greyhounds appears to have proven effective in reducing the number of hare injuries and deaths at coursing meetings.  For example, the percentage of hares released back into the wild after coursing meetings last season was 99.33%.   </p></reply>

In the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage for the county, the related building is rated of &lsquo; <i>national&rsquo;</i>significance.</p><p>In recognition of that significance, conservation works have been undertaken in recent years to the building with public funding support in the region of &euro;2m being channelled through the Heritage Council.  This was directed at the vital re-roofing works necessary to secure the survival of the fabric of the asset.</p><p>I understand that the House in question has now been offered for sale by the owners and that negotiations are underway with interested parties.  As Minister, I have no role in this as it is a commercial matter between the owners of the property and parties interested in the purchase.</p><p>I am also aware of the general risk to the sustainable future of the remaining stock of large Irish Historic Houses, where owners have consistently struggled throughout the last century to find sustainable alternative means of meeting the on-going costs of their maintenance.</p><p>I am prepared to work closely with the owners of such properties and to support them to the extent feasible to allow these properties to remain open to the public.  In February 2015, I approved the establishment of an Irish Historic Houses Committee, with representatives from relevant Government Departments, the Irish Historic Houses Association (a representative body for Historic House owners), F&aacute;ilte Ireland, relevant non-governmental organisations and a number of individual house owners.  My Department has now concluded and published an Action Plan in this regard, which is being implemented in cooperation with the Irish Historic Houses Association.</p><p>As the Deputy can appreciate, the scope for funding for the conservation of the built heritage is currently constrained by the significant reduction in the public finances.  Nonetheless, funding for the protection of built heritage continues to be provided by my Department in 2016 via a number of schemes, which are either directly administered or delivered through local authorities or through the Heritage Council.  The remainder of my Department&rsquo;s built heritage capital budget for 2016 is focused on the conservation and presentation of the State's heritage portfolio, which is managed by the Office of Public Works.</p></reply>

Within these allocations, the Arts Council is the primary State agency for funding the arts.  I secured significant additional funding for the Arts Council in Budget 2017 of &euro;5 million, or 8%.  Details of the Council's funding decisions can be found on its website at the following link www.artscouncil.ie/Who_we_funded/</p><p><b></b>Direct funding from my Department for arts primarily relates to capital funding for individual projects, as well as the promotion of Irish arts and culture abroad through Culture Ireland.</p><p>Budget 2016 included over &euro;48 million for the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme, including almost &euro;31 million for ma jor capital works.  There was also additional funding for an inclusive and wide-ranging national and international commemorative programme, including State events, local community initiatives, and a wide range of arts and cultural projects, as well as &euro;3 million for Culture Ireland&rsquo;s 2016 international programme and the Abbey Theatre.  Investing in our cultural infrastructure is hugely important.  Arts and cultural centres not only enrich local communities - they also help to drive economic growth.</p><p>I believe that it is important to continue the momentum to build on the positive legacy of the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme.  My Department has, therefore, been developing a cross-Government initiative to mainstream culture and creativity in the life of the nation and to promote individual, community and national wellbeing.  This will focus on boosting cultural provision and participation in communities, and harnessing the goodwill and engagement generated by the commemorative programme this year.  It will also act as the main vehicle to take forward the priorities identified in <i>Culture 2025</i>.  I have secured funding of &euro;5m in Budget 2017 to underpin this new initiative and I intend to announce further details in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

This success was particularly evident during Ireland&rsquo;s success at the 2016 Oscars with <i>Room</i>, <i>Brooklyn</i>and other films.  This was followed later in the year with <i>Star Wars</i>returning to film here and the attendant promotional activity around the shooting.  </p><p>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>contains a very important commitment to work to progressively increase funding to the arts, including the Arts Council and the Irish Film Board, as the economy continues to improve.  The Irish Film Board is the national development agency for Irish filmmaking and the Irish film, television and animation industry.  The Board promotes the Irish screen industries at major international markets and festivals, supports inward investment, promotes the use of Ireland as a location for international production and provides support for companies filming in Ireland.  The Film Board also liaises with IDA Ireland and Tourism Ireland in terms of maximising joint opportunities for promotion of Ireland as a location for film productions. </p><p>In Budget 2017, I secured<b></b>an increase of &euro;2 million for the Irish Film Board, representing a 14% increase in its annual budget.  This increase in funding will allow the Board to invest more in Irish film talent in the year ahead, and follows on from a very successful year for the Irish film sector, particularly the indigenous film sector.</p></reply>

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures.  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.</p><p>Under section 54 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, a planning authority may add to or delete from its Record of Protected Structures, a structure, a specified part of a structure or a specified feature of the attendant grounds of a structure.  Such a structure, specified part of a structure, or specified feature remains on the Record of Protected Structures until such time as the planning authority deletes it.  Provision is made in the Act for the carrying out of works to protected structures either by way of planning permission or on the foot of a declaration received from a planning authority that certain works that would not materially affect the character of a structure are exempted development.  There is a duty on owners and occupiers to protect structures from endangerment.  Where structures become endangered or unauthorised development has been or is being carried out, the planning authority has the powers to take appropriate action.</p><p><b></b>There is a number of ways in which my Department acts in respect of possible heritage sites/buildings deemed to be at risk.  One of these is the receipt of applications for funding for the repair, conservation, preservation or safeguarding of protected structures, sites or monuments.  Financial support is being provided by my Department through a number of structured schemes for the conservation and protection of heritage buildings.  My Department itself operates a Structures at Risk Fund to enable conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, that are protected under the Planning and Development Acts and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  This Fund is administered through the local authorities and seeks to encourage the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and to help to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.  The 2016 Structures at Risk Scheme, with an allocation of over &euro;900,000, has funded over 50 projects.  Since 2011, over 180 structures have been safeguarded for the future as a result of the Structures at Risk Fund.</p><p>In 2015 I launched a new &euro;2 million scheme - the Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS) - for the repair and conservatio n of protected structures.  The 2016 BHIS scheme has operated via the local authorities, on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme, which ran in 2014.  In 2016, BHIS has supported over 270 pro jects across the country, creating over 17,000 days of employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas.  The scheme has also leveraged just under &euro;5.5 million, more than double the scheme&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;2 million.  Both schemes will run again in 2017.</p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  For 2016, the Council is administering a community-based heritage grants scheme available for projects that contributed to particular heritage themes. Further details can be found at www.heritagecouncil.ie </p></reply>

As Minister, I am the owner or guardian under the National Monuments Acts of approximately 1,000 national monuments located at approximately 750 sites and, in such cases, there is a statutory duty to maintain the national monument.  Such maintenance is undertaken by the Office of Public Works (OPW).  Local authorities are responsible under the National Monuments Acts for maintaining national monuments of which they are owners or guardians.  A wide range of other monuments (in the order of 130,000) are currently subject to protection under other provisions of the National Monuments Acts but my Department and the OPW do not have a direct role in their maintenance except where, as already noted, a monument is a national monument of which I, as Minister, am owner or guardian.  </p>  <p>  My Department is providing &euro;350,000 of funding to the OPW in 2016 to assist in the conservation and presentation of historic buildings and national monuments in State ownership.  My Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service works in close collaboration with the OPW on survey, excavation and research work to optimise the protection, management, interpretation and presentation of national monuments in State care.  While my Department is responsible for legislation, policy and management of the archaeological heritage, works on the conservation and restoration of individual monuments in State care is undertaken by OPW.   </p></reply>

My Department provides some funding to assist with implementation of initiatives of the Charter which has included the development of the Arts in Education Portal which now serves as an effective key communications and information channel for both education and arts sectors.  </p><p>This year, the Ireland 2016 Project Office of my Department worked with the Department of Education and Skills to develop a rich programme for the primary and post primary sectors, and to ensure that the programme reached every school in the country.  Every National School in the country was visited by members of the Defence Forces and were presented with the National Flag, copies of the Proclamation and the National Anthem.  These were accompanied by a booklet which explained the history, heritage and significance of the national flag.  In consultation with the Thomas Meagher Foundation, the National Flag was also provided to each secondary school around the country.  </p><p>Schools were also invited to write a new proclamation for 2016, to reflect the values, hopes and aspirations of the generation of 2016, starting with an analysis of the ideals, principles and aspirations of the 1916 Proclamation.

The programme is sponsored by groups wishing to benefit the local community, namely voluntary organisations, public bodies and those involved in not-for-profit activities. </p>  <p>  The DSP provides financial support to assist with the Job Initiative scheme, for example participant wages.  Also, while on the programme, participants can retain their medical cards.</p>  <p>  On foot of changes the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment introduced in 2004, there is currently no recruitment onto this scheme.</p></reply>

The Company must submit a separate application to extend a treatment to a new cohort of patients.  Each application is considered separately on its merits and in line with the 2013 Act.</p><p>In reaching its decision, the HSE examines all the evidence which may be relevant in its view for the decision (including the information /dossier submitted by the Company) and will take into account such expert opinions and recommendations which may have been sought by the HSE at its sole discretion (for example, from the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics). </p><p>In considering an application, the HSE will also have regard to Part 1 and Part 3 of Schedule 3 of the 2013 Act. Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria: </p><p>1.  the health needs of the public;</p><p>2.  the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;</p><p>3.  the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement;</p><p>4.  the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks;</p><p>5.  the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item; </p><p>6.  the clinical need for the item or listed item;</p><p>7.  the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety;</p><p>8.  the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and </p><p>9.  the resources available to the HSE. </p><p>I am informed that the HSE received a request and economic dossier from the manufacturer of Ivacaftor, brand name Kalydeco, for the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients aged 2 years and older weighing less than 25kg.  In March of this year the HSE asked the NCPE to carry out a health technology assessment of the applicant&rsquo;s economic dossier on the cost effectiveness of this treatment.</p><p>The NCPE completed its assessment and made a recommendation in October 2016.  The NCPE determined that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness of the drug for its intended cohort of patients and did not recommend that it should be reimbursed for this indication at the submitted price.</p><p>A summary of the health technology assessment has been published on the NCPE website and is available at: . </p><p>As the HSE is responsible for the negotiations with manufacturers I have asked them to reply to the Deputy directly in relation to the status of negotiations with the manufacturer.</p></reply>

Progress to date includes changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate flexible/shared GMS/GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday, as well as the introduction of an enhanced supports package for rural GP practices.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria:</p><p>1. the health needs of the public; </p><p>2. the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;</p><p>3. the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement;</p><p>4. the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks;</p><p>5. the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item;</p><p>6. the clinical need for the item or listed item;</p><p>7. the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety;</p><p>8. the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and</p><p>9. the resources available to the HSE.</p><p>I am informed that the HSE received a request and economic dossier from the manufacturer of Ivacaftor, brand name Kalydeco, for the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients aged 2 years and older weighing less than 25 kg. In March of this year the HSE asked the NCPE to carry out a health technology assessment of the applicant&rsquo;s economic dossier on the cost effectiveness of this treatment.</p><p>The NCPE completed its assessment and made a recommendation in October 2016. The NCPE determined that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness of the drug for its intended cohort of patients and did not recommend that it should be reimbursed for this indication at the submitted price. In the economic dossier submitted to the NCPE the manufacturer estimates that there are 18 patients eligible for early ivacaftor treatment.</p><p>A summary of the health technology assessment has been published on the NCPE website and is available at: .</p><p>As the HSE is responsible for the negotiations with manufacturers I have asked them to reply to the Deputy directly in relation to the status of negotiations with the manufacturer.</p><p>I have also asked that the HSE respond on the issue of numbers of patients currently receiving Kalydeco and the cost per patient.</p><p>In relation to the pricing of Kalydeco in other EU countries, I am informed that the Scottish Medicines Consortium has not recommended the drug for this cohort of patients as the manufacturer's justification of the treatment cost in relation to associated health benefits was not sufficient.</p><p>I understand how patients and their families must feel in these circumstances as they await the decisions by the HSE in relation to reimbursement.  However as with all new drugs developed, the HSE must follow a process, as set out in the 2013 Act.</p></reply>

The manufacturer has had difficulties in the production of the BCG vaccine.  Since this problem became apparent, the HSE National Immunisation Office has been in regular contact with the manufacturer of BCG vaccine to ascertain when the vaccine might be available.  The HSE has also asked the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), which licenses and regulates all human medicines in Ireland, to source an alternate supplier of the BCG vaccine.  Efforts have been made to find a company that can provide the vaccine for use in Ireland which satisfies all the HPRA requirements on safety and efficacy.  There has been a worldwide shortage for over two years and to date no suitable alternative BCG product has been found.  Therefore the HSE has been unable to procure the BCG vaccine from any other source and still awaits the product from the HPRA licensed supplier of the vaccine.</p>  <p>  The supplier has indicated that supplies of the vaccine are not expected to be delivered into Ireland until early 2017.  When there is confirmation of the date of new supply, the HSE will be guided by the recommendations of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee on its administration.</p></reply>

In line with practice in other EU Member States, the HSE, through the National Contact Point (NCP) office, provides information for patients on the Cross-Border Directive on its website - www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/cbd/ - and also by phone.  The principal function of the NCP (which is the mechanism specified under the Directive for the dissemination of information on the Directive by Member States) is to facilitate exchange of information for patients concerning their rights and entitlements relating to receiving healthcare in another Member State, in particular the terms and conditions for reimbursement of cost and the procedures for accessing and determining those entitlements.</p>  <p>  The NCP also has a responsibility to ensure that all enquirers are informed of the right to healthcare, if any, that they may have through the European legislation on the coordination of social security schemes (EU Regulation 883/04) and which may be more beneficial to them.  The NCP is able to inform patients what the cost of their treatments would be in Ireland to allow them make a comparison with the costs they are being quoted for comparable treatment in another Member State.</p>  <p>  Similar to other healthcare schemes operated by EU Member States under Community legislation, access to healthcare abroad under the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive is based on patients following public patient pathways, hence the HSE has in particular concentrated on informing the doctors who make the referrals.</p>  <p>  In order to determine if a patient is eligible under CBD an application must be submitted to the NCP.

Independent reviews since 2006 have reaffirmed the importance of co-location with a major adult teaching hospital.</p>  <p>  Planning permission was granted for this new children&rsquo;s hospital, as well as for two Paediatric OPD and Urgent Care Satellite Centres at Tallaght and Connolly Hospital, in April of this year, clearing the way for enabling works which began this summer on the campus of St. James's Hospital.  It is expected that the satellite centres at Connolly Hospital and Tallaght Hospital can open in 2018, significantly enhancing access to urgent care and outpatient services for children from the Greater Dublin Area.  Building work on the main site will be completed in 2020.</p>  <p>  The previous Government committed to making &euro;200m available from the sale of the National Lottery for the new children's hospital, adding to the existing &euro;450m Exchequer funding and underlining the Government's commitment to the project.  The 2014 estimate, as set out in the approved Project Brief, affirmed delivery of the core hospital, including both satellite centres, within this envelope.  As with any capital project, it is essential that cost estimates be reviewed and refined as appropriate, including making prudent provision for construction inflation.</p>  <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, which is the statutory body charged with delivery of the capital project, is currently reviewing tenders, received at the end of October, for the main and specialist contractors for the hospital on the campus of St James&rsquo;s and the two satellite centres.  Due to the high profile nature of this project it is a highly competitive tender process and so it is anticipated that this will be reflected in the submissions tendered.  Final capital costs will be available following tender evaluations.  As the tendering process is still ongoing and for reasons of commercial sensitivity, details of cost estimates cannot be provided at this stage.  It is my intention to bring a Memorandum to Government early in 2017 in relation to the new children&rsquo;s hospital and associated satellite centres.</p>  <p>  The cost of transitioning the new children's hospital to a site at Connolly Hospital has not been assessed in any detail given the fact that no such project exists.  Additional to the capital cost of developing the children's hospital itself on the campus, a significant upgrade of Connolly Hospital would be required to achieve the same potential for quality of clinical outcomes as co-location/tri-location with St James&rsquo;s, requiring very substantial investment of human and capital resources to develop over time into an adult tertiary hospital with critical mass supported by leading edge research facilities.</p></reply>

The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.  NIAC recommended that the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine be given to all girls aged 12-13 in 2009 and in September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools.  </p>  <p>  By January 2016, over 200 million doses of Gardasil had been distributed worldwide.  In Ireland over 580,000 doses of Gardasil have been administered and over 220,000 girls have been fully vaccinated against HPV since it was introduced in 2010.</p>  <p>  No medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, there is therefore on-going pharmacovigilance and monitoring of medicinal products once they are authorised for use.  The safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level.  In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the statutory regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland. </p>  <p>  In November 2015 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine.  The review, in which the HPRA participated, focused on two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.  The review found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions.  On 12 January 2016 the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the EMA stating that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information which is now binding in all member states.</p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  It is important to reassure people that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services.

My Department is aware that cannabis for medicinal use has been legalised in some countries and that there have been several studies internationally on the therapeutic effects of cannabinoids for a number of medical issues. </p>  <p>  I understand the concern of these and many other people who believe that cannabis should be a treatment option for certain medical conditions and I recognise the urgency and constant worry felt by patients with very distressing illnesses. As a result I am committed to urgently reviewing Ireland&rsquo;s policy on medicinal cannabis. </p>  <p>  Cannabis-based preparations are strictly controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Acts. However, it is open for an Irish registered doctor to apply for a licence for such preparations for an individual, named-patient. Such applications will be considered on a case by case basis.  The appropriateness of any particular treatment is a matter between the patient and their doctor. </p>  <p>  Cannabidiol (CBD) is derived from cannabis. However, since it does not have psychoactive properties it is not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Acts. </p>  <p>  While I am aware that CBD oil is sometimes marketed as a nutritional or dietary supplement, it should be noted that it is not authorised as a medicinal product in Ireland.</p>  <p>  I recently asked the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) to examine the issue of permitting the use of cannabis-based products for medical purposes in Ireland.  The HPRA&rsquo;s statutory role is to protect and enhance human health by regulating medicines and other health products and it has the necessary clinical and scientific expertise to provide advice on this issue.</p>  <p>  Separately the Oireachtas Health Committee has now also begun to examine the issue of medicinal cannabis.  </p>  <p>  I hope to receive the report from the HPRA and the output from the Oireachtas Health Committee early in the New Year and I will then be in a position to consider future policy and progress any legislative changes that may be recommended.</p></reply>

Any revision of these medical card income thresholds requires primary legislation.</p>  <p>  Persons aged 70 or older, who are assessed as ineligible under the gross income thresholds, may also have their eligibility assessed under the means-tested medical card scheme if they so wish, for example in the event that they face particularly high expenses, e.g. nursing home or medication costs.  This scheme is open to all persons, irrespective of their age and assessment is based on net income and assessable outgoing expenses.  The qualifying income thresholds under this scheme are lower than over-70s gross income thresholds.  In setting the assessment guidelines, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has regard to Government policy as outlined by the Minister for Health, changes in the consumer price index and other issues which may be relevant.  Furthermore, persons, including those aged over 70 years, may be deemed eligible for a medical card on a discretionary basis, if they are judged to face undue hardship in arranging GP services as a result of medical or social circumstances.  In addition, from August 2015, all persons aged 70 or older qualify for a GP Visit Card, regardless of income.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the increase in the State pension takes effect from March 2017.  In the meantime, I have asked my Department to consider with the HSE the impact, if any, which this increase may have on people's ability to qualify for a medical card under the gross income threshold arrangements.  It would be the Government's intention that people would not be adversely affected.</p></reply>

The agreements, where entered into at the behest of either party, preclude the disclosure of settlement details by either party. </p>  <p>  Regarding other settlements in the Department, in September 2012 the Minister entered into an agreement with the Medical Defence Union in settlement of litigation.  This agreement is subject to a confidentiality clause. </p>  <p>  My officials are awaiting further clarification from the Deputy in relation to the specific details he requires on non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements with persons or groups and when this is supplied I will  forward a reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.  I will also send the question to the HSE and the other agencies under the aegis of my Department, when the specific details of the question are clarified and they too will be requested to reply directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p><p>The gross funding, which includes client contributions under the Scheme, for the years 2010 to 2015 is as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Gross Budget (millions)</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>&euro;979</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;963</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;994.7</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;974</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;939</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>&euro;993</td></tr></table></p><p>The gross budget for the Scheme in 2016 is &euro;1,004.9 million, with a net budget (excluding income from clients) of &euro;940 million. Expenditure of &euro;921.5 million of the net budget is anticipated for 2016.  </p><p>A number of factors may impact on future cost and demand for long-term residential care services, including social changes, possible new models of care for older people, and changes in population health status. Accurate long-term forecasts are accordingly difficult.  However, high-level projections are possible, and as part of the review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, an analysis of the current NHSS population by age cohort, projected forward in line with CSO demographic projections, indicates that approximately 33,000 people will require support under the scheme by 2024.  At present cost levels, this would imply a total annual net cost of approximately &euro;1.3 billion by 2024.</p></reply>

The plan is being rolled out at a regional and local level and involves full consultation with stakeholders. </p><p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.  Currently, 2725 people live in congregated settings and our objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.</p><p>The HSE has established a subgroup, under <i>&lsquo;Transforming Lives&rsquo;,</i>the Programme to implement the recommendations of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services, which is developing an implementation plan for moving people from institutions.  I welcome the fact that the needs of people moving from congregated settings will be fully taken into account during this process as the model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan. </p><p>The HSE's 2016 National Service Plan has set a target of 165 people to move from institutions in 2016 into suitable accommodation.  Earlier this year, I announced that we are providing &euro;100 million in capital funding from now until 2021 in respect of acquiring and renovating properties in priority institutions identified by the HSE.  This will  ensure that people are able to move out of congregated settings, and into their own homes in the community.  I want to emphasise that the appropriate supports and resources are being put in place to ensure that people are supported as they move out of residential centres. </p><p>In addition, I am pleased to note that the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is providing &euro;10 million under the Capital Assistance Scheme to provide suitable accommodation for people transitioning from institutions in 2016.  The HSE estimate that a further 100 people could benefit from this initiative.  &euro;1 million in ring-fenced leasing funding is also being made available by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Governmentin 2016 to support people moving from institutions into suitable social housing in the community.  This demonstrates the joined up commitment of both Departments to support the de-congregation programme.  </p><p>The HSE has developed a three strand approach to accelerate transitions from institutions in the period 2016-2021, with a target of 900 people to move to more suitable accommodation in this period. </p><p>- Strand 1- is focussed on large institutional settings at high risk of not meeting HIQA Standards;</p><p>- Strand 2- is focussed on moving people into suitable social housing in the community through the Department of Housing schemes; and </p><p>- Strand 3- is focussed on remaining service users in congregated settings who could move to suitable accommodation.</p><p>This process of moving people to more suitable accommodation in the community will take place over a number of years, and will be done in full consultation with all residents and their families.</p><p>As the HSE is responsible for leading out on the recommendations on <i>&quot;Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion&quot;, </i>I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy for any further information that they may be able to provide.</p></reply>

However, per capita figures are only one of a number of measures that can give a view of drugs spending in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The OECD report cited by the Deputy uses data from 2014, the last year for which full figures are available.  In 2014, expenditure on prescription and over the counter medicines accounted for just over 14 percent of overall health expenditure in Ireland.  Although this was higher than several other EU countries, including Denmark, Finland, and Belgium, it was lower than Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, and significantly lower than Greece or Hungary.</p>  <p>  OECD data on pharmaceutical expenditure includes expenditure on both prescription and over the counter medicines but excludes expenditure on Pharmaceuticals consumed in hospitals and other health care settings as part of an inpatient or day case treatment.  As acknowledged by the OECD "comparability issues exist with regards to the administration and dispensing of pharmaceuticals for outpatients in hospitals."</p>  <p>  Looking at expenditure in Ireland alone, the report noted the significant reversal in the growth of pharmaceutical spending in Ireland between 2009 and 2014.  There has also been a number of significant developments since 2014 that will further reduce the cost of medicines in Ireland.  The Framework Agreement on the Pricing and Supply of Medicines will reduce the price of medicines to the average of 14 other countries and provides for an annual downward only price realignment.  This will ensure that Irish medicine prices continue to reduce in line with price reductions across reference countries.  This Agreement is expected to deliver savings of up to &euro;750 million over the next four years.  </p>  <p>  Other initiatives will continue to be pursued, to ensure that we achieve affordable prices for medicines for both patients and the State.</p>  <p>  These include the HSE's Medicines Management Programme, which has a particular focus on cost-effective prescribing, and the continued implementation of generic substitution and reference pricing.</p>  <p>  The implementation of generic substitution and reference pricing has also contributed to significant price reductions.  The prices of referenced products are generally 70-80% lower than the prices paid when medicines were on patent.  Generic substitution and reference pricing delivered savings of &euro;47 million in 2014 and &euro;94 million in 2015, and ensures that generic drug prices in Ireland will continue to fall towards European norms.</p>  <p>  As a result of these measures, the average price of an item dispensed on the General Medical Services Scheme has reduced to below the price paid in 2001 and the average Drug Payment Scheme price is below the price paid in 2000.</p></reply>

The current Strategy contains an action to develop a sustained range of awareness campaigns that target third level educational institutions, workplaces and recreational venues.  The HSE has implemented a number of targeted awareness campaigns through the drugs.ie website, relating to the use of new psychoactive substances, ketamine and pills.  These campaigns provide harm reduction information and advice, while emphasising that it's always safest not to take unknown or illicit drugs at all.  In addition, the HSE Addiction service provides non-judgemental, evidence based treatment interventions to individuals presenting with problems associated with a range of licit and illicit substances.</p>  <p>  Substance use education in schools is provided in the context of Social Personal and Health Education.  The Department of Education and Skills' Inspectorate continues to monitor the effectiveness of the implementation of substance use policies in schools through the whole-school evaluation process and the inspectorate system.  Local and Regional Drug and Alcohol Task Forces operate a range of education and prevention programmes, which aim to promote healthier lifestyle choices among young people and other vulnerable groups at risk of problem drug use.  In addition, young people at risk of drug misuse can access diversionary programmes, facilities and services and family support. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a Steering Committee, with an independent chair, has been established to advise me on a new National Drugs Strategy, which will commence in 2017, when the current policy expires.  I understand that the need for prevention and education programmes that raise awareness of the risks and harms associated with recreational drug use is one of the key issues emerging from the multi-stakeholder focus groups, which will advise the Steering Committee on measures to address gaps in the current response to the drug problem.  It is expected that the focus groups will shortly conclude their work and report back to the Steering Committee.  I am expecting the final report of the Steering Committee early in the New Year. </p></reply>

As required by the Act, a National Mitigation Plan (NMP) is currently being prepared and I understand that this will be released shortly for a period of public consultation by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment. Agricultural sectoral mitigation measures have been prepared for input to the NMP. </p><p>A range of actions are currently being undertaken to make Irish farming more environmentally sustainable,  including measures under the Rural Development Programme (RDP), which is worth almost &euro;4 billion over 7 years.  The Programme is strongly targeted towards environmental benefits, including knowledge transfer programmes, which will bring the latest innovative sustainability research and practices direct to farmers. </p><p>Other measures include GLAS, the Green, Low-Carbon, Agri-Environment Scheme which offers opportunities to support emission reductions and carbon sequestration through various actions such as hedgerow and tree planting, minimum tillage and encouraging the sustainable management of upland peatlands, while at the same time addressing other environmental threats such as biodiversity and water quality.</p><p>The Beef Data and Genomics Programme is directly targeted at the climate emissions of 30,000 beef farmers. Its objective is to lower the intensity of GHG emissions by improving the quality and efficiency of the national beef herd </p><p>Furthermore, the establishment and maintenance of landscape features (for example, Ecological Focus Areas under CAP Pillar I) can assist with achieving other environmental objectives which are expected of land, such as water and biodiversity management, in addition to carbon sequestration benefits.</p><p>Ireland is a world leader in areas such as sustainable auditing and carbon foot-printing under the Origin Green programme.  Origin Green is a strategic priority in Food Wise 2025, the ten year strategy for the agri-food industry.</p><p>Also the Pasture Profit Index, the Carbon Navigator Tool and the Agricultural Catchments Programme help to reduce carbon emissions per unit of output produced and help protect our rivers. </p><p>All of these efforts are being implemented alongside an extensive afforestation scheme.  Afforestation is the main cost effective land based climate mitigation tool available to Ireland, followed by the above mentioned mitigation technologies in agriculture itself. Climate change mitigation by forests, forest fuels and wood products is one of the principal drivers of the policy to expand forest cover out to mid century.  Agriculture and afforestation are intrinsically linked in Ireland. Every new hectare of afforestation comes directly from agriculture.  </p></reply>

This Scheme will enable farmers to improve the management of their cash flow and reduce the cost of their short-term borrowings.  This loan scheme forms part of a &ldquo;three pillar strategy&rdquo; in response to income volatility, which I announced as part of the recent Budget.  Along with tax measures and farm payments, it will alleviate some of the pressures being caused by the current market difficulties. </p>  <p>  The SBCI is targeting that the loans will be available in the market by the end of January 2017. I am encouraging farmers to consider their cash flow and borrowings situation now, and if appropriate to their circumstances, to be prepared to apply for these loans when they become available.</p>  <p>  The Scheme is being developed by my Department in partnership with the SBCI. The Department&rsquo;s funding of &euro;25 million includes &euro;11 million made available under the EU&rsquo;s exceptional adjustment aid for milk and other livestock farmers and &euro;14 million in national funding.  This provides leverage for the &euro;150 million scheme, which will support highly flexible loans for up to six years, for amounts up to &euro;150,000, at an interest rate of 2.95%.</p></reply>

The sustained period of lower commodity prices has caused cash flow difficulties for farmers in several sectors, which consequently affects service providers such as farm contractors.  I have committed to working with all the stakeholders to address the issues involved and ensure that we continue to have a sustainable and resilient sector.  As part of the recent Budget, I announced a &ldquo;three pillar strategy&rdquo; to alleviate the pressures of income volatility through lower cost finance, tax measures and farm payments. </p>  <p>  While taxation policy is primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Finance, our two Departments continuously liaise on agri-taxation matters and I make an annual submission in advance of the Budget.  I will ensure that the Department of Finance is informed of the various issues raised by FCI.  Considerable progress was made in the recent budget, including the extension of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland&rsquo;s accelerated capital allowance scheme for energy efficient equipment to non-incorporated businesses, and increased equity within the income tax system for the self-employed. </p>  <p>  Hedge cutting controls are primarily a responsibility for the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs under the Wildlife Act.  </p>  <p>  You may be aware that last week I announced that the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) has invited banks and other lenders to take part in the "Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme".  My Department and the SBCI have been working closely on the Scheme and the SBCI is targeting that the loans will be available in the market by the end of January 2017.  I clarified at the meeting with FCI that these loans will be available to farmers or SMEs engaged in primary agricultural production. </p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and through a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not  been fully demonstrated.     The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll out a new high-speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area, comprising over 750,000 premises including approximately 20,300 premises in Co Kildare, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland. </p>  <p>  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  Householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 megabits per second but potentially up to 1000 megabits per second with businesses potentially availing of symmetrical upload and download speeds. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded under the NBP. The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process. The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process. Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids. In addition, bidders need adequate time to get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process. It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed. I do not propose to comment any further on timelines at this juncture, given that discussions are on-going in the procurement process. I can assure the Deputy, however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one that will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century. </p>  <p>  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP. As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan. A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded. In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p>  <p>  The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the extent of the State Intervention area:</p>  <p>  - The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  </p>  <p>  - The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention which are the subject of the current procurement process. </p>  <p>  The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including County Kildare.  Members of the public can view whether their premises in Kildare are in the BLUE or AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.</p>  <p>  I would encourage citizens in County Kildare who cannot access high speed broadband services to contact my Department directly at broadband@dccae.gov.ie, quoting their address and Eircode, and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services.  This information will assist my Department to keep track of progress in those areas so that high speed broadband solutions can be found in parallel with the State Intervention high speed broadband network roll-out. </p></reply>

Using Eircodes helps the National Ambulance Service (NAS) provide speedier access to care.  The NAS integrated Eircodes into their Computer Aided Dispatch system (CAD) in February 2016.  This means that callers to the ambulance service can give the patient&rsquo;s Eircode, which is validated in the CAD system.  The call taker can then locate the patient&rsquo;s property and direct the nearest available ambulance to the correct location. </p>  <p>  Ambulance emergency requests often come from isolated rural locations.  NAS considers the Eircode information to be very important in the rapid identification of these rural addresses &ndash; in particular, responding to calls from any of the 35% non-unique addresses in the state which caused significant operational challenges in the past.  On foot of the campaign, call takers in the National Ambulance Service noticed a big improvement in the elderly population knowing and keeping their Eircode close to the phone.</p>  <p>  While there is no requirement to reference the Department in a public service announcement, my Department did approve the public awareness campaign.</p></reply>

Since 2002, the regulation of the gas market has been the responsibility of the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is independent in the performance of its functions.  Decisions on the regulatory treatment of the gas network and tariffing are statutorily matters for the CER under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002. The CER, as the independent energy regulator, has a remit to protect energy consumers, ensure security of supply and support competitiveness. </p>  <p>  From 2011, in anticipation of the entry of Corrib gas into the system, and in pursuance of its duty to ensure that new sources of gas for the Irish market did not result in unwarranted increases in the price of gas to business and domestic consumers, the CER embarked on a process of reform of the regime governing the regulatory treatment of the two Ireland/UK gas interconnectors and associated tariffing.  The rationale for the CER&rsquo;s proposed reform was that if the then current regime were to persist, new sources of gas coming onstream such as Corrib, and possible liquified natural gas (LNG), would cause the price of gas to rise significantly for all Irish consumers, regardless of the source of the supply.  Given our high dependence on gas for electricity generation this would also give rise to electricity price increases and would negatively impact on Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness. </p>  <p>  On 29 June 2012, following the usual consultation period, the CER published a high-level decision outlining its proposals for the new tariff regime.  This CER decision subsequently became the subject of a Judicial Review taken by Shannon LNG.  On 11 December 2013 the High Court upheld the CER decision of 29 June 2012.  I understand that Shannon LNG has appealed the High Court decision to the Supreme Court.</p>  <p>  Following an extensive period of consultation on how the 2012 decision would be implemented, the associated new tariffing regime was introduced with effect from 1st October 2015.  Full details are to be found in the CER Decision Paper of 23 July 2015 (CER/15/140) available from the CER website at www.cer.ie.</p></reply>

However, it is important to note that the electricity and gas markets are commercial, liberalised, and competitive and that they operate within national and European regulatory regimes.</p><p>Responsibility for electricity and gas market regulation is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) which is an independent statutory body.</p><p>Existing obligations on suppliers as regards disconnections are included in the CERs Electricity and Natural Gas Supplier Handbook, which includes a Code of Practice on Disconnections, under which suppliers are required to offer customers assistance in managing their account and treat disconnections as a last resort.</p><p>A number of measures have been taken in recent years to assist consumers deal with energy costs.  The CER procured Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) Meters to help those in difficulty with energy bills to better manage their usage and reduce the risk of disconnection.  The rollout of PAYG meters has contributed to a fall in the number of disconnections and limited the accumulation of arrears.  The Department continues to work with the CER and the energy industry to ensure that there are no impediments to their continued availability to customers who are at risk of energy poverty.</p><p>Bord G&aacute;is Energy, Electric Ireland, Energia, Flogas Natural Gas and SSE Airtricity have adopted a voluntary code of practice, the 'Energy Engage Code' committing them never to disconnect an engaging customer, to avoid disconnections in the winter period, and to work with their customers on realistic and achievable payment plans for any arrears.</p><p>CER has also issued a disconnection moratorium request to all suppliers and the network companies for all domestic customers for the Christmas period.  The moratorium runs from 16<sup>th</sup>December 2016 to 6<sup>th</sup>January 2017.  Essentially, network companies cannot process requests for disconnection for non-payment of account during this period. </p><p>The Code supplements existing obligations on suppliers as set out in the CERs Electricity and Natural Gas Supplier Handbook.  The impact of the Code on the level of disconnections is being continuously monitored by the CER.</p></reply>

In the delivery of smart meters, ESB Networks, and Gas Networks Ireland are required to ensure that any meters procured would, at a minimum, meet Irish and EU product health and safety legislation and standards, which require manufacturers to ensure that any product placed on the market is safe.  The Commission for Energy Regulation will be monitoring this to ensure full compliance.</p>  <p>  Regarding right of refusal, I have been informed by the Commission for Energy Regulation that a customer that does not want an upgraded meter will be able to decline to have this new meter installed.  However, the intention is that the default for newly constructed dwellings or other premises, or where meters are due for replacement at the end of their life, will be the installation of a smart meter.  Over time, every mechanical meter is likely to be replaced with this new generation technology.</p></reply>

If they are not, then they are not covered by the terms of the leaner permit, which entitles them to drive only if accompanied.  As such, unaccompanied learner drivers are in fact driving unlicensed.</p>  <p>  The driver testing service, which is operated by the Road Safety Authority (RSA), is responsible for running the driving test, and does not have any power to enforce the law.  This remains the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

In addition the NTA also required a period to make and prepare the necessary regulations provided for under the Act as well as ensure appropriate training and administrative supports are in place to allow for commencement of regulatory activities.</p>  <p>  This preparatory work has now been completed; however, in recent weeks an issue arose in how the Act deals with the required consultation process in relation to draft Regulations prior to their finalisation.  This issue needs to be addressed so as to ensure that the NTA can proceed with the publication of said draft Regulations.</p>  <p>  This issue is being dealt with through making a technical amendment to the Vehicle Clamping Act 2015 which will be introduced by means of an amendment to the Road Traffic Bill 2016 which is currently at D&aacute;il Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  Subject to the availability of parliamentary time, I expect that  the Road Traffic Bill 2016 will complete its Oireachtas passage before the end of the year.  Once amended, I will commence the Vehicle Clamping Act and the NTA will then proceed with the consultation process in relation to the draft Regulations prior to their finalisation.</p></reply>

The objective of the RTP is to provide a quality nationwide community based public transport system in rural Ireland which responds to local needs.  These needs include isolation in rural areas arising from unmet public transport needs.</p>  <p>  A major restructuring of the RTP arising from a 2011 Value for Money and Policy Review, involving the formation of 17 Transport Coordination Units (TCUs) from 35 previously existing rural transport groups, was implemented on a phased basis during 2014 and 2015.  The purpose of the restructuring of the RTP is to protect the provision of rural transport services into the future by ensuring a more efficient delivery structure that maximises integration with other State transport services and by making the Programme a sustainable part of the public transport system.</p>  <p>  The NTA, in consultation with the TCUs and other relevant stakeholders, is overseeing a number of initiatives to improve connectivity and integration of RTP services with other State funded transport services which will be of particular benefit to those at risk of social exclusion.  The restructured RTP offers a structure to integrate rural transport services with other State funded local transport services, to achieve greater synergies, better meet identified transport needs and deliver increased value for money for the exchequer.  The NTA is also preparing a report for my Department, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, for submission to the Oireachtas Transport Committee, regarding the potential integration with other transport type services such as the HSE transport networks.</p>  <p>  The NTA, in its role as regulator of the taxi industry, introduced the Local Area Hackney licence in December 2013.  This was recommended in the Taxi Regulation Review Report 2011 as a means of providing a low cost entry to the hackney market for transport provision in rural locations which would otherwise not receive such services.  It should be noted that is not intended to replace or displace conventional hackney or taxi services.</p></reply>

While the LIS does not have a ring-fenced allocation at present, local authorities may use a proportion of State grant funding (15% of the Discretionary Grant) for LIS should they wish to do so.  In addition Councils can also provide monies from their own resources towards LIS.</p>  <p>  While 2017 will see a modest increase in funding for roads, it will take some years yet under the Capital Plan to restore "steady state" funding levels for regional and local roads.  The primary focus will have to continue to be on the maintenance and renewal of public roads.  I do, however, expect that local authorities will continue to be able to use a proportion of their Discretionary Grant for the local improvement scheme in 2017.</p>  <p>  In light of the provision in the Programme for Government indicating that, as the economy recovers, the Government will promote increased funding for Local Improvement Schemes, I will be raising the issue of increased funding in the context of the planned Review of the Capital Plan.</p></reply>

The main purpose of the proposed Bill is to respond to certain of the recommendations contained in a Report undertaken by the Copyright Review Committee entitled &ldquo;Modernising Copyright&rdquo; which was published in October 2013.  The Bill does not involve a thorough examination of copyright legislation in its entirety or indeed of the rights of artists.  In general, the rights of artists come within the overall policy responsibility of the Minister for the Arts, Heritage, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</p>  <p>  As advised, the Bill is currently undergoing the formal drafting process with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and that remains the position.</p>  <p>  Artists who are employees in Ireland have the same rights as all other employees.

This is done initially through the use of of business tools which focus on the finances and overheads of the service.  For example, a fee calculation exercise looks at whether the fee being charged by the service is appropriate.  There is also a staff ratio calculation applied to look at the numbers of children in the service, when they are booked in, and what ratio needs to be applied.  For example, it may be that the service should take two fewer children in the morning, and two more in the afternoon in order to maximise the potential and run a viable service.  </p><p>This methodology has been found to be very effective in many services across the country, and whilst sometimes unpopular decisions have had to be made in the short term, the medium and long term results should justify these decisions.</p><p>I hope that the support offered to the services can assist them in reforming their services in order to enable them to continue.  I will of course be working extremely hard to seek further investment in childcare that will improve affordability for parents but also assist providers in running viable and high quality services.  My Department has long-standing relationships with community/not-for-profit childcare providers, and recognises the important role that this sector has to play in childcare provision.  I can certainly empathise with the challenges these services face and I continuously commend all early years services, particularly those operating on a not for profit basis, for the work they do.  </p><p>The CCI review  is due to be completed shortly, but preliminary results suggest that some services became over-reliant on unqualified CE participants to be part of core staff ratios over the years.  Many services across the country began preparing for the regulations some time ago and have reduced or eliminated their reliance on CE participants as part of the ratios, but I understand that some remain.</p><p>In Budget 2017 provision was made for a fund of &euro;1m to assist in the investigation of sustainability issues being faced by childcare providers, and to develop a policy to guide any future interventions.  This initiative is at an early stage and officials will commence work in this regard in early 2017.  </p><p>I believe that the work presently being undertaken by my Department and the CCI will influence policy over the coming months and years as we seek to establish a high quality childcare infrastructure in Ireland.  You will also be aware that the Programme for Government contains a commitment to independently evaluate the cost of providing childcare.  This report will give us solid evidence which will also inform future policy.  Such evidence will be critical to ensuring that whilst we work to make high quality childcare more accessible and affordable for parents, we also invest sufficiently to enable services to operate to high standards and attract new staff and retain their existing valued staff.</p></reply>

Childcare service providers receive grant funding from the Department for the provision of ECCE for a period of 38 weeks, as per the 2016/17 ECCE grant funding agreement.  Community/not for profit Childcare services that provide the ECCE Programme may also avail of grant funding for the provision of TEC and CCS for up to a period of 52 weeks per year.  Both TEC and CCS will be subsumed into Single Affordable Childcare Scheme from September 2017. The new scheme will provide up to 48 weeks of childcare per year.</p>  <p>  Although my Department does not act as employer to childcare it does acknowledge that the sector is under cost pressure, and that staff wages are a large component of cost.  To go some way towards addressing this, I have secured additional funding of &euro;14 million in Budget 2017 which will enable ECCE providers to be paid for a 39th week and part of a 40th week (7 ECCE days in total or 1.4 ECCE weeks) where they will have no children present and they will be able to pay staff to concentrate on administrative workload.  Services themselves can decide how to use the payment when it is received.  For the average ECCE service with 25 children, this will mean an additional annual payment of approximately &euro;2,400 per annum.  Part of the additional funding &euro;14m will be given to CCS and TEC providers on a pro-rata basis also to acknowledge their administrative burden also.  The Affordable Childcare Scheme when introduced in Sept 17 will replace CCS and TEC and will have recognition of non-contact time built into its cost base.  In addition, under Budget 2017 a provision was made for a fund of &euro;1m to assist in the investigation of sustainability issues being faced by childcare providers, and to develop a policy to guide any future interventions.  This initiative is at an early stage and officials will commence work in this regard in early 2017.</p></reply>

This initiative is at an early stage and officials will commence work in this regard in early 2017.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to conducting and publishing an independent review of the cost of providing quality childcare.  This commitment aligns closely with work on the design and development of a new Single Affordable Childcare Scheme and is currently being progressed in that context.  Work is well underway on the development of policy proposals for the new Affordable Childcare Scheme.  As part of this, Department officials are reviewing previous published research and analysis on the cost of childcare provision, are assessing available data sources and are scoping the precise requirements for the independent review.  </p>  <p>  Under the Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016, registered providers of pre-school services will, from 31st December 2016, be required to ensure that each employee working directly with children attending the service holds at least a major award in Early Childhood Care and Education at Level 5 on the National Qualifications Framework or a qualification deemed by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to be equivalent.  The Learner Fund was introduced in 2014 to provide support for existing childcare staff to achieve this minimum requirement.  The fund was later expanded to support existing pre-school leaders to up-skill to Level 6 on the National Qualifications Framework, which is now the minimum requirement for pre-school leaders delivering the Early childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme.</p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;1.5m will be available in 2017 to continue to Level 6 support in the context of the expansion of the ECCE programme.  I also hope to extend the Learner Fund to support childcare staff to achieve higher level qualifications in childcare, i.e. Fetac Level 7 and Level 8.  In this regard, my Department, in association with the Department of Education and Skills and Pobal, intends to commence work as soon as possible on the development of an approved panel of Level 7 and Level 8 training providers, and a new Learner Fund application process.</p>  <p>  I also hope to be in a position to make some funding available to those childcare staff who have already completed higher level courses entirely at their own expense.</p></reply>

Under the new scheme, parents will qualify for a targeted subsidy based on their net income, and the highest levels of support will be offered to those on the lowest incomes. </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 allocated funding for the development of an online IT application system that will allow parents to apply for subsidies, via an online application system, by entering their PPS number and other details such as their work or training status.  In order to make the application process as easy as possible for parents, it is intended that the means-testing will, in most cases, be carried out through an automatic link with income data held by the Revenue Commissioners and by the Department of Social Protection. </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the scheme will be available from September 2017 and, as such, applications for eligibility from parents will commence prior to September 2017.  Detailed development and implementation planning, including relating to the development of new legislation and ICT infrastructure, is currently underway.  This is a major project and it will be underpinned by a comprehensive communications strategy which will involve regular updates to the public and to all key stakeholders regarding progress and precise timeframes for implementation.</p></reply>

The new scheme will provide a system from which both universal and targeted subsidies can be provided towards the cost of childcare.

Subject to the terms of the scheme, including the maximum subsidised hours per week, the universal subsidy will be payable for the number of hours and weeks agreed between the parent and childcare provider.</p></reply>

It was clear from the review that the three brigade Army structure was no longer viable, particularly when compared to international norms.  </p>  <p>  Accordingly, a major re-organisation of the Defence Forces was implemented in order to ensure that the Defence Forces could operate efficiently and effectively within the revised strength ceiling of 9,500 personnel and was not focused on achieving savings.  The re-organisation encompassed the consolidation of the three under-strength brigades into two full strength brigades.  Key aspects of the re-organisation, which was introduced in 2012, included the consolidation of under-strength units into a smaller number of full strength units, a reduction in the number of headquarters and the associated re-deployment of personnel from administrative and support functions to operational units.  </p>  <p>  The re-organisation has maintained the operational capacity of the Defence Forces to the greatest extent possible within the available resource envelope and has improved the deployability and sustainability of the Defence Forces, both at home and overseas.  This remains a key focus for the future.  It is important to note that the re-organisation did not reduce the numbers of PDF personnel serving in locations within the former 4th Western Brigade area and I am satisfied that a return to a three brigade structure would cause a range of unnecessary inefficiencies, such as an increased administrative burden arising from the need to reintroduce a layer of non-operational middle management, and a return to under-strength units.     </p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence 2015 confirmed the Government&rsquo;s commitment to retain a PDF strength of at least 9,500 personnel and the continued retention of the Army&rsquo;s two Brigade structure.</p></reply>
