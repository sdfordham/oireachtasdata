    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-12-17a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121700056#WRA00500"><p>I have partially addressed this subject in my reply given today Question No. 10.</p>  <p>  As independent studies have shown, a UK withdrawal from the EU would have negative implications for Ireland.  There is, at this stage, little doubt about that. Determining the full impact of such a complex scenario is, however, extremely difficult, especially given that much would depend on the exact terms of a future UK relationship with the EU.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, we are working across Government to improve our understanding of the various issues that might arise for Ireland in the event of a fundamental change in the EU-UK relationship.  The Department of the Taoiseach has a leading role in this process and my Department is heavily involved, including through our Embassy in London, our Consulate General in Edinburgh and our offices in Northern Ireland.  Other Departments are also playing their part.</p>  <p>  One obvious area that could be significantly affected is the performance of our economy.  A study by the Economic and Social Research Institute, which was commissioned by the Department of Finance, was very clear on this point.  That study also highlighted other challenges that might arise, including in terms of migration and in the energy sector.</p>  <p>  It is also the Government&rsquo;s view that a UK departure from the Union could be damaging for Northern Ireland in particular.  That is because the EU has been a force for good for everyone in the North, whether through supporting the peace process or by helping to create jobs and employment.  I recently spoke at a seminar in Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast in which I elaborated on those points and explained why I believed continued EU membership is in the interests of the people there.</p>  <p>  The Government fully recognises that we must be prepared for any scenario, including the possibility that the UK may ultimately opt to leave the EU.  However, our priority is doing all we can to ensure the UK remains in the Union in the first place.  We will continue to work towards that goal, especially as we enter a crucial period of EU negotiations on a potential package of reforms acceptable to the UK and all EU Member States.</p></reply>

These measures will assist Turkey in providing for the refugees on its territory and to prevent uncontrolled migratory flows from Turkey to the EU.  As part of this, the EU has agreed to provide a financial package worth an additional &euro;3 billion, with the establishment of a &lsquo;Refugee Facility for Turkey&rsquo; to coordinate and streamline actions financed by this package.</p><p>The Joint Action Plan includes, in particular, action on the visa liberalisation dialogue, the EU-Turkey readmission agreement, as well as, more generally, Turkey&rsquo;s EU accession process.</p><p>Turkey, for its part, has committed to implement immediately actions to stem the flow of irregular refugees and migrants to the EU and to improve the situation of refugees and migrants under temporary protection in Turkey.</p><p>In addition, the EU has agreed to re-energise Turkey&rsquo;s accession process, and I welcome the opening of Chapter 17 of the <i>acquis communautaire</i>,<font color="#4F4F4F"> </font>covering economic and monetary policies, on 14 December.  This paves the way to explore positively the opening of other Chapters of the process.</p><p>Turkey and the EU also agreed to explore further the great potential of EU-Turkey relations  and to maintain regular and enhanced dialogue through more frequent summits and high-level political meetings.  Most recently, the Turkish Foreign Minister, Mevl&uuml;t &Ccedil;avu&thorn;o&eth;lu, participated in a working lunch with EU Foreign Ministers, which I attended, at the Foreign Affairs Council on 14 December, where we had a productive discussion on international issues, including Syria.</p><p>Ireland strongly supports the recent intensified engagement between the EU and Turkey, including the outcome of the meeting of EU Heads of State or Government with Turkey on 29 November.  I welcome, in particular, the agreement to implement the EU-Turkey Joint Action Plan.  The relationship between the EU and Turkey is important in the context of the migration crisis and because of Turkey&rsquo;s status as an EU candidate country.</p><p>The EU&rsquo;s engagement with Turkey in no way changes the core requirements of all candidate countries to achieve the benchmarks and criteria for membership of the EU.  The Commission&rsquo;s most recent report on Turkey, published on 10 November highlighted concerns in several fundamental areas including in the rule of law and human rights.  The EU and Member States will continue our dialogue with Turkey in relation on these and other issues of concern in relation to the internal situation in Turkey.</p></reply>

The Burundian Government responded with extremely repressive measures, including extra-judicial killings, arbitrary detentions, and restrictions on freedom of expression.  Among those killed have been prominent members of the opposition and human rights activists. 230,000 people have fled to neighbouring countries.</p>  <p>  In an escalation of the violence, it is reported that 87 people were killed following attacks on three military bases in the capital, Bujumbura, last week.  Some of the victims appear to have been shot in reprisals carried out by the security forces.</p>  <p>  While Uganda has been leading mediation efforts on behalf of the East African Community, the process of agreeing inclusive talks amongst the stakeholders has made little progress, with daily killings still reported in the capital, Bujumbura.</p>  <p>  Ireland has joined the international community in strongly condemning the ongoing violence, and urging all involved to commence inclusive dialogue immediately.  EU Foreign Ministers adopted Council Conclusions on the crisis, and the EU has imposed sanctions on certain individuals in Burundi.  A UN Security Council Resolution, adopted in November, condemns the extra-judicial killings and arbitrary detentions, and urges the Government to engage fully in the mediation process.</p>  <p>  Ireland has supported a number of civil society organisations in Burundi through our overseas aid programme, Irish Aid.  We are also providing emergency assistance to Burundian refugees in neighbouring countries.  I am keeping the situation under review in the light of developments.</p></reply>

As such, I have discussed the Syrian crisis at almost every meeting with Ireland&rsquo;s international partners, bilaterally and multilaterally, since becoming Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  These contacts are too numerous to listed here.</p>  <p>  Ireland strongly endorses the efforts of the United Nations to renew peace negotiations based on the 2012 Geneva communique principles, in particular the ending of violence, the formation of a transitional governing body with full executive powers and a constitutional reform process which would protect Syria&rsquo;s multi-ethnic and multi-sectarian character.</p>  <p>  I welcome the announcements of 30 October and 14 November by the International Syria Support Group in Vienna, which includes the European Union and a number of EU Member States, on the launching of negotiations, the holding of elections, working for a nationwide ceasefire and supporting unimpeded humanitarian access across Syria.</p>  <p>  I reiterated our concerns on the threat posed to international peace and security by the Syrian conflict and the threat of terrorism at meetings with our partners in EU, in my address to the UN General Assembly and to UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon and at the September 2015 Summit on Countering Violent Extremism.</p>  <p>  Security Council resolution 2249 calls upon UN Member States to take all necessary measure to prevent and suppress terrorist acts by D and Al-Nusra Front (an Al-Qaeda affiliate) in territory under Da&rsquo;esh control within Syria and Iraq and to eradicate the safe haven they have established inside Syria and Iraq.  Any action undertaken under this resolution must be in compliance with international law, in particular the UN Charter, as well as international human rights, refugee, and humanitarian law.</p>  <p>  Ireland is not and will not be participating in any international military action to combat Da&rsquo;esh and is not holding discussions with other States on their military actions in Syria.</p></reply>

In furtherance of those clear objectives, our Embassy in Cairo has paid numerous consular visits to the citizen in detention, and has attended all trial hearings so far.  Such a high level of consular visitation is an important practical tool in our approach, and it means that the Embassy is well-placed to raise any concerns with the Egyptian authorities.  Indeed, numerous effective interventions have already been made on this citizen&rsquo;s behalf by the Embassy and by this Government.</p>  <p>  The most recent hearing of this citizen&rsquo;s case occurred on Tuesday 15 December.  At this hearing the presiding Judge declared that there would be a further adjournment until Saturday 19 December, due to the non-appearance of one defendant.  At this hearing the Government was represented by our Ambassador to Egypt, who spoke directly with members of the citizen&rsquo;s family, and with his Egyptian legal representation regarding aspects of his welfare.  Embassy officials intend to make another visit to the citizen in the near future as part of its overall strategy to care for his welfare while he remains in detention.</p>  <p>  I am aware that this citizen has indicated that he embarked upon a hunger strike as of 21 October.  We advised him against this course of action in the strongest possible terms during the consular visit of 23 November, and I appeal for all those in positions of influence to do likewise.  The Government remains in close contact with the Egyptian authorities regarding this citizen and they are in no doubt as to our interest in his welfare.</p></reply>

Successive Governments have made landing facilities available at Shannon Airport to the United States, in line with these strict conditions, for well over 50 years.  These arrangements have never been suspended and I do not consider that it would be appropriate to do so now.</p></reply>

It is central to our objective of a two state solution that will ensure the security and prosperity of both peoples.</p>  <p>  I continue to consider carefully whether the recognition by Ireland now of a state of Palestine, prior to its real achievement on the ground, could be a helpful step towards that goal.</p>  <p>  The motions passed in the Seanad on 22 October and the D&aacute;il on 10 December are very important factors in that consideration, but ultimately it remains a matter for assessment and decision by the Government.  Other factors are its symbolic importance for the Palestinian people, its likely impact on the prospects for advancing the peace process, and its effect on Ireland&rsquo;s own influence on the issue, which is very important to us.</p>  <p>  I have made clear that I will recommend early recognition by Ireland if I conclude that it can be helpful.</p></reply>

We will meet again before the end of the month, when I will again raise the situation in Maghaberry with her.</p>  <p>  At our recent meeting, Minister Ford updated me on progress in implementing the recommendations of the recent report by Criminal Justice Inspector, Brendan McGuigan, into conditions in the prison.  The Criminal Justice Inspector will return to Maghaberry in January to monitor progress.  I expressed my concerns at the deficiencies identified in the prison, which affect the entire prison population and, also, prison staff, and not just those in the separated regime.</p>  <p>  Minister Ford and I also discussed follow-up on the recommendations of the Independent Assessment Team report on the conditions in the prison's separated wing.  Minister Ford noted that while there had been some progress, full implementation had been affected by trust issues arising, in part, from the sense of threat to staff.  The Northern Ireland Prison Service has said that it remains committed to implementing the recommendations of the stocktake report but only in &ldquo;an environment where staff are free from threat and intimidation&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Among the challenges we discussed were the obstacles to the operation of the Prison Forum, which since July 2015 has been chaired by a representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross.  A functioning forum would make an important contribution to reducing tensions in Maghaberry.</p>  <p>  My officials maintain regular contact with the Chair of the Prison Forum and also with the members of the Independent Assessment Team.  Regrettably, due to the intensity of the political talks in Belfast, I had to postpone a meeting with the Chair scheduled for 29 October, who instead briefed my officials.</p></reply>

I have advised her that the Irish Government considers there was a political commitment made by both Governments at Weston Park in 2001 in relation to the holding of public inquiries in a number of controversial cases and that this commitment remains unfulfilled in the Pat Finucane case.</p>  <p>  In our statement to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on 8 December the Government restated our view that a satisfactory outcome to this case will ultimately be best served through a full public inquiry in accordance with the commitments made by the British and Irish Governments in the Weston Park Agreement of 2001.</p>  <p>  I very much welcome the decision on 8 December by the Committee of Ministers committing it to resume consideration of reopening its supervision of individual measures in the Pat Finucane case once the current appeals around the Judgment and Declaration of the Belfast High Court in relation to this case are completed.</p>  <p>  In its decision, the Committee also acknowledged that the de Silva review in 2011 uncovered new information that had not been previously investigated, and therefore had not taken this into account at the time the Committee decided to close individual measures in March 2009.  The Committee also noted the submission by Geraldine Finucane, the applicant in this case, requesting the Committee to reopen individual measures.</p>  <p>  At the Committee of Minister&rsquo;s meeting on 8 December in Strasbourg, the Government set out in very clear terms our support for the reopening of individual measures in the case of Pat Finucane and therefore for the Finucane family&rsquo;s request.  The Government believes that since the Committee of Ministers decided to close its consideration of individual measures in March 2009, new and significant information has come to light through the 2011 de Silva review that supports our call for the reopening of individual measures on this case.  Our support for reopening is reinforced by the Declaration of the Belfast High Court on 8 September 2015 which stated that as of March 2009, the date of the Committee of Ministers&rsquo; decision closing individual measures, there had been no effective investigation in compliance with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>  <p>  Therefore, having regard to the obligation of the Committee of Ministers under Article 46(2) to supervise the execution of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, the logical and appropriate action for the Committee to take would be to reopen the individual measures pending the outcome of the on-going police investigation which is currently reviewing the new and significant information discovered by the de Silva review.</p>  <p>  Due to the ongoing domestic proceedings in the UK in relation to this case, the Government agreed that it would be prudent for the Committee to postpone its decision on reopening individual measures until the outcome of these legal proceedings are known.  This decision took account of the practice within the Council of Europe that the Committee of Ministers should avoid making any findings in a case which is subject to proceedings in domestic courts.  I look forward to the Committee of Ministers resuming its consideration on reopening individual measures once the outcome of the ongoing appeals are known and I would note in this regard that the Committee has decided, in any event, to return to the Pat Finucane case, as part of the McKerr Group of cases, by June 2016 at the latest.</p></reply>

Ireland has the greatest impact on matters of foreign policy, including human rights, when we speak with one voice with all of our EU partners.  As such, we regularly raise human rights matters in conjunction with our EU partners through the EU Representation in Riyadh, as well as bilaterally through the Irish Mission using the complementary channel provided by our diplomatic relations with the Kingdom.</p>  <p>  Ireland also makes full use of mechanisms such as the UN Human Rights Council to raise human rights issues; we made recommendations during Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s 2013 Universal Periodic Review, and made a statement voicing serious concern at the Council on 21 September 2015 in relation to a particular death penalty issue.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s stance on the death penalty is clear: we oppose it in all circumstances, and have expressed concerns about its increased use of late in a number of countries, including Saudi Arabia.</p>  <p>  Saudi Arabia is a designated priority market for Ireland, and we have a strong, and growing, trade relationship with Saudi Arabia and its neighbours.  Saudi Arabia represents a significant market: total bilateral trade in 2013 was worth over &euro;1.36 billion.  Most of this trade is in Ireland&rsquo;s favour; the economic relationship therefore has considerable benefits for the Irish economy.</p>  <p>  The economic partnership that we have with Saudi Arabia, however, does not prevent us from raising human rights issues in the appropriate channels.  We will continue to maintain relations with Saudi Arabia: economic, for the benefit of our economy and trade; and diplomatic, to facilitate our continued engagement with the Kingdom on human rights and also on other matters as they arise.</p></reply>

These events are in addition to those I mentioned in my previous response to the Deputy, intended to be representative rather than exhaustive, and do not take account of the Embassy network&rsquo;s broader promotion of &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East&rsquo; on social media or in an informal manner in the context of other events that promote Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Embassy of Ireland in Norway has promoted the &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East&rsquo; campaign via the organisation of a roundtable event with several Norwegian tour operators in conjunction with Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s Nordic branch office. As part of this discussion there was a particular focus on the &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East&rsquo; promotion.</p>  <p>  Further afield, the Embassy of Ireland in China has worked with Tourism Ireland on promoting &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East&rsquo; since June 2015.  Tourism Ireland launched this destination during this year's China Sales Mission which took place in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chengdu.  In addition, a bespoke trade and consumer ezine themed on &lsquo;Ireland's Ancient East&rsquo; was widely circulated in September.</p>  <p>  The Embassy of Ireland in Australia works with Tourism Ireland to promote tourism generally.  During Canberra&rsquo;s annual multicultural festival in February 2015, &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East&rsquo; was promoted at the Ireland stand.  More recently, the Deputy Consul General in Sydney attended a key trade event held at Sydney Tower on 2 November 2015 in which Tourism Ireland promoted &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  On a more general level, Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Mission to UNESCO in Paris assists in obtaining UNESCO recognition of appropriate sites in Ireland, which could include sites falling under the region covered by &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  Looking ahead, there are plans in train for promotion of &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East&rsquo; in 2016, including across the key German market and, in February, the Embassy of Ireland in Denmark will support a Tourism Ireland-hosted workshop in Copenhagen aimed at the whole Scandinavian travel industry which will mark the official launch of &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East&rsquo; in the Nordic region.</p>  <p>  In 2016, Tourism Ireland in China will continue to promote Ireland's Ancient East through trade, digital and publicity channels.  The month long St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day festival, which is organised in several major cities by Team Ireland in China, will provide a major platform for promoting Ireland, including all of its tourism destinations.  Promotional material highlighting &lsquo;Ireland's Ancient East&rsquo; will be provided to partners in the travel industry during sales calls and at trade training sessions throughout 2016.  In the second half of 2016 there will be an online campaign focussed on the region.</p>  <p>  In South Africa, at the AGM of the Embassy-supported BISA (Business Ireland Southern Africa) network in Pretoria on Friday 13 November, the Tourism Ireland agent based in South Africa presented &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East&rsquo; to the representatives present from Irish Business Networks in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban and Harare.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy has specific thoughts on how the Embassy network, working closely with the State agencies and Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, might additionally promote or showcase &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East&rsquo; and other tourism initiatives, I would be very happy to discuss these with her.</p></reply>

Central to this commitment is enabling and encouraging business enterprises to become more competitive by integrating responsible and sustainable business practices and respect for human rights across their operations.  The National Plan on Business and Human Rights will seek to create functional tools to help business enterprises achieve this, targeting, among others, the Small and Medium Enterprises sector in Ireland which accounts for the vast majority of enterprises.</p>  <p>  The Working Outline of the Plan sets out the current state of play in relation to actions which already assist in the implementation of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and also sets out some 54 action points which could be taken over the two to three year period after the adoption of the final version of the plan.</p>  <p>  Comments and submissions on the Working Outline are invited by 29 January 2016.

In recent weeks I met with the British Foreign Secretary in London, delivered a speech in Belfast focused on Northern Ireland and the EU, and hosted a business event on &ldquo;Brexit&rdquo; at Iveagh House.</p>  <p>  It is certainly very important that we develop a full understanding &ndash; insofar as is possible &ndash; of the potential implications of a British withdrawal from the EU and that we are prepared for any scenario.  We will continue to work with that in mind.  Our priority, however, as I have said before, is doing what we can to help ensure the UK does not decide to leave the EU in the first place.</p></reply>

This instability is also impacting on Europe in the form of both large scale migration and the recent terrorist attacks.</p>  <p>  Airstrikes have been conducted against Da&rsquo;esh in Iraq and Syria for a number of months.  It is for individual States to determine in what way they might best contribute to the concerted international effort underway to tackle the threat posed by Da&rsquo;esh and other UN-designated terrorist groups.</p>  <p>  Security Council resolution 2249 calls upon UN Member States to take all necessary measure to prevent and suppress terrorist acts by Da&rsquo;esh and Al-Nusra Front (an Al-Qaeda affiliate) in territory under Da&rsquo;esh control within Syria and Iraq and to eradicate the safe haven they have established inside Syria and Iraq.  Any action undertaken under this resolution must be in compliance with international law, in particular the UN Charter, as well as international human rights, refugee, and humanitarian law.</p>  <p>  Ireland is not and will not be participating in any international military action to combat Da&rsquo;esh and is not holding discussions with other States on their military actions in Syria.</p>  <p>  While the crisis in Syria features in almost every discussion at the Foreign Affairs Council, there has been no discussion on the question of military action against Da&rsquo;esh at EU level on this issue, as it is exclusively the competence of national governments.  However, at my recent meeting with the UK&rsquo;s Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond there was some discussion of the then impending parliamentary vote on UK airstrikes in Syria.</p></reply>

Through our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates throughout the U.S., and in conjunction with regular high level political visits, the Government continues to promote the immigration reform agenda with high level Government contacts in the United States and with many other individuals and groups across Irish America and beyond.</p>  <p>  As I indicated to Deputy Naughten last month, the Government are aware of and have raised the matter of waivers for 3 and 10 year travel bans in relation to US visa applications for Irish undocumented who have overstayed their visa in the United States.</p>  <p>  At my request, the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade wrote to the US Ambassador earlier this year to ask him to explore further the question of such waivers.  I have also had the opportunity to directly discuss the matter with the US Ambassador.  The Taoiseach also raised waivers, amongst other immigration reform issues, during his visit to Washington for St Patrick&rsquo;s Day.</p>  <p>  I can offer some information on the basis of these representations and responses.</p>  <p>  The US Embassy has indicated that the US waiver system operates uniformly worldwide, including in Ireland, and is applied in strict accordance with US laws and regulations.  Such a waiver can be applied for in the case of a 3 or 10 year ban having been imposed for overstaying a visa in the US.</p>  <p>  However, the US Embassy has also underlined that applications are assessed individually on a case-by-case basis, with final decisions on each a matter for the US authorities in Washington, and that accordingly an applicant would not be able to predict with any degree of certainty as to whether he or she would be successful or not.</p>  <p>  The Government has sought to advance all viable opportunities to achieve relief for our undocumented citizens in the United States.  While I am disappointed that representations to the US on this matter have not resulted in a more encouraging outcome, ultimately it is a matter for the US Government and US Embassy to interpret and implement their immigration laws.</p>  <p>  The Government as a whole, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin and our Embassy in Washington, will continue to actively follow up on all opportunities to improve the situation of the Irish undocumented with the US Administration, with Congress, and with the US Embassy in Ireland.  In addition, the Government continues to provide significant financial support, &euro;1,535,911   in 2015, to support the work of various Irish immigration centres across the US.</p></reply>

Settlement goods are not entitled to the lower tariffs that are the norm in the EU, and meat from settlements may not be certified by Israeli veterinary authorities.  EU research funding may not be spent in settlements.  Most recently, the European Commission last month clarified that goods from settlements may not be misleadingly labelled as being produce of Israel.  Ireland has supported all of these measures.</p>  <p>  This is part of a general approach, in line with the conclusions of the Council in December 2012, to differentiate the EU's relationship with Israel from the relationship with the settlements.</p>  <p>  There is no prospect whatever at present of obtaining agreement at EU level on a ban on the import of goods from the settlements.  And while that remains the case, it would be futile and counterproductive for Ireland to try to push such an approach.  The reasons for this have been explained on a number of occasions in more detail with Oireachtas Committees.</p></reply>

DA'ESH's horrific crimes in Paris and Beirut, as well as their systematic crimes against the rights and the existence of ethnic, religious and LGBTI minorities, women and children across the Middle East must be prevented by all legal means possible.</p><p>At the UN Human Rights Council in September 2015, Ireland made a number of statements in which we condemned DA'ESH'S barbarous treatment of civilians, their campaign of violence against religious and ethnic minorities in Syria and Iraq, and their treatment of women and girls, including their being subjected to harrowing acts of sexual and physical violence and to sexual slavery.  We have urged the Security Council to uphold international law and ensure full accountability for crimes committed in Syria by referring the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court.</p><p>UNSCR 2249 grants authority for States to take all necessary measure to suppress and eradicate terrorist acts by DA'ESH in territory under its control within Syria and Iraq and to eradicate the safe haven they have established inside Syria and Iraq.  Any action undertaken under this resolution must be in compliance with international law, in particular the UN Charter, as well as international human rights, refugee, and humanitarian law.</p><p>Defeating DA'ESH cannot be separated from ending the Syrian conflict.  It is the Syrian conflict, and above all the actions and policies of the Assad regime, which has created this terrorist threat.  The attack in Paris underlines the critical importance of bringing the Syrian conflict to a close.</p><p>I welcome the statement of the International Syria Support Group on 14 November in Vienna on the launching of negotiations, the holding of elections and supporting unimpeded humanitarian access across Syria.</p><p>The conflict in Syria has had immense humanitarian consequences and Ireland is playing its part in alleviating the suffering of those affected.  By the end of 2015, we have pledged that our support for the Syrian people will reach &euro;42 million<i>.  </i>Funding is spent on priority needs which include food aid, water and sanitation, shelter, education and protection, including child protection and prevention of gender-based violence.</p><p>The brutal activities of Boko Haram continue to represent a serious threat to the peace and security of Nigeria, but also the wider region.  They also involve the clear and persistent abuse of human rights, especially of women and girls, and a direct threat to education and education facilities.</p><p>There has been some success this year in pushing Boko Haram back from major towns in north-eastern Nigeria.  A Multinational Joint Taskforce involving troops from Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Benin has been operationalised.</p><p>EU Foreign Ministers adopted detailed Conclusions in February, condemning the appalling atrocities committed by Boko Haram and confirming the EU's readiness to provide support to the region.  Since then, an EU Political Framework for Crisis Approach (PFCA) for Boko Haram has been developed, and EU support of up to &euro;50 million for the Multinational Joint Taskforce has been approved.</p><p>The EU has also pledged to continue providing immediate humanitarian relief to those affected by Boko Haram activities and to increase its efforts at a regional level - mobilising &euro;21 million of humanitarian funding last June for the four countries concerned.  Ireland is also providing direct support of nearly &euro;1.4 million this year to address humanitarian needs.</p><p>The situation concerning Boko Haram was discussed at a meeting convened by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on 30 June and at a Special Session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in April.  At these meetings, Ireland highlighted the terrible human rights and humanitarian impact of the terrorist violence.</p><p>More generally on human rights, Ireland and the EU consistently press for effective action to counter the persecution of minorities in all relevant international fora.  Ireland strongly condemns all forms of persecution on the basis of religion or belief, irrespective of where they occur or who the victims are.  I highlighted the alarming rise in attacks on Christians when I addressed the UN General Assembly in October and the UN Human Rights Council in March.</p><p>Ireland works within and alongside the EU to address persecution of Christians and other religious minorities, notably through the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief adopted during Ireland's Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013 and the EU-led General Assembly resolution on Freedom of Religion or Belief which was adopted by the Third Committee last month.</p></reply>

In furtherance of those clear objectives, our Embassy in Cairo has made numerous consular visits to the citizen in detention, and has attended all trial hearings so far.  The high level of consular visitation is an important practical tool in our approach, and it means that the Embassy is well-placed to raise any concerns with the Egyptian authorities.  Indeed, numerous effective interventions have already been made on this citizen's behalf by the Embassy and by this Government.</p>  <p>  The most recent hearing of this citizen's case occurred on Tuesday 15 December.  At this hearing the presiding Judge declared that there would be a further adjournment until Saturday 19 December, due to the non-appearance of one defendant.

Among the issues we discussed was the situation in Maghaberry prison, including the regime for separated prisoners.</p>  <p>  My last meeting with Secretary of State Theresa Villiers was on 17 November, as we concluded the negotiation of the 'Fresh Start' Agreement.  We will meet again before the end of the month, when I will again raise the situation in Maghaberry with her.</p>  <p>  At our recent meeting, Minister Ford updated me on progress in implementing the recommendations of the recent report by Criminal Justice Inspector, Brendan McGuigan, into conditions in the prison.  The Criminal Justice Inspector will return to Maghaberry in January to monitor progress.  I expressed my concerns at the deficiencies identified in the prison, which affect the entire prison population and, also, prison staff, and not just those in the separated regime.</p>  <p>  Minister Ford and I also discussed follow-up on the recommendations of the Independent Assessment Team report on the conditions in the prison's separated wing.  Minister Ford noted that while there had been some progress, full implementation had been affected by trust issues arising, in part, from the sense of threat to staff.  The Northern Ireland Prison Service has said that it remains committed to implementing the recommendations of the stocktake report but only in &ldquo;an environment where staff are free from threat and intimidation&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Among the challenges we discussed were the obstacles to the operation of the Prison Forum, which since July 2015 has been chaired by a representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross.  A functioning forum would make an important contribution to reducing tensions in Maghaberry.</p>  <p>  My officials maintain regular contact with the Chair of the Prison Forum and also with the members of the Independent Assessment Team.  Regrettably, due to the intensity of the political talks in Belfast, I had to postpone a meeting with the Chair scheduled for 29 October, who instead briefed my officials.</p></reply>

It is central to our objective of a two state solution that will ensure the security and prosperity of both peoples.</p>  <p>  I continue to consider carefully whether the recognition by Ireland now of a state of Palestine, prior to its real achievement on the ground, could be a helpful step towards that goal.</p>  <p>  The motions passed in the Seanad on 22 October and the D&aacute;il on 10 December are very important factors in that consideration.  Other factors are its symbolic importance for the Palestinian people, its likely impact on the prospects for advancing the peace process, and its effect on Ireland's ability to exercise influence on developments.  Ultimately this is a matter for assessment and decision by the Government.</p>  <p>  I have made clear that I will recommend early recognition by Ireland if I conclude that it can be helpful.</p></reply>

The recent attacks in Paris, Tunisia, Lebanon and elsewhere, including those in which Irish citizens have been murdered and wounded, show that Da'esh's terrorist crimes are an international and indiscriminate phenomenon which does not respect borders or nationality.</p>  <p>  The threat posed by international terrorism requires a coordinated response from the international community.  An effective response also requires a comprehensive approach which addresses root causes and contributory factors, promotes a counter-narrative, prevents radicalisation, deters and disrupts terrorist travel, addresses terrorist financing and brings perpetrators to justice.</p>  <p>  Ireland, in common with all other UN Member States has a duty to implement relevant UN Security Council Resolutions and we have taken steps to do so.  These Resolutions include UNSCR 2161 on freezing the funds and other assets of terrorist groupings and UNSCR 2178 on measures to suppress the recruiting, organising, transporting or equipping of individuals who travel to another State in order to perpetrate, plan or participate in terrorist acts or training.</p>  <p>  Ireland is not and will not be participating in any international military action to combat Da'esh.</p>  <p>  It is for individual States to determine in what way they might best contribute to the concerted international effort underway to tackle the threat posed by DA'ESH and other UN-designated terrorist groups.  Security Council resolution 2249 calls upon UN Member States to &ldquo;take all necessary measures, in compliance with international law, in particular with the United Nations Charter, as well as international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law, on the territory under the control of ISIL also known as Da'esh, in Syria and Iraq, to redouble and coordinate their efforts to prevent and suppress terrorist acts committed specifically by ISIL also known as Da'esh as well as ANF, and all other individuals, groups, undertakings, and entities associated with Al Qaeda, and other terrorist groups, as designated by the United Nations Security Council, and as may further be agreed by the International Syria Support Group (ISSG) and endorsed by the UN Security Council, pursuant to the Statement of the International Syria Support Group (ISSG) of 14 November, and to eradicate the safe haven they have established over significant parts of Iraq and Syria".</p></reply>

In 2014 average appeal processing times for an oral hearing had almost halved to 28.6 weeks and the average time taken to process appeals involving summary decisions had also significantly reduced to 21.1 weeks.  This downward trend in overall appeal processing times has continued to date in 2015 to 25.7 weeks for an oral hearing and 18.2 weeks for a summary decision.  </p><p>The reduction in processing times reflects the significant resources which have been invested in the Social Welfare Appeals Office over the last number of years.  </p><p>In addition the Department has undertaken a process of reform in many of its scheme areas aimed at reducing the time taken to respond to requests for submissions in relation to appeals.  Appeal processing times are kept under continual review in the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p><p>In addition to the improvement in processing times, these measures have also led to a significant reduction in the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 9,057 at 14 December 2015.</p><p>Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department's Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  The system is flexible and accessible and <font color="#2F2F2F">allows multiple reviews and submissions of fresh evidence at all stages.</font>For logistical reasons the process takes longer when an oral hearing is required.</p><p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.</p><p><b>Appeals processing times by scheme 01/01-2014-31/12/2014</b><table><tr><th></th><th>Average processing times (weeks) -

In all cases, the data are expressed as a percentage of the population aged 15-24, and are averages of the four quarters in the relevant year.<table><tr><th></th><th rowspan="2" colspan="2">All young persons not in education, training or employment (NEET)</th><th colspan="6">Of whom</th></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">Unemployed</td><td colspan="2">Others who would like to work (seeking employment or not)</td><td colspan="2">All who would like to work</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>EU 28</td><td>IRL</td><td>EU 28</td><td>IRL</td><td>EU 28</td><td>IRL</td><td>EU 28</td><td>IRL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="9">Percentage of Population aged 15-24 in years</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>10.9</td><td>10.8</td><td>4.9</td><td>4.3</td><td>2.6</td><td>1.2</td><td>7.5</td><td>5.5</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>10.9</td><td>15.0</td><td>5.0</td><td>6.7</td><td>2.4</td><td>1.4</td><td>7.4</td><td>8.1</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>12.4</td><td>18.6</td><td>6.3</td><td>9.7</td><td>2.6</td><td>2.1</td><td>8.9</td><td>11.8</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>12.8</td><td>19.2</td><td>6.5</td><td>10.1</td><td>2.7</td><td>2.2</td><td>9.2</td><td>12.3</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>12.9</td><td>18.8</td><td>6.6</td><td>10.0</td><td>2.8</td><td>2.1</td><td>9.4</td><td>12.1</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>13.2</td><td>18.7</td><td>6.9</td><td>10.1</td><td>2.8</td><td>2.1</td><td>9.7</td><td>12.2</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>13.0</td><td>16.1</td><td>6.9</td><td>8.3</td><td>2.7</td><td>2.1</td><td>9.6</td><td>10.4</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>12.5</td><td>15.2</td><td>6.4</td><td>7.1</td><td>2.7</td><td>1.7</td><td>9.1</td><td>8.8</td></tr></table></p><p>The proportion of young people aged 15-24 who are NEET rose from just under 11% in 2007 (close to the then EU average) to over 19% in 2010 (some 6.4 percentage points above the EU average in that year.  The proportion NEET has been falling since 2012, reaching 15.2% in 2014; this was 2.7 percentage points above the EU average for 2014.</p><p>The overall NEET figure includes some, but not all of the young unemployed (some of whom may be engaged in education or training).  As shown in the table, the group who are both NEET and unemployed represented approximately 4% of the young adult population in 2007, 10% in 2010-2012, and 7% in 2014.  This figure, again, rose from below the EU level in 2007 to well above the EU average in 2010, but had fallen back towards the EU average in 2014.</p><p>The NEET figure also includes a number of inactive groups (i.e. persons who are not seeking work) &ndash; primarily full-time students on short breaks from education, people with caring responsibilities, and people with disabilities.  Some of these young people, while not currently seeking work, indicate that they would nevertheless like to work.  As shown in the table, this group has averaged between 1.2% and 2.1% of the young adult population in recent years &ndash; generally somewhat below the EU average.</p><p>Taking together the unemployed and inactive people who would like to work, the share of the young adult population accounted for by people who are NEET and are either seeking or would like to work rose from 5.5% in 2007 (when the EU average was 7.5%) to 12.3% in 2010 (EU average 9.2%) and had fallen back to 8.8% in 2014 as compared with the EU average of 9.1% in that year.</p><p>The trend in the NEET data and in the data for the sub-groups identified in the table reflects the significant worsening in labour market conditions for young people between 2007 and 2010, and the subsequent improvement in the situation that began in 2012.</p></reply>

This will also benefit many of those gaining from the increase in the minimum wage.  </p>  <p>  Currently Class A employees become liable to pay PRSI on all earnings, once weekly earnings exceed &euro;352.01.  This creates a &ldquo;step effect&rdquo; as net income reduces immediately by the full 4% PRSI charge applied to all earnings.  This means that a &euro;0.01 increase in weekly earnings of &euro;352 attracts a weekly PRSI charge of &euro;14.08.  The introduction of the PRSI Credit will address the &ldquo;step effect&rdquo; by reducing the actual amount of PRSI charged, for those earning between &euro;352.01 and &euro;424 in a week.  At weekly earnings of &euro;352.01 the maximum PRSI Credit of &euro;12 will reduce the PRSI charge payable from &euro;14.08 to &euro;2.08.</p>  <p>  The Family Income Supplement (FIS) income thresholds will also increase by &euro;5 for families with one child and &euro;10 for families with two or more children thereby benefitting lower income households.</p>  <p>  The income disregards for means tested schemes are being fully maintained for all schemes.  In the case of Jobseeker's Transition, the income disregards for earnings from employment will increase from &euro;60 to &euro;90 and the taper will reduce from 60% to 50%.</p></reply>

As most of the Social Welfare Bills which have been published since March 2011 have provided for the implementation of various budgetary measures, RIAs have not been considered necessary in relation to these measures.  Social Welfare Bills also provide for a range of other miscellaneous and technical amendments to the social welfare code and these types of amendments are not considered amenable to the undertaking of an RIA.</p><p>Regulatory Impact Analyses have been undertaken in relation to significant non-budgetary matters reflected in certain Bills.  Two such RIAs have been published since March 2011.  One of these RIAs relates to amendments to the funding standard applying to defined benefit pension schemes, which were provided for in Part 3 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012.  This RIA is available at  .</p><p>The other RIA relates to the measures to provide for the transposition of certain aspects of Directive 2010/41/EU on the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity, in so far as they relate to ensuring that the spouse or civil partner of a self-employed worker can benefit from social protection in accordance with national law.  The amendments necessary to transpose these provisions are contained in section 19 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2014.  This RIA is available at .</p><p>In addition, Part 4 of the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 implemented the recommendations of the Critical Review of the Pensions Board.  This review, which involved a public consultation process, was carried out under the Public Service Reform plan.  This review is available at .</p><p>Part 3 of the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2013 provided for changes in the manner in which the resources of a defined benefit pension scheme are distributed on the wind up of a pension scheme.  On the publication of this Bill, the Department of Social Protection also published a report by Mercer on the changes to occupational pensions.  This report undertook a detailed modelling exercise of different approaches to the changes to the order of priority given to the disbursement of assets when a defined benefit pension scheme winds up.  This is available at .  </p><p>In the period since March 2011 I have also published three Bills relating to civil registration matters which were subsequently enacted.  The Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2012 provided for an extension of the list of bodies authorised to solemnise marriages.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-12-17a.139.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121700057#WRB07400"><p>The Department of Social Protection supports service provision through a number of programmes and schemes.  The Community Services Programme (CSP) supports community companies that operate on a community business or social enterprise model.  Companies supported by the CSP generate and use income from the services they provide to pay staff, meet overhead costs and to contribute to future development.  The CSP provides a contribution to the wage cost on the basis that the services are not fully self-financing or the cost of provision would be prohibitive on users.</p>  <p>  Currently, there are 398 active contracts in place with community companies at a cost of &euro;42 million per annum.  The Programme directly supports 2,110 full-time positions.  Of these positions, a financial contribution of &euro;32,000 per annum is made to support the employment of managers, of which there are 312 currently.  Funds are also provided as a contribution to the cost of employing people in some 1,800 full-time equivalent positions.  The Department estimates that some 2,800 people are employed across these companies with direct CSP support.  Another 1,100 people are employed in these companies without public funding support.  Additionally, the companies provide some 1,500 work placements through CE, the Rural Social Scheme and T&uacute;s.  These companies are valuable to the social fabric of the country and provide very good quality services, particularly in poorer urban areas and rural villages where services are not widely available. </p>  <p>  Since the CSP became operational in 2006, it has helped companies to move from a situation where the minimum wage was paid to a position today where 60% of employees are paid above this level.  The Department is committed to working with the remaining companies to work towards paying a reasonable wage.  The resurgent economy will support this move.  A core requirement of the Programme is that service providers generate non-public revenues from their operations by the sale of goods, charging fees for services delivered or fundraising.  </p>  <p>  Companies in contract with CSP must be not-for-profit, social enterprise or community business in nature.  This does not mean that they should not aspire to make reasonable returns from their activities that allow for a good wage to be paid.  The CSP operates very clearly on the basis that it provides a &ldquo;contribution only&rdquo; to offset the wage costs of service provision.  However, it is entirely a matter for each service provider to set their own wage levels.  </p>  <p>  The Deputies should note that some 45% of non-management staff are paid the minimum wage in companies in contract to the CSP, contrary to the requirements of the programme to pay the local pay rate.  Ten percent were paid above the proposed living wage of &euro;11.50 per hour and the remaining 45% are paid between these ranges.  The development of the Programme and the companies in recent years has ensured that the majority of companies do not continue to operate with a low pay model.  </p>  <p>  The Department is working with Pobal to put in place arrangements that will allow companies to apply in a structured manner to access short-term financial support, if that is needed to deal with the issues identified.  The arrangements which are being prepared will be notified to companies early in the New Year.</p></reply>

In 10 of these cases no evidence was found of a data breach and 8 cases are still under investigation.</p>  <p>  In the remaining 24 cases, data breaches occurred where customer information was erroneously and inadvertently disclosed to third parties (e.g., letters incorrectly addressed).  In each case, efforts were immediately made to secure the compromised data, and the affected customers were informed.  They were issued with a letter of unreserved apology and informed of their entitlement to contact the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner if they so wished.  Local management examined work practices that led to the error being made and put measures in place to prevent a recurrence. </p>  <p>  In each of these incidents, the action taken to address the breach was consistent with the Data Protection Commissioner's Personal Data Security Breach Code of Practice.  </p>  <p>  While every data breach is a matter of great concern to the Department, the number of confirmed breaches should be viewed in the context of the scale of the Department's business; during 2014, a total of 1.9 million applications were processed by the Department, a similar figure to that which is expected to be returned for 2015. </p>  <p>  The Department takes its responsibilities in relation to data protection very seriously.  Every effort is made to ensure that personal customer data is used solely for business purposes and that it is not compromised in any way.  The Department has data protection and information security policies, standards, procedures and guidelines in place governing the use of its computer systems and customer data.  </p>  <p>  All members of staff of the Department are regularly reminded of their data protection obligations and the consequences of not adhering to policies such as loss of pay increment(s), loss of entitlement to enter promotional competitions and dismissal.  Staff members are required to sign annual undertakings that they have read, and will act in accordance with, data protection policies and guidelines. </p>  <p>  A high-level working group is in place to examine, and progress, all aspects of data protection compliance in the Department.</p>  <p>  In June the Department ran its annual Data Protection Awareness Week for staff.  Activities this year included a very effective short video on social engineering which was developed in-house and made available to all staff; a data protection newsletter issued to all staff; presentations were made to hundreds of staff nationwide and posters were exhibited in headquarter and local offices drawing attention to the importance of securing customers' personal data.</p></reply>

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people.</p><p>The Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular.  This is the rationale behind the Government's Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan.</p><p>Within this framework, the Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment, education or training within four months of becoming unemployed. The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs.  There is monthly engagement with all young jobseekers.  For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training.  Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and Tus, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment. </p><p>Overall, the Youth Guarantee provided nearly 25,000 places for young people in 2014.  This figure excludes some 24,000 places provided for young people through PLC courses and apprenticeships.  These PLC and apprenticeship places, together with the wide range of vocational third-level courses provided for the young, although not reserved for unemployed jobseekers, nevertheless contribute to the spirit of the guarantee. </p><p>The following table details the expected full year intake on relevant programmes for 2015 as well the actual number of starters up to the most recent date for which data are available.  </p><p><b>Youth Guarantee Progress 2015 Starters</b><table><tr><th>Programme</th><th>Expected full-year intake</th><th>2015 information to date</th><th>Note</th></tr><tr><td>Youthreach/Community Training Centres</td><td>3,300</td><td>2,168</td><td>As of end November 2015 (CTCs), May 2015 (Youthreach)</td></tr><tr><td>JobBridge  </td><td>5,000</td><td>2,120</td><td>As of mid December 2015</td></tr><tr><td>T&uacute;s</td><td>1,000</td><td>1,070</td><td>As of end September 2015</td></tr><tr><td>JobsPlus (including JobPlus Youth)</td><td>1,500</td><td>721</td><td>As of end October 2015</td></tr><tr><td>Momentum</td><td>2,000</td><td>1,053</td><td>As of mid December 2015</td></tr><tr><td>BTEA (excl Momentum)</td><td>3,300</td><td>N/A</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>BTWEA</td><td>200</td><td>151</td><td>As of end September 2015</td></tr><tr><td>VTOS</td><td>500</td><td>N/A </td><td>Enrolment begins in September</td></tr><tr><td>Former F&Aacute;S/SOLAS*</td><td>9500</td><td>6,409</td><td>Based on Specific Skills Training, Traineeship, Bridging and Local Training Initiative starters end November 2015.</td></tr><tr><td>County Enterprise Board Youth Entrepreneurship Training and Mentoring supports.</td><td>700</td><td>N/A</td><td>This programme has been superseded by Ireland's Best Young Entrepreneur 2014/5 competition</td></tr><tr><td>Micro Finance Ireland micro-loans for young people.</td><td>150</td><td>N/A</td><td>Age-specific breakdowns not yet available.</td></tr><tr><td>International Work Experience and Training</td><td>250</td><td>8 </td><td>As of mid December 2015</td></tr><tr><td>Gateway</td><td>450</td><td>272 </td><td>As of end September 2015</td></tr><tr><td>Community Employment</td><td>500</td><td>686 </td><td>As of mid December 2015</td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>28,350</td><td>14,650</td><td>Excluding where figures are not available</td></tr></table>*F&Aacute;S &ndash; Former Training and Employment Authority/SOLAS &ndash; Further Education and Training Authority</p><p>*<b>NB </b>The figures above refer to the cumulative starters under 25 upon entry to the programme, from 1<sup>st</sup>January 2015.</p><p>Direct measures of employment from the Youth Guarantee process are unavailable. However, of the 61,000 young people entering full unemployment in 2014, 26,200 had exited to employment by June 2015, while an additional 8,100 exits were to unknown destinations, of which a significant proportion are likely to be to employment.  An additional 3,600 took up education while 8,800 took up training opportunities.  The expectation is that most of those taking up education and training opportunities will find employment on completion of the programmes involved.</p><p>Annual expenditure on the core programmes identified in the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan was estimated at approximately &euro;336 million for 2014, with a further expenditure on other relevant programmes (Apprenticeship and PLC courses) of &euro;192 million.  Actual expenditure on participation by young people on this range of programmes in 2015 will depend on the ultimate take-up of places, and can be estimated only after the end of the financial year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-12-17a.161.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121700058#WRC01800"><p>The social welfare system is primarily a contingency-based system, with entitlement based on a number of defined contingencies such as sickness, unemployment, old age or widowhood.</p>  <p>  There are two basic principles which underpin the Irish social insurance system.  Firstly there is the contributory principle.  Under this principle there is a link between the PRSI contributions that a person has paid and entitlement to a varying range of benefits and pensions.  Where a person has sufficient PRSI contributions, then benefits and pensions may be paid, subject to legislative provisions, where a particular contingency arises and without a means test.</p>  <p>  Secondly there is the solidarity principle.  Under this principle the benefits and pensions that are paid are not directly related to the amount of PRSI contributions paid by insured persons.  PRSI contribution income is instead redistributed to support contributors who are more vulnerable.  In this regard, it should be noted that some PRSI contributors do not experience all of the contingencies during their life.  For example, one contributor may never require access to Invalidity Pension whereas it may be a crucial support for another.  It should also be noted that access to Widow's/Widower's/Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension is available to those who have been married or in a civil partnership only, and that scheme will not benefit someone who has been single all their life.</p>  <p>  To qualify for a Widow's or Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension, either the person claiming or their late spouse or civil partner must have a certain number of PRSI contributions.  All the PRSI requirements must be met on one person's record - one may not combine the contributions of either spouses or civil partners.  All must have been made before the death of the spouse or civil partner.  Virtually all PRSI contributions count towards this pension, including contributions paid by public servants and the self-employed. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the pension system is to provide a person with an adequate income.  The rate of payment is set with this objective in mind, and the fact that there are a number of ways one can qualify for such a pension does not mean someone may qualify for multiple pensions.  There is, therefore, a principle of one person, one payment, which generally applies across the whole of the social welfare system.  Given the contingency-based nature of this system, it can happen that a person may experience more than one contingency at the same time.  For example, an unemployed person may become sick.  As a consequence, if a person experiences more than one of these contingencies at the same time, he or she can receive only one of those payments.  This principle is common to social security systems across the world.</p>  <p>  While there may be other arrangements regarding private pensions, those pensions would not generally have the solidarity based provisions common to social welfare pensions, nor the high level of State subsidy which exists for schemes financed by the Social Insurance Fund.</p>  <p>  Amending the State pensions system, to allow two pensions be paid to one person, would be a significant change to the system, providing one person with the pension income of two people, and would greatly increase the cost of the scheme.  This extra cost would have to be financed from either an increase in the rate of PRSI contributions, an increase in the Exchequer subvention to the scheme, or a reduction in the rate of payments.  I have no plans to introduce such a change.</p></reply>

Last year, I partially re-introduced a 25% bonus, and this year, I was pleased to announce a 75% bonus for over 1.2 million long-term social welfare recipients, such as pensioners, people with disabilities, carers and long-term jobseekers.  Illness Benefit was never eligible for the bonus in the past and similar arrangements apply this year. </p>  <p>  While the short-term Illness Benefit scheme is not eligible for the bonus, recipients of long-term disability payments are eligible.  In this regard, persons who are permanently incapable of work may be eligible for the non-means tested Invalidity Pension (subject to satisfying the relevant medical criteria).  Persons who are substantially restricted in undertaking suitable employment arising from a medical condition may be eligible for the means tested Disability Allowance (subject to the relevant medical criteria).  All recipients of both of these payments are eligible for the Christmas Bonus. </p>  <p>  The introduction of new employment and internship schemes such as JobBridge, T&uacute;s and Gateway has given rise to a number of complex issues in relation to the 15 months requirement for Jobseeker's Allowance recipients to qualify for the bonus.  Any jobseeker who was previously on JobBridge and who has not received the bonus should contact the local office who will examine their entitlement.</p></reply>

FIS is designed to prevent child and family poverty and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment as compared to social welfare payments.  There are currently some 54,000 families with some 119,000 children in receipt of FIS.  Expenditure on FIS is estimated to be of the order of &euro;349.2 million in 2015.</p><p>To qualify for payment of FIS, a person must be engaged in insurable employment which is expected to last for at least three months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  Therefore, self-employed people are not eligible for FIS.</p><p>There are a number of factors that would have to be taken in to account in any consideration of extending eligibility for FIS to include self-employed persons:</p><p>- the practical difficulties in defining and controlling an alternative to the hours worked condition;</p><p>- establishing satisfactorily a self-employed person's hours of employment and certifying this on an ongoing basis;</p><p>- existing arrangements to provide income support to self-employed people on low incomes, such as jobseeker's allowance and farm assist for low-income farmers;</p><p>- the cost of extending the scheme to the self-employed would be considerable.</p><p>Given the above, I have no plans to extend FIS to the self-employed. </p><p>I would bring the Deputy's attention to the Back to Work Family Dividend, for which self-employed people are eligible.  The scheme, which the Department of Social Protection introduced in early 2015, helps families to move from social welfare into employment, including self-employment, by retaining their qualified child increase for up to two years.</p></reply>

The 2015 Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseekers' schemes of &euro;3.01 billion.</p>  <p>  It is a fundamental qualifying condition of both schemes that a person must be fully unemployed for four days in any period of seven consecutive days.  A person working four or more days a week will not qualify for a jobseeker's payment, even if they work only a small number of hours on those days.</p>  <p>  The Department does not collect data on the number of hours a jobseeker works as this information is not necessary to make a decision on an application for a jobseeker's payment.  In this context the cost associated with moving the jobseeker's benefit scheme to an hours-based system, as outlined by the Deputy, cannot be ascertained.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that a changing labour market has resulted in a move away from more traditional work patterns, resulting in an increase in the number of persons employed for less than a full week.  However, any changes to the current criteria, such as moving to an hours based system, could result in significant numbers of individuals becoming eligible for a jobseeker's payment with substantial corresponding cost implications for the Exchequer.</p></reply>

These contributions entitle them to access social insurance benefits, including State pension (contributory), widow/widower or surviving civil partner's (contributory) pension, guardians payment (contributory), maternity benefit and adoptive benefit.  In contrast, a combined employer and employee rate of 14.75% is paid in respect of class A employees, who can then access the full range of social insurance benefits, including jobseeker's benefit. </p>  <p>  The most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund published in 2012 found that the effective annual rate of contribution for those on national average earnings, needed to provide the core full-rate State Pension (Contributory), (which is the main benefit currently available to self-employed contributors), is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  The Review also found that: </p>  <p>  - An incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if Jobseekers Benefit in addition to core State Pension (Contributory) is provided.</p>  <p>  - The average contribution rate required for the core State Pension (Contributory) plus the Invalidity Pension is estimated to be in the region of 17%. </p>  <p>  Using a number of assumptions based on the existing population of contributors and beneficiaries, the report estimated the full year incremental costs of extending Jobseekers Benefit and Invalidity Pension to the self-employed, stated in 2016 terms, to be &euro;76m and &euro;93m respectively.  This was based on the assumption that the incidence rate of benefit is the same as that applying to the overall population and assuming the extended scheme reaches full &ldquo;maturity&rdquo; in terms of the numbers of additional beneficiaries with immediate effect.  Access to these benefits, and accordingly the costs associated with these benefits, would not arise in Year 1 as entitlement to such benefits can only be established on the basis of contributions paid in prior years.</p>  <p>  In its 2013 report, the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare considered issues related to extending social insurance coverage to the self-employed in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral.</p>  <p>  The Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for Jobseeker's Benefit.  It found that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed persons who claimed the means tested jobseekers allowance during the three-year period from 2009-2011 received payment.  </p>  <p>  The Group did, however, find that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases relating to long term sickness or injuries, through the invalidity pension and partial capacity benefit schemes.  In this regard the Group recommended that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points, payable on a compulsory basis only. </p>  <p>  The Advisory Group also examined the extension of social insurance benefits to the self-employed on an optional basis.  It considered that allowing people a facility to opt in or out at their own discretion could lead to the selection of bad risks.  The whole principle of social insurance is social solidarity where everybody pays in and, if needed, cover is available.  Allowing people to opt in or out could result in a negation of the social solidarity and contributory principles which underline the social insurance system. </p>  <p>  It is not possible to estimate the costs associated with those self-employed who might opt to pay Class A PRSI on a voluntary basis.  While I am anxious to expand the level of social insurance entitlement for the self-employed, any such change would have to be funded by an appropriate level of contribution.</p></reply>

This takes the form of a Group Engagement session where a number of clients are called to a meeting with DSP staff.  Following this the client is called for a one to one discussion with a case officer and a personal progression plan (PPP) is agreed.  After the one to one discussion the client progresses according to the PPP.  The process will also include a series of activation review meetings for as long as the person remains wholly unemployed.  Following up on the PPP may include participation in a training/education course or in an employment or work experience programme.</p>  <p>  There are many permutations in terms of routes through the activation process, and a meaningful 'average cost' of activating a person who is unemployed cannot therefore be estimated.</p>  <p>  Some indicative costs are however available for the Department of Social Protection activation programmes.  The cost for International Work Experience and training is &euro;2531.73 per person.  The average payment per week for a JobBridge participant during 2015 is &euro;233.33.  This equates to &euro;9,100 for a 9 month internship (39 weeks) or &euro;6,067 for a 6 month internship (26 weeks).  The average weekly cost is &euro;250.70 for Gateway, &euro;264.36 for the Rural Social Scheme is and &euro;253.09 for T&uacute;s.  The average cost for the Momentum 2 programme is expected to be &euro;3,447 per participant.</p>  <p>  Costs per participant on training and education programmes are a matter for the Department of Education and Skills.</p></reply>

To this end, the Department provides a wide range of work related supports, which in 2015 will cost an estimated &euro;37 million solely for persons with a disability. </p><p>The Government's commitments to facilitating increased participation in employment for persons with a disability are reflected in the Comprehensive Employment Strategy.  In addition, under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy an interdepartmental group, under an independent chair, will review and make recommendations on 'making work pay' for people with disabilities through examination of the complex interactions between the benefit system, the additional costs associated with work for people with disabilities, and net income gains in employment.</p><p>In addition, a young person with a disability is at all times free to avail of the Intreo service on a voluntary basis and a complete range of activation supports for people with disabilities is available at Intreo Centres. </p><p>Under the Youth Guarantee the main innovation in dealing with young people on jobseekers' payments relates to earlier engagement with this group than is normal under the general activation arrangements for unemployed people through INTREO.  This means that young people on jobseekers' payments are referred to a caseworker, are engaged with more systematically in terms of their rights and responsibilities, at an earlier date than older unemployed people.  For such young jobseekers, engagement with activation measures through the Intreo service is mandatory. </p><p>The current situation in respect of young people with disabilities who present at a DSP office needing activation/intervention type supports is that they are they are referred immediately to a caseworker within Intreo or at the Local Employment Service (LES).  For such young persons in receipt of disability/illness support payments, engagement with the Intreo service is on a voluntary basis.</p><p>A caseworker working with a young person with a disability can arrange access for that young client to the full range of services and programmes that are available to young people on jobseekers' payments.  This includes access to programmes such as JobBridge, the Back to Education Allowance, and Solas training for unemployed people.  The Department is also currently considering how people with disabilities might best be included in any future iteration of the Momentum programme.</p><p>Young people with a disability are thus not excluded from the programmes and services provided under the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan. </p><p>In addition, a caseworker dealing with a young person with a disability can arrange access to a range of additional services and supports that are specific to people with disabilities and are not available to other young jobseekers.  These services and supports are as follows.</p><p><b>EmployAbility</b></p><p>EmployAbility is an open labour market initiative providing disabled people with supports to help them access the open labour market.  It is implemented by sponsor organisations (EmployAbility) on behalf of DSP who employ Job Coaches to provide a range of supports tailored to the individual needs of a jobseeker.  The ultimate objective is that the employee becomes independent of Job Coach support.</p><p>The Supported Employment Service under EmployAbility is an employment and recruitment service to assist people with a disability to secure and maintain a job in the open labour market.  This Supported Employment Service provides a range of supports to employers and people with a disability, through Job Coaches.  The range of supports includes:</p><p>- Individual Needs Assessment</p><p>- Vocational Profiling and Career Planning</p><p>- Individual Employment Plan</p><p>- Job Sourcing and Job Matching</p><p>- On-the-Job Support and Coaching</p><p>- Advice and Support to Employers</p><p>- Follow-up Support and Mentoring to both Employers &amp;amp; Employees.</p><p><b>The Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS)</b></p><p>The purpose of this demand - led programme is to increase the numbers of people with disabilities participating in the open labour market.  WSS provides financial incentives to employers, outside the public sector, to employ disabled people who work more than 20 hours per week.  The Scheme is structured in three strands.  The employer can benefit from one or all, simultaneously.</p><p>Strand I subsidy is a general subsidy for any perceived productivity shortfall in excess of 20% for a disabled person, in comparison to a non-disabled peer.  An employee must work a minimum of 21 hours per week up to a maximum of 39 hours per week.  The rate of subsidy is &euro;5.30 per hour and is based on the number of hours worked, giving a total annual subsidy available of &euro;10,748 per annum based on 39 hour week. </p><p>Strand II is based on the total number of disabled employees in a company, an employer can apply for a grant to cover additional costs ranging from an additional 10% for 3-6 employees to a maximum of 50% of the wage subsidy for 23+ disabled employees.</p><p>Strand III is where 30 or more disabled people are employed, employers can avail of a grant of &euro;30,000 per annum to assist with the cost of employing an Employment Assistance Officer.</p><p>Unlike other recruitment subsidies such as JobsPlus, WSS is payable indefinitely as long as the disabled person remains in the employment concerned.  New Applicants for WSS who are currently on Disability Allowance may apply for DA Disregard in conjunction with the WSS provided the minimum 21 working hours per week WSS threshold is maintained.</p><p><b>Disability Support/Awareness</b></p><p>A number of different employment supports for people with disabilities are provided for under this heading.</p><p>A. Workplace Equipment Adaptation Grant</p><p>B. Job Interview\Personal Reader Grant</p><p>C. Employee Retention Grant Scheme.</p><p>D. Disability Awareness Support Scheme</p><p><b>Community Employment</b></p><p>The CE eligibility requirements for people with disabilities are not as demanding as for other Job seeker groups so as to encourage participation.  Those on job-seekers' payments generally must be aged over 25 and on a payment for a year or more.  Effectively a person in receipt of DA who is aged 18 or over can be in receipt of their payment for 1 week and be eligible for CE. </p><p><b>Specialist Training Providers</b></p><p>Apart from having access to the full range of training programmes for unemployed people provided through Solas, people with disabilities also have access to Specialist Training Programme provision specific to their needs.</p><p>Key additional features of specialist vocational training, as compared with programmes for the generality of unemployed job-seekers, include:</p><p>- additional training duration</p><p>- adapted equipment</p><p>- transport arrangements</p><p>- enhanced programme content</p><p>- trainer-learner ratio</p><p>- qualifications of staff</p><p>- additional opportunities for assessment</p><p>- individualised approach.</p><p>Pathways to Work 2015 includes a commitment to develop and evaluate options for the further extension of employment services to people not on the live register and to improve the promotion/communication of existing activation options for this group, and young people with disabilities will be considered in that context, if necessary. </p><p>In the light of the enhanced existing arrangements already in place for young people with disabilities, and their current access to all relevant programmes and services, additional costs do not arise from giving young people with disabilities access to schemes and services to which they already have access.</p></reply>

This number is currently increasing at a rate of approximately 3.5% per annum.</p>  <p>  Funding requirements of the free travel scheme are dependent on a number of factors, including the number of people in receipt of qualifying benefits, the number of participating companies and routes, and fare levels, not all of which can be predicted 5 years in advance.</p>  <p>  While changing demographics are expected to result in increased numbers of people qualifying for the travel pass, the payments to operators who accept the free travel pass are calculated on the basis of fares foregone (at a reduced rate to take account of travel generated by the free travel scheme), and not simply by the numbers who are entitled to a free travel pass.  Other factors that can affect the overall cost include the number of operators who participate in the scheme and potential future fare increases by those operators.</p>  <p>  Consequently, the funding for the subsequent 12 months is agreed in the context of the Budget process each year.</p>  <p>  In order to maintain service at existing levels, an additional funding of &euro;3 million was provided for in Budget 2016, increasing the annual allocation to &euro;80 million.</p></reply>

Key criteria for participation and continued eligibility for the scheme is that the participant is underemployed in their primary activity i.e. either farming or fishing, and that earnings are insufficient.  Participants are engaged for 19&frac12; hours per week to provide certain services of benefit to rural communities.  The scheme currently provides work opportunities for around 2,600 participants and 130 supervisory staff.  The funds allocated for the RSS in 2015 is &euro;45m and this level of funding will allow the scheme to continue along the same lines as in previous years but does not allow for the recruitment above the numbers stated above.</p>  <p>  The Department has no role with respect to industrial or employment-related matters that SIPTU has asked the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) to consider.  The Department has written to the LRC, the forerunner to the WRC, to set out and clarify its position.  Issues of the nature referred to by the Deputy are for determination between the employers (the local development companies engaged by the Department to deliver the scheme) and their employees.</p>  <p>  The Department engages with local development companies and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta (collectively referred to as implementing bodies within the programmes) with respect to the management and co-ordination of delivery of the rural social scheme and T&uacute;s &ndash; the community work placement initiative.  The Department meets with the implementing bodies at frequent intervals throughout the year to monitor implementation, discuss matters arising with implementation and agree common responses to matters impacting on the delivery of the schemes.  Given the respective roles of the Department and implementing bodies, the position of workers is represented by the latter.</p></reply>

FIS is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependants and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment.  There are over 54,000 families in receipt of FIS, an increase of over 70 per cent since 2011.  The estimated spend on FIS this year is approximately &euro;349.2 million, an increase of &euro;50 million on last year. </p>  <p>  To qualify for FIS, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria.  The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them or is supported by them.  Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.</p>  <p>  The 'hours worked' eligibility criterion has been set at 38 hours per fortnight/19 hours per week since 1996.  It is not possible to estimate the costs associated with replacing the current thresholds for FIS qualification without specifying a) a new hours threshold and b) the 'sliding scale'.</p>  <p>  Reducing the &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; requirement would have implications for existing working age schemes.  Under jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance a person may, subject to scheme criteria, work for up to three days and continue to receive support under the schemes.  The proposal set out by the Deputy would be significantly more complex than the present scheme and could require additional resources to administer.</p></reply>

The 2015 Revised Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure of almost &euro;89 million on the farm assist scheme.    </p>  <p>  Changes introduced in Budgets 2012 and 2013 have brought farm assist into closer alignment with the jobseeker's allowance scheme's treatment of self-employed persons.  Farm families with the lowest income were least affected by these changes as the headline rates of farm assist were maintained.  The changes introduced over these respective Budgets reduced the cost of farm assist by just over &euro;10 million per annum. </p>  <p>  The assessment of means for the farm assist scheme is designed to reflect the actual net income from farming.  Income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator of the expected position in the following year.  However, farm assist is a flexible payment. Account is taken of any exceptional circumstances so as to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the current situation.  Any farmer experiencing lower levels of income or cash-flow issues can ask their local Intreo office to review the level of means applying to their claim.  </p>  <p>  Last year, the Christmas Bonus was re-introduced, payable at 25% of the weekly rate.  This year I was in a position to provide a 75% Christmas Bonus payment for all long term welfare recipients, including recipients of farm assist.

The package is generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  It is a universal payment from the age of 70.  The Department will spend approximately &euro;227 million this year on the household benefits package for approximately 416,000 customers. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2015 an initiative was announced to assist those in receipt of the Household Benefits Package and the Fuel Allowance Scheme from my Department with water costs.

Subsequently, on 18 November 2014 and following a review, the Government announced changes to the domestic water charging regime, and also provided for the new water conservation grant.  These changes were designed to promote affordability for households and assist with water conservation measures.  The grant replaces the tax rebate and social protection measures previously announced, as it provides a more straightforward means of addressing water issues for all households on equal terms and will help reduce households' outlay on water services. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, I have no plans to introduce a free water allowance to the household benefits package.

JobsPlus was introduced in July 2013 as one of a series of measures contained in the Action Plan for Jobs and replaced two existing schemes, namely the Employer PRSI Exemption scheme and the revenue job assist.  The Employer PRSI Exemption scheme reduced the employer's PRSI liability where additional employees (who were formerly unemployed) were engaged. </p>  <p>  JobsPlus is available to all employers in the private (including commercial semi-state), community, not-for-profit and voluntary sectors and is available to employers who offer any full-time work of over 30 hours per week and spanning at least a 4 day week.  There is no limit on the number of new recruits per employer.  Start-up employers may also avail of the scheme, on production of evidence that the business has commenced operations.</p>  <p>  For jobseekers who are over 24 months out of the labour market, a subsidy of &euro;10,000 is paid monthly to the employer over two years.  A subsidy of &euro;7,500 paid monthly over two years is available to employers who recruit a jobseeker who is between 12 and 24 months unemployed.  In 2015 eligibility was broadened to include young jobseekers (under 25 year olds) unemployed for four months or more in the previous 6 months and jobseekers transitioning from a one parent family payment.  A subsidy of &euro;7,500 is payable in both instances.</p>  <p>  The 2015 provision for JobsPlus is &euro;25.5 million.  In November 2015 the Department made payments totalling just under &euro;2.1 million to 3,953 employers in respect of 5,364 employees.</p></reply>

There are also a number of other allowances and deductions available to reduce the tax on rental income paid.  These include, for example, the cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant and the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property.</p><p>The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has published a guide to the income tax treatment of rental income.  It sets out the amount of rental income to be taken account of for income tax purposes and provides a comprehensive list of expenditure items that are allowable for deduction in computing rental income for tax purposes.  This guide is available at:  .</p><p>In the current Finance Bill I have provided for a full 100% interest deduction where the landlord undertakes, for a period of at least three years, to provide accommodation to tenants in receipt of social housing supports and registers such undertakings with the Private Residential Tenancies Board within certain time limits. </p><p>I am conscious of the challenges that individuals continue to face, despite the improving economic conditions.  However I would also note that the changes to the income tax system included in Budget 2015 mean that individuals who paid Income Tax and or USC in 2014 have seen a reduction in their tax bill in 2015 where incomes are equal.  Budget 2016 is now continuing this process of reducing the tax burden on low and middle income earners including, among other changes, a decrease in the three lowest rates of USC announced to take effect from January 2016.</p></reply>

The zero rating applies according to the following criteria:</p><p>- all children's clothing of sizes up to and including 32&quot; chest or 26&quot; waist; and,</p><p>- children's footwear up to and including size 5&frac12; (38 continental or equivalent).</p><p>Under the EU VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services.  As school uniforms for people over 10 years of age were not subject to the zero rate on 1 January 1991, it is not possible to apply the zero rate to these uniforms now.</p><p>In addition, Member States may apply a reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the EU VAT Directive.  As clothes and shoes are not listed under this Annex the reduced rate cannot be applied to the supply of school uniforms.  Therefore the only rate of VAT that can apply to the supply of school uniforms for children over 10 years of age is the standard VAT rate of 23%.</p></reply>

The Central Bank's latest Household Credit Market Report, at, presents the percentage of loans in negative equity by the origin year of the mortgage (Figure 17, HCMR H2 2015). These data are for December 2014 and do not reflect changes to loan balances and house prices since December 2014.</p><p>However, the Deputy may wish to note that the ESRI's Summer Quarterly Economic Commentary provides the most recently available research on the number of mortgages that are in negative equity and can be accessed at . This report shows that the estimated number of those who are in negative equity continues to decline with the rise in residential property prices.</p><p>According to the ESRI's analysis, the number of mortgages, nationally, estimated to be in negative equity reached close to 315,000 at the end of 2012 but has continued to decline since, with an estimated 267,000 in negative equity in 2013 and just over 161,000 in December 2014. Based on residential price developments for this year, it is now estimated that somewhere in the region of 100,000 mortgages are likely to be in negative equity by the end of 2015.</p><p>Residential property price increases are relevant in alleviating the extent of negative equity and household over-indebtedness and this has important implications for the wider economy. The reduction in negative equity should improve mobility amongst those affected, encourage spending on home improvements and maintenance, and increase consumption via the wealth effect.</p></reply>

The objective of the IIF is to provide long term investors with a stable income yield as well as the potential for capital growth deriving from a substantial portfolio of assets which underpin the Irish economy. The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) has a commitment of &euro;250 million to the IIF. </p>  <p>  The IIF has thus far completed three investments. The first investment was the acquisition of a controlling stake in a portfolio of wind farms from Viridian Group in 2012. The IIF completed a second investment in 2013 when it acquired Towercom, Ireland's largest independent wireless telecoms infrastructure company. The IIF's most recent investment was completed in July 2015, when it acquired the concession contract to operate and maintain The Convention Centre Dublin, with the investment also including a license to build and operate an approximately 330-bed hotel on a site adjacent to The Convention Centre. </p>  <p>  The IIF has in the course of 2015 secured investor commitments to over &euro;400 million, including the ISIF commitment, with 14 institutional investors participating in the funding round to complete the most recent CCD investment. The IIF has an on-going pipeline of investment opportunities that it is actively evaluating and it is currently hoped that an additional investment will be undertaken in the coming months. The IIF is also continuing to meet with both domestic and international investors with a view to raising additional capital.</p>  <p>  Information on the economic impact of ISIF's investments, including employment, is published on a bi-annual basis. Due to commercial sensitivities the ISIF does not report on economic impact at individual transaction level, but instead at the aggregate portfolio level. Updated economic impact figures show that as at end-December 2014, ISIF, through its investment activities, was supporting 12,005  jobs in the Irish economy.  Interim economic impact figures for the first half of 2015 will be published in the coming days.</p></reply>

This is due to the new Deposit Guarantee Regulations (S.I. No. 516 of 2015) requiring annual contributions to be made to a new deposit contributory fund established under these regulations. The requirement is to build the deposit contributory fund up to a level of 0.8% of covered deposits (circa &euro;680m) of all credit institutions authorised in the State by 3 July 2024. This will mean an annual contribution by participating credit institutions of approximately &euro;85m.  </p>  <p>  In order to facilitate the move from the deposit protection account to the deposit contributory fund, Part 3 of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015, introduced a funding arrangement known as a legacy fund. Under this arrangement the Central Bank will shortly transfer 0.2% of covered deposits or &euro;180m from the deposit protection account to the new legacy fund, in order to provide a backstop to the deposit contributory fund in the early years while it is being built up. The balance of deposit protection account funds will be returned to credit institutions, as there is no longer any legal basis to hold onto this money. </p>  <p>  The reason the level of 0.2% of covered deposits was chosen is that it will ensure that all credit institutions will contribute proportionately the same amount to the legacy fund, and therefore to a DGS pay-out should the contributory fund have insufficient resources during the three-year operational period of the legacy fund.</p></reply>

The 'Allowable Expenses' figures represent both flat rate (employment) expenses and also un-reimbursed expenses incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of an office/employment.</p><p>The latest full year for which information is available is 2013. Updates for 2014 will be published in due course. </p><p>I am further advised by Revenue that the flat rate expense regime has been developed over many years with individual flat rate expenses negotiated with representatives of different categories of workers at their request. During such negotiations, an entitlement to a deduction is first established, i.e. the expense must be wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of the office or employment, and the amount of the allowable expenses incurred is ascertained.</p><p>The agreed deduction may then be applied to all employees of the class or group in question, ensuring that each individual in a particular class or group is granted the same amount. It reduces the need for individual employees to submit claims annually to Revenue thereby reducing costs for both taxpayers and Revenue.  </p><p>Representative bodies occasionally approach Revenue to seek a review of the flat rate expense applicable to the class or group of employees that they represent.  Any such review is focused solely on the expense items applicable to the relevant sector or group of employees.</p></reply>

I have also extended the scheme in the recent Budget to include owners of rental properties who are subject to income tax;</p><p>- a range of amendments in the recent Finance Bill (2015), to give Revenue extended powers to obtain information from financial institutions and other third parties.</p><p>I am advised that Revenue has a facility on its website that allows a person to report instances of tax evasion.  Information and the reporting form can be accessed through the following link:  . Any such report will be followed through by Revenue. Revenue is a fully integrated tax and customs administration currently has approximately 2,000 staff countrywide engaged on activities that are dedicated to targeting and confronting non-compliance, in all its forms. These activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection.  Over the last few years a number of measures have been implemented to tackle Ireland's high level of cash usage. The latest of these were contained in the Budget 2016 speech where I set out two important reforms to incentivise debit card usage over cash. The first was a reform of Stamp Duty, which changed it from a 'per-card' Stamp Duty currently levied into a 'per-ATM withdrawal' levy.  I also announced a reduction in the so-called interchange fees paid by retailers every time they accept a debit or credit card.  Since 2006 usage of debit cards has quadrupled in volume and trebled in value to almost &euro;20bn last year.  The additional measures announced in the Budget are likely to accelerate card usage still further.</p></reply>

It is estimated based on 2013 records that some 65% of individuals with income from a self-employed trade or profession are also in receipt of PAYE income, and would therefore already be availing of the PAYE credit. </p>  <p>  111,600 persons are expected to benefit from the EIC as introduced in Budget 2016.  This credit was specifically designed to benefit self-employed individuals who have an active trade or profession, and who do not have any other income that would generate an entitlement to the PAYE credit. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that where a person has both employment and self-employment income, a claim can be made for both credits, but the maximum total credit value available to each taxpayer is &euro;1,650.  This is in line with the functioning of the existing PAYE credit; employees who work in two different employments are not entitled to claim two PAYE credits, for example.</p>  <p>  Therefore all self-employed persons with an active trade or profession, who do not have access to the PAYE credit, should be in a position to claim the EIC in 2016.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the cost to the Exchequer of extending the EIC to other self-assessed persons who do not currently qualify for the credit, including those who already have access to a PAYE credit, is in the order of &euro;95 million, and the additional cost to further extend this credit to &euro;1,650 (level of the current PAYE credit) is estimated to be &euro;313 million. </p>  <p>  It is not clear the basis on which the Deputy is querying the extension of the credit over three years, therefore the cost presented is the estimate for making the change in one year.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that this estimate does not take into account the ability of the credit to be fully absorbed.</p></reply>

At the same time, an Environmental Impact Statement will be completed. It is expected that this will allow the holding of a formal public exhibition in mid 2016 following which work on the detailed design will be progressed with the aim of enabling the Office of Public Works (OPW) to submit the Scheme for Ministerial Confirmation under the Arterial Drainage Acts as early as possible in 2017. </p>  <p>  Subject to the Scheme being Confirmed the OPW will aim to appoint a civil works contractor and commence construction within a short period thereafter. Due to the likely scale of the proposed Scheme, it is possible that the Scheme will be undertaken on a phased basis under a number of contracts. The design consultants have commenced work on a Phasing Report which will assist a structured implementation of the Scheme. This will be a very significant scheme with commensurate costs and it is anticipated that the works will take at least 4-5 years to complete.</p>  <p>  Both the OPW and Cork City Council are anxious that works would commence at the earliest possible date and investigations are underway to see if some advance works could be undertaken by the City Council under its own powers. Should this prove possible, then funding would be provided to the Council by OPW to enable it to progress such works in late 2016.</p>  <p>  As the outline design for Blackpool has been completed it has been decided to separate this and make it a Scheme in its own right. The proposals for Blackpool are currently on public exhibition and subject to a successful exhibition it is hoped to complete the detailed design of the Scheme there and proceed to the tender process for a civil works contractor in mid 2016. The scheme would also be sent for Confirmation to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform at the same time and subject to no issues arising, a contractor could be appointed before the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to the provision of a flood relief scheme for the people of Cork City and the OPW has made provision for the cost of implementing both schemes in its Multi Annual Budget Profiles over the period 2016-2021.</p></reply>

An additional pay reduction for public servants in receipt of annual remuneration in excess of &euro;65,000 in July 2013 was also implemented under the FEMPI legislation. These measures   together with the  Public Service Pension Reduction implemented in January 2011  are estimated to give rise to in excess of &euro;2.2bn in direct reductions in public service remuneration and pensions. </p>  <p>  It is not possible within the fiscal space currently available to Government and the requirement to manage public expenditure in accordance with the EU's Stability and Growth Pact to fund the some &euro;2.2bn cost of reversing the FEMPI measures on public servants. To do so would be to reverse the hard won progress made in rescuing the economy from the financial collapse which it so recently faced. </p>  <p>  The Government has now, through the negotiation and agreement of a financially prudent public service agreement on pay and related issues, provided for a gradual unwinding of the FEMPI measures as they apply to public servants. The terms of this agreement, the Lansdowne Road Agreement  are being implemented under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2015 with effect from 1 January 2016 at a full year cost of &euro;844m in 2018. Provision has also been made for an amelioration of the PSPR for public service pensioners at an additional full year cost of &euro;90m in 2018.

A meeting took place on 5 October, 2015 between the OPW and KCC at which these matters were discussed. </p>  <p>  It was explained by the OPW at this meeting that at both of these locations old Land Commission embankments protect private dwellings, some constructed in relatively recent times. It was confirmed to the Council that OPW is not responsible for the upkeep of these embankments. Funding of &euro;80,000 and &euro;100,000 for both of these locations was granted to KCC in 2012 under the OPW's Minor Flood Mitigation And Coastal Protection Scheme and these were the maximum possible amounts that could be approved under the Scheme's criteria having regard to the information submitted by KCC in its application.  </p>  <p>  Also, following the coastal storms which affected the western seaboard in December 2013 and January 2014, KCC requested funding for strengthening works at Incherea, Glenbeigh and both repair and strengthening works at Cromane Lower. The Council was advised by the OPW that strengthening works were outside of the scope of the Government Decision allocating funding for storm damage repairs and that only the repair element of projects, such as that at Cromane Lower, were covered under the allocation. The OPW approved KCC's programme of repair works, which included &euro;30,000 for Cromane Lower which amount has been drawn down by KCC.</p>  <p>  If, following assessment, the Council considers that economically and technically viable measures and works are possible at the locations in question then it may undertake such works using its own resources or, if necessary, it may submit applications under the OPW's Minor Works Scheme. Any application received will be assessed under the scheme's eligibility criteria, including a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of funding for flood risk management. Application forms and related guidelines are available on the OPW website under Flood Risk Management. </p>  <p>  No application under the Minor Works scheme from KCC is currently in hands in the OPW for any projects at the locations referred to.</p></reply>

They can be used in public procurement in cases where they are targeted at factoring into the procurement process consideration of social issues such as employment opportunities, equal opportunities and social inclusion.  In order to be compatible with EU law, they must be made known to all interested parties at tender stage and must not restrict participation by contractors from other Member States. It is important to note that a number of social considerations are already included as standard clauses in public procurement tender documents and include the following: </p><p>- Taxation and Social insurance payments </p><p>-  Employment legislation </p><p>-  Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 </p><p>-  Waste management </p><p>-  Human Rights </p><p>-  Environmental legislation</p><p>In order to ensure that the inclusion of additional social considerations do not discriminate, it is vital to adopt a targeted approach to the use of social clauses in contracts.  This is likely to mitigate against risks such as the displacing of workers already in employment while offering the opportunity of assisting with labour activation measures for the long-term unemployed.</p><p>This is a complex area and it is important to develop a robust structure that will assist the contracting authority to develop the correct clause and to provide the support from the appropriate agency to aid SMEs in implementing the clause. I have instructed the OGP to report on this issue and to issue practical guidance designed to assist contracting authorities to carry out this important role in a consistent manner.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the cost of implementing guidance on the inclusion of social considerations in public procurement will be a matter for each individual contracting authority, as they will be best placed to gauge any additional costs should they arise, on a contract by contract basis.  </p></reply>

My colleague, Mr Damien English, T.D., Minister of State for Skills, Research and Innovation is representing Ireland at the Ministerial Conference.  At the WTO, the European Commission leads negotiations on behalf of the European Union, and Ireland actively participates in the formulation of EU positions at the negotiations.  Minister English is also attending the parallel EU Foreign Affairs Council (Trade) which takes place in Nairobi. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s priorities are represented by the EU position negotiated at the Ministerial Conference.  Ireland, along with the other 27 Member States, believes that agreeing on a balanced and ambitious outcome on export competition (which includes export subsidies; export credits; state trade enterprises and food aid) would constitute an important step forward in the process of creating a stronger and fairer multilateral trading system, especially for Developing and Least Developed Countries (LDCs).  Ireland also supports an agreement on a &ldquo;development package&rdquo; following on from the ninth Ministerial Conference, comprising of (i) better duty-free, quota-free access; (ii) enhanced services waiver; (iii) streamlined rules of origin and (iv) greater market access for cotton producing countries, as well as work on Food Security.  Finally, in terms of priorities, Ireland is seeking agreement on new rules to deliver greater transparency, in relation to anti-dumping, regional trade agreements and various subsidy regimes.  </p>  <p>  My Department liaises closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to ensure that the needs of LDCs are taken into account in the articulation of Ireland&rsquo;s position at the WTO, at EU level.</p>  <p>  In addition to our work at the Ministerial Conference in this regard, Ireland has also provided &euro;50,000 this year to support LDC participation at the Ministerial Conference so that LDCs can be present and make their voices heard directly during the negotiations.</p>  <p>  I understand that Minister English, as well as meeting with Irish companies operating in Kenya, is also meeting with a number of local non-governmental development organisations with the assistance of the Irish Embassy in Nairobi.</p></reply>

There has been one significant instance of shared co-operation between both Agencies some years ago, to capitalise on the combined strengths of Letterkenny and Derry City as an economic corridor.  This led to the jointly developed North West Business Technology Zone (NWBTZ), which involved a total expenditure of &euro;39m on developing infrastructure and property solutions in both centres, including the development of a state of the art Business and Technology Park in Letterkenny.  Of this sum, the EU&rsquo;s INTERREG IIIA Programme contributed &euro;10m. Enhanced facilities are now in place, to drive the region&rsquo;s attractiveness for investment.</p>  <p>  Arising out of that work by IDA and INI, Project Kelvin was developed to provide enhanced telecommunications between the region and North American/European centres.  It was a cross-border venture, costing &euro;43m, supported by the relevant Departments North and South and co-financed by the European Union (&euro;32.25m). The project was completed in 2010 and represents an important driver to attract companies requiring these technologies.</p>  <p>  Apart from those specific projects, where appropriate, IDA Ireland and INI co-operate administratively on company visits where both jurisdictions are being considered by foreign companies.  These visits are, in the main, usually initiated by IDA&rsquo;s network of overseas offices.</p></reply>

I also note that the Deputy&rsquo;s party proposed such a Zone in a policy document earlier this year.</p><p>The possible development of a Border Development Zone could raise significant issues involving EU State Aid Rules and other EU provisions and it would also, of course, require detailed negotiations between both Administrations on this island.  There would also be significant resource issues, which would be challenging. I am not aware that detailed costings have been carried out in relation to the proposal. I expect that these would obviously depend of the exact nature and functions of such a body. As you will be aware, this Government have initiated a significant reduction in the number of Bodies and Agencies, in order to achieve more effective administration and delivery of services, so that a very strong case needs to be made to justify the creation of new bodies. I would again emphasise that any new structures to be put in place would require the full agreement of the Northern Ireland authorities.  Both administrations on the island are focussed on developing the existing mechanisms and on making them work better.</p><p>Developing new, regionally-based, economic structures could be a significant policy development, and one requiring careful consideration. The need to avoid duplication would be paramount, in the interests of utilising scarce State resources efficiently.  It is therefore worth noting that there are already several mechanisms in place to pursue cross border economic development.</p><p>I strongly believe that we should continue to build on the structures already in place and on what has been achieved in that region.  The work of the Cross Border Body, <i>InterTrade Ireland,</i>has been foremost in this regard, with a significant range of enterprise development initiatives and programmes in place. My Department jointly funds and provides oversight to this Body, together with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Belfast, and it represents a very effective mechanism for tackling business development on an all-island basis. In addition, there is on-going co-operation between <i>Enterprise Ireland</i>and its Northern Ireland counterpart agency, <i>Invest Northern Ireland</i>on areas of mutual interest.</p><p>Over recent years, a range of projects under the Enterprise Development theme of the INTERREG IVA Programme (2009-2015) have made a significant impact on developing small businesses in the region.  My Department co-funded this strand of this INTERREG Programme, under which a total of 28 individual projects have been initiated. I now look forward to the roll out of the successor Programme for the period up to 2020, which will support Research and Innovation initiatives.</p><p>The operation of the North South Ministerial Council, in which I fully participate, both in its Plenary format and also in the Trade and Business Sectoral format with my counterpart from the Northern Ireland Executive, is an ongoing forum which can develop practical North South initiatives.</p></reply>

Gift vouchers that are not financial services products are covered also by the provisions of the European Union (Consumer Information, Cancellation and Other Rights) Regulations 2013 (S.I.

In addition to Parts dealing with the consolidation and updating of the law of the supply of goods, digital content and services and on unfair contract terms, the draft Scheme contains a number of provisions for the regulation of gift vouchers, including a proposed ban on expiry dates in contracts for the supply of gift vouchers. My aim in publishing the draft Scheme was to get as wide a range of responses as possible from consumers and traders in view of the fact that its provisions will affect virtually every business and citizen in the State. The responses to the gift card provisions in particular raised a substantial number of issues, some of which have required further engagement by my Department with stakeholders. In addition to concerns expressed by businesses about the impact of a complete prohibition on expiry dates, the responses have highlighted the need to ensure regulatory clarity and certainty in respect of the regulation of gift cards that come within the scope of the European Communities (Electronic Money) Regulations 2011. The consideration of other provisions of the draft Scheme has had to take account of EU legislative proposals on digital content and online and distance sale of goods published on 9 December 2015. My Department is currently finalising the provisions of the draft Scheme in the light of the responses to the consultation and other considerations with a view to its submission to Government in the New Year.</p></reply>

A second tariff offer covering trade in goods was exchanged and both sides have now arrived at proposals covering 97% of tariff lines.  Progress in this area will provide momentum in other areas of the negotiations.  There was also discussion in relation to public procurement and it is envisaged that there will be an exchange of market access proposals on public procurement by February 2016.</p><p>The negotiations also provided an opportunity to clarify some of the main principles of regulatory cooperation.  These included the fact that any cooperation is possible only if the level of protection for consumers stays the same or improves and any form of regulatory cooperation will not change or affect the EU regulatory and democratic process. </p><p>  During this round, the EU presented its first legal textual proposal for a chapter on Trade and Sustainable Development, including labour and the environment, which covers conservation, sustainable management of resources, wildlife, forestry and fisheries, as well as other substantive matters including opportunities for joint initiatives in third countries to further labour rights and environmental protection.  The European Commission published this proposal on its website on the 6 November 2015.</p><p>On the 12 November 2015, the EU Commission published and formally presented to the US its proposal for a new and more transparent system for resolving disputes between investors and states &ndash; the Investment Court System.  This proposal is the outcome of a lengthy public consultation process with the Member States, the European Parliament, stakeholders and the public.  The Commission&rsquo;s proposal aims at safeguarding Government&rsquo;s right to regulate and creates a new system composed of a first instance tribunal and an appeal mechanism based on clearly defined rules, with qualified judges and transparent proceedings.  The proposal also includes additional improvements on access to the new system by small and medium sized companies. </p><p>An EU-US agreement would be the world&rsquo;s largest bilateral trade and investment deal, and a successful conclusion is expected to benefit Ireland more than any other EU Member State.  Owing to our position as a small open economy, Ireland&rsquo;s enterprises are particularly well placed to take up opportunities to trade more easily with the US.  The key findings of the Copenhagen Economics study, published on the 27 March 2015, are very positive for Ireland indicating a potential impact on the Irish economy of 1.1% increase in GDP.  This is double the impact for the EU as a whole.</p></reply>

Following on from its voluntary redundancy programme as part of a global restructuring, the company has now consolidated its workforce in the three existing Irish sites and currently employs a total of over 2,300 staff. I was very pleased when the company announced a significant investment in one of those centre earlier this year, involving the creation of a significant number of new, specialised jobs there. </p><p>Regarding Foreign Direct Investment for Kerry generally, there are 12 IDA Ireland supported client companies, employing 1,874 people in the county and those companies have added 361 additional new jobs between 2011 &ndash; 2014 (a 24% increase), compared to 502 job losses in the period 2008 &ndash; 2010 (a 25% decrease). It should be noted that 70% of new IDA jobs come from existing client companies, not from new investments.</p><p>Marketing of any regional area, including Kerry, for Foreign Direct Investment is done through IDA Ireland&rsquo;s network of overseas offices.  IDA Ireland actively incentivises and encourages investors to consider a range of potential locations in Ireland and it is heartening that the number of IDA company visits to Kerry was six in the first nine months of 2015, double the number for the full year 2014. However it should be appreciated that the ultimate locations selected are decided<font color="#5F5F5F"> </font>by the companies themselves, taking into account factors they consider to be in the wider best interests of the individual company.</p><p>A boost to the county has been the reinstatement of Regional Aid for Co. Kerry under the new EU Regional Aid Guidelines (RAGs), which came into force last year. The RAGs enable the State to give State Aid, at enhanced rates, to businesses in order to support new investment and new employment in productive projects in Ireland's most disadvantaged regions. This means that the full range of Regional Aid assistance options are available in Kerry.</p><p>In April of this year, IDA Ireland launched its new five-year strategy entitled <i>Winning &ndash; Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019</i>. The strategy has a strong focus on regional development, setting forth aims and strategies to achieve a significant increase in investment going into regional locations. To support that aim, IDA Ireland is rolling out a &euro;150 million capital investment programme to help attract more multinational jobs into each region over a 5-year period. This programme will include investments over the coming years in constructing Advanced Technology Buildings and office facilities in a number of regional locations to provide state-of-the-art property solutions for clients.  Tralee is to be the site of one such Advanced Technology Building.</p><p>While all regions have grown employment since the Action Plan for Jobs was launched in 2012, some regions have grown faster than others, that is why I set about introducing an initiative for <i>Regional Action Plans for Jobs.</i>The purpose of this initiative is to identify a range of actions over the period 2015 - 2017 aimed at facilitating each region to achieve its economic potential and raise employment levels. Earlier this year I launched the <i>Action Plan for Jobs for the South West</i>(Cork and Kerry). The aim is to develop the full potential of that region for enterprise and job creation, building upon its specific local assets and areas of competitive advantage. The primary objective of this Plan is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in the region by 2020 and to ensure that the unemployment rate is within 1 per cent of the State average. Achieving this goal in the South West will contribute to the overall ambition of creating sustainable full employment in Ireland from 2018 onwards. </p></reply>

The strategy has a strong focus on regional development, setting forth aims and strategies to achieve a significant increase in investment going into regional locations. To support that aim, IDA Ireland is rolling out a &euro;150million capital investment programme to help attract more multinational jobs into each region over a 5-year period. This programme will include investments over the coming years in building advanced technology buildings and office facilities in a number of regional locations to provide state-of-the-art property solutions for clients.</p><p>In line with this strategy, IDA Ireland has commenced a 3-year building programme to attract FDI to designated regional locations where the private sector has failed so far to invest thus requiring IDA Ireland to intervene. IDA Ireland plan to construct an advance technology building in Tralee, Co. Kerry, subject to planning permission.  Planning permission will be submitted before the end of the year.  The anticipated completion of the building is in the first quarter of 2017.</p><p>The tender process is currently underway and a contractor will be appointed prior to obtaining planning permission.</p></reply>

All regions have experienced jobs growth, but the rate of progress in some regions is less than in others. That is why the Government is placing an increased emphasis on supporting job creation in the regions this year.</p>  <p>  The Regional Action Plans for Jobs Initiative was launched by Government in February of this year. The purpose of this initiative is to identify a range of actions over the period 2015 - 2017 aimed at facilitating each region to achieve its economic potential and raise employment levels in each of the regions.  </p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs for the Mid East region, which includes Athy, is currently under development and is expected to be launched in early 2016.  As with other plans, it will include a series of practical actions, developed in collaboration with regional stakeholders, to support enterprise growth and job creation across the Mid East region and enable the region as a whole to realise its economic potential and create jobs.</p>  <p>  The primary objective of each of the plans published to date is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020 and to ensure the unemployment rate of each region is within one per cent of the State average. Key targets in the Regional Action Plans published to date are to increase the number of entrepreneurs/start-ups in each region by a minimum of 25%, improve the 5-year survival rate by 25% and improve scaling performance of companies by 25%. </p>  <p>  All regional Action Plans will be supported by investment of up to &euro;250 million over the next five years, including &euro;150 million for a property investment programme by IDA Ireland.  The intention is that a further sum of up to &euro;100 million will be made available over the next five years through three competitive calls to be administered by Enterprise Ireland. These competitive calls will be targeted at innovative and collaborative approaches to support job creation across the regions.</p>  <p>  In April 2014, a new Regional aid map was published, providing details of areas of the country in which the State can grant State aid, at enhanced rates, to businesses to support development and employment. Under the revised map, Athy has been included as an eligible area. This presents a significant opportunity for developing businesses, supporting employment, and growing the enterprise base in Athy. Regional aid can be given to businesses to support new investment and new employment in productive projects, and can also be provided under schemes for tourism grants, urban and rural renewal and other tax-based development schemes.</p>  <p>  In March 2011, there were 18,207 people recorded on the Live Register in Kildare County. This number has since fallen to 13,851 as at November 2015.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland have also placed an increased emphasis on the regions in their new corporate strategies.  Enterprise Ireland works with entrepreneurs and business people across the full business development spectrum - from early-stage entrepreneurs, to established business owners and Irish multinational companies.  Earlier this year IDA Ireland launched its 5 year strategy for the period 2015 to 2019 which aims to create 80,000 new jobs in the economy over the period and increase investment into each region by between 30% and 40%.  Meanwhile, the Local Enterprise Offices are committed to providing consistent supports for microenterprises across all regions and acting as a first-stop-shop in delivering business growth and jobs for the small and micro-enterprise sector. </p></reply>

A key element of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy is to develop innovative companies through supporting research and development at the company level.  Enterprise Ireland has a number of financial supports to encourage companies to focus on research and development activities both within their companies and by collaborating with other companies and the third level research institutes.</p><p>24 companies in Waterford have been paid by Enterprise Ireland for research and development activities between 2010 and the present time (15 December 2015).  These research and development supports include the RandD Fund, the RTI Fund, RandD Stimulation Grants, Technical Feasibility studies and RandD equity packages.

I have been in regular contact with IDA Ireland to ensure that everything possible is being done to market the facility abroad through IDA&rsquo;s network of overseas offices. I have also ensured that Enterprise Ireland is likewise marketing the facility to its client base. The premises are privately owned and leased by BOSE. Both the building itself and the skilled workforce already there are strong selling points.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland met with Monaghan County Council on 23 September to discuss the BOSE facility.

Monaghan, like many other areas, has seen positive trends in recent years, with employment in agency-supported companies expanding by 11% and substantial improvement in the live register.  However, I believe that more can be done.

There are 36 multinational companies based in the North East, employing 4,440 across the Region, of which 7 companies are located in Cavan employing 1,136 people. The North East also has a vibrant cluster of Indigenous companies with 80 based in Cavan and employing 4,048 people.</p>  <p>  Regional development is fundamental to IDA Ireland&rsquo;s new strategy for the next five years, titled &lsquo;Winning &ndash; Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019&rsquo;, which was launched earlier this year.  For the first time, ambitious investment targets have been set for each region, with a strong focus on securing a significant uplift in the number of investments. Central to this is a driving ambition for employment growth throughout all regions over the lifetime of this strategy.  </p>  <p>  As part of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to achieve a significant uplift in the amount of FDI projects going into regions, the strategy outlines key actions aimed at achieving that, including a &euro;150m property investment plan, spread out over five years, which will support the achievement of the organisation's regional goals. The funding will be used to upgrade Ireland's business and technology parks, make investments in a number of strategic utility-intensive sites and build new advanced technology buildings in a number of regional locations. </p>  <p>  Since the national Action Plan for Jobs was launched in early 2012 more than 20,000 extra people are at work in the North East/North West region (a 12% increase).  Cavan, like many other areas, has seen positive trends in recent years, with employment in agency-supported companies expanding and substantial improvement in the live register.  However, I believe that more can be done. As part of the government&rsquo;s &euro;250m Regional Action Plan for Jobs, I recently launched the North East/North West Action Plan for jobs with a target to create 28,000 additional jobs throughout the North East/North West.  The Plan focusses on maximising the strengths and assets of the region to support enterprise growth and job creation and to build on the progress that has already been made.</p>  <p>  I am informed by IDA Ireland that the lands in Killygarry at the Business and Technology Park consists of approximately 17 hectares.  The Park has direct access to the N3 that connects Cavan town to Dublin.  There are currently approximately 11 hectares of serviced marketable land available on the park.  The main tenant on the Park at present is ATA Group (an Enterprise Ireland client).</p>  <p>  The Agency have assured me that they are happy to consider opportunities to utilise the Park to attract other non-traditional type investments into the region, investments which do not fall under the general remit of IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland but which could create investment and employment opportunities.  These lands are currently zoned &lsquo;Industrial &amp;amp; Employment&rsquo;. Any non-traditional type interest in the IDA lands will be considered on a case by case basis and subject to IDA Ireland Board Approval and Ministerial Consent.</p></reply>

Any discrimination based on nationality against EU workers as regards employment, remuneration, or working conditions is not permitted.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will understand that I am not in a position to comment or advise in relation to the employment or other rights applying to any individual&rsquo;s specific circumstances. Independent legal advice should be sought in relation to any concerns an individual may have about their situation. </p>  <p>  Ireland has a comprehensive body of employment rights, equality and industrial relations legislation, in respect of which the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) is mandated to secure compliance. The Workplace Relations Customer Service Section provides information in relation to the rights and obligations under the relevant legislation. It can be contacted at Lo-call: 1890 80 80 90. The website www.workplacerelations.ie also provides extensive information on employment rights. </p>  <p>  However, in so far as the Deputy is referring to the position of posted workers within the EU, the Deputy may wish to be aware that the Posted Workers Directive 96/71/EC (the 1996 Framework Directive) aims to balance the freedom to provide services across the Internal Market while ensuring that the rights and working conditions of posted workers are protected. Posted Workers are individuals who are employed in one EU Member State but are posted by their employer to work in another Member State on a temporary basis. </p>  <p>  The Framework Directive provides that posted workers are entitled to core statutory employment rights in the country to which they are posted including, for example, national minimum rates of pay, minimum paid annual holidays, maximum work periods and minimum rest periods. Employers may apply the rights of the home Member State (i.e. the Member State where the posted worker normally works) if they are more favourable, or offer enhanced terms and conditions as an incentive for working away from home, but this would be a contractual agreement and not a statutory obligation. In Ireland, the Framework Directive was transposed by section 20 of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001.</p></reply>

In addition to seeking written submissions from all interested parties, I have met with employer representative bodies, worker representative bodies and non-Governmental organisations to hear their views first hand and to impress on them the importance of receiving their detailed and considered responses to the study, including, where relevant, costings in support of their responses.</p>  <p>  It is important to point out that this is an independent study and the conclusions being drawn and the recommendations being made in the study are those of UL.  Therefore, it is essential that the various stakeholders who contributed to the study and indeed other interested parties who may not have had an opportunity to engage with UL, are given an opportunity to consider and respond to the findings and recommendations in the UL report.

It is an ambitious strategy, with the objective of delivering growth over the next decade that is sustainable, led by strong export performance, builds on our sectoral strengths, and that is underpinned by innovation, productivity, cost effectiveness and competitiveness.  We aim to build resilience into our economy so that we do not suffer again as we have done in the past number of years.</p>  <p>  We have 135,800 more people at work than when we launched our first Action Plan for Jobs in 2012.  Our export performance has been exceptional, with exports by Enterprise Ireland clients at a record of &euro;18.6bn last year.  Employment in EI and IDA supported firms has grown by over 40,000 since 2012.</p>  <p>  We set a target in 2012 to increase employment by 100,000 by 2016.  We achieved that ambitious target and have now exceeded it.  We want to go further and to replace all the jobs lost during the recession and to realise sustainable full employment over the longer term. </p>  <p>  Enterprise 2025 is a strategy that aims to build an economy that will not just achieve full employment but will sustain it in the long term.  It has the commitment across government to take focused actions to deliver growth that is sustainable, led by strong export performance and underpinned by innovation, productivity and competitiveness. </p>  <p>  Enterprise 2025 sets out a clear statement of ambition, including that we will have 2.18 million people at work by 2020, with the unemployment rate down to 6 percent and that the unemployment in all regions not more than one percent above the national average. </p>  <p>  Achieving this objective at regional level will require a renewed focus on building on the strengths of each region to develop the attractive and competitive environments for business to start, grow and succeed on international markets and to attract inward investment.  We started the process of rebuilding the capacity of the regions with the launch of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs this year.  In the case of six of the regions we are now firmly moving into the implementation phase of the process and I will be meeting with the enterprise champions in each of the regions early in the New Year.  </p>  <p>  Enterprise 2025 is a whole of enterprise strategy, aimed at delivering opportunities across all regions and across all sectors, including both manufacturing and services activities. Through a partnership approach with enterprise, representative bodies, the enterprise development agencies, Local Enterprise Offices and others, delivering a step change in enterprise performance and resilience will see a significant increase in Irish owned companies of scale, contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s reputation for innovation in international markets.  The enterprise agencies and the LEOs will use their budgets in the optimal way to deliver on the potential for enterprise growth in the regions. In addition, earlier this year, we announced additional funding to support implementation of the regional Action Plans of &euro;250m over the coming years.  This comprises &euro;150m of investment by IDA Ireland in advanced property solutions in the regions and &euro;100m in competitive funding through Enterprise Ireland to support community enterprise initiatives, innovative initiatives by the Local Enterprise Offices and to support regional collaborative and clustering initiatives by public and private sector bodies and enterprises.     </p>  <p>  Our objective is to establish vibrant ecosystems for entrepreneurship, to stimulate clusters of scale and international visibility in areas of strength and to ensure that Ireland and our regions continue to be the best places to succeed in business, delivering sustainable employment and higher standards of living for all and we will direct available resources accordingly. </p></reply>

It sets out the Government&rsquo;s strategic objectives as a facilitator within the Irish entrepreneurship ecosystem.  It covers the six key elements that impact on entrepreneurs and start-ups and signposts the direction that policy will take in the coming years. This Policy Statement has as one of its stated high level objectives that &quot;we will ensure that greater numbers of people, particularly in underrepresented cohorts such as females, youths and older persons, start and run their own business&quot;.</p><p>The Policy Statement sets out the six elements of the ecosystem for entrepreneurship as: </p><p>- culture, human capital and education; </p><p>- business environment and supports; </p><p>- innovation; </p><p>- access to finance; </p><p>- entrepreneurial networks and mentoring; and </p><p>- access to markets. </p><p>It contains 96 key actions across a range of Government Departments and Agencies, which are designed to deliver improvements across the entire ecosystem.  The ambition of the Policy Statement is to increase the number of startups by 25%, to increase the survival rate in the first five years and to improve the capacity to scale by 25% and early indications are that progress is being made on this ambition.  </p><p>In terms of my own Department and its Agencies a number of supports are available, for those considering starting a business, regardless of age.  In relation to business start-ups and expansions in the micro and small business sector the 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the First Stop Shop for access to advice and support for this business cohort.  Supports available include:</p><p>- Start-your-own-business training courses,</p><p>- Market research information,</p><p>- Business planning advice and templates,</p><p>- Access to experienced business mentors, and</p><p>- Feasibility grants and co-investment for your plans.</p><p>In addition to accessing the mainstream supports from the LEOs &ndash; where eligible &ndash; young entrepreneurs were specifically targeted with the roll-out of the Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur (IBYE) competition in 2014 and 2015. The aim of IBYE is to promote entrepreneurship as a career choice and to encourage young people to set up new businesses which will ultimately create jobs. </p><p>The competition was open to people aged between the ages of 18-30. First time entrepreneurs were well catered for in the context of the IBYE programme. A &euro;50,000 Investment Fund was made available to each of the 31 LEOs to run the competition in their area in line with the following three categories:</p><p>- Best Business Idea: companies that are not yet trading, </p><p>- Best Start-Up Business: companies that have already started trading but in business for up to 24 months, and </p><p>- Best Established Business: companies that are in business more than 24 months.</p><p>The National Final was held on 6<sup>th</sup>December last from which a national winner in each category was selected in addition to selecting an overall winner as &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur 2015&rdquo;.</p><p>The LEOs also run the highly successful and well established Student Enterprise Awards for second level students giving them the chance to set up and run their own business while at school.  Students experience the realities of entrepreneurship from coming up with their business idea and writing a business plan to producing the product, research the marketing, promoting the business and managing the books.  It opens up to second level student the possibility of starting their own business and seeing entrepreneurship as a career choice in years to come.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland (EI) offers a range of startup supports to entrepreneurs, regardless of age.  In 2011, EI launched the Competitive Start Fund as a direct response to the needs of early-stage client companies regarding financing in the startup and market-launch process.  2011 also saw the introduction of EI&rsquo;s High Potential Start-Ups (HPSU) Accelerated Growth Programme aimed at HPSUs to develop critical skills in international sales, raising finance and building teams.  Another key programme is EI&rsquo;s New Frontiers Programme which was developed to support entrepreneurs and accelerate the development of sustainable early stage businesses with strong employment and growth potential, and to provide a feedstock to EI&rsquo;s HPSU programme.  EI also regularly offers feasibility funding for business startups in various sectors and geographic regions to assist new startup companies or entrepreneurs, to investigate the viability of a new growth-orientated business proposition which has the potential to become a HPSU.</p><p>I have no proposals to establish a standalone national office to support young business entrepreneurs aged 18&ndash;25 years as I believe that the existing Agencies of the State, through a variety of programmes and supports, are best placed to deliver the objectives and targets of the National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement.  The Supporting SMEs online tool is a valuable resource that will signpost the range of programmes and supports available, and can be found at:  </p></reply>

The SFPA response, inter alia, puts forward Ireland&rsquo;s views on the suitability of the European testing requirements for live crab and includes a comprehensive technical report on the matter compiled by relevant technical and scientific experts in the SFPA and the Marine Institute.  In addition, the SFPA has offered to facilitate further dialogue with the Chinese import authorities in keeping with the Memorandum of Understanding I referred to in my reply of 19 November, and has invited the Chinese authorities to visit Ireland in 2016 to examine our official control systems, laboratories and crab production establishments.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the concerns live crab exporters have at this time and I note that the SFPA has provided regular updates to industry representatives on the matter.

The measures provided through the &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; priority category of the National Reserve and also the Young Farmers Scheme are designed to encourage and facilitate the entrance of young, well educated persons into our farming community.  This implementation of these measures has the potential to play a major role in the regeneration of agriculture in Ireland and will provide a solid basis for the industry in the coming years.</p>  <p>  Successful young farmer applicants to the National Reserve will receive an allocation of new entitlements on the basis of one entitlement for one hectare.  Applicants who already hold existing entitlements which are below the national average value will receive a top-up whereby the value of those entitlements will be increased to the national average value.  The National Reserve fund in 2015 is based on 3% of the Basic Payment Scheme financial ceiling, which is estimated at providing approximately &euro;24 million in funding.  Some 6,000 farmers applied under the Young Farmer category of the National Reserve and payments are currently being issued.   </p>  <p>  With regard to the Young Farmers Scheme, young farmers will receive the payment under the scheme for a maximum period of five years.  The &lsquo;five years&rsquo; is dated from the year of setting up of the holding in his/her own name.  The Young Farmers Scheme payment will be made on a maximum of 50 entitlements.  I have opted to use the maximum financing rate of 2% for the Young Farmers Scheme.  Funding of &euro;24 million is available under the scheme for 2015 and the same financing rate will be applied for the years 2016 to 2019.  I have selected the method of calculation which will give the maximum payment possible.  The payment will be calculated as 25% of the national average payment per hectare which is estimated will give a payment of approximately &euro;66 per entitlement held by the young farmer.  Some 8,500 farmers applied under the Young Farmer Scheme and payments to eligible applicants are currently being issued. </p>  <p>  I have also established a dedicated capital investment scheme for young farmers under TAMS II, offering a wider range of investment items than is generally available, and with an enhanced rate of aid of 60% as compared with the standard 4 0% grant.  A similar dedicated investment scheme is available for Organic farmers, with a range of items specific to organic production, and again offering a 60% rate of aid for young farmers.  For any young farmers who do not meet the eligibility requirements for these dedicated schemes, I have ensured that their applications will be prioritised under the mainstream TAMS schemes, which are open to all.   </p>  <p>  Last September I presented a six point plan, to both the EU Commissioner and my EU ministerial colleagues, to address the particularly acute situation in the dairy sector. I was extremely pleased that the final decision at Council took account of Ireland&rsquo;s requests and included the provision of targeted direct aid for dairy farmers, which can be matched nationally.  The aid comprises &euro;13.7m of EU funding and a further &euro;13.7m in matching national funding.  The payment will be made on a flat rate basis with each of the 18,000 dairy farmers in the country receiving approximately &euro;1,350, with an additional &euro;800 top-up for young dairy farmers.  The flat rate payment will be made in the coming weeks and the young farmers&rsquo; top-up payment will be made in early 2016 when that scheme is finalised. </p>  <p>  The Agri-taxation Review was a joint initiative by the Minister for Finance and me, which was published as part of Budget 2015, and set out the main policy objectives for continuing support through agri-taxation measures including increasing land mobility and the productive use of land and assisting succession and the transfer of farms.  Both objectives are especially relevant to young farmers.   </p>  <p>  Budget 2016 continued the implementation of the Agri-taxation Review and a major new initiative on &lsquo;Family Transfer Partnerships&rsquo; to assist succession was announced. It is a structure in which family members enter into a partnership, and appropriate profit-sharing agreement, with the provision for the transfer of the family farm to the younger farmer at the end of a specified period (not exceeding ten years). To support this transfer a tax credit of up to a maximum of &euro;5,000 per annum for five years can be allocated to the partnership, thereby incentivising the transfer and mitigating some of the financial concerns involved. The partnership model enables a gradual transfer of control and also facilitates knowledge transfer from one generation to another. In addition two measures specifically aimed at young farmers were renewed for a further three years &ndash; the 100% Stock Relief on Income Tax for Certain Young Trained Farmers and the Stamp Duty Exemption on Transfers of Land to Young Trained Farmers. These changes are subject to EU State Aid approval.</p></reply>

The SFPA noted that Renard pier is a relatively remote location and that the nearest Port office in Dingle is 180km round trip (a pprox 4 hrs return journey).   </p>  <p>  The SFPA has advised that following further discussions with a commercial party with an interest in the matter, it is giving active consideration to the possibility of supporting the designation of Renard Pier and a thorough analysis of the impacts of this designation is being carried out at present.</p></reply>

The current rates are 0.06 cent per litre of milk processed and &euro;1.27 for each animal slaughtered or exported.  The total collected for these levies in 2015 to date is &euro;5.955m.</p>  <p>  Total expenditure on disease eradication to date in 2015 has been &euro;27.4m.  This represents a 17% reduction from the same period last year, mainly due to the reduction in the incidence of TB and associated savings.  From an economic perspective, the very considerable saving both to the national exchequer and to farmers arising from the eradication of Brucellosis and the substantial reduction in TB illustrates the huge benefits which derive from the effective implementation of disease eradication programmes.  The progressive and on-going reduction in the incidence of TB eradication holds out the promise of further significant savings for farmers and taxpayers by building on the progress achieved in recent years.</p></reply>

This included a large scale systematic and wider targeted survey of forests, nurseries, hedgerows, agricultural environmental schemes and roadside plantings across the whole of the country which commenced at the beginning of July.</p>  <p>  The results have shown that due to the high number of findings of ash dieback, especially in native hedgerows, Ireland would not be in a position to apply to the EU for Protected Zone status for the disease. The outcomes from the survey and other work are now feeding into a review of policy in relation to the disease being carried out by my Department in co-operation with colleagues in DARD in Northern Ireland.   </p>  <p>  My officials met a delegation from the IFA including the person referred to in your question on the 18 November. At that meeting the Department provided a detailed update on the situation of the disease in the country. The possibility of removing the embargo on ash sales under a plant passport system for nurseries, for plants which have been free of the disease for at least two years, is being considered. </p>  <p>  Over the last number of years the Department has operated a Reconstitution Scheme to restore forests established under its afforestation schemes back to their original form following significant damage by natural causes. The Scheme has been used to assist forestry owners who have been affected by Ash dieback disease. The objective of the Scheme is to eradicate/contain ash dieback in forests by supporting the removal and destruction of trees and leaf litter and to reconstitute the forest by replanting with alternative species. The Scheme provides funding in respect of costs necessarily incurred in clearing the site and reconstituting the forest, subject to the maximum limits laid down. </p>  <p>  The Scheme is restricted to forestry and currently there are no plans to either broaden the scope of the Scheme or to introduce any other Scheme for individuals or nurseries that have been affected by outbreaks of plant diseases including ash dieback.</p></reply>

If my Department were to permit deforestation, it would fall to the State&rsquo;s afforestation programme to fund the replacement of those areas deforested by grant-aiding other individuals to plant a similar number of hectares elsewhere.  In effect, this is analogous to the State indirectly subsidising commercial developments through its afforestation programme.  Much of the substantial investment to date would have served little purpose if it only subsidised temporary forests. If such forests were allowed to be removed, not only would the subsidies have been pointless but the deforestation would also cost the State further in respect of carbon credits by way of offsetting.</p>  <p>  The only exceptions to the replanting requirement are small projects that provide value to the community (such as playing fields for schools and community centres, etc.) or up to 0.5 ha to build a home for a landowner or for his/her immediate family.  Any project that is for commercial gain (any &lsquo;business&rsquo; such as housing developments, wind farms, farming, industrial, etc.) is required to replant the site or to plant an alternative site.  </p></reply>

I envisaged that this group, which would meet periodically, would adopt a strategic perspective and that it would comprise relevant stakeholders, including farm organisations, processors and cooperatives, state and semi state bodies, banks, environmental and other stakeholders. Such a dairy forum is appropriate as a means of engagement on critical issues such as market developments, sustainability, animal health, milk quality and price volatility.</p>  <p>  This forum met for the first time in the Autumn with the agenda focussed on some of the aforementioned issues. There was a particular focus on this occasion on the issue of volatility. The forum also served as an extremely useful mechanism to gauge stakeholder preferences with respect to EU targeted aid for the sector. As the deputy will be aware, we are currently in the process of implementing these provisions nationally with payments to farmers currently being processed. I look forward to continued cooperation via the dairy forum to ensure that the Irish dairy sector can harness the opportunities and address the challenges that the future will bring in the context of quota free production. A decision regarding the timing of the next meeting will be made in the new year. </p></reply>

Statistics show that accidents on farms cause more workplace deaths than all other occupations combined. Last year, 2014, was a particularly difficult year with 30 deaths on Irish farms and there have been 16 fatal farm accidents to date in 2015.</p><p>The Health and Safety Authority, a state agency of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, has a comprehensive up-to-date Farm Safety module for Primary schools, which has been in place for two years. The online module aims to teach children about farm safety. It is ideal for delivery in class via an interactive whiteboard or a computer projector.</p><p>The aims and objectives of this module correspond with the SPHE curriculum requirements for 3rd and 4th class in relation to farm safety. The module is therefore most suitable for children in 3rd and 4th class but may also be used as a &lsquo;refresher&rsquo; lesson with more senior classes. </p><p>The module consists of two 30-40 minute lessons followed by a third quiz based lesson.</p><p>The course can be accessed at the Health and Safety Authorities&rsquo; on-line learning portal: hsalearning.ie</p><p>The Health and Safety Authority also run regular competitions for primary schools in relation to farm safety.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, price is ultimately a matter to be determined between both the purchasers and the sellers of cattle. Cattle prices are determined by supply and demand dynamics which are in turn influenced by seasonality of production, length of the production lifecycle, market conditions such as retail promotions, consumer confidence, competition with other meats as well as the overall macroeconomic situation. My Departmental officials and I are constantly conscious of the need to develop new market outlets for quality Irish beef and live cattle. I have just returned from a trade mission where I discussed market access with my counterparts in Nigeria and Ghana, and this week access has been secured to the Maldives for beef exports, making it the fifth nee market this year for Irish beef.</p>  <p>  2015 has been a relatively positive year for beef prices in Ireland with the yearly average to date up 8% on last year. With regard to the price differential between Irish and UK cattle, a number of factors have been identified to explain why Irish-born cattle command lower prices than their British equivalents. These include a British consumer preference for indigenous product as well as additional transport and processing costs in supplying that market. However, one should note that sharp currency fluctuations have been one of the major factors in price divergence this year. Live exports of Irish beef cattle to Northern Ireland are up this year in both absolute terms and relative to cattle of dairy dams.  At the end of October, 28,500 beef cattle had been exported across the border compared to 18,600 in the same period in 2014. </p>  <p>  The best interests of this very important industry are ultimately served by ensuring a continuing supply of high quality cattle to the processing sector, and, subject to market context, this objective can be best achieved by providing a fair level of remuneration to suppliers for their efforts. I would also encourage processors to ensure that their systems for determining price are as open and transparent as possible to the farmer and that any adjustments or changes regarding specification criteria are clearly and promptly   communicated and have regard to the realities of the production cycle. </p>  <p>  In 2014 there were 1,647,827 carcasses of adult bovines classified by mechanical (94.4%) or manual (5.6%) methods. There were 515 classification control inspections conducted by Classification officers during 2014 in 31 factories and local authority abattoirs. During these unannounced inspections 51,017 carcasses were checked by Classification officers for conformation and fat. DAFM Classification officers also checked weights, dressing (Trim) and labelling. In the first 11 months of 2015 50,782 carcasses were inspected during 520 unannounced inspections. At these inspections, DAFM officers also conducted all the ancillary checks outlined above. There are currently five officers authorised to supervise classification checks. While I am satisfied that my Department operates a robust and comprehensive carcass classification control regime, I am also aware of the need to continuously monitor the way in which controls are undertaken, including the feasibility of reconfiguring existing Department resources within meat factories. I can assure the Deputy that this process of analysis and review is ongoing, and that I will make any necessary adjustments to ensure the continued good functioning of the control regime. </p>  <p>  The outlook suggests that 2016 may be a challenging year for the sector. However, with careful and considered monitoring of market trends, open channels of intra-sector communication and engagement, access to new export market for beef and live cattle and a continued focus on highlighting Ireland&rsquo;s high-quality, grass-fed beef system, I believe the industry can overcome these challenges and continue to justify the large vote of confidence that this government has placed in the beef sector. </p>  <p>  Yesterday I chaired the seventh meeting of the Beef Roundtable. The meeting discussed proposals to recognise Producer Organisations in the Beef Sector, which will give formal recognition to POs for the first time in Ireland, as well as an update on beef markets and upcoming initiatives in animal health. As always the meeting also reviewed the implementation of the Agreement from last November&rsquo;s Roundtable. The producer organisations have been one of the key outcomes of last November&rsquo;s roundtable agreement and marks an historic breakthrough for Irish beef farmers who now for the first time will have a legal framework allowing for negotiation directly with factories on price as a group. As we have seen from other sectors, POs can greatly help to rebalance the supply chain by strengthening the hand of producers who will now have a structure for negotiating collectively. </p></reply>

In the case of severe weather events, these meetings are chaired by senior officials of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government as the lead Department and I have been personally briefed by the Chair   of the NECG during the recent severe weather. When such NECG meetings are convened, representatives on the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning attend the first meeting and attendance at subsequent meetings is at the discretion of the Lead Government Department, who may also call in additional expertise when required. </p>  <p>  Senior officials of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government have continued to chair the meetings of the NECG on Severe Weather in response to Storm Desmond and the associated flooding impacts, which have been held almost daily since the first meeting on 3 December 2015 to date. The NECG on Severe Weather is continuing to regularly brief the Government, Ministers and the relevant Departments and Agencies on the national responses to these impacts. The NECG has also held daily briefings with the media to inform the public of the evolving situation and the whole of Government response to it. It is envisaged that these meetings will continue this week depending on the evolving nature of the flooding situation being experienced and any further impacts the weather may have.   </p>  <p>  Separate to this severe weather response, I chair the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, which includes senior officials of Government Departments, senior officers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces and officials of other key public authorities, which have a lead or support role in Government emergency planning. </p>  <p>  The Government Task Force coordinates and oversees the emergency management policy and activities of all Government Departments and public agencies. It provides political leadership and facilitates coordination of emergency management between Government Departments/agencies on an ongoing basis and is supported by the Office of Emergency Planning within the Department of Defence. The Government Task Force meets on a regular basis throughout the year and the next meeting is planned to take place in early January 2016 given the fact that the National Emergency Coordination Group on Severe Weather has been meeting almost daily since 3 December 2015.   </p>  <p>  With regard to the previous meetings of the Government Task Force, there have been a total of five meetings held in 2015. I chaired the first meeting on 26 February 2015 and the last meeting held on 12 November 2015, which was followed by the launch of the Government&rsquo;s &ldquo;Be Winter Ready&rdquo; Information Campaign. The other three meetings were held on 30 April 2015, 23 July 2015 and 8 October 2015 and were chaired by senior officials of the Department of Defence. While details of matters discussed at meetings of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning are confidential, I can confirm that the Task Force continues to examine current risks and supports the coordination arrangements for emergency planning across a &ldquo;Whole of Government&rdquo; approach. The Government Task Force is also regularly briefed on matters such as the current security threat, which is provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces, as well as receiving regular updates and briefings on topical matters from the relevant lead Government Departments.</p></reply>

The Army Pensions Board is an independent statutory body established under the Army Pensions Act 1927. The Act specifies that the Board shall consist of a chairman and two ordinary members.  The two ordinary members must be qualified medical practitioners of whom one must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps.  The chairman and the non military ordinary member are appointed by the Minister for Defence with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Army Medical Corps ordinary member is appointed by the Minister for Defence on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces.</p><p>There have been 5 appointments to the Army Pensions Board since March 2011.  Commandant Adam Lagun was appointed to the position of Army Medical Corps member of the Board in December 2011.  This position became vacant in October 2014 due to Commandant Lagun being deployed overseas.  On the recommendation of the Chief of Staff, the temporary appointment of Commandant Syed Shah to the Board, from 16 October 2014 to 31 May 2015, was made to cover Commandant Lagun&rsquo;s absence. Commandant Lagun resumed as Ordinary member of the Board in June 2015.  The position became vacant again in September 2015 with the deployment overseas of Commandant Lagun.  On the recommendation of the Chief of Staff Commandant Zdenek Osecky was appointed temporarily to cover this temporary vacant position, from 10 September 2015 to 30June 2016.</p><p>As the Army Pensions Act 1927 specifies that one of the ordinary members must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps, the positions outlined above were not publicly advertised on either occasion.  Details of these appointments to the Army Pensions Board were published in the Iris Oifigi&uacute;il.</p><p>A civilian doctor, Dr. Loretta Nolan, was appointed as ordinary member of the Army Pensions Board in November 2013.  The civilian doctor vacancy was advertised on the Department of Defence website and the Public Appointments Service website.  A number of expressions of interest in the position were received and an appointment to the Board was made on foot of this public advertisement process.</p><p>The Civil Defence Board was identified in the Public Service Reform Plan as a body to be abolished.  Against this backdrop, in July 2011, the then Minister for Defence appointed a 14 person interim Board as a temporary measure. In this context, none of the positions were advertised, nor was the chairperson interviewed by an Oireachtas committee.  Legislation to dissolve the Board was passed by the Oireachtas in December 2012. Its functions have now transferred back to the Department of Defence.  The membership of the interim Board appointed in July 2011 is set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Name </th><th>Nominating Bodies </th></tr><tr><td>Civil Defence Board Chairperson </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Brian Spain, Director, Department of Defence </td><td>Nominated by the Minister for Defence </td></tr><tr><td>Civil Defence Board Members</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Cathal Duffy, Principal, Department of Defence </td><td>Nominated by the Minister for Defence </td></tr><tr><td>Ms. Clare Tiernan, Principal, Department of Defence </td><td>Nominated by the Minister for Defence </td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Robert Mooney, Principal, Department of Defence </td><td>Nominated by the Minister for Defence </td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Bill Smith, Director General, Civil Defence Board </td><td>Appointed as Director General, Civil Defence Board </td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Ned Gleeson, County Manager, Limerick City Council </td><td>Nominated by County and City Managers&rsquo; Association </td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Keith Leonard, Assistant Fire Advisor </td><td>Nominated by the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government </td></tr><tr><td>Dr. Barbara Rafferty </td><td>Nominated by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland </td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Becci Cantrell </td><td>Nominated by the Environmental Protection Agency </td></tr><tr><td>Ms. Veronica Forde, Assistant Civil Defence Officer </td><td>Nominated by the Civil Defence Officers&rsquo; Association </td></tr><tr><td>Lt.

In the context of settling the Estimates for the Department of Defence for 2010, the Government decided that the national sail training scheme operated by Coiste an Asgard would be discontinued as recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure.  The formal wind up of the Company, including voluntary strike off with the Companies Registration Office, was completed in early 2013. </p><p>All appointments to Boards under the aegis of my Department are made in accordance with the relevant legislation or regulations.</p></reply>

Ireland has agreed to accept approximately 4,000 persons in total under resettlement and relocation programmes.  The figure of 4,000 includes approximately 2,600 persons to be taken in from migration hotspots in Italy and Greece under the new EU programme and 520 programme refugees from camps in Lebanon and Jordan, which the Irish Government has committed to taking in by the end of 2016 under Ireland's Refugee Resettlement programme.  The  balance of the 4,000 will be taken in on a gradual basis up to the end of 2017.</p>  <p>  Among the measures agreed under the programme was the establishment of a Network of Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres (EROCs)  which will be used to provide emergency accommodation and meet the basic needs of the 4,000 people who are expected to arrive over the next two years.  Also among the measures announced was the establishment of a cross-Departmental Taskforce, chaired by my Department, to coordinate and implement the logistical and operational aspects associated with the IRPP.  This will include the delivery of emergency accommodation and orientation services in the first instance and facilitating the longer term integration needs of those with refugee status through the provision of a sustainable housing strategy, health services, education, social welfare, and  social inclusion activities.</p>  <p>  In terms of expenditure a number of financial measures have been put in place.  As part of the original decision establishing the IRPP the Government announced a package of &euro;6 million in the short term to help establish the necessary structures required to implement the programme.  I have also secured &euro;25 million under the 2016 estimates process to meet the costs associated with delivering the Programme, including the establishment of Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres, the provision of orientation and integration services and the provision of additional staff to work in the key bottleneck areas to target backlogs and speed up processing.  The budget of the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration will also be increased next year by 89% to a total of &euro;4.445 million) to allow for additional staffing and integration measures required to support the increased intake of programme refugees in 2016.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Government has also acknowledged that there may be further costs associated with the delivery of mainstream services through Departments and State agencies such as the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, HSE, Tusla, etc.  Any such costs will feed into an overall assessment which will form the basis of further discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

This will include the curricular arrangements for the provision of clinical legal education and the methods by which, and the persons by whom, such education and training is provided.  I have also ensured that the Bill includes, at Section 34(1), for a public consultation specifically in relation to this matter.  The Authority's report to the Minister of that consultation must be provided within two years of the Authority's establishment.  It will contain a review of the existing arrangements and will make such recommendations as it considers appropriate in relation to any necessary reforms.  The outcome of these deliberations, as expressly enabled under the Bill, will inform policy in relation to legal professional education and in relation to how it may impact on access to the legal professions.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Bill's provisions on access to barristers, the Bill does in fact provide for direct access by clients to barristers in relation to non-contentious business under Section 101.  This is an important first step in ensuring that consumers who wish to directly access legal opinion do not necessarily have to do so through a solicitor intermediary.  At the same time, the Bill provides that direct access to barristers may in the future also be provided in relation to contentious matters, that is to say contested or disputed matters such as those coming before a court or tribunal.  This will be subject to the public consultation process set out in Section 120(1) of the Bill alongside the related consultation on the question of barristers holding clients' monies.  The results of these consultations, scheduled within 12 months of the establishment of the Authority, will inform the necessary next steps to be taken.  In this way the Bill provides a framework within which a degree of direct access to barristers can immediately be enjoyed by prospective clients for non-contentious business.

Careful and comprehensive research and consultation are required to develop and reform this very important area of the administration of justice.  This is particularly so, given the complexity and extent of existing legislative provisions and the very wide range of issues that are for consideration across many aspects of the appointments process including the appropriate qualifications and eligibility criteria.</p>  <p>  A consultations process relating to the system of judicial appointments was conducted in early 2014 with the intention of instituting reforms to enhance the current system.  It was considered that, while the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board process was a model of best practice in its day, almost 20 years from its establishment it was worthwhile to review the operation of the entire judicial appointments system to ensure it reflects current best practice.</p>  <p>  There was a significant response to the call for submissions which included a submission by the Judicial Appointments Review Committee which is chaired by the Chief Justice.</p>  <p>  Arising from the consultations process, draft legislative provisions to reform and update judicial appointment procedures are being prepared by my Department and I anticipate that these will be brought forward early in 2016.</p></reply>

A panel consisting of two senior and five junior counsel was established for that purpose. </p>  <p>  The Panel has provided recommendations to me in all 320 cases submitted to them and has therefore largely concluded its work.  The issuing of notification letters to complainants commenced on 29 June.  To date, 306 complainants have been notified of the outcome of the review of their cases.  Letters will continue to issue to all complainants, until the process is completed which I expect will be very shortly as we are nearing the end of the process.</p>  <p>  I have repeatedly emphasised that the Independent Review Mechanism was not established to act as a Commission of Inquiry or Investigation.  Nor was it designed to make findings. Its purpose was to triage the allegations to see whether further action was needed and what that action would be.  I know that some Deputies have argued that the review should have involved interviews with the complainants and other relevant persons, but with respect I think that is to misunderstand this process.  To have required counsel to hold hearings where they would interview everyone concerned would in effect have been to hold full-scale investigations into over 300 cases, without having made any attempt to see if this was necessary or practical. </p>  <p>  I wish also to stress the independence of this process.  The cases have all been considered by independent barristers, members of the Panel constituted to conduct this review.  Following their reviews of the papers in each complaint, counsel made recommendation to me, as to whether or not further action should be carried out by me, and if so the nature of that action.  I also decided to appoint a retired judge, Mr Justice Roderick Murphy, to advise on the preparation of letters notifying individuals as to the outcome of the review in their particular cases.  I was concerned that these letters should not only set out the recommendation of counsel, but also outline as far as possible the reasons for the recommendation, subject to any legal constraints there may be.   I made this appointment in order to provide complete reassurance on the probity and independence of this entire process, from start to finish. </p>  <p>  I have previously assured Deputies that where further investigation has been recommended by the review then that will occur.  However, I have also pointed out that in a large proportion of cases, counsel would be likely to recommend that no further action could reasonably be taken.  This has proven to be the case.  One of the main reasons for this has been because a case has already been through due process even though the complainant remains unhappy with the outcome.  The crucial point, however, is that every case has been reviewed by independent counsel, who have made an objective recommendation.</p>  <p>  As I have stated before, I will make a comprehensive statement on all matters relating to the process once it is completed, including an overview of the outcomes of cases.  I have also asked counsel to produce a general overview report on the issues and trends which featured in this process.</p></reply>

So far 295 of those new recruits are fully attested and are on the ground in communities nationwide. It is expected that a further 395 will attest by the end of 2016 which, taking account of projected retirements, will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark.  I expect recruitment to continue at or around the current levels for the next number of years having regard to factors such as the level of retirements in any one year.  I have also discussed with the Garda commissioner the desirability of a fresh recruitment drive for reserve members in the New Year.</p><p><b>Strength of the Force since 2006</b><table><tr><th>2006</th><th>2007</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015*</th></tr><tr><td>12,954</td><td>13,755</td><td>14,412</td><td>14,549</td><td>14,377</td><td>13,894</td><td>13,424</td><td>13,093</td><td>12,799</td><td>12,866</td></tr></table></p><p>(*October 2015 Garda numbers)</p></reply>

The other part, which relates to the pay and conditions of members and appropriate industrial relations mechanisms, is ongoing under the stewardship of Mr Ray McGee, formerly of the Labour Relations Commission.</p><p>The report makes some 80 recommendations in relation to the structures of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, its deployment practices, culture, human resources practices and financial management.  Some of the recommendations are far-reaching and, if implemented, would involve a fundamental restructuring of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na across the country.  It is, therefore, important that the full implications of the recommendations, and the analysis underpinning them, are considered in detail before any decisions are taken.  With these considerations in mind, I have put in place a process to seek the views of the Garda Commissioner and other bodies to whom recommendations are directed and have requested them to respond within a reasonably short period of time, having regard to the size and scope of the report. </p><p>In relation to the particular matter raised by the Deputy, the report does suggest that there are a significant number of technical or administrative posts occupied by Garda&iacute; that do not appear to require sworn powers, and that may provide good opportunities to increase the use of skilled civilians and release members for front-line roles.  As recognised by the Inspectorate, however, achieving the optimum composition of the Garda workforce as between highly trained Garda&iacute; and professional, skilled civilian staff and redeploying Garda members to front-line duties is a medium term project requiring very detailed analysis of the specific roles in An Garda Sioch&aacute;na in order to determine if they require Garda powers and if not, the mix of skills required by a civilian to fill the post instead.  It is not the case that members can simply be redeployed overnight &ndash; it must be done in planned way with suitably qualified civilians recruited to replace them.  In addition, there may be medical reasons arising from injuries received while serving on the front-line or other health reasons that might prevent a member being deployed to the front-line.</p><p>In saying that, I am keen that this work should progress as quickly as possible and my Department will continue to work with the Garda Commissioner and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in order to make progress in this area.  As an example of what can be achieved, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the process which is currently ongoing to civilianise border control functions at Dublin airport and the transfer of these responsibilities from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department.</p></reply>

Garda management keep this distribution under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of resources.<i></i>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that there are currently 978 Reserve members.</p><p>The Garda Reserve was established in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to enhance the links between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities and consists of voluntary unpaid members, drawn from the community, to support the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Reserve members make a real and tangible contribution to the policing of communities right across the country and I am fully supportive of the continued development of the Reserve.In particular, I welcome the recent conferring by the Commissioner of additional powers on reserve members under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and also her decision that reserve members should carry out additional duties including the serving of summonses, and the issuing of Fixed Charged Penalty Notices where offences are detected.</p><p>The Report of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate <i>&quot;Changing Policing in Ireland - Delivering a visible, accessible and responsive service&quot; </i>which I published on 9 December makes a range of recommendations in relation to the effective use of human resources including reserve members, and recommends that An  Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na develops a strategic plan for maximising the operational effectiveness and contribution of reserves.

Indeed I was very pleased that the recruitment campaign for 2016 for full-time members of the Service, which I announced recently, includes a special stream for eligible reserve members in order to ensure that due recognition is given to satisfactory service by such a member.  The Public Appointments Service (PAS) is organising the recruitment competition on behalf of the Garda Commissioner and applications may be made through the PAS website at .

The information for 2015 is not currently available.</p>  <p>  I can further advise the Deputy that the number of such persons held in custody at any one time is a tiny fraction of the overall prisoner population.  To illustrate this point, on 16 December 2015, 3 people or 0.08 percent out of a prison population of 3,731, in custody fell into this category.</p>  <p>  In terms of the Fines (Payments and Recovery) Act 2014 I can inform the Deputy that the Act was signed into law by the President on 16 April 2014. This legislation represents a very significant change in the way justice is administered by the courts. As well as introducing an option for persons to pay fines by instalment, there are also changes in the way those who fail to pay fines are dealt with, as the Act provides a range of options available to judges including recovery orders, attachment of earnings, community service and ultimately imprisonment. It is envisaged that the system will become operational in January 2016.</p></reply>

The Committee were invited to examine this draft analysis and provide any commentary they wished to make on it. The Committee's response to this draft analysis was provided by way of a presentation made by researchers associated with the Committee; this presentation was made on 30 September 2015.

This document clearly sets out who may apply for permission under this policy and the criteria which applies to them.  The outcome of an immigration decision in the area of family reunification depends on a number of factors: one of these being the security of the residence of the person with whom they seek to be reunited.  Immediate family members of non-EEA sponsors will, if granted immigration permission, continue to be subject to the employment permit requirements and they will be entitled to apply for immigration status in their own right under the various channels available, i.e. student, work permit etc. However, it is important to bear in mind that any person is potentially free to make an application to me for permission to reside in Ireland in their own right and also to adduce inter alia in their application any familial relationships with a resident in the State.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been established specifically for this purpose.

In particular, these conditions require that an applicant is of good character.  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and I know the Deputy will appreciate that it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p>  <p>  As I recently advised the Deputy, it is open to any individual to lodge an application for a certificate of naturalisation if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements as prescribed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended.  The fact that a person may have had an application refused does not preclude or disqualify them from submitting a fresh application in the future.  Indeed, the letter advising the person concerned of the Minister's decision also informed him that he may reapply for the grant of a certificate of naturalisation at any time.  The letter advised that, when considering making such a re-application, he should give due regard to the reasons for the refusal which were contained in the submission attached to the refusal letter and that any further application will be considered taking into account all statutory and administrative conditions applicable at the time of application.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Over 640 new vehicles are coming on stream since the start of 2015 including new specialised vehicles.  This investment will provide the Garda with additional high powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, cars for surveillance and covert operations, motor cycles for high visibility road policing and vehicles for public order policing. This investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016-2021, which provides an additional &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles over the life time of the plan. The increased budget allocation for 2016 will also facilitate additional funding for Garda surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing.  Following delivery and fit out, these vehicles will be allocated on a regional basis as determined by the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na consistent with operational requirements.</p></reply>

It thus allows for a reduction in staffing costs for hospital escorts. Following a competitive tender in 2014, Chubb Ireland Ltd. was awarded the contract for the supply of electronic monitoring of prisoners for the Irish Prison Service.</p>  <p>  The total cost of the provision of electronic tagging in 2014 was &euro;73,961 (inclusive of VAT).  The annual cost of the contract depends on the number of prisoners who are monitored throughout the course of the year. The cost for 2015 to date is &euro;152,335.78 (inclusive of VAT).  So far in 2015, there have been 49 prisoners in total who were electronically monitored while on temporary release as hospital in-patients.</p>  <p>  Subject to legislative amendment included in the General Scheme of the Bail Bill, it is intended to provide for electronic monitoring to be used in selected cases as a condition of bail.  The introduction of an electronic monitoring system for bail purposes will require a separate tendering process and involve the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The costs will depend on the type of system deployed, the numbers monitored and the outcome of the tender process.</p>  <p>  Provision for the electronic monitoring of certain sex offenders post release was also included in the General Scheme of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill and this would involve the Probation Service.

The other part, which relates to the pay and conditions of members and appropriate industrial relations mechanisms, is ongoing under the stewardship of Mr Ray McGee, formerly of the Labour Relations Commission.  I should mention that I have arranged for the report to be sent to Mr McGee in order that he may take it into account in completing his part of the review.</p><p>The report will make an important contribution to the on-going reform agenda in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It identifies scope for broad-ranging reforms in relation to the structures of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, its deployment practices, culture, human resources practices and financial management. Clearly, a report of this nature requires a considered response. Some of the recommendations are far-reaching and, if implemented, would involve a fundamental restructuring of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na across the country.  It is, therefore, important that the full implications of the recommendations and the analysis underpinning them are considered in detail before any decisions are taken. The Government is determined that whatever action might ultimately be taken in response will not interfere with the closeness of the relationship between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the communities it serves. In fact many of the recommendations are aimed at enhancing and developing frontline policing and community supports. With these considerations in mind, I have put in place a process to seek the views of the Garda Commissioner and other bodies to whom recommendations are directed. I have requested them to respond within a reasonably short period of time, having regard to the size and scope of the report. The report will also be considered by the Cabinet Committee on Justice Reform in the New Year.</p><p>When considering the report it is important to contextualise the recommendations. Many of them arise from historical underfunding of, for example, critical ICT infrastructure which the Government has sought to rectify by providing an additional &euro;205 million over the next number of years. It is also important to keep in mind the excellent work that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na do day in and day out to ensure the safety of our citizens throughout the State. Undoubtedly, the report identifies scope for broad-ranging reform but the need for on-going reform is a challenge that all organisations face, a fact acknowledged by the Inspectorate in the report itself.  In this regard I welcome the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s intention to publish a Strategic Transformation Programme for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shortly. I understand that the Programme will address many of the themes covered by the Inspectorate report and will also be sufficiently flexible to take on board any other agreed reforms.</p></reply>

Related matters were also investigated by the McEntee Commission of Investigation.  Arising from the report of the Barron Inquiry and the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights the Garda Commissioner appointed a dedicated liaison officer for the victims of the bombings in Dublin in 1972 and 1973 and in Dublin and Monaghan in 1974.  This dedicated liaison service has been in place since then and it is currently provided by a Garda Superintendent based at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation in Dublin.</p>  <p>  It is the policy of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to provide effective liaison with the victims of crime and their families.  The Garda authorities are strongly aware of the importance of victims in the criminal justice system and will continue to make efforts to ensure their needs are met, particularly in respect of making information available to them.  The Garda authorities are conscious of the need to ensure that the liaison process is operated in order to best address the needs of the individual victims while at the same time ensuring that criminal investigations would not be in any way compromised.</p>  <p>  In achieving this and in the interests of operational effectiveness, Garda liaison with the victims of serious crime and their families is provided directly to them from the Garda Division and investigation team which is investigating the case at hand.  The Garda&iacute; in the Division which is investigating a case are in possession of the detailed and up-to-date information with regard to it and are, therefore, best placed to interact with the victims and their families.  Such interaction is done directly by or under the supervision of the relevant Garda Superintendent.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that we must always be conscious that the victims of crime are individuals with individual needs and that any approach must take into account their specific requirements.</p></reply>

Such an examination would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort, that could not be justified where there are other significant demands on resources.</p><p>However, figures for assaults in our prisons in the years 2012 to 2014 are set out in a table. <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of Prisoner on Prisoner Assaults </th><th>Number of Prisoner Assaults on Staff </th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>715</td><td>107</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>530</td><td>147</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>564</td><td>144</td></tr></table></p><p>No level of inter prisoner violence or assaults is acceptable and effort is made by prison staff and management to limit the scope of acts of violence.  However, no regime can completely eliminate the possibility of violent incidents happening in a prison setting where a large number of dangerous and violent offenders are being held.</p><p>The Irish Prison Service has successfully introduced a number of measures across the prison estate such as, hand-held metal detectors, netting over prison yards, BOSS chairs and security screening machines to detect and prevent weapons from entering the prison to limit the scope of acts of violence. In addition, new prisoner programmes have been introduced such as the Incentivised Regimes policy which provides for a differentiation of privileges between prisoners according to their level of engagement with services and quality of behaviour. The objective is to provide tangible incentives to prisoners to participate in structured activities and to reinforce good behaviour, leading to a safer and more secure environment.</p></reply>

For the 2015-16 programme year, children who were born between 2 February 2011 and 30 June 2012 were eligible. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2016 it was announced that, from September 2016, children will be eligible to start free pre-school when they turn age 3, and can continue in free pre-school until they start primary school (once the child is not older than 5&frac12; years at the end of the relevant pre-school year i.e. end June).  As part of the reform of free pre-school, children will be able to enrol in free pre-school at three different points in the year - September, January and April - so that they can access free pre-school as soon as possible after they reach age 3.</p>  <p>  This budgetary measure implements a key recommendation of the Expert Advisory Group on the Early Years Strategy, which recommended that a free part-time place in early childhood care and education be available from every child&rsquo;s third birthday, until they enter primary school.  The Expert Group recognised that this would mean that the period of time a child would spend in free pre-school would vary depending on both the child&rsquo;s birth date and the age at which they start primary school.  The decision to allow children to register for free pre-school at three different points in the year was designed to ensure that children could access the benefits of pre-school as soon as they were old enough.</p>  <p>  In addition, an upper age limit for participation in free pre-school was set by the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment on the advice of the Department of Education and Skills.  Limiting the diversity in age ranges in primary school is considered to be generally in the best interest of children, in relation to peer interaction in junior infants, as well as other educational considerations.  This does mean that different children will spend different lengths of time in free pre-school, but our focus throughout in considering these issues was how to achieve the best outcomes for children.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular case raised by the Deputy, the child in question was born in January 2014.  She will be eligible to enrol for the free pre-school in April 2017 and can continue in the programme until June 2019, a total of 88 weeks.  If her parents decide to send her to primary school in September 2018 then she will avail of 50 weeks free pre-school. </p>  <p>  Childcare providers will not be required to hold places open in expectation of enrolments in January and April.  I am clear that more capacity will be required and that January and April enrolments may pose a challenge.  Officials in my Department are committed to assisting with these challenges.  They are already working closely with the City and County Childcare Committees and the Voluntary Childcare Organisations on a range of measures which will assist pre-school providers meet increased demand for free pre-school provision, particularly from January and April 2017.  Further information on these measures will be available shortly.</p></reply>

It provides the overarching framework for the development and implementation of policy and services for children and young people.  This is a whole of government framework, implementation of which is overseen by my Department.</p><p><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>set out a target of lifting over 70,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020, a reduction of at least two-thirds on the 2011 level.  The Department of Social Protection have the lead role in coordinating government strategies on child poverty and are the Sponsor of outcome 4 of <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>- economic security and opportunity.  The Department of Social Protection also has lead responsibility for the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  Its work is also informed by the European Commission Recommendation on &lsquo;Investing in children: Breaking the cycle of disadvantage&rsquo;.  The Department of Social Protection have identified child poverty as a key cross-sectoral priority to be addressed in 2015 and 2016 under the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures structures.</p><p>To assist in this, the Advisory Council for <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Future,</i>which brings together key members of the community and voluntary sectors who work with and for children and young people, and the Department of Social Protection have co-convened a subgroup with officials from my Department and other relevant Departments to progress solutions to the issue of child poverty.  This group has held two meetings in September and November 2015, and two more are planned for the near future.</p><p>Although the level of consistent poverty among children has fallen slightly from 11.7% to 11.2% between 2013 and 2014, the Government acknowledges the challenge in successfully achieving the child poverty target, but remains committed to meeting it.  The timescale for achieving the target will be influenced by the pace of economic and employment growth.  However, we believe having an ambitious target and actively monitoring this will provide a roadmap towards which we can develop and implement a strong multi-dimensional policy response.</p><p>As part of this multi-dimensional approach and the importance accorded to the development of effective and quality focused services and support for children and young people, my Department in collaboration with the DSP will hold an EU Peer Review in February 2016 to explore innovative responses in prevention and early intervention policy and provision to address child poverty and disadvantage.  This event will involve ten Member States and the European Commission. </p><p>My Department continues to work closely with the Department of Social Protection supporting this mutli-dimensional approach to child poverty.  There are also a number of areas of focus that support our response to child poverty within my Department.  My Department invests &euro;260 million annually on early childhood care and education and after-school support programmes which provide care to 100,000 children.  A number of these programmes are targeted at those on lowest incomes.  In addition in early 2015, I established an Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and After-School Care and Education.  The work of the group was focused on identifying policy objectives to guide future investment in this area.  This report was published in July 2015 and informed the estimates process for Budget 2016.  Budget 2016 provides for an additional &euro;85 million investment in 2016.</p><p>My Department is also leading the implementation of the Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme (2013-2017).  The ABC Programme is co-funded by my Department and The Atlantic Philanthropies and will have a total funding allocation of up to &euro;29.7 million.  The Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme aims to improve the outcomes for children, young people and existing service by drawing on best international practice to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched.  It is overseen by an inter-departmental project team.</p><p>My Department also provides targeted support for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through a range of schemes totalling &euro;49.93m of funding.  The purpose of recently published <i>National Youth Strategy 2015 - 2020</i>is to enable all young people aged 10 to 24 to realise their maximum potential with regard to the five national outcomes in <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.</i>It is a universal strategy for all young people.  It has a particular focus on the needs of young people experiencing, or at risk of experiencing the poorest outcomes. </p><p>Finally, as part of my Department's response, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency is also responsible for the delivery of a range of services focusing on the welfare, protection and support for children, young people and their families which are key to supporting outcomes which assist in actively mitigating the impact of child poverty.</p></reply>

These data show that:</p>  <p>  - 64% of five-year-old children are cared for at home by a parent after-school, 27% are in informal after-school childcare arrangements and 9% are in centre-based settings; and</p>  <p>  - 77% of nine-year-old children are cared for at home by a parent after-school, 19% are in informal after-school childcare arrangements and 3% are in centre-based settings </p>  <p>  I would like to inform the Deputy that earlier this year I established an Inter-Departmental Group to consider options for future investment in early years and after-school childcare.  This Group reported to Government in July this year, setting out a range of options for future investment to enhance affordability, increase the accessibility and improve the quality of early years and after-school childcare.  </p>  <p>  Several recommendations of the Group, which relate to after-school childcare, were considered as part of the Estimates process for the Budget and will be funded in 2016.  These include a &euro;3 million capital fund, which will be provided to enable both community/not-for-profit and private providers to develop after-school childcare services using existing school and other accessible community facilities.  Work will also begin on the development of Quality Standards for After-School Childcare, along with a consultation with children on their views about after-school childcare.  These new developments add to the range of programmes implemented by my Department to assist parents in accessing quality and affordable after-school childcare. These include:</p>  <p>  - The After-School Childcare (ASCC) programme that provides after-school care for primary school children of eligible parents for a period of 52 weeks.  Eligibility for the programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.  The programme contributes &euro;40 per week for an after-school place or &euro;80 per week in situations where the childcare service provides a pick-up service that collects the child from school.  The programme also provides a full day care rate of &euro;105 per week, for a maximum of 10 weeks, to cater for school holiday periods.  In all cases, the maximum fee payable by parents is &euro;15 per week per child.</p>  <p>  - The Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme, which is targeted specifically at participants in the Community Employment (CE) schemes operated by the Department of Social Protection.  Under this programme, &euro;80 per week is provided for pre-school places for children up to the age of 5 and &euro;40 per week for after-school places for primary school children up to the age of 13, with a set charge of &euro;15 per week to the parent in either case.  The programme also provides a part time day care rate of &euro;80 per week, for a maximum of 10 weeks, to cater for school holiday periods.  Places are approved for 50 weeks. Eligibility for the CEC programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  - The Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme, which provides childcare places, including part-time and after-school places, to qualifying Solas or Education and Training Boards (ETB) trainees or students for the duration of their courses.  Eligibility for the CETS programme is determined by the Department of Education and Skills. </p>  <p>  - The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to community childcare services to enable them to provide quality childcare, including after-school care, at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income working parents.</p></reply>

The Dublin Rape Crisis Centre have submitted a proposal to a number of Government Departments regarding the completion of a second such "snapshot" survey. </p>  <p>  The costs of the proposed survey are considerable and my Department is currently considering the proposal.  Considerations include the overall amount of funding available to my Department at any one time for research work, given the scale and duration of the investment required.  In addition, the Department is considering whether and to what degree a repeat of this survey is the most effective use of funds to research both adult and child abuse survivors at this point.  It is acknowledged that there is a need to take account of emerging issues and any research investment should be designed to meet with policy need and gaps in understanding and data.  Finally, the question how a survey of this scale and cost would be commissioned in accordance with procurement and other rules will need to be considered. </p>  <p>  I have been in discussions with my colleague the Minister for Justice on the matter and we are both anxious to work with the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and other providers to determine data and research priorities in this areas.

Given the legislative framework utilised to manage the interaction between the Child Care Act 1991 and the Health Act 2007, in relation to special care provisions, Regulations to be made by the Minister for Health under the Health Act 2007 are required in advance of the commencement of these sections.  These Regulations have now been finalised.  I hope to sign a Commencement Order for the relevant sections of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2011, and arrange for the Regulations to be signed by my colleague the Minister for Health, in the near future.</p>  <p>  The Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015 was signed into law on 10th December 2015.  The main body of provision relates to aftercare but it also includes provision in relation to early years services and technical amendments on foot of the commencement of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013.  I hope to commence this Act in the near future. </p>  <p>  The Children (Amendment) Act 2015 was signed into law on 27 July 2015.  This legislation amends certain provisions of the Children Act 2001 on the operation of the children detention schools.  I signed the first commencement order under the 2015 Act on 27 November 2015 which brought a number of technical provisions of the Act relating to the children detention schools into force from 1 December 2015.  These provisions are listed in the Children (Amendment) Act 2015 (Commencement) Order 2015, Statutory Instrument Number 539 of 2015.  The remaining sections yet to be commenced relate to the ending of the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities, the introduction of a new system of remission in the children detention schools and a technical issue relating to the operation of the Children Court on the issuing of detention orders under the Children Act 2001.  In relation to the first of these issues, the relevant sections are to be commenced early in 2016 on foot of the completion of the current programme of recruitment for care staff to work in the children detention schools.  The sections on remission and issuing of detention orders will also be commenced early in 2016 on foot of the completion of policy work for the required secondary legislation in this area.  </p>  <p>  The Children First Act 2015 was enacted on the 19 Nov 2015. The Act is for the purpose of making further and better provision for the care and protection of children including raising awareness of child abuse and neglect, providing for reporting and management of child protection concerns and improving child protection arrangements in organisations providing services to children.  The Sections that have commenced are 1 to 5 and 28, effective from 11 Dec 2015.  The Sections not commenced are: Section 6-7 (Part I General and Preliminary), Section 8-13 (Part 2 Child Safeguarding Statements), Section 14-19 (Part 3 Reporting), Sections 20-27 (Part 4 Children First Inter-Departmental Group and Sectoral Implementation Plans).  A significant provision in the legislation is the underpinning on a statutory basis of the Children First Interdepartmental Implementation Group.  This Group, which will include a representative of all Government Departments, will be required to keep under review, the implementation of this legislation and the Children First Guidance, and to report on an annual basis to the Minister.</p></reply>

This protocol sets out three options.  </p>  <p>  1. Does a State Agency require the property?</p>  <p>  2. Open market sale, subject to favourable market conditions.</p>  <p>  3. Community/voluntary use will be considered only if points 1 and 2 above do not materialise.</p>  <p>  Any proposals for the property in question to must be considered in the context of the capital funding available to Health and the Government's Reform Plan relating to the State's property asset use and management.  In this context, I must advise you that the Health Service Executive is required to obtain value for money when disposing of surplus property assets.  These proceeds will be re-invested in delivering much needed health care infrastructure.  As there will always be more projects than can be funded by the Exchequer facilities which support the delivery of core health services must be prioritised within the context of the overall capital envelope available to us.  Given the limited funding available and our health infrastructure needs, priority for funding must be based on verified service needs and all capital funding must be directed to supporting these core services.  The HSE is concentrating on applying the limited funding available for capital works in the most effective way possible to meet health care needs now and in the future.   </p>  <p>  In addition consideration must be given to the Government's Reform Plan which sets out commitments relating to property asset use and management.  These commitments include ensuring that optimal value for money is achieved in the management of the State's property portfolio.  The development and implementation of the Property Management Delivery Plan has been one of the outcomes of the reform process.  This plan aims to improve the planning and management of the public service property portfolio by improving co-ordination of strategies and activities, processes for strategic planning, projects and property management, standards for accommodation fit-out and data capture, accountability for decision making and deployment of resources. </p>  <p>  The HSE has engaged locally on the potential use of the property for historical, heritage and cultural purposes; the proposal sought was not submitted.  It has also engaged with the private sector with the view to sale.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has made contact with the local HSE Estates Office and a meeting is being arranged.  HSE officials will meet their representatives early in the new year. </p></reply>

The Department of Health is examining the Irish Pharmacy Union's proposal for a Minor Ailments Scheme, having regard to the evidence base for such a service, the application of such schemes in other countries and any contractual or funding implications.  The Department has engaged the services of the Health Research Board (HRB) to undertake an analysis of Minor Ailments Schemes in other jurisdictions.

The HRB's report will assist the Department in its consideration of this matter.</p>  <p>  In October 2015, the Minister for Health signed new regulations to expand the range of vaccines which can be administered by pharmacists.

Over this period, the annual Rural Practice Allowance (RPA) under the GMS capitation agreement was reduced from &euro;20,712.29 to the current rate of &euro;16,216.07.</p>  <p>  Currently, 168 GPs are in receipt of the RPA.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-12-17a.1161.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121700082#WRBB04300"><p>In 2012, my Department engaged with an expert from the UK NHS (Mark Ogden) to examine the financial management of the Health Service Executive and make recommendations regarding strengthening and improving the management of its finances.  The report made a number of recommendations to improve the financial management process within the HSE.  Particular reference was made to managing the transition phase that the health sector was undergoing.  The recommendations were grouped into 3 distinct areas: Improving Financial Performance; Policy Considerations; and Effective Transitioning (Managing the Change).  These are set out in the attached note <i>A Review of Financial Management Systems in the Irish Health Service.</i></p><p>Subsequently, PA Consultancy was engaged to undertake a wide-ranging review of financial management and cost containment systems in the health service, including an assessment of the Ogden Report and the preparation of an action plan for the implementation of its recommendations.</p><p>Financial Reform is a key element of <i>Future Health - A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012 &ndash; 2015. </i>The HSE commenced the Finance Reform Programme in 2012.  Central to the establishment of this programme was the recognition that successful implementation of Future Health and the wider reform agenda will require fundamental changes in the way financial management is delivered across the health service in Ireland.  One of the early outputs of the programme was the development of a new operating model for finance in health.  The HSE has submitted a business case for the new operating model which defines the case for change and scope as well as providing an estimate of the resources required to deliver the new operating model and supporting technology.</p><p>The change programme covers a number of different strands and involves business process re-engineering, with a recent focus on the technology aspect of the Reform Programme.  An ICT business case for an Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) was the subject of peer review and the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) recently confirmed that the peer review team recommended that the project as presented should proceed to the next stage. </p><p>Work is progressing on the Finance Reform Programme on a number of important work streams.  Key activities being worked on across the reform programme include developing a stabilisation approach for legacy finance systems and a business intelligence (BI) solution for identifying and agreeing one national reporting finance system for the HSE.  Permission has recently been received from the OGCIO to proceed with the first phase of the stabilisation project and the Finance Reform Board has recently given the go ahead for a Finance BI solution.  Significant progress has also been made in developing and finalising the approach for the procurement of the key components of an IFMS.  The Office of Government Procurement has requested that the procurement of Lot 1 IFMS (Enterprise Resource Planning Platform) should commence as soon as possible subject to the appropriate approvals.  A procurement plan has been developed with two stages to the procurement approach. The HSE are working on the tender documents for stage 1.</p><p>The new financial operating model will greatly enhance the health sector's ability to effectively manage and monitor its budget at all levels.</p><p><b>A REVIEW OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IN THE IRISH HEALTH SERVICE</b></p><p><b>Main Recommendations</b><table><tr><th></th><th><b>1.

In 2008, the then Government decided, in light of financial circumstances, to defer further implementation of the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  However, in light of legal advice following a ruling of the High Court, children born after 1 June 2002 are being treated by the Health Service Executive as eligible to apply for an assessment under the Act.  Part 2 of the 2005 Act provides for an assessment of the needs of eligible applicants, occasioned by their disability, to be commenced within three months of receipt of an application and completed within a further three months.  </p>  <p>  The HSE recognises that it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory time-frames which apply to the assessment of need process, given the number and complexity of cases, and has taken a number of measures to address the issue.  While any delay in assessment or intervention for any child is not desirable, it should be noted that the assessment process under the Disability Act can take place in parallel with any intervention which is identified as necessary.</p>  <p>  Following the publication of a National Disability Authority report commissioned by the Department of Health and the HSE, a major emphasis is being placed on reconfiguring children&rsquo;s disability services into integrated multi-disciplinary geographically-based early-intervention and school-aged teams under the HSE&rsquo;s Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme.  The key objective of this programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities, including autism, and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school they go to, or the nature of the individual child&rsquo;s difficulties.  In 2014, an additional &euro;4 million was specifically allocated to drive implementation of the programme, equating to approximately 80 additional therapy posts.  A further additional &euro;4m (equating to &euro;6m in a full year) has been allocated to the programme this year to support its ongoing implementation.  </p>  <p>  Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Funding is being provided in 2016 to expand the provision of speech and language therapy in primary care and to support the reorganisation and expansion of speech and language and other therapies under the Progressing Disability Services Programme.

Implementation of a vision strategy along the lines recommended by the National Vision Coalition has not been costed by the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  There are a range of health services in place aimed at protecting people's eye health and where necessary providing supports to people with visual impairment.  These services are based on the goals and principles of Healthy Ireland which aims to improve the health and well-being of the population through a greater emphasis on prevention, early intervention and keeping individuals and communities well.  A number of services are provided in primary care and supported by secondary and specialist services for those who need them. </p>  <p>  The Primary Care Eye Services Review Group, which was established by the HSE, is due to report in early 2016.  It will set out a clear blueprint with recommendations for the delivery of primary care eye services which will ensure a high quality, safe and consistent service for patients.  The National Vision Coalition was among the stakeholders consulted by the Review Group.  It should be noted that any cost implications of the Review Group recommendations will need to be considered in the context of the financial resources available to the HSE in 2016 and future years.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable.

Patients are assessed by the HSE Orthodontic Service under the modified Index of Treatment Need.  Patients with the greatest level of need are provided with treatment by the HSE.

One member of the dental hygienist staff and one member of the dental nursing staff completed a one-year training course in September 2015.  They are now working in the HSE under the supervision of specialist orthodontists.  The scheme is currently undergoing an evaluation, which includes consideration of how the scheme is affecting waiting lists.  Figures are currently being collated and early indications are positive.  It is planned to extend the scheme nationally after the evaluation has been completed. </p><p>In addition, a national procurement process is currently underway to provide treatment for certain categories of misalignment by a panel of independent practitioners under contract to the HSE over the next three years, with consideration of an extension to four years.  This initiative will especially focus on those waiting for four years or longer.  Tenders are currently being evaluated and contracts will be awarded in the coming weeks.

The Government currently provides funding of approximately &euro;1.5 billion to the Disability Services Programme through the Health Service Executive's National Service Plan for 2015.</p><p>In 2015, the HSE is seeking to maximise the provision of services within available resources and to maintaining a consistent level to that provided in 2014, by providing the following specialist disability services:</p><p>- residential services to around 9,000 people with a disability; </p><p>- day services to over 22,000 people with intellectual and physical disabilities; </p><p>- respite residential support of 190,000 overnights for people with intellectual and physical disabilities; and</p><p>- 3.9 million hours of Personal Assistant/Home Support Hours.</p><p>Additional funding of &euro;6 million has been allocated in the HSE National Service Plan in 2015 to provide day places for an estimated 1,400 young people finishing school and rehabilitative (life-skills) training.  &euro;4m in additional funding has also been allocated in the Plan to deliver an increase in the services for children with disabilities and reduce waiting lists under the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18s) Programme.</p><p>I have been informed that the HSE is acutely aware of the resource shortfall presented by Camphill and is currently engaging with them to develop an agreed set of proposals to resolve the challenges over an agreed period of time.  This includes a commitment to supporting the organisation to re-configure the current model of service and funding arrangements to a more sustainable model while still maintaining the particular ethos of the service. </p><p>I understand that as part of this process of engagement, the HSE requested Camphill to consider how its model of service provision may change over the coming years as Disability Services are reformed.  The HSE will work closely with Camphill to shape a five year plan to secure the additional resources required to ensure the future of the organisation in a sustainable way. </p><p>I have been assured by the HSE that it will continue to work with Camphill and be as supportive as possible within current financial constraints.</p></reply>

This protocol sets out three options.  </p>  <p>  1. Does a State Agency require the property?</p>  <p>  2. Open market sale, subject to favourable market conditions.</p>  <p>  3. Community/voluntary use will be considered only if points 1 and 2 above do not materialise.</p>  <p>  Any proposals for the property in question to must be considered in the context of the capital funding available to Health and the Government's Reform Plan relating to the State's property asset use and management.  In this context, I must advise you that the Health Service Executive is required to obtain value for money when disposing of surplus property assets.  These proceeds will be re-invested in delivering much needed health care infrastructure.  As there will always be more projects than can be funded by the Exchequer, facilities which support the delivery of core health services must be prioritised within the context of the overall capital envelope available to us.  Given the limited funding available and our health infrastructure needs, priority for funding must be based on verified service needs and all capital funding must be directed to supporting these core services.  The HSE is concentrating on applying the limited funding available for capital works in the most effective way possible to meet health care needs now and in the future.   </p>  <p>  In addition, consideration must be given to the Government's Reform Plan which sets out commitments relating to property asset use and management.  These commitments include ensuring that optimal value for money is achieved in the management of the State's property portfolio.  The development and implementation of the Property Management Delivery Plan has been one of the outcomes of the reform process.  This plan aims to improve the planning and management of the public service property portfolio by improving co-ordination of strategies and activities, processes for strategic planning, projects and property management, standards for accommodation fit-out and data capture, accountability for decision making and deployment of resources. </p>  <p>  The HSE has been requested to reply directly to you as regards its plans for the property in question.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, please contact my Private Office who will follow up.</p></reply>

Patients have the ability to apply to the HSE TAS seeking access to public healthcare outside the State through model form E112.  The application requires the patient's Irish-based public referring hospital consultant, following clinical assessment, to certify, among other things, that the treatment is medically necessary and will meet the patient&rsquo;s needs.

Once the implementation framework has been agreed by the Steering Group, it will go for consultation to the wider stakeholder interest groups.  Following this consultation the framework will be revised and will guide and oversee the reconfiguration and development of Neuro-rehabilitation structures and services at national and local level, from within existing resources.</p>  <p>  In August 2015, my colleague, the Minister for Health, announced an additional &euro;15 million for the redevelopment of the National Rehabilitation Hospital (NRH) in Dun Laoghaire.  This allocation will now enable the NRH and the HSE to proceed with a new 120 bed building on the Dun Laoghaire campus.  The redeveloped facility will be purpose built to accommodate integrated therapy services, hydrotherapy and sports facilities.</p>  <p>  Outside of the Clinical Programme, the HSE&rsquo;s Disability Services Division has a role in certain key aspects of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services, primarily the provision of community based therapy services, and personal social services, often funded through partner service providing agencies in the non-statutory sector.  The Disability Services Division will focus on Disability funded rehabilitation services in 2016, and enable reconfiguration of existing provision through the establishment of demonstration sites.  Close links will be maintained with the Rehabilitation Medicine Clinical Programme to ensure that there is no duplication of effort and that all initiatives receive optimal support.  Demonstration sites have been identified by Disability Services and mapping has commenced.</p></reply>

This service is developing in line with best practice and the national clinical programme for acute coronary care. </p>  <p>  The cath lab in UHW performs approximately 40 invasive cardiovascular procedures each week and offers a comprehensive range of invasive and non-invasive diagnostic services. This includes the insertion of stents, pacemakers and implantable defibrillators.</p>  <p>  Primary PCI is undertaken with STEMI heart attacks which are about 20% of all heart attacks. It is done in a cath lab by an experienced cardiologist. The cath lab in UHW is open five days a week from 8.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. Patients who require Primary PCI outside these hours are transferred to Cork University Hospital or to a Dublin hospital. However it is important to note that 24 hour, 7 day a week consultant medical cover for cardiac patients is provided in UHW.</p>  <p>  I am aware that UHW is committed to the progressive extension of the current PPCI service. However, the reality is that any extension to the service will require significant investment, both capital and revenue. 24 hour emergency PPCI cover requires, as a minimum, two cath labs on site. It also requires a minimum of 6 interventional cardiologists. As for any complex acute hospital service, a key criterion for deciding whether a 24 hour PPCI service should be provided, is whether there is sufficient volume of appropriate patient activity to ensure the safe provision of the service. Without sufficient volume of service, staff will not be in a position to maintain their skills and in those circumstances, it will not be possible to provide a safe service.</p>  <p>  Funding for new developments is limited and it is of critical importance that the available funds are targeted appropriately. UHW is a constituent hospital of the South South West Hospital Group. The priority to be afforded to the expansion of the PPCI service in Waterford must first be considered from a hospital group perspective and in relation to the planning for the cardiology needs of the Group population.  The development must then be considered in a national context, and in the light of competing demands for scarce resources.</p>  <p>  This proposal remains to be considered and prioritised by the HSE.  In this regard, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly. If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and my officials will follow the matter up.</p></reply>

It also seeks to protect the rights of everyone using the mental health services.</p>  <p>  Details relating to the admittance of persons to residential psychiatric facilities are set out in the Mental Health Commission&rsquo;s &lsquo;Code of Practice on Admission, Transfer and Discharge to and from an Approved Centre&rsquo;.  This code of practise requires that residents should be actively involved in the admission process and in the development of individual care and treatment plans.  The code also states that the resident&rsquo;s family/carer and/or chosen advocate should be involved in the admission process and in the development of the care and treatment plan with the resident&rsquo;s consent.  Where the resident has no advocate, one can be made available.</p>  <p>  In addition, the National Standards for Mental Health Services are set out in another Mental Health Commission document &lsquo;Quality Framework Mental Health Services in Ireland&rsquo;.  Theme six of this framework relates to &lsquo;Family/chosen advocate involvement and support&rsquo; and goes on to state that families/chosen advocate should receive information about what services are available, how they work and  how to access them, especially in a crisis.  Families/chosen advocates should also receive support from the mental health team through an assigned member of staff. The level of support required is provided based on identified need.</p>  <p>  Following the publication of an Expert Group review of the Mental Health Act 2001, a major reform of current mental health legislation is underway to reflect the recommendations of the Expert Group. A number of the recommendations of the Expert Group will further strengthen and enhance the protections of both voluntary and involuntary patients for the admittance  to residential psychiatric facilities as well as increasing the powers of the Mental Health Commission to make standards in respect of all mental health services. In addition, the Expert Group recommended that the revised legislation should proactively encourage and support patients to involve family and/or carers in the admission process and in the development of care and treatment plans with the patient's consent. The Group also recommended that all relevant professional bodies involved in mental health care should ensure their codes of practice guidelines for practitioners reflect the need to involve families and/or carers in the development of care and treatment plans with the patient's consent.</p></reply>

Prior to reimbursing any medicine, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria, including clinical need, cost-effectiveness and the resources available to the HSE.</p>  <p>  The decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). They are not political or ministerial decisions. The NCPE conducts the health technology assessment of pharmaceutical products for the HSE, and can make recommendations on reimbursement to assist the HSE in its decision-making process.</p>  <p>  Vertex Pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of Orkambi&trade;, submitted a Rapid Review application for the drug to the NCPE on 26 November 2015. The company is expected to submit a full pricing and reimbursement application to the HSE/Primary Care Reimbursement Service in the immediate future. </p>  <p>  Once this application is received, it will be considered by the HSE in line with criteria set out in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 and using the processes outlined in national pricing framework agreements.</p></reply>

In line with Government Decision S180/20/10/1617 of 2014 and Guidelines set out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform relating to the advertising for expressions of interest in vacancies on State Boards, my Department, in conjunction with the Public Appointments Service currently advertises for board vacancies as they arise, where I, as Minister for Health, have nominating rights under relevant legislation. The notices about forthcoming vacancies are advertised on the <i>stateboards.ie</i>website and are also placed on my Department's website.</p><p>There have been over 700 appointments made under the aegis of my Department since March 2011, of which 360 positions where filled through the advertising process. There are some exceptions to the advertising process.  For example, the members of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal are appointed by the Minister, on the advice of the Attorney General, as these members carry out a very specific role in relation to assessing the quantum of awards under the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act.  In 2012 and 2013  in the case of some hospital boards, e.g. Beaumont and St James&rsquo;s, the term of existing members was extended as a prudent provisional measure, to allow time for appropriate competencies required in members of these boards to be set out, given the Health Reform Programme and its impact on hospital configuration.  Appointments of the new board members were subsequently advertised.</p><p>Many appointments have been made on the nomination of other bodies as specified in legislation, or were re-appointments. It should be noted that there were no advertising campaigns in 2011, but 34 appointments were made where the Minister had nominating rights. It should also be noted that there are several campaigns ongoing with appointments pending.</p></reply>

The plan will be rolled out at a regional and local level and will involve full consultation. </p>  <p>  In terms of housing, the Department of Health and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government are working in collaboration to support the transition of people with a disability from institutions to social housing in the community under the Government's National Housing Strategy for People with Disability 2011 to 2016.</p>  <p>  As part of the implementation process, in 2013 and 2014 one million euro was transferred from the Department of Health&rsquo;s Vote to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government&rsquo;s Vote to provide for the ring-fenced social housing costs of up to 150 people leaving disability or mental health institutions. At the end of December 2014, it is estimated that there were around 3,000 people with a disability living in congregated settings. The HSE has prioritised the transition of 150 people from congregated settings in 2015. In 2015, one million euro has been allocated to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to continue this process.</p>  <p>  As the HSE is responsible for leading out on the recommendations on &ldquo;Time to Move on from Congregated Settings &ndash; A Strategy for Community Inclusion&rdquo;, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.  If the Deputy has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, he can contact my Private Office and they will follow the matter up with the HSE.</p></reply>

Every year, young people with disabilities finish their second level education and progress to the next stage in their lives. For most, the hope is that they will progress directly to further education, vocational training or employment. Responsibility for the provision of services and supports in these areas lies with the Government Departments and agencies that have responsibility for providing these services to the whole population.</p>  <p>  Some young people who have more complex support needs will require life-skills training or day supports provided by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The HSE, through its Occupational Guidance Service, works with schools, service providers, young people with disabilities and their families to identify training needs and explore suitable options.</p>  <p>  One of the most significant projects currently being progressed by the HSE is the implementation of the person-centred approach to day services outlined in New Directions - Report on the National Working Group for the Review of HSE funded Adult Day Services. The New Directions policy proposes that health-funded day services for adults with disabilities should be based on the principles of person-centredness, community inclusion, active citizenship and high quality service provision.  The HSE is committed to providing services in a more individualised and person-centred way to people availing of day services including school-leavers and those graduating from Rehabilitative (Lifeskills) training, whose service should in future take the form of individualised and personally chosen outcome-focused supports.</p>  <p>  Each Local Health Office area in the Health Service Executive (HSE) has a dedicated Disability Manager to coordinate the delivery of services to people with disabilities.  It is open to the individual and his family to discuss his options on leaving school with the Disability Manager for their area who can be contacted at: Fujitsu House, Unit 100, 4th Floor, Lakeshore Drive, Airside, Swords; phone number 01 8953725.</p></reply>

The article states that &ldquo;If a Member State is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other Member States shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power, in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.  This shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The French Ambassador to Ireland subsequently met with senior officials from my Department and senior officials from a number of other Departments, including the Department of Defence, for initial discussions as to how Ireland might provide practical assistance to France.  These Departments are considering how best Ireland can respond, taking account of France&rsquo;s needs, and our resources and expertise.  No decision has been taken regarding the nature of our assistance and I do not wish to pre-judge the outcome of ongoing discussions.</p>  <p>  The possibility of taking on UN-authorised peacekeeping duties to which France is currently committed, including in Mali, has been mentioned as one possible option.  The purpose of any such deployment would be to ensuring the continued effectiveness of UN-authorised peacekeeping missions in the event of a French withdrawal.</p>  <p>  Assistance which we provide will be consistent with Irish law and with our longstanding policy of military neutrality.</p></reply>

The Bill is aimed at providing access to several thousand E3 visas for Irish citizens.</p><p>I warmly welcome this positive step towards meeting the desire of many Irish people to live and work in the US for a time, but would also point out that there is much work to be done in both Houses of Congress before this Bill might become law.  I am also aware that while this particular measure would help with our objective of securing improved legal migration channels, it would not address the concerns of undocumented citizens currently in the US.  These remain a key priority and continue to be the subject of our<i></i>ongoing contacts with the US authorities.  In addition, the Government has provided financial support of &euro;1,535,911 in 2015 to assist the work of Irish immigration centres who, inter alia, offer advice and support to our undocumented citizens.</p><p>The Government as a whole, including my Department in Dublin and our Embassy in Washington, is continuing to engage with Congressman Sensenbrenner and other Congressional contacts, across both sides of the political aisle, to encourage progress on the E3 visa Bill proposed by the Congressman through the legislative process.</p></reply>

That strategy is based on two key objectives: first, to see this citizen released by the Egyptian authorities so that he can return to his family and his studies in Ireland and, second, to provide consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention. </p>  <p>  In furtherance of these objectives, I have intensively engaged with the Egyptian authorities, including the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs and Egypt&rsquo;s Ambassador to Ireland, and with EU and international partners, including High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Ms. Federica Mogherini. The Taoiseach also raised the case in person on two occasions with Egyptian President al-Sisi. The information we receive from all of these contacts is carefully considered and used in reviewing our approach to this case on a constant basis.</p>  <p>  Significant resources in Cairo and in Dublin continue to be deployed in the provision of consular assistance to both the citizen and their family. I would also note that Embassy officials visited this citizen in detention for the forty-eighth time on 23 November. </p>  <p>  Irrespective of any views regarding the fairness or appropriateness of any arrest abroad, the reality is that where an Irish citizen is charged with an offence under the law of a foreign country, it is the foreign law that applies and it is the relevant foreign court which decides matters such as bail and release. While the Irish Government is entitled to expect that its citizens will receive a trial similar to that in Ireland, this is not always the case in practice. The Government has made several representations to the Egyptian Government about this citizen&rsquo;s time spent in detention without conviction, and has supported applications for release on bail in accordance with Egyptian law.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to review its approach and retains the flexibility to adjust it as and when that may be required, but the Government&rsquo;s approach is guided at all times by the two key objectives set out.</p></reply>

This has been a key priority for Ireland and its EU partners in recent years.</p>  <p>  I welcome the announcements of 30 October and 14 November by international stakeholders, including the European Union and a number of EU Member States, in Vienna on the launching of negotiations, the holding of elections, working for a nationwide ceasefire and supporting unimpeded humanitarian access across Syria.  I call on all parties to support the UN&rsquo;s efforts and to commit themselves to work sincerely and with urgency for a nationwide ceasefire and a negotiated peace agreement.  Ireland strongly endorses the efforts of the United Nations to renew peace negotiations based on the 2012 Geneva communique principles, in particular the ending of violence, the formation of a transitional governing body with full executive powers and a constitutional reform process which would protect Syria&rsquo;s multi-ethnic and multi-sectarian character.  </p>  <p>  I believe that there must also be legal accountability for victims of the Syrian conflict and in 2014 we co-sponsored a resolution called for referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. </p>  <p>  While I am appalled by the actions of the Assad regime  and convinced that a political transition is needed, I want to make clear that, ultimately, it is the Syrian people&rsquo;s right to decide on Syria&rsquo;s future national leadership. </p>  <p>  Ireland has pledged that our support for the Syrian people will reach over &euro;42 million by the end of 2015.</p>  <p>  Any decision on the possible establishment of a mandated safe haven or no-fly zone in Syria is a matter which falls to the UN Security Council.

The conflict in Syria - the biggest driver behind this year&rsquo;s migrant flows - has led to the world&rsquo;s largest humanitarian crisis. But the problem is bigger than Syria. An estimated 60 million displaced people worldwide are on the move, the highest since World War II. They are coming not just from Syria but from such places such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Gaza and a dozen or so countries in sub-Saharan and North Africa.</p>  <p>  For most of this year Migration has been at the very top of the EU agenda. There have been no fewer than five special meetings of Justice and Home Affairs ministers devoted to migration while Heads of State and Government have debated the issue in three special councils. I and my foreign minister colleagues have also addressed the issue many times this year.</p>  <p>  In June, the Foreign Affairs Council launched EUNAVFOR Med, the EU&rsquo;s naval operation to disrupt the dangerous activities of people smugglers in the Mediterranean, which have tragically resulted in the loss of many lives. As the Deputy will know, the crews of the L.E. Niamh, Eithne and Samuel Beckett have done sterling work in saving more than 8,500 lives. </p>  <p>  In September, the Government decided accept up to 4,000 asylum seekers and refugees as part of the European Commission&rsquo;s comprehensive plan to address the migration crisis. </p>  <p>  As part of its efforts to develop a comprehensive strategy to address the refugee crisis, the EU organised two high level conferences earlier this year. On 8 October, a conference focusing on migration flows into the EU through the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Balkans route took place in Luxembourg attended by both JHA and Foreign Ministers. The Conference issued a Declaration endorsing a five-pronged approach to addressing the migration challenge. </p>  <p>  On 11/12 November EU Heads of State and Government met their African counterparts at a migration summit in Valletta. They agreed to establish a Trust Fund to address the root causes of migration in Africa. The &euro;1.8 billion Fund is to be augmented by EU member state contributions. Ireland is contributing &euro;3m.</p>  <p>  On 29 November, there was a key meeting of EU Heads of Government with Turkey in Brussels at which the EU agreed to provide a financial package worth &euro;3 billion to help Turkey accommodate the more than two million refugees residing in the country. As part of the agreement there is to be a concerted effort by Turkey to stem the flow of irregular migrants through its territory. This agreement &ndash; or Joint Plan of Action &ndash; presents a real opportunity to stem the flow of such migrants into the EU. </p>  <p>  The scale and complexity of the Migration challenge means that there are no quick fixes. But in the past year the European Council, the Foreign Affairs Council, the Justice and Home Affairs Council and the General Affairs Council have adopted an extensive programme to address the crisis in the short, medium and long-term.</p>  <p>  I trust the Deputy will agree that these initiatives demonstrate both the united approach of the EU, and its determination to see the refugee crisis resolved as soon as possible. </p></reply>

International pressure has not, unfortunately, been sufficient to bring those talks successfully to a conclusion. Many reasons can be suggested for these failures, but they amount essentially to a complete lack of trust between the two sides, and a persistent reluctance by the Israeli Government to contemplate the difficult choices and compromises without which no negotiation can succeed.</p>  <p>  I remain convinced that the conflict is entirely capable of resolution, if both sides can be convinced that it is in their own interest to end the current situation. The international community should concentrate its attention on creating those conditions.</p>  <p>  The EU, the UN, the Quartet, the United States, and the Arab League are all active in trying to bring the parties and the process forward.

Official Ethiopian Government figures indicate that 10.2 million people will require food assistance in early 2016.  This is in addition to the 7.9 million people receiving food and cash transfers as part of the Government&rsquo;s Productive Safety Net Programme.</p>  <p>  The Ethiopian Government is leading the response to the current humanitarian crisis.  It has provided US$200 million in emergency support in 2015 and a further allocation of $97 million has been committed to support food distribution in early 2016.  However, given the scale and severity of the crisis, the Ethiopian Government has also requested assistance from the international community, including Ireland.</p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Addis Ababa has taken a leading role, on behalf of all development partners, in dialogue with the Ethiopian Government and in advocating for a greater response from the international community.  Embassy officials have met with the Ministers of Finance and Agriculture to promote the joint response by the Government and international community to the crisis.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a long-standing engagement with Ethiopia, one of our seven Key Partner Countries in sub-Saharan Africa. This year alone, we have increased our bilateral programme in Ethiopia to nearly &euro;28 million to address poverty, vulnerability and the impact of the current humanitarian crisis.</p>  <p>  Through our bilateral programme in 2015, we have provided &euro;10.4 million to the Productive Safety Net Programme, as well as &euro;3.8 million to the Humanitarian Response Fund managed by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to address immediate humanitarian needs. A further &euro;1.8 million in humanitarian assistance has been provided through NGO partners Tr&oacute;caire, GOAL and Concern. </p>  <p>  Ethiopia is one of Africa&rsquo;s most vibrant economies. Timely intervention now will help ensure its economic growth and protect development gains. We will continue to monitor the situation as it unfolds.  In 2016, we anticipate that over 50% of Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral programme in Ethiopia will continue to be targeted at meeting the humanitarian needs of those affected by the crisis.</p></reply>

They also involve the clear and persistent abuse of human rights, especially of women and girls, and a direct threat to education and education facilities.</p>  <p>  EU Foreign Ministers adopted detailed Conclusions last February, condemning the appalling atrocities committed by Boko Haram and confirming the EU&rsquo;s readiness to provide support to the region with its full range of instruments.  Since then, an EU Political Framework for Crisis Approach for Boko Haram has been developed, and EU support of up to &euro;50 million for a Multinational Joint Taskforce has recently been approved. The Multinational Joint Taskforce, which involves troops from Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Benin, aims to protect innocent people and to prevent the further spread of Boko Haram terrorism. The EU and UN have strongly commended this regional approach.</p>  <p>  The EU has pledged to continue providing immediate humanitarian relief to those affected by Boko Haram activities and to increase its efforts at a regional level, mobilising &euro;21 million in humanitarian funding last June for the four countries concerned. Ireland is also providing direct support of nearly &euro;1.4 million this year to address the humanitarian needs of those affected by Boko Haram terrorism, including Nigerian refugees in Northern Cameroon.</p>  <p>  The situation has also been discussed at the UN. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights convened a meeting on the issue on 30 June and a Special Session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on Boko Haram was held to on 1 April.  At these meetings, Ireland highlighted the terrible human rights and humanitarian impact of the terrorist violence.

Unpredictable weather conditions, due to the current El Ni&ntilde;o weather event, are already causing severe droughts and flooding in Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan, Djibouti and Eritrea. The severe weather is particularly affecting agricultural production, and is having a detrimental effect on people&rsquo;s lives and livelihoods.</p><p>UN Agencies and the UN Central Emergency Response Fund are playing a key role in providing humanitarian assistance. The EU has provided funding to respond to the crisis through the European Development Fund and the EU humanitarian budget. Further EU support is likely to be provided through the recently established EU Trust Fund for Africa, to which Ireland is providing &euro;3 million over the coming years.</p><p>Ireland has also scaled up our humanitarian responses to reduce the impact on households and save lives in the worst-affected places.  Ethiopia, one of Ireland&rsquo;s seven key partner countries in sub-Saharan Africa, has been particularly affected by the current drought.  We have increased our bilateral programme in Ethiopia to nearly &euro;28 million this year to address poverty, vulnerability and the impact of the crisis.  An additional &euro;1.8 million in humanitarian assistance was provided through NGO partners in Ethiopia. Since 2012, Ireland has provided a total of &euro;60 million for humanitarian and emergency assistance programmes in the Horn of Africa. </p><p>The human rights situation in the Horn of Africa remains deeply worrying. The UN Human Rights Council has been active on several countries in the region, including Somalia, South Sudan and Eritrea. The EU promotes human rights in the region through its support to human rights NGOs, its work on women&rsquo;s rights and support for a free and independent media. The recently adopted EU Horn of Africa Regional Action Plan highlights human rights, rule of law and democratic governance as priority issues for EU engagement. The EU has also appointed a Special Representative to the Horn of Africa to co-ordinate EU efforts in the region. </p><p>The Government also monitors the human rights situation in the Horn of Africa and we highlight our concerns bilaterally, through the EU, and in the UN Human Rights Council.</p><p>There are disturbing reports of the use of child soldiers in several countries in the Horn of Africa, particularly Somalia, Sudan and South Sudan. The UN is very active in this area, particularly through the work of the UN Secretary-General&rsquo;s Special Adviser on Children and Armed Conflict, Leila Zerrougui. The most recent UN Report on Children and Armed conflict listed 12 armed groups in the Horn of Africa that recruit and use children in armed conflict. </p><p>UN Special Representative Zerrougui and UNICEF launched the <i>Children, Not Soldiers</i>campaign last year to end and prevent the recruitment and use of children as soldiers. Several countries in the Horn of Africa - including security forces and armed groups in Somalia, Sudan, and South Sudan - have made commitments under this campaign. </p><p>Ireland has engaged on this important issue through addressing the root causes of poverty and under-development and by supporting more targeted and specific interventions through UNICEF and the International Criminal Court. We have also intervened on the issue at the UN Human Rights Council.</p></reply>

The Spring 2015 Eurobarometer survey provides some insights into the views of EU citizens, recording that the image of the EU across the Union improved for the fourth consecutive time since autumn 2013.  The same study showed that the proportion of Europeans who see the EU in a positive light has increased by six percentage points in the year since spring 2014 and by eleven points in two years (since spring 2013), and is the largest recorded since the Standard Eurobarometer survey of spring 2010.  During the same periods, the percentage of Europeans with a negative image of the EU has decreased by six and ten points respectively.</p>  <p>  It would be important that the Union&rsquo;s response to more recent events and challenges facing the Union would continue to enhance public confidence.  In this regard, dealing effectively with the current migration crisis as well as the continuing economic challenges is essential.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, the Government&rsquo;s focus is on building understanding and knowledge about our membership of the EU.  This includes targeted spending on EU engagement, including support for the activities of local community groups and non-governmental organisations through the Communicating Europe Initiative.  The Government also works closely with the European Commission Representation and the European Parliament Information Office in Dublin to improve communications on EU issues in Ireland and promote greater understanding of the EU.  </p>  <p>  A similar approach to communication has been adopted, with varying degrees of success, in other Member States of the EU, and the Institutions of the EU have invested heavily in making their work more accessible and more transparent to European citizens. </p>  <p>  We must also work to ensure that the EU does its own work better.  The Government has worked closely with the EU Institutions and with our fellow Member States to put the citizen at the heart of the EU&rsquo;s work and to deliver concrete, tangible results of benefit to sustainable investment, growth and job creation. </p>  <p>  The Juncker Commission has strengthened engagement with the public and made good on his commitment to develop a Commission which &lsquo;&rsquo;does things differently and does different things&rsquo;&rsquo; and which is &lsquo;&rsquo;more ambitious on big things and more modest on little things&rsquo;&rsquo;.  The 2016 Commission Work Plan continues to push big initiatives of importance to the Irish and the European citizen alike: the Digital Single Market, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, the 2030 Climate and Energy Package, to name but a few.  </p>  <p>  The Government will continue its efforts to communicate Europe, and will, of course, work alongside the Governments of fellow EU Member States and the EU institutions to keep European citizens at the heart of the EU agenda.  We are strongly supportive of EU-wide efforts to promote sustainable investment, growth and job creation, and we will work to keep the concrete delivery of results at the top of the EU agenda.</p></reply>

Along with my counterparts in the EU and the wider international community, I welcome the broadly peaceful and well-organised manner in which the elections were carried out, while stressing that the legal framework of the electoral process must be improved to ensure that it is fully inclusive and representative.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, it is recognised by the international community that the country is still at an early stage of its democratic transition and that it faces a wide range of challenges in the coming years as it seeks to strengthen its democratic structures. Reflecting this, the UN General Assembly Third Committee unanimously adopted a resolution on the promotion and protection of human rights on 18 November 2015, which among other issues, encourages the international community to continue to support the Government of Myanmar in the implementation of its democratic transitional process.</p>  <p>  The EU continues to monitor and support Myanmar&rsquo;s democratic transition closely, both on the ground, and at political and working group level in Brussels.  The Comprehensive Framework for the EU&rsquo;s policy and support to Myanmar, adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council in July 2013, sets out the context for this support. Noting that human rights and fundamental freedoms are essential elements of democracy, the framework outlines the areas in which the EU has committed to providing support, assistance, and advice, including support to strengthen the electoral system in Myanmar, engagement in constitutional review, ratification and implementation of core human rights conventions, strengthening democratic institutions and rule of law, and interaction with civil society. </p>  <p>  Along with the wider international community, Ireland is committed to supporting Myanmar in its transition towards democracy. Ireland actively participated in the EU&rsquo;s recent Electoral Observation Mission, which included three observers supported by Irish Aid and a representative from the Embassy of Ireland in Hanoi. Since 2013 Ireland has established a modest development programme in Myanmar of &euro;500,000 per annum, overseen by Embassy Hanoi. Support is provided through trusted development partners for both long term development work and emergency/recovery responses.  This is particularly important in the light of the recent elections and the need for continued support and engagement in Myanmar&rsquo;s transition to democracy. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, as part of Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to enhance governance, human rights and gender equality in Myanmar, some &euro;3 million has been provided to partner organisations since 2012;  including &euro;2.8 million support to Tr&oacute;caire for their work supporting communities to defend and protect their rights to land and efforts to increase women&rsquo;s participation in decision making at a local level. In addition, almost &euro;2 million in humanitarian funding has been provided to Irish Aid NGO partners in Myanmar since 2012 to meet needs arising from conflict, food insecurity and natural disasters.</p>  <p>  Upon their appointment, I strongly encourage the new leaders of the country to seize the positive momentum of the elections to make further progress in the democratisation process in Myanmar.</p></reply>

Almost 60 million people are now displaced globally, half of them children, many on the continent of Africa.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s aid programme, Irish Aid, is strongly focused on the fight against poverty and hunger in sub-Saharan Africa and Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian response focuses on the most severe crises, especially protracted and forgotten emergencies. The core objective of our assistance is to save and protect lives, alleviate suffering and maintain human dignity, before, during and in the aftermath of such crises. Ireland's humanitarian response is principled and focused on where needs are greatest.</p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to working with a range of partners including non-governmental and UN organisations, and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. These partners have the experience and capacity to deliver assistance to the most vulnerable communities in times of crisis and stress. </p>  <p>  In total, Ireland has provided over &euro;80 million in humanitarian assistance in 2015 and this budget will increase to over &euro;100 million for 2016.  We are allocating additional resources across affected countries to support programmes which save lives, improve food security and protect livelihoods.  </p>  <p>  In addition to responding to acute humanitarian needs in South Sudan since the outbreak of conflict two years ago, Ireland continues to provide humanitarian assistance in a number of major crises across Africa in Sudan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and across the Sahel and the Horn of Africa, including Somalia and Ethiopia.</p>  <p>  Many parts of Africa are currently being affected by the El Ni&ntilde;o weather event which is one of the strongest ever measured. More unpredictable weather conditions are already having a detrimental effect on people&rsquo;s lives and livelihoods across the continent.

Irish Embassies and Consulates-General provide a global platform for the promotion of Ireland as a business, investment, tourism and education destination.</p><p>While the majority of Irish services and merchandise exports go to Europe and the US and we must of course continue to cultivate these markets, the Government is strongly focused on the further development of trading partnerships with other important emerging markets. </p><p>The Embassy network plays a crucial role in proactively addressing market access issues, supporting Irish businesses seeking to grow overseas, holding promotional events for, and in association with, State agencies and actively contributing to the organisation and conduct of Enterprise Ireland-led trade missions and events overseas.</p><p>Our Embassy network plays an important role in the implementation of the Government Trade Tourism and Investment Strategy. In the Review of the Strategy published in February 2014, seven additional high potential and exploratory markets were identified as part of a &lsquo;new market approach&rsquo; aimed at increasing our engagement with high growth markets in Asia, Latin America and Africa.

The Rapid Response Corps roster currently comprises 120 individuals with specialised skills in child protection, nutrition, logistics, engineering, humanitarian coordination, and other areas.</p>  <p>  Rapid Response Corps members are deployed overseas to work as surge capacity in United Nations&rsquo; humanitarian response operations including those of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the World Food Programme, the United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.  </p>  <p>  As the Rapid Response Corps was established as part of Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development and humanitarian assistance programme, all Corps members deploy overseas to areas of greatest need in developing countries.  In light of the vast humanitarian needs globally at the current time, and the focus of the Government&rsquo;s overseas development assistance programme, consideration was not given to deploying members to flood affected communities and households in the Shannon basin to assist with relief efforts.  </p>  <p>  Most Corps members deploy overseas to severe, protracted crises in Africa and crises in the Middle East driven by conflict and violence, where millions of people have been displaced and the scale of humanitarian need is immense and unprecedented.  Corps members also deploy overseas in the immediate aftermath of severe sudden onset disasters such as the earthquakes in Haiti and Nepal and Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines.  32 roster members were deployed to date in 2015 to countries including South Sudan, Sudan, Ethiopia, the Central African Republic, Nigeria, Tanzania, Jordan, and Nepal.</p></reply>

The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is the lead Department on WTO matters.  My colleague, Mr. Damien English T.D., Minister of State for Skills, Research and Innovation is representing Ireland at the Ministerial Conference.  At the WTO, the European Commission leads negotiations on behalf of the European Union, including all 28 Member States.  Ireland is actively participating in the formulation of EU positions at the negotiations.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s development co-operation programme, which is at the heart of our foreign policy, recognises that international trade can play a major role in the promotion of economic development and the alleviation of poverty, including the fight against hunger and undernutrition.  My Department liaises closely with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to ensure that the needs of Least Developed Countries (LDCs) are taken into account in the articulation of Ireland&rsquo;s position on the WTO at EU level.  Ireland supports agreement on a development package at the Ministerial Conference, especially on following up the decisions taken at the ninth Ministerial Conference on duty-free, quota-free access; on an LDC Services Waiver; on Rules of Origin; and on Cotton and Food Security.</p><p>I understand that Minister of State English, while attending the EU Foreign Affairs Council (Trade) in Nairobi, has urged the EU Commission to strive for a balanced negotiated outcome from this week&rsquo;s Ministerial Conference which would deliver a tangible dividend for LDCs. I also understand that with the assistance of our Embassy in Nairobi, he is having discussions with a number of local non-governmental development organisations. </p><p>Ireland has also provided &euro;50,000 this year to support LDC participation at the Ministerial Conference so that the Least Developed Countries can be present and make their voices heard directly during the negotiations.</p></reply>

Meetings such as those between the Taoiseach, President Obama and other senior political figures around St Patrick&rsquo;s Day have provided an important opportunity to reiterate our concerns in relation to the undocumented Irish and to encourage progress on a comprehensive legislative package by Congress.</p>  <p>  In July, the Taoiseach and I met with John Boehner, the then-Speaker of the House of Representatives, and a number of his Congressional colleagues when they visited Dublin. More recently, in Washington at the end of September, I met key Democratic and Republican contacts on Capitol Hill, including Senator Patrick Leahy, Congressmen Joseph Kennedy III, Paul Ryan, James Sensenbrenner, Richard Neal and other members of the Congressional Friends of Ireland group. In all of these meetings I stressed the importance we attach to immigration reform, as I did when meeting leaders of the Irish American community later that week in New York.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the Government is aware of and has raised the matter of waivers of three and ten-year travel bans imposed by the US authorities on Irish undocumented who have overstayed their visa in the United States.</p>  <p>  At my request, the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade wrote to the US Ambassador earlier this year to ask him to explore the question of such waivers further. I have also had the opportunity to directly discuss the matter with the US Ambassador. The Taoiseach also raised waivers, amongst other immigration reform issues, during his visit to Washington for St Patrick&rsquo;s Day. </p>  <p>  In response to the Government&rsquo;s representations the US Embassy has pointed out that the US waiver system operates uniformly worldwide and is applied in strict accordance with US laws and regulations.  Individuals who have received a three or 10 year ban for overstaying a visa in the US can apply for a waiver and these applications are assessed individually on a case-by-case basis, with the final decision on each a matter for the US authorities in Washington. The US Embassy also noted it was not possible for applicants to predict with any degree of certainty whether they would be successful in this process.  The Embassy has also advised that there are no differences in the way in which the US waiver system is applied to Mexican and Irish citizens.</p>  <p>  The Government has been assiduous in seeking to advance all viable opportunities to achieve relief for our undocumented citizens in the United States. While I am disappointed that representations to the US on this matter have not resulted in a more encouraging outcome, ultimately it is a matter for the US Government and US Embassy to interpret and implement their immigration laws.</p>  <p>  The Government as a whole, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin and our Embassy in Washington, will continue to actively follow up on all opportunities to improve the situation of the Irish undocumented with the US Administration, with Congress, and with the US Embassy in Ireland.

We attach great importance to combatting all forms of discrimination based on religion or belief and incitement to religious hatred.  We firmly believe in tolerance, non-discrimination, freedom of expression, freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief.  Ireland is deeply concerned by the persecution of Christians.</p><p>On 20 July 2015, the EU Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) adopted the EU Action Plan for Human Rights and Democracy 2015-2019. The Action Plan forms part of the EU Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy which was adopted by the FAC in June 2012.  Its purpose is to improve the effectiveness and consistency of the EU&rsquo;s policy and commits the EU to promoting human rights in all areas of its external action. Responsibility for the implementation of the Action Plan is shared between the EEAS, European Commission and EU Member States. </p><p>Within the EU, Ireland pressed for the promotion of freedom of religion or belief to be included in the Action Plan, and this is now reflected as a stand-alone point with the following actions:</p><p>a. Ensure that freedom of religion or belief remains high on the agenda of relations with third countries, as well as in multilateral fora, in close cooperation with relevant stakeholders; promote the exchange of best practices, and deepen awareness on the various components of freedom of religion or belief at Headquarters, EU delegations and Member State embassies.</p><p>b. Encourage and support relevant partner countries and other stakeholders&rsquo; initiatives on freedom of religion or belief in particular those aimed at protecting and promoting the rights of persons belonging to religious minorities, enabling them to manifest their religion or belief without fear of violence, discrimination, political pressure, censorship or persecution.</p><p>c. Promote inter-cultural and inter-religious dialogue and the role of religious and other leaders in ensuring freedom of religion or belief.</p><p>The Action Plan will strengthen the EU&rsquo;s co-ordinated response to persecution based on religion or belief throughout the world. </p><p>Ireland works within and alongside the EU to address the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities, notably with the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief adopted during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013. These Guidelines provide EU officials with an overview of the legal and policy framework within which the right to freedom of religion or belief is protected. They also elaborate an EU strategy on how to engage with third countries on the right to freedom of religion or belief, a strategy which we hope to see bear fruit as we assess the implementation of the Guidelines.</p><p>Ireland and the EU consistently press for effective action to counter the persecution of minorities in all relevant international fora, including at the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Human Rights Council, of which Ireland is a member until the end of this month. Ireland reiterated its commitment to defending the right to freedom of religion or belief during a UN Security Council debate on the victims of attacks and abuses on ethnic or religious grounds in the Middle East, on 27 March 2015.  I personally highlighted the alarming rise in attacks on Christians when I addressed the UN General Assembly in New York on 1 October 2015 and the UN Human Rights Council at its 28th session on 4 March 2015.  I also raised it during my meetings with the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, in September 2014 and May 2015.  </p><p>The issue of freedom of religion was raised by the EU at the most recent EU-China Human Rights Dialogue in Beijing on 30 November 2015.</p><p>On 22 October at the Third Committee at the United Nations General Assembly Ireland presented a statement specifically addressing the importance of freedom of religion or belief at an Interactive Dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, Professor Heiner Bielefeldt. The statement can be found on the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade at the following address: </p><p>Ireland was also active in the negotiation of the EU led draft resolution on Freedom of Religion or Belief in the Third Committee.</p><p>Ireland will continue to raise the issue of the persecution of Christians through its official bilateral contacts with the countries in question, stressing the responsibility of the government to protect all citizens and minorities, irrespective of their religion or belief. I am glad to note that my Department maintains close contact with non-governmental organisations which have a particular interest in issues relating to persecution of religious minorities.</p><p>Our concerns about the treatment of some Christians in Iran were conveyed to the Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister during consultations at senior diplomatic level in Dublin in January, and I also raised the issue myself with the Speaker of the Majlis during his visit in June.</p><p>In relation to Nigeria, Ireland, along with our EU and UN partners has consistently condemned the brutal activities of Boko Haram which represent a serious threat to the peace and security of Nigeria, and the wider region, including Cameroon, Chad and Niger. They also involve the clear and persistent abuse of human rights, especially of women and girls, and a direct threat to education and education facilities. Ireland is providing direct support of nearly &euro;1.4 million this year to address the humanitarian needs of those affected by Boko Haram terrorism, including Nigerian refugees in Northern Cameroon. Along with our EU and UN partners, Ireland has commended the operationalisation of a Multinational Joint Taskforce involving troops from Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Benin.  This Taskforce aims to protect innocent people and to prevent the further spread of Boko Haram terrorism.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to actively support freedom of religion or belief across our foreign policy.</p></reply>

This was the 21<sup>st</sup>Plenary meeting of the NSMC.</p><p>At the meeting Ministers discussed the <i>Fresh Start</i>Agreement and the work to be undertaken by officials to review North South infrastructure projects.  The Council also welcomed the commitment in <i>Fresh Start </i>to tackle paramilitarism, criminality and organised crime and to bring to justice those involved in it.</p><p>Discussions covered a wide range of financial, economic and EU matters including the economic challenges faced in both jurisdictions and the work being taken forward to promote economic growth and employment.  The importance of tourism, trade, investment and of supporting companies in accessing overseas markets was recognised. Ministers also discussed the Progress Report prepared by the NSMC Joint Secretaries on the work of the North South Bodies and in the other NSMC areas for co-operation since the preceding Plenary meeting on 5 June 2015 in Dublin Castle. </p><p>The Council welcomed that the EU INTERREG VA funding programme has now opened for funding calls and noted that the PEACE IV Programme was recently adopted by the European Commission.  It was noted that discussions are continuing to take place at NSMC Sectoral meetings on collaboration to drawdown EU funding and the Council was encouraged by the work that has been undertaken to identify funding opportunities across various EU Funding Programmes. In particular, Ministers welcomed the focus on Horizon 2020, EU LIFE, Connecting Europe Facility, ERAMUS+ and Creative Europe. These discussions will continue throughout the next round of NSMC meetings. </p><p>The Council noted that under the EU&rsquo;s Horizon 2020 programme, &euro;29.67m has been secured in the first year for 22 joint projects involving both jurisdictions and also noted the work of InterTradeIreland and the All-Island Steering Group in raising awareness of this &euro;80bn EU programme. </p><p>The Council welcomed the commitment of the Government to provide &euro;2.5 million in funding to a North West Development Fund to support the North West Gateway Initiative which will be complemented by matching funding from the Northern Ireland Executive.  The Council noted the continued engagement between officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister with relevant stakeholders in the region regarding the direction and priorities for the future development of the North West. </p><p>The Council further noted the work by Donegal County Council and Derry City and Strabane District Council to produce a collaborative framework aimed at placing cross-border co-operation on a more formal basis within local government structures. </p><p>The Government and the Northern Ireland Executive have reiterated their commitment to a meeting of Ministers from both jurisdictions to take place in the North West region to consider the strategic approach to the development of the region.  </p><p>The Council noted the position on the development of new priorities for North/South cooperation and the ongoing review of Work Programmes at Sectoral meetings.  The current position on setting up a North South Consultative Forum as envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement was also noted. </p><p>The Council approved the appointment of Chairpersons, Vice Chairpersons and members to the Boards of the North South Implementation Bodies and Directors of Tourism Ireland Limited.  Ministers expressed their appreciation for the work of outgoing Board members.</p><p>The Council also approved a schedule of NSMC meetings proposed by the Joint Secretariat, including the next NSMC Plenary meeting in June 2016. </p><p>The Government is firmly committed to developing North South cooperation in every possible respect and I am looking forward to continuing to work on this agenda with Northern Ireland Executive colleagues in the North South Ministerial Council. </p></reply>

As I have stated before, I wish to see this relationship develop further.</p>  <p>  Cuba and Ireland held bilateral consultations in April of this year during the visit of the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to Havana. In his official-level meetings, the Secretary General discussed issues relating to Cuba&rsquo;s reform process and human rights, Cuba&rsquo;s relations with the United States, bilateral trade and cultural ties between Cuba and Ireland. The consultations took place in a positive atmosphere and provide a good basis for further progress in strengthening our relationship with Cuba.</p>  <p>  The Secretary General&rsquo;s visit also included the signing of a memorandum of understanding on political dialogue between Ireland and Cuba. The memorandum provides a joint structure for consulting on international issues &ndash; a sign that both countries are planning for a growing, strengthening bilateral relationship. I also look forward to the conclusion of a bilateral cooperation agreement, negotiations for which are now at an advanced stage. </p>  <p>  Bilateral trade in goods between Ireland and Cuba has increased steadily from a low base in recent years and between January and July of 2015 was &euro;2.93 million, compared to &euro;1.35 million for the whole of 2014. We hope that, as the process of economic reform proceeds, and as Cuba&rsquo;s relations with the United States are normalized, it will be possible to develop our trade relationship further.</p>  <p>  In the context of the European Union, I am pleased that negotiations are continuing on an EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Co-operation Agreement (PDCA). This agreement will strengthen the EU-Cuba relationship and provide an improved framework for political dialogue, economic relations and cooperation. Six rounds of negotiations have so far taken place between Brussels and Havana. A seventh round of talks will take place in Havana early in 2016.</p>  <p>  The EU is also Cuba's second most important trading partner, accounting for 20 per cent of all Cuban trade. The Union is also Cuba's biggest external investor and approximately one third of all tourists visiting the island every year come from EU member states. </p></reply>

Not all of the allowances listed are available to every teacher as entitlement is based on the qualifications held by the individual and/or the nature of the post for which they were employed. </p><p>Since the beginning of the financial crisis, there has been a need to enact a number of measures to reduce public expenditure.  The previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable of all new entrants to public service recruitment grades (including teachers) by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011 and required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale. </p><p>Subsequently, following the public service-wide review of allowances and premium payments, the Government decided to withdraw or modify allowances for new beneficiary public servants with effect from 1 February 2012.  Under this decision, certain allowances were withdrawn for new beneficiary teachers, including qualification allowances.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.</p><p>These measures were implemented at time of very difficult financial and budgetary circumstances for the State.</p><p>Alleviation of the salary imbalance between those who entered the public service since 2011 and those who entered before that date began under the Haddington Road Agreement. Improved pay scales for post-1 January 2011 and post-1 February 2012 entrants to teaching were agreed and implemented under the terms of that Agreement. In addition, allowances payable to post-1 January 2011 entrants and such allowances as remain payable to post-1 February 2012 entrants were restored to pre-2011 levels.</p><p>The process of reducing the public service pay reductions made in recent years in respect of teachers and other cadres of public servants is outlined in the relevant provisions of the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  The Agreement will, through salary increases and a reduction in the Pension-Related Deduction, begin the process of restoring the reductions to public service pay.  The issue of equalised pay scales was not one which could be resolved in the discussions which lead to the Agreement.  However, the flat-rate increases contained in the Agreement and implemented as part of FEMPI 2015, will be proportionately more favourable to new entrants to teaching (who are lower on the pay scale) than to longer serving teachers.</p><p>We look forward to seeing the further restoration of public service pay levels as our economy continues to recover strongly. </p><p><b>TEACHERS' COMMON BASIC SCALE</b><table><tr><th>Scale Point</th><th>Pre - 1 January 2011 New entrants</th><th>Pre-1 January 2011 New entrants - with effect from 1/1/16(Note a)</th><th>Post-1/1/11 New entrants to teaching - Applied 1/1/11 to 30/6/13 (Note b)</th><th>Post-1/1/11 New entrants to teaching - 1/7/13 to 31/10/13 (Note c)</th><th>Post 1/1/11 New entrants to teaching - 1/11/13 to 31/12/15 (Note d)</th><th>Post-1/1/11 New entrants to teaching between 1/1/2011 and 31/1/2012 - with effect from 1/1/16(Note e)</th><th>Post 1/2/12 New entrants to teaching - 1/2/12 to 30/6/13  (Note f)</th><th>Post 1/2/12 New entrants to teaching - 1/7/13 to 31/12/15(Note g)</th><th>Post 1/2/12 New entrants and future entrants - with effect from 1/1/16<br /><br />(Note h)</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>&euro;

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally. The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board. Details of the appeals criteria are set out in the published staffing arrangements.</p>  <p>  The Statistics Section of my Department's website contains extensive data relating to schools, including data on an individual school basis. The most recent published information relates to the 2014/15 school year.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I have made provision in Budget 2016 for some 2,260 additional teaching posts for our primary and post primary schools next year. These posts will provide for an improvement in the staffing schedules at primary and post primary levels, enhance the leadership and management roles of deputy principals at post-primary level by reducing their teaching time, an improvement to the scheme of release time for principal teachers at primary level and additional resource posts to meet special education needs.</p>  <p>  At primary level there will be a one point improvement to the primary staffing schedule to be implemented for the 2016/17 school year. This will see the primary staffing schedule operate on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 27 pupils. Lower thresholds apply for DEIS Band 1 schools. The improved staffing schedule is currently available on the Department website.</p>  <p>  The staffing and redeployment arrangements for all schools for the 2016/17 school year will be published early in 2016. The final staffing position for 2016/17 for all schools will ultimately not be known until the Autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and any appeals to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.</p></reply>

When considering whether a student meets the conditions to be assessed independently of his or her parents, grant awarding authorities are obliged to satisfy themselves beyond doubt that an acceptable degree of proof of independent living in the relevant period has been submitted by the grant applicant.</p>  <p>  I understand that, SUSI accepts certain documentation from the Department of Social Protection in order to assist an applicant in proving that he/she is living independently at an address. The documentation must, however, directly relate to the applicant's residence at that address e.g. a letter from the Department of Social Protection confirming that the applicant is receiving rent allowance at that address. Other forms of correspondence from the Department of Social Protection that may be provided to SUSI by applicants as part of their student grant application do not necessarily require the same level of validation by the Department of Social Protection with regard to the person's residence at a particular address. However, all documentation received by SUSI as evidence of independent residence is reviewed and decisions are made on a case by case basis having regard to the evidential value of the documentation submitted, other available evidence and the specific circumstances of each case.</p>  <p>  If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a student grant, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to their awarding body. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing, by SUSI, and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to the independent Student Grant Appeals Board.</p></reply>

When considering whether a student meets the conditions to be assessed independently of his or her parents, grant awarding authorities are obliged to satisfy themselves beyond doubt that an acceptable degree of proof of independent living in the relevant period has been submitted by the grant applicant.</p><p>  I understand that, SUSI accepts certain documentation from the Department of Social Protection in order to assist an applicant in proving that he/she is living independently at an address. The documentation must, however, directly relate to the applicant's residence at that address, e.g. a letter from the Department of Social Protection confirming that the applicant is receiving rent allowance at that address. Other forms of correspondence from the Department of Social Protection that may be provided to SUSI by applicants as part of their student grant application do not necessarily require the same level of validation by the Department of Social Protection with regard to the person's residence at a particular address. However, all documentation received by SUSI as evidence of independent residence is reviewed and decisions are made on a case by case basis having regard to the evidential value of the documentation submitted, other available evidence and the specific circumstances of each case.</p><p>  As previously advised, if an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a student grant, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to their awarding body. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by SUSI, and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to the independent Student Grant Appeals Board.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location. The primary staffing schedule currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils, with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools. The Deputy will be aware that I have made provision in Budget 2016 for some 2,260 additional teaching posts for our primary and post primary schools next year. These posts will provide for an improvement in the staffing schedules at primary and post primary levels, enhance the leadership and management roles of deputy principals at post-primary level by reducing their teaching time, an improvement to the scheme of release time for principal teachers at primary level and additional resource posts to meet special education needs.</p><p>  At primary level there will be a one point improvement to the primary staffing schedule to be implemented for the 2016/17 school year. This will see the primary staffing schedule operate on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 27 pupils. Lower thresholds apply for DEIS Band 1 schools. The improved staffing schedule is currently available on the Department website.</p><p>  Each one point adjustment to the current 28:1 schedule at primary level is estimated to cost of the order of 250 posts (estimated &euro;15m full year cost, &euro;5m first year cost).</p></reply>

The reports, however, did not recommend a change to the role of the SNA. </p><p>  There are therefore no plans to amend the SNA role as it is currently provided for in Circular 0030/2014, nor did the Circular fundamentally alter the SNA role from that which existed prior to 2012.</p><p>  As there is currently no SNA teaching support grade, it is not possible to advise as to the potential cost of changing the role of the existing SNA grade to a new grade, as the cost differential arising would be dependent on any salary scale put in place for a new grade.  </p><p>  Circular 30/2014 states that students with special educational needs can have very complex learning needs and should be taught by qualified and experienced teachers who are equipped with the necessary skills to meet the needs of these students. It is the responsibility of the classroom teacher to ensure that each pupil is taught in a stimulating and supportive classroom environment where all pupils feel equal and valued</p><p>  The Circular also notes that many children with significant special educational needs require additional teaching support in schools.  In such circumstances, the classroom teacher will be supported by a resource teacher/learning support teacher, who are fully qualified teachers who will have access to additional training in the area of special education.  </p><p>  To provide for this additional teaching support, my Department currently allocates over 11,500 additional teachers to schools to support children with special educational or learning support needs. These allocations are made to schools, either through General Allocation schemes for primary and post primary schools, or through additional allocations made to schools by the NCSE in respect of Low Incidences disabilities, as set out in my Departments Circular DES 02/05. </p><p>  Such additional teaching support allocations are made to schools in addition to any SNA provision.</p><p>  In order to provide further clarity in relation to the SNA scheme, my Department also asked the NCSE to prepare an Information Booklet for parents which has now been published and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

All special schools receive enhanced pupil teacher ratios ranging from 6-1, to 12-1, depending on the disability categorisation of pupils attending. These enhanced ratios are provided because pupils attending special schools have significant special educational needs. Special schools also receive very high levels of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) staffing support. My Department also provides enhanced levels of capitation in Special schools as well as specialist School Transport arrangements for pupils with disabilities, additional teacher training for teachers of children with special educational needs and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment, where required. </p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for the provision of a range of educational services at local and national level for students with special educational needs.

Each SENO works in an assigned local area with parents, schools, teachers, psychologists, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services in that area for children with special educational needs. Schools and parents may contact their local SENO using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that a process for the review of the DEIS Programme is currently underway in my Department.

In the primary sector, this can be done by either completing Probation or Droichead. Both of these processes are available to teachers employed in special education settings as per the Council's procedures. In these settings, the successful completion of either process means that teachers who then wish to work in mainstream settings must complete an additional period of professional practice before achieving full registration.</p><p>In relation to the question of modules on special education, I understand from the Council that Inclusive Education (including Special Education, Multiculturalism, Disadvantage etc.) is now a mandatory element of all programmes of Initial Teacher Education in the State. This is a requirement that the Council put in place as part of its Criteria and Guidelines for Programme Providers. All providers of ITE must meet these requirements in order for their programmes to be accredited by the Council.  In relation to the appropriateness of the education provided to student teachers in this area, I am advised that all programmes of ITE have been reconceptualised to meet the Council's criteria and each has been reviewed, for professional accreditation purposes, by an independent expert panel. As Inclusion is one of the strategic priorities identified by Council, this area received considerable attention during the review process, and many reports contained commendations or recommendations relating to same. All 59 primary and post-primary programmes of ITE have received accreditation from the Council and the reports are available on its website.</p><p>The extension and reconceptualisation of the programmes of ITE has taken place against a background of a new policy framework since 2011. I refer in particular to my Department's Literacy and Numeracy Strategy of that year, as well as the Council's Policy on the Continuum of Teacher Education. The latter document makes clear that teachers' learning takes place throughout their careers, not just during one particular phase. Given the complexity of the issues relating to Special Education, and the constantly evolving insights into the best approaches arising from ongoing research in the area, it must be noted that the forthcoming framework for teachers' learning from the Council, Cos&aacute;n, is seeking to develop the national policy framework further. It will recognise that the Continuum offers the best reassurance we can rely on as to the appropriateness of the many ways in which teachers are already seeking to learn about the needs of some of the most vulnerable learners in our society.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-12-17a.1669.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121700096#WRQQ01300"><p>There are limited alleviation arrangements in place for schools that are acutely affected by the impact of the moratorium at Assistant Principal level. These arrangements are mainly focused at post-primary level. However, it is fair to say that before the moratorium, notwithstanding the fact that one out of every two teachers held a management allowance the workload issue and the pressures on Principals and Deputy Principals existed. Simply lifting the moratorium as extra funding becomes available in future years is not the best way of improving how school leadership is distributed in our schools. School leaders have a key role to play in determining the shape of our schools and student outcomes. Leading on curricular change and change management are key challenges for every school leader. The challenge for schools and the Department is therefore to build a leadership partnership that is fit for 21st century Ireland and school context.</p><p>Economic constraints and the moratorium on recruitment, albeit alleviated to some extent for schools, have presented challenges within the education sector. They also provide an opportunity to review the role of the principal so that our principals are leaders of learning, and to reconfigure the middle management structure to support principals in their role, ensuring ownership of responsibility rather than tasks, thereby building expertise and supporting a career path within the profession. </p><p>  The Department, in consultation with the representative management bodies has commenced an exploration of the opportunities to support and thereby advance our understanding of the needs of school leaders and how they might be addressed. Earlier this month, I formally launched the newly established Centre for School Leadership (CSL). The Centre's responsibilities will cover the continuum of professional development for school leaders, from pre-appointment training and induction of newly appointed principals, to continuing professional development throughout careers. The Centre is operating on a partnership basis between the Department of Education and Skills, the Irish Primary Principals' Network (IPPN) and the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals (NAPD). The partnership will have many benefits for the profession in terms of the quality of training programmes, coordination of provision, and increased accessibility.</p><p>  As part of the 2,260 additional teaching posts announced in Budget 2016, 250 of these posts are being provided to second level schools to enable Deputy Principals to be freed up from teaching time and be more fully available to assist the school principal with the leadership of the school. Up to now only schools with at least with over 500 students received an allocation to free up the Deputy Principal.  With effect from 01 September 2016 second level schools with over 400 students will receive an allocation that will bring those schools in line with the schools that have over 500 pupils where the Deputy Principal is fully freed up. A pro rata allocation of additional hours to support school leadership will also be provided to the schools with 400 or fewer students enrolled. At primary level Budget 2016 provides for additional release days for teaching principals to range between 15 and 25 days depending on the size of the school and effective from the start of the 2016/17 school year.</p></reply>

The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.</p>  <p>  As the PRTB replaces the Courts for the vast majority of landlord and tenant disputes, there are statutory time periods laid down in the Residential Tenancies Act to provide for due process. There are a number of factors that may delay the processing of a case including where adjournment requests are made or where there are difficulties locating a party to the dispute.</p>  <p>  The PRTB received 3,374 applications for dispute resolution in 2014, a 104% increase since 2008 when 1,650 cases were received. In 2014, some 80% of cases were processed or closed within 5 to 6 months. Only 7% of what were the most difficult cases were taking 9 to 10 months to process. </p>  <p>  The PRTB is continuously reviewing operations to increase efficiency and processing times continue to improve in 2015. The PRTB reports that currently 82% of cases are completed in 4 months or less. Only 2% of the most troublesome cases are taking in excess of 6 months to complete.</p>  <p>  A telephone mediation service was introduced in late 2013 as an alternative means to address disputes. Processing times for telephone mediation cases in 2014 were typically 10 to 12 weeks. Processing times for telephone mediation have improved further in the course of 2015 to 6 to 9 weeks.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the Board continues to discharge its statutory obligations in an independent, fair and efficient manner.</p></reply>

The Board is currently entitled to retain 80% of the registration fee income to fund its activities, with 20% going to fund local authority inspections of rented accommodation under the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008. It also retains the fees charged for its dispute resolution services. Details of the Board&rsquo;s income are set out in its Annual Reports and Accounts, which are available on its website .</p><p>In line with the Government&rsquo;s Employment Control Framework, the PRTB was required to reduce its staffing complement from a peak of 70 which included agency staff, to 50 at end-2011 and to 33 by end-2013.</p><p>The reduction in staffing over that period also needs to be seen in the context of the introduction of online tenancy registration and dispute application services and the outsourcing of certain activities. In 2012, the PRTB awarded a contract, outsourcing its call -centre activities and the processing of paper registrations, allowing the Board to focus on its dispute resolution functions.  There are currently 30 people employed on the PRTB account by the outsourced service provider.</p><p>Given the sustained increase in demand for PRTB services, approval was provided in 2014 for an additional 9 permanent staff and the Board is in the process of recruitment to fill these posts which will bring the number of personnel up to 42.</p><p>More recently, in the context of the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s package of measures in relation to the rental sector announced in November 2015, sanction for a further 5 staff to establish the Deposit Protection Scheme and 3 additional staff to administer the new rent stability arrangements was secured. When recruitment is completed, this will bring the staff complement back up to 50 and ensures that the Board is well-resourced to perform its functions.</p><p>My Department continues to keep the resources available to the PRTB under close review and engages regularly with the Board on this matter. </p></reply>

Accordingly, the Act is ideally calibrated to ensure that domestic policy can be reviewed and, where necessary, amended in a complementary fashion with the five-yearly reviews under the international process, while also taking account of our obligations under the EU processes.</p><p>In addition, the Act provides for annual reviews of, <i>inter alia</i>, mitigation policy by the independent Climate Change Advisory Council, which may also conduct periodic reviews of such policy.</p><p>I am satisfied therefore, that our recently enacted climate change legislation is fully fit-for-purpose to meet both the domestic and international mitigation and adaptation challenges that lie ahead.</p></reply>

Furthermore, Appendix F of each of the Plans sets out more detail in this regard at the individual local authority level.</p><p>The Waste Management Planning Lead Authorities (WMPLAs) are required by the end of 2015 to have ranked the high-risk sites in accordance with the risk screening process set out in the Plans, with a view to prioritising landfills for remediation over the lifetime of the plans.

Each region is then required to develop and agree a road-map before the end of 2016 which prioritises the investigation and remediation of the priority ranked landfills over the period 2015 to 2021.

As well as creating a more rational and comprehensive structural arrangement, the new system enables more effective and community-focused decision making. There is also a more appropriate assignment of reserved functions, full integration of local authority resources across each county and elimination of duplication both in administrative and electoral terms. </p>  <p>  Regarding savings, it is important to recognise that 2015 is the first full year of the operation of the new structures. I initiated an operational review earlier this year in relation to the new arrangements to assess how they are impacting in relation to both non-financial and financial matters. In this regard, it is important to view the benefits not only in terms of expenditure reductions but also having regard to the broader objectives of local government reform such as strengthening the sector and seeking greater efficiency and more productive use of resources previously taken up with multiple corporate processes.   </p>  <p>  The operational review involves an Advisory Group, on which both elected members and local authority chief executives are represented, together with a Local Government Forum for engagement with the Association of Irish Local Government. To date, these groups have met on six occasions in total and the feedback thus far from these deliberations suggests that the revised structures are generally operating well but will need more time to bed down fully. Importantly, there has also been an acknowledgement that there would be no return to the structures in place prior to June 2014, a view which corresponds with my stated position that the re-introduction of the pre-reform configuration of town councils would not be the correct approach.  Accordingly, costings of any restoration of such structures are not being undertaken. </p></reply>

The report concluded that the best way of ensuring increasing efficiency and effectiveness of operations and capital investment and accessing new finances for the water sector, was to establish Irish Water as a public utility. Accordingly, no consideration is being given to the abolition of Irish Water, or the costs thereof. </p></reply>

There are a number of funding, investment and legal issues which would have to be addressed.</p>  <p>  Firstly, Article 9 of the Water Framework Directive requires member states to take account of the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle. As part of the first round of River Basin Management Plans, the Government of the day indicated to the European Commission that this would be addressed through the introduction of water charges.   </p>  <p>  Secondly, the costings below, which outline the annual financial impact of abolition of water charges, do not take account of possible longer term effects outside of the period to 2016. The stream of income from domestic customers is a key tool in driving additional investment into the sector and underpins a utility model based on quality customer service and the regulated model delivering greater efficiencies. New revenue from domestic charges underpins the access to commercial borrowing for the sector. </p>  <p>  Thirdly, charging for water based on usage leads to a reduction in overall demand for water over time with consequential impacts on required capital investment for capacity increases and operational costs;. </p>  <p>  If domestic water charges were abolished, Irish Water and the Group Water sector would require additional funding to substitute for the loss of revenue from domestic customers. The estimated additional revenue requirement in 2016 would be &euro;210.5m, allowing for some reduced customer operation costs and working capital loans in the case of Irish Water, but not factoring in the costs, if any, of dismantling any relevant contracts. </p></reply>

In doing so, it also provides a solid statutory foundation to the institutional arrangements necessary to enable the State to pursue and achieve that national transition objective.</p><p>Among the key provisions of the Act are the preparation and adoption of:</p><p>- successive five-yearly National Mitigation Plans which will specify the policy measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland and meet our current and future emission reduction targets; and</p><p>- successive five-yearly National Adaptation Frameworks which will set out the national strategy for the coordinated application of adaptation measures in different sectors and by local authorities in order to adapt to the inevitable effects of climate change in Ireland.</p><p>The Act also provides for the establishment of a Climate Change Advisory Council to provide advice and recommendations to Ministers and the Government on climate matters. The Advisory Council has already been established on a non-statutory basis under the chairmanship of Professor John Fitzgerald, pending enactment of the legislation, and is already undertaking some preliminary assessments.</p><p>The preparation of the National Mitigation Plan is statutorily designed to be a whole-of-Government approach to tackling greenhouse gas emissions. In particular, each Minister with responsibility for the largest emitting sectors (namely, agriculture, transport, energy and the built environment) will be required by Government to develop sectoral mitigation measures for inclusion in the Plan.</p><p>Pursuant to the provisions of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 the first National Mitigation Plan must now be produced within 18 months of the enactment date, and I expect that the first National Mitigation Plan will be produced well in advance of this deadline, for completion by the end of 2016.</p></reply>

The council is the final decision making authority, and it is the task of the SPCs, as committees of the council, to advise and assist the council in its work.   </p>  <p>  Under section 54(2) of the 2001 Act, my Department issued guidelines on SPCs in May 2014.  The objective of these guidelines was to create a common general framework for the establishment and operation of SPCs and to assist and support local authorities in this task. However, subject to this general framework, the guidelines allow a measure of discretion to local authorities in establishing an SPC structure which takes account of local circumstances and which best meets local needs. </p>  <p>  SPCs are encouraged in the guidelines to adopt a multi-annual work programme linked to the local authority&rsquo;s corporate plan and to update this regularly as necessary.

Funding is being provided to support the development of social enterprises that have the capacity to deliver local, sustainable jobs and which contribute to community gain in disadvantaged areas/for economically and socially disadvantages persons. </p><p>The aim of the Youth Employment Measure is to target the most disadvantaged young people who tend not to avail of mainstream supports and are most distant from the labour market or the education system. The opportunity under this measure is to focus on vulnerable youth by providing more intensive engagement and supports to those &ldquo;most marginalised and disadvantaged&rdquo; or within &ldquo;NEET&rdquo; youth (i.e. a young person who is &ldquo;Not in Education, Employment or Training&rdquo;).

Some 157 applications were received by Pobal. Following competitive assessment, 55 applications were approved for funding for the two-year period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016. The award process included considerations such as the social and economic benefits, consistency with current policies and long term vision. </p>  <p>  IMSA applied successfully for funding under the scheme, and were allocated &euro;175,950 over the 24 month period of the scheme. The aim of the funding is to assist IMSA to increase the network of Men&rsquo;s Sheds in Ireland to over 400, with over 20,000 disadvantaged men participating. The funding is contributing to the employment of the CEO and a Resource Worker, and associated overheads. I understand that IMSA also receive funding through subscriptions, donations, sponsors and other fundraising.     </p>  <p>  Funding under the SSNO is specifically for national organisations such as IMSA for core funding. My Department does not provide funding under the SSNO for local or regional branches of national organisations. I understand that the principal activity of the organisation is the supporting of men&rsquo;s learning and well-being. There are no schemes within my Department that specifically provide funding appropriate to these activities at a local level.   </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the new Scheme to Support National Organisations will be advertised in early 2016 and groups funded under the 2014-2016 Scheme and other interested organisations can apply again for funding under the new SSNO Scheme. Organisations who meet the minimum overall quality score threshold will be considered eligible for funding, subject to available resources.</p></reply>

In April 2015, I issued social housing targets and provisional funding allocations to all local authorities to be invested in a combination of building, buying and leasing schemes designed to accommodate 25% of those currently on the housing waiting lists.  The following are the targets in respect of Westmeath, which are supported by a funding allocation of &euro;30.7 million:  <table><tr><th>Funding stream</th><th>Local Authority Housing/<br /><br />AHB delivery via CAS/<br /><br />Return of vacant properties</th><th>Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP)</th><th>Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP)</th><th>Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS)</th><th>Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS)</th></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>2015-17</td><td>2015</td><td>2016/7</td><td>2015</td><td>2016/7</td></tr><tr><td>Target</td><td>148</td><td>72</td><td>226</td><td>52</td><td>44</td></tr></table></p><p>As the housing authority for their areas, local authorities are responsible for the detailed planning of social housing provision based on local need. This includes working with approved housing bodies to assist in meeting the needs of those on the social housing waiting list in their administrative areas.  However, I said when I allocated the targets and funding that all local authorities will be expected to kick-start a building programme.  In that regard, I have announced new social housing construction and acquisition projects to the value of approximately &euro;500 million so far this year, including 43 new units for County Westmeath at a cost estimate of almost &euro;7 million.  Details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links: and .</p><p>Given the timelag between approval and delivery in terms of construction projects, a successful programme to remediate vacant units, as well as the acquisition by local authorities of properties through turn-key developments and other purchases, are important parts of social housing delivery this year. In this regard, Westmeath County Council has programmed 20 to 30 new acquisitions this year, while I am providing funding support to the Council to return over 80 vacant social housing units to productive use.  The projects and programmes to deliver new social housing are being advanced strongly by local authorities. </p><p>Under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) units can be delivered in a variety of ways and local authorities are encouraged to explore and use all of these mechanisms, which include units purchased, leased or constructed by approved housing bodies and both multi-unit developments and individual units leased or acquired through rental arrangements directly by local authorities.  Units leased by local authorities or approved housing bodies can be for up to 20 years.  The accommodation provided is made available to persons on local authority waiting lists, persons with long term housing needs in receipt of rent supplement or persons who are homeless. </p><p>The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) is a social housing support introduced to cater for the accommodation needs of persons who are in receipt of long term rent supplement. Persons normally must be in receipt of continuous rent supplement for a minimum period of 18 months, and be assessed as having a long term housing need. </p><p>The targets for Westmeath County Council for the period 2015-2017 are set out in the table above. Together, the RAS and SHCEP Schemes have met the social housing needs of an additional 153 households in Westmeath County Council in 2015, which is well in excess of the original targets set for the local authority.</p><p>I am confident that by utilising all delivery mechanisms under these programmes, local authorities will continue to deliver on their social housing targets in line with the Social Housing Strategy.</p></reply>

This funding, coupled with the Government&rsquo;s drive to increase coordination at a local level and the commitment to the delivery of the recommendations in the report of the Commission on the Economic Development of Rural Areas (CEDRA), will ensure that the impact of the available funding will be maximised to support the sustainable development of our rural communities.</p></reply>

However, the owner is entitled to a refund if the property is vacant for specified purposes i.e. if the premises are unoccupied for the purpose of additions, alterations or repairs; where the owner is bona fide unable to obtain a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent; and where the premises are vacant pending redevelopment.  The collection of rates and the determination of eligibility for a refund in this context are matters for each individual local authority.</p>  <p>  The Local Government Act 1946 provided that the owner was entitled to a 100% refund in most local authority areas. Separate legislation governs refunds in the cities of Dublin, Limerick and Cork, where the same criteria for refunds apply but only 50% of the rates paid was refundable.</p>  <p>  With effect from 1 June 2014, when the relevant provision commenced, the Local Government Reform Act 2014 gives discretion to the elected members of individual local authorities to vary the level of rates refunds that apply in individual local electoral areas within the authority&rsquo;s administrative area.  This discretion allows elected members to respond to the differing characteristics of local commercial property markets.  The Local Government (Financial and Audit Procedures) Regulations 2014 provide that the decision to alter the rate of refund should be taken at the annual budget meeting and that the rate of refund decided in respect of the relevant local electoral area shall apply to eligible persons for the year to which the budget relates.  The absence of a decision to vary the refund means that the existing legislative provisions regarding the rate of refunds apply (either 100% or 50% as set out above).   </p>  <p>  Rates income data are published by local authorities in their Annual Financial Statements. 2013 is the latest year for which audited local authority Annual Financial Statement data are available.</p>  <p>  The information requested in respect of the number of vacant properties where commercial rates were due in 2014, the amount of such properties where rates were paid and the amount outstanding, is not available in my Department.</p></reply>

The Strategy includes a commitment to commence work on a financial vehicle, to be known as the Strategic Housing Fund, to raise funding for the social housing sector.  The financial vehicle will be established to facilitate the aggregation of private investment into a fund for subsequent lending as project finance.  It is intended that this funding would be lent on to qualifying Approved Housing Bodies, giving them access to long term finance.</p>  <p>  Work on the development of this new funding model is being progressed under the oversight of a group which has been put in place to develop the financial aspects of the Social Housing Strategy.  This group - the Finance Work Stream - comprises a range of key stakeholders including my Department, the Housing Finance Agency, the National Development Finance Agency and the Departments of Finance and of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The timing of the introduction of the new funding model will be dependent on the outcome of the group&rsquo;s work.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the Housing Finance Agency is a State-owned company established in 1982, which provides loan finance to local authorities and voluntary housing bodies for housing and related purposes.  The HFA raises its funds on the domestic and international capital markets in structures and at costs that reflect its customers&rsquo; requirements.</p>  <p>  In February 2015, a new initiative jointly backed by the Housing Finance Agency and the European Investment Bank was announced which is expected to support investment in 2,000 social housing units to be developed across Ireland over the next three years.  The &euro;150 million funding from the European Investment Bank will be matched by the HFA to provide &euro;300 million available for lending to support investment by Approved Housing Bodies across the country to upgrade social housing and improve energy efficiency.  By accessing EIB funding the HFA will be able to offer Approved Housing Bodies long-term finance at extremely competitive rates.  This is just one of the methods of housing delivery in the Social Housing Strategy and underlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling the acute housing need that currently exists.</p></reply>

These are joint publications by my Department and the Department of Health and set out the Government&rsquo;s broad framework for the delivery of housing for people with disabilities through mainstream housing policy.  They were developed as part of a coherent framework, in conjunction with the Government&rsquo;s mental health policy, A Vision for Change, the Report of the Working Group on Congregated Settings and the Value for Money Review of Disability Services, to support people with disabilities within community-based living with maximum independence and choice.</p><p>Considerable progress has been made since the Strategy was published.  Implementation of the Strategy is being driven primarily by the Housing Agency.  A dedicated Housing Subgroup chaired by the Housing Agency was established in 2012 to progress implementation and includes representatives from my Department, the HSE, the Department of Health, local authorities, the Irish Council for Social Housing and various disability representative organisations.  The Housing Agency sub-group has met on 25 occasions since its establishment.</p><p>National Guidelines for the Assessment and Allocation Process for Housing Provision for People with a Disability, a key output under the NHSPWD, have been developed and was adopted for implementation by housing authorities with effect from November 2014.</p><p>Implementation of the Congregated Settings Report, led by the HSE, is supported by my Department through the NHSPWD.  My Department is represented on the HSE Working Group and is supporting the ongoing work to progress the transitioning of individuals from congregated settings.  In addition, the Housing Agency subgroup has established two task groups to progress the priority actions in relation to mental health and in relation to actions for individuals with a disability living in the community.  Much work has been done to deliver on these issues and this will continue.</p><p>The majority of housing authorities have now established Housing and Disability Steering Groups (HDSGs), chaired by the authority and including the HSE and disability representative organisations, to achieve a co-ordinated and integrated approach to meeting the housing needs of people with disabilities.  All HDSGs will be up and running in the coming months.  As part of the priority action to ensure equitable access for people with disabilities, each HSDG must prepare a Strategic Plan for each county/city area  which aims to identify the housing needs of people with a disability, both current and emerging over the next five years, and develop specific local strategies to meet the identified needs.  Most of the Strategic Plans have now been preparedand it is intended that they will be collated by the Housing Agency into a draft National Plan.</p><p>An Implementation Monitoring Group was established in 2012 to monitor and report on progress, and has met on seven occasions since then.  The group is chaired by my Department and comprises representatives of the Department of Health, the HSE, the National Disability Authority, the National Service Users Executive and disability representative organisations.  The first progress report of the Implementation Monitoring Group was published in 2014 and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at:</p><p>www.environ.ie/e.</p><p>It is intended to hold a meeting of the IMG early in 2016 with a view to further updating progress.</p></reply>

My Department undertakes Regulatory Impact Assessments in accordance with the procedures set out in the RIA Guidelines published by the Department of the Taoiseach.  The following is a list of the eight Bills which have been published to date:</p>  <p>  - The Access to Central Treasury Funds (Commission for Energy Regulation) Bill 2011 was enacted on 23 November 2011.  No Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) was required for this Bill.  A full RIA was undertaken for the related Petroleum (Exploration and Extraction) Safety Act, 2010.</p>  <p>  - The Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2011 was enacted on 25 February 2012.  A RIA for the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2011 was published with the Bill on 27 September 2011.</p>  <p>  - The Electricity Regulation (Carbon Revenue Levy) (Amendment) Bill 2012 was enacted on 25 May 2012.  This was emergency legislation on foot of a Supreme Court Decision and therefore was exempt from RIA requirements.</p>  <p>  - The Gas Regulation Bill 2013 was enacted on 3 December 2013.  A RIA on the Gas Regulation Bill 2013, setting out the policy context and rationale for the implementation of full ownership unbundling, including for the sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy, was prepared.  Some of the material contained in the RIA was considered to be commercially sensitive in light of the ongoing transaction process.  Therefore, it has not been published at this stage.</p>  <p>  - The ESB (Electronic Communications Networks) Bill 2013 was enacted on 18 March 2014.  A RIA was completed in respect of the Bill and was published on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  - The Communications Regulation (Postal Services) (Amendment) Bill 2015 was enacted on 2 July 2015.  A RIA was completed in respect of the Bill and was published on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  - The Petroleum (Exploration and Extraction) Safety Bill 2015 was enacted on 22 July 2015.  A RIA was completed in respect of the Bill and was published on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  - The Minerals Development Bill 2015 was published on 9 July 2015.  A RIA was completed in respect of the Bill and will shortly be published on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  There are two Bills currently in preparation where draft Heads of these Bills have been approved by Government and the Bills are expected to be published in Spring 2016.  Regulatory Impact Assessments have been completed in respect of both of these Bills.</p>  <p>  In addition, there are four Bills currently in preparation in respect of which Heads of these Bills have not yet been submitted to Government.  It is expected that a Regulatory Impact Assessment will be published for each of these Bills.</p></reply>

Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures including attic insulation, wall insulation, heating systems upgrades, solar thermal panels and accompanying Building Energy Rating (BER).</p><p>From 2011 to end-November 2015 the scheme delivered energy efficiency measures to 109,191 homes around the country. In response to a decline in demand for this scheme, in March of this year, I increased grant levels and introduced other reforms such as a bonus payment for deeper measures. This has led to a resurgence in grant applications, with applications up 80% year on year in 2015. </p><p>The following illustrates the number of homes grant-aided per year, along with the average value of grants awarded.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of Homes</th><th>Average value of grant per home</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>49,236</td><td>&euro;1,170</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>26,426</td><td>&euro;1,095</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>13,710</td><td>&euro;960</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>9,279</td><td>&euro;997</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>10,540</td><td>&euro;1,141</td></tr></table></p><p>The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty, who meet the eligibility criteria. It should be noted that under this scheme the full cost of the works is met, therefore the figures given relate to average spend per home. The measures available include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation. </p><p>From 2011 to end-November 2015, 67,293 homes around the country have received energy efficiency measures under the scheme. Demand for this scheme remains strong, with &euro;15m paid out so far in 2015. The average spend per home has increased considerably over the past five years. This is primarily due to significant improvements in the technical standards the scheme must meet. Rising costs and the provision of some deeper interventions for households in severe energy poverty also account for this increase. <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of Homes </th><th>Average spend per home </th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>20,388</td><td>&euro;1,049</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>21,175</td><td>&euro;1,683</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>9,803</td><td>&euro;1,790</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>9,056</td><td>&euro;2,280</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>6,871</td><td>&euro;2,212</td></tr></table></p></reply>

However, the postal sector is undergoing systemic change, with migration towards electronic communications resulting in significant core mail volume decline year-on-year. However, post offices, having being fully computerised some years ago, also stand well positioned to become the front office provider of choice for Government and the financial services sector for both electronic transactions as well as the more traditional over the counter transactions.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the changing commercial environment I established the Post Office Network Business Development Group earlier this year, the remit of which is to examine the potential from existing and new Government and commercial business that could be transacted through the Post Office network. The Group presented its initial report to me in May 2015. In summary, the initial report outlined that the future of the Post Office network would be best secured by seeking out opportunities in the following areas: financial services; Government services; social capital and enterprise; and white labelling of financial and other products.</p>  <p>  To gain further insight into these areas, a public consultation exercise was held from 16 June to 28 July last, inclusive. Interested parties were invited to submit their views on the initial report. It is clear from the responses received that there is a strong public desire to maintain the nationwide network of post offices. The consultation responses have assisted the Group in identifying opportunities that can benefit the post office network and have informed the final report, which I expect to receive presently.</p>  <p>  It is premature to speculate, in advance of receiving the final report, on matters, including cost implications, until I have had the opportunity to consider in detail the findings of the Group.</p></reply>

In 2014, 8.6% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall energy requirements were met from renewable sources.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  </font><font color="#0D0D0D">To date wind energy has proved to be the most commercial renewable energy technology in the Irish electricity market. In 2014, 18.2% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity demand was met by wind generation. Nevertheless, diversification of the renewable generation portfolio in the longer term will be important for creating a sustainable, carbon free, electricity system. In this regard, biomass will have a role to play. Electricity generated from biomass is already supported through the three REFIT schemes and, depending on electricity demand; the full implementation of current policies could mean that up to 5% of electricity may be generated from biomass in 2020. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">Notwithstanding the expected use of biomass in the electricity sector, it is expected that biomass will have a more significant role to play in the heat and transport sectors where fewer alternative technologies exist. To support this, the Draft Bioenergy Plan published in 2014 identified the need for an additional bioenergy focussed Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) to support the deployment of renewable energy in the heat sector. The Draft Bioenergy Plan identified the introduction of an RHI as the most cost effective means of helping to meet our 12% renewable heat target by 2020. It has been determined through subsequent analysis that a premium based RHI scheme targeted at the large industrial non-ETS sector would be the most cost effective mechanism.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  As part of the design process to introduce an effective RHI scheme, my Department published the first of three consultations in July this year to identify a range of technologies in the heating sector. At the moment, all responses to this first consultation are under review. Two further consultations are expected in 2016 in order to finalise the new RHI support scheme, and determine the level of subsidy required. The RHI scheme will - subject to Government approval and state aid clearance from the European Commission - become available at the end of 2016.</font></p></reply>

While it is entirely independent in the execution of its statutory duties, I am satisfied that it carries them out to the highest standard. As I have said in the White Paper on energy policy which I published yesterday, the CER has provided valuable regulatory stability, certainty and predictability through its strong, evidence-based and transparent decision-making.</p>  <p>  CER ceased regulating retail electricity prices in 2011 and retail gas prices in 2014. The electricity and gas markets are commercial, liberalised, and competitive and that they operate within national and European regulatory regimes. The competitive energy market results in choice for consumers and businesses in terms of suppliers, products and prices, exerting downward pressure on prices. </p>  <p>  Under various relevant Statutory Instruments, CER carries out statutory market monitoring functions and has the responsibility to ensure the market operates competitively for the benefit of the consumer. The statutory functions include monitoring whether the development and operation of competition in electricity supply is benefitting final customers. CER market monitoring reports are available on its website. In this regard I am confident that the regulator is carrying out its functions effectively and that it will continue to ensure that competitive markets are delivering for all consumers as I set out in the White Paper. The recent announcements by Electric Ireland, Bord G&aacute;is, SSE and Energia offering savings to customers indicate that competition is working for the benefit of customers.</p>  <p>  The White Paper contains a commitment to review the legal and institutional framework for the regulation of the electricity and natural gas markets. This review will encompass a review of the CER&rsquo;s mandate, in line with ongoing requirements for government sectoral economic regulation.</p></reply>

It is expected that the majority of this 40% target will be met by wind energy. Quantifying the costs and benefits of meeting our renewable energy obligations is a complex task involving the examination of many interrelated variables. This work and the related findings will form the basis of a report that will be published shortly.</p>  <p>  In addition, a range of other studies have been undertaken in the last number of years to assess the economic cost of integrating increasing amounts of renewable energy into the energy mix. The All-Island Grid Study, published in 2008, assessed the technical feasibility and the relative costs and benefits associated with various scenarios for increased shares of electricity sourced from renewable energy in the all island power system. The scenarios were informed by the resource available, technological readiness of the various generation technologies (including wind) and cost required per generated unit. This study informed the decision to move towards achieving 40% renewable electricity generation in Ireland by 2020. It concluded that - based on assumptions set out in the report - wind energy represented a cost effective source for electricity generation. </p>  <p>  It is well known that Ireland is an ideal location for wind energy investment. The abundant wind resource in Ireland means that each unit of installed wind generation capacity generates more units of electricity when compared with other countries and hence needs a lower rate per generated unit of electricity in order to recover the overall costs of the project. The existing feed-in tariff, REFIT, which is funded from the Public Service Obligation levy on consumer bills, is a very cost effective support for onshore wind development. This was the finding of a report published by the Council of European Energy Regulators earlier this year.</p>  <p>  This finding has been underpinned by other published reports and analyses which have examined the effect of renewables on electricity prices. Two major studies have been published on the impact of increased wind generation on the Single Electricity Market in Ireland. One was carried out by the Commission for Energy Regulation&rsquo;s (CER) and the Northern Ireland Authority for Energy Regulation (NIAER) in January 2009 and the other by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and EirGrid in 2011. Both studies found that the market is capable of operating successfully with increasing amounts of wind and that the cost to consumers in Public Service Obligation (PSO) terms tends to be offset by the downward pressure wind puts on energy prices in the wholesale market.</p>  <p>  On the question of sustainability; there is little doubt that the use of indigenous renewable generation is a more sustainable long-term approach for energy security and economic competitiveness than importing fossil fuel energy. In 2014, renewable electricity generation in Ireland is estimated by the SEAI to have avoided &euro;250 million worth of fossil fuels imports. </p>  <p>  In the circumstances, there are no plans to set up and independent body to commission further economic review of wind energy.</p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.</p><p>In July last I published a detailed draft Intervention Strategy for public consultation. That Strategy proposes that the State-funded network must be capable of delivering high-quality, high speed broadband of at least 30mbps download and 6mbps upload.

This will be a specific requirement of the tender and it will be a matter for bidders to select the technology they consider will best deliver the service.</p><p>In accordance with EU State Aid Guidelines, my Department must observe a strict policy of technology neutrality in any procurement process and therefore I am not in a position to promise connectivity through any one particular technology platform. The Department will set out a detailed service specification, including a requirement to scale up services over the lifetime of the contract, and allow bidders to demonstrate how they propose to meet these contractual requirements.</p><p>The Government is determined to ensure that the network is built out as quickly as possible and engagement with industry stakeholders has indicated that this could be achieved within 3-5 years of the contract award. </p><p>In this context, the NBP proposes that through the combination of commercial investment and State intervention, 85% of addresses in Ireland will have access to high speed services by 2018 with an ambition of 100% coverage by 2020.</p><p>More generally I am informed by the commercial operators that next generation broadband services have been rolled out to over 55,000 premises to date in County Kildare with over 12,500 more expected to be served by commercial investment. Approximately 20,500 remaining premises in Kildare will be covered either by further commercial investment or the proposed State intervention.

It is not possible for me to comment on the suitability of individual locations but my Department is fully supportive of the development of blueways and recognise the benefits of these initiatives to local economies.  However, it is a matter for interested parties to develop any proposal with the relevant local authority and National Governing Bodies, in the first instance, and then to work with Sport Ireland and or Failte Ireland as appropriate to develop any such proposal.</p>  <p>  The Royal and Shannon Blueways - on the Shannon River and Royal Canal  - were developed by a number of partners with the lead agency, Waterways Ireland. In May 2014 a coastal blueway was launched in South Galway and North Mayo following development of the concept by a committee drawn from interested parties including Galway and Mayo County Councils and National Governing Bodies for Watersports.</p>  <p>  The National Trails Office, which is operated by Sport Ireland, has responsibility for the development of a standard for Blueways and for verification of compliance with the standard through a trail registration and inspection process. The National Trials Office is available to provide advice where the development of a Blueway is proposed.</p></reply>

Waterford Port  is eligible to apply for funding through the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), a key EU funding instrument to promote growth, jobs and competitiveness through targeted infrastructure investment at European level.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department have met recently with Waterford Port Company to advise and encourage them to explore projects that might qualify for CEF funding. </p>  <p>  In December, the Department facilitated a meeting between the port and officials from the Commission, the European Investment Bank and INEA (the Executive agency for CEF). In addition, the port attended a recent information session on Motorways of the Sea (MOS), a horizontal priority of the Connecting Europe Facility, hosted jointly by the Department and the European Coordinator for Motorways of the Sea. Once again, an individual meeting was facilitated between the port and the European Co-ordinator. My Department is aware that the Port of Waterford is actively exploring a joint venture with a number of partners in preparation for an application for Motorways of the Sea funding.​</p>  <p>  Waterford Port is within the South East Region for EU Structural Funding purposes and the managing authority for the Regional Operational Programme is the Southern Regional Assembly.</p>  <p>  The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) co-financed Regional Operational Programmes (2014-2020) approved by the Irish Government and agreed with the European Commission in December 2014 were formally signed in Brussels in February 2015.</p>  <p>  The regional programmes focus on five thematic areas: research and innovation, enterprise development, broadband infrastructure, energy efficiency and integrated urban development. Port infrastructure was not identified as a thematic priority for co-funding under the 2014-2020 programmes. However, the Southern Regional Assembly have advised that they are available to provide additional information and advice to the port in relation to potential future funding through the regional programmes.</p></reply>

In the case of the proposed runway extension at Waterford, the airport authorities are fully aware of this position and I understand that they are pursuing local interests in relation to that project.</p>  <p>  My Department invited all airports and other transport bodies to an Information Seminar earlier this month on the financing options under the European Union's European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI), the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) and the EIB.

It links the south west corner of Lough Neagh with the south east corner of Upper Lough Erne and passes through or close to Counties Tyrone, Fermanagh and Armagh in Northern Ireland and Counties Monaghan and Cavan in Ireland.  It passes through a number of towns and villages, including Monaghan and Clones.</p>  <p>  The cost estimate for the restoration of the full Ulster Canal navigation from Upper Lough Erne to Lough Neagh is based on the 2007 business case prepared by Fitzpatrick Associates for the  then Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Restoring the Ulster Canal: Outline Business Case, June 2007).  The costs, presented in sterling (GBP), were estimated at some &pound;141.6 million at 2007 prices. </p>  <p>  2008 was the first year of expenditure on the project following the North South Ministerial Council Decision to proceed with the restoration of 13 kms of the Ulster Canal from Upper Lough Erne to Clones at an estimated cost of some &euro;35m. The total expenditure between 2008 and 2015 amounts to &euro;1,263,000. This figure includes design, environmental study and planning costs.  It also includes expenditure of &euro;347,000 incurred on foot of the Government approval that I secured earlier this year for Waterways Ireland to proceed with the restoration of the 2.5 km section of the Ulster Canal from Lough Erne to Castle Saunderson. These works are proceeding, with the bulk of the expenditure due to take place in 2016.</p>  <p>  The Ulster Canal restoration project has been 100% funded by the Irish Government to date.</p></reply>
