The Department of Justice and Equality is currently leading a consultation process to develop a new National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy.  This process will result in a new Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2016-2020 and a set of actions to bring about a real improvement in the quality of life for Travellers and Roma, including children. </p><p><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>,<i></i>our<i></i>major framework in relation to children and young people, contains a range of commitments to Traveller and Roma children, addressing issues such as health, education, and social inclusion.  The State of the Nation&rsquo;s Children Report (2014) includes a specific section on children in the Traveller Community on areas including nutrition, self-esteem, drug and alcohol use, family relationships, and feelings of safeness within community.  The <i>National Strategy on Children and Young People&rsquo;s Participation in Decision-making</i>(2015-2020) contains specific actions to strengthen participation in decision-making by Traveller children and young people.</p><p>Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has a statutory responsibility to ensure each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.  Tusla's education welfare service, comprising the statutory Education Welfare Service, the School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison scheme, are key supports for children who are vulnerable to early school-leaving and educational disadvantage including Traveller children.</p><p>Children and families from the Traveller Community who require additional support or are  identified as vulnerable also avail of other mainstream services within Tusla.  Tusla works in partnership with local authorities, the Health Service Executive and schools to ensure an integrated response to the needs of children and families from the Traveller community including public health nursing, disability services and other relevant services.  Tusla funds a number of Traveller specific projects and provides counselling grants to organisations serving the Traveller community.</p><p>My Department also provides annual funding to support specific projects which are targeted at young Travellers and offer a wide range of programmes and services aimed at young people at risk and who are disadvantaged due to a combination of factors such as social isolation, substance misuse, involvement in crime, homelessness, early school-leaving and unemployment.  </p></reply>

With this in mind, I requested that an Interdepartmental Group, led by this Department, be established with a brief to bring forward recommendations to address this issue.</p>  <p>  The Group has concluded its work and its recommendations were fully accepted and funded by Government.  I announced, as part of Budget 2016, the necessary funding to implement the new model with costs estimated to be &euro;17.7 m in 2016 and with full year cost estimated to be &euro;33 m from 2017 onwards.  This Group has identified a practical, workable model for meeting the needs of children with a disability and the allocation of funding is clear evidence of the Government's commitment to supporting vulnerable children.</p>  <p>  When established, the new model will focus on the developmental level of children with disabilities, their functional ability and their needs.  It will not focus on diagnosis, recognising that many children may not have a formal diagnosis at the time of presenting to preschool. </p>  <p>  The model, when fully operational, will deliver seven levels of support to enable the full inclusion and meaningful participation of children with disabilities in the ECCE Programme.  These supports, which move from universal to highly targeted supports based on the needs of the child, include: enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations, increased capitation for children with very complex needs, as well as access to therapeutic intervention. </p>  <p>  Two groups have been established to oversee and implement the new model; a Cross Sectoral Implementation Group will oversee and monitor implementation, and a Project Group, which will implement the model for roll-out by September 2016.  Further details in relation to this measure are expected to be available in June this year. </p>  <p>  Until the new model is available in September 2016, my Department, the Department of Education and Skills and the HSE will continue to make a range of supports available to children with disabilities in ECCE.</p>  <p>  Publication of the EPSEN Act Implementation Plan is a matter for the Minister for Education and Skills.</p></reply>

Based on more recent (2014) data, this target has been updated to 100,000 children.  </p><p>The Department of Social Protection has the lead role in co-ordinating Government strategies on child poverty and is the Sponsor of Outcome 4 of <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>- economic security and opportunity.  It also has lead responsibility for the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion, and it has identified child poverty as a key cross-sectoral priority to be addressed in 2015 and 2016 under the <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>structures.</p><p>My Department is actively contributing to this multi-dimensional approach to address child poverty.  Key to this is the importance accorded to the development of effective and quality focused services and support for children and young people.  In this regard my Department, in collaboration with the Department of Social Protection, will hold an EU Peer Review next month to explore innovative responses in prevention and early intervention to improve outcomes for children - in particular those experiencing child poverty and disadvantage.  This event will involve ten Member States and the European Commission and a number of key Irish Stakeholders.</p><p>Within my Department, there are also a number of specific areas of focus that support our response to child poverty.  These include:</p><p>- Provision of &euro;260 million annually on early childhood care and education and after-school support programmes which provide care to 100,000 children.  This will increase to &euro;345m in 2016.</p><p>- Provision of &euro;29.7 million through the Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme (2013-2017) which is co-funded by my Department and The Atlantic Philanthropies.  </p><p>- Provision of &euro;51 million in the area of youth work services and supports.</p><p>Finally, as part of my Department's response, Tusla  is responsible for the delivery of a range of services focusing on the welfare, protection and support for children, young people and their families which are key to supporting outcomes which assist in actively reducing the impact of child poverty.</p></reply>

This new requirement will apply to all new services registering with the Child and Family Agency after the commencement of new Regulations in this area, and to existing services from 31st December this year.  Following the introduction of these changes, only those staff who hold the necessary qualification will be in position to meet the adult:child ratio requirements in early years settings.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department have met with officials from the Department of Social Protection on a number of occasions to consider any impact the qualifications requirement would have on the scheme and on services.  We all agree that quality in childcare services is of priority and that the Early Years Quality Agenda must remain the key focus in childcare services.  The Community Employment Childcare Programme helps participants to upskill in a supervised environment.  Community Childcare Services also benefit from the extra support in the early years setting.  However, utilising CE participants as core staff within childcare services adult:child ratios is not best practice for either the Childcare or Community Employment areas.</p>  <p>  I am aware that some Community Childcare Services have traditionally relied on Community Employment participants as core staff in their settings and that the new Regulations with the minimum qualification requirement will bring challenges for those services, once commenced.  At the request of my Department, City and County Childcare Committees have established a project to examine the impact of these changes on the sustainability of community childcare services that are currently dependent on Community Employment workers to meet the ratio requirements.  My Department has advised childcare providers who consider that the sustainability of their service is at risk as a result of this measure to contact their local City or County Childcare Committee immediately to discuss this matter. </p>  <p>  There is no issue with Community Employment participants obtaining placement within the childcare services as long as they are not considered core staff members/part of the adult:child ratio.</p></reply>

The data indicated a substantial increase in economic vulnerability for children over the period of the recent recession, and demonstrated that it had negative consequences for children&rsquo;s social and emotional development.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the study found higher risks of economic vulnerability among groups such as lone parents, families where the primary caregiver had lower levels of education, and families where the primary caregiver was very young at the time of the child&rsquo;s birth.  </p><p>The analysis points to the need for a continuing emphasis on education and skills, especially for early school leavers.  It also demonstrates the need for the right mix of income support and services such as training and childcare, so that families can be supported through both immediate financial protection and enhanced labour market prospects.</p><p>My Department has a key role to play in promoting positive parenting and supporting families in difficulty.  It also plays an important role in supporting high quality and affordable childcare, an area for which I secured an increase of &euro;85m, or 33% of our existing investment, in 2016.</p><p>For parenting and family support, my Department published the <i>High Level Policy Statement on Supporting Parents and Families</i>last April, which provides the context for considerable work being done in this area by Tusla.  In addition to its important child protection and welfare functions, Tusla also works to support all families in universal programmes such as <i>Parenting24seven</i>.  </p><p>For families in difficulty, Tusla's <i>Meitheal </i>programme is a valuable national practice model for assessing the needs of children and families that come to the attention of practitioners and communities.  It focuses on early responses to help prevent family problems from reaching a stage where they might otherwise require more specialised supports.</p><p>There is no doubt that the recent recession was an extremely difficult time for all children and families, but particularly those in vulnerable situations.  The <i>Growing up in Ireland </i>data provide us with an important insight into the nature of the challenges they have faced, and it is vital that all Government policies are appropriately tailored to meet their needs.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-01-28a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016012800051#WRA01600"><p>Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the considerable support of the childcare sector and the flexibility of childcare providers and staff in ensuring that the range of childcare support programmes administered by my Department are implemented. </p>  <p>  At present, the Early Childhood Care and Education Programme covers children who have reached the age of 3 years and 2 months by 1st September of the relevant year.  From September 2016, I am expanding this Programme to allow children enrol in free pre-school from the time they are 3 years of age and to remain there until they start primary school.  </p>  <p>  Following the Budget announcement, I met with senior representatives from the early years sector to discuss the measures that were announced as part of the Budget package.  The meeting was positive and constructive, with all parties expressing commitment to work together on the issues of capacity and high quality pre-school provision.  </p>  <p>  As a result of the Budget extension, the number of children benefiting from the Programme is expected to rise from around 67,000 to 127,000 in a given programme year.  For the 2016/17 programme year, it is estimated that 89,500 children will be eligible to enrol in the Programme from September 2016, an additional 22,000 from January 2017 and a further 15,500 from April 2017.</p>  <p>  I decided to introduce this new measure from September 2016 in order to provide the early years sector with the time to build capacity to meet the increased demand.  As the increased demand for the Programme is not expected to peak until April 2017, this timeframe should allow preschool providers to make any necessary infrastructural or service changes and to put in place extra staff resources to accommodate the additional demand. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that there is already additional capacity in the early years sector to cope with some of the increased demand.  The Annual Survey of Early Years Services, which was conducted in December 2014, estimates that there are more than 24,000 vacancies in early years services across the country with almost 13,000 of these vacancies in sessional services.</p>  <p>  I am also aware that every year a significant number of new preschool providers apply to participate in this Programme.  This increased demand for, and additional investment in, free preschool provision should encourage a greater numbers of applicants.  </p>  <p>  It is clear that more capacity will be required.  Officials in my Department are working closely with the City and County Childcare Committees and the Voluntary Childcare Organisations to identify measures to help increase capacity. </p></reply>

In replying, the Minister made reference to provisions in both the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 and Ombudsman Act 1980 which excludes either Ombudsman from investigating any action taken by or on behalf of a person in the administration of law relating to asylum.</p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality established a working group to review a range of issues pertaining to asylum seekers and direct provision.  The Working Group on the Protection Process was chaired by Judge Bryan McMahon and consisted of children's rights advocates, organisations engaged with asylum groups and representatives from a range of relevant Government departments, including a representative from my own Department.  The Report of the Working Group on the Protection Process was published in June 2015.  It included a recommendation that the remit of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children should be extended to complaints relating to services to residents of direct provision accommodation centres and to transfer decisions following breach of rules.  The report and its recommendations are currently being considered by my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality,  Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the Ombudsman for Children identified the lengthy period of time that families spend in direct provision as a key concern, and it is one which would help to address many of the problems experienced in the system.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-01-28a.29.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016012800051#WRA02000"><p>Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the considerable support of the childcare sector and the flexibility of childcare providers and staff in ensuring that the range of childcare support programmes administered by my Department are implemented. </p>  <p>  At present, the Early Childhood Care and Education Programme covers children who have reached the age of 3 years and 2 months by 1st September of the relevant year.  From September 2016, I am expanding this Programme to allow children enrol in free preschool from the time they are 3 years of age and to remain there until they start primary school.  As a result of this extension, the number of children benefiting from the Programme is expected to rise from around 67,000 to 127,000 in a given programme year, which represents an opportunity for the sector to increase income by 60% on average.</p>  <p>  I decided to introduce this new measure from September 2016.  As the increased demand for the Programme is not expected to peak until April 2017, this timeframe should allow preschool providers to make any necessary infrastructural or service changes and to put in place extra staff resources to accommodate the additional demand.  I am satisfied that there is already additional capacity in the early years sector to cope with some of the increased demand. </p>  <p>  I am also aware that every year a significant number of new preschool providers apply to participate in this Programme.  This increased demand for, and additional investment in, free preschool provision should encourage a greater numbers of applicants, although clearly additional capacity will be required. </p>  <p>  I am restoring capitation rates to pre-2012 levels from September 2016.  This increase, which will bring capitation to as much as &euro;2,850 per year for each eligible child, is a guaranteed source of income and a major support for preschool providers.  This was particularly evident in the difficult economic climate that prevailed in recent years when many parents would not have been in a position to avail of preschool for their children.  Additional capitation for preschool providers, announced as part of the suite of Government-funded supports for children with a disability accessing the ECCE Programme, is another measure that will assist in addressing issues of sustainability for preschool providers.</p>  <p>  I met with senior representatives from the early years sector to discuss, among other issues, the measures that were announced as part of the Budget 2016 package.  The meeting was positive and constructive, with all parties expressing commitment to work together on the issues of capacity and high quality preschool provision.  My Department will be working closely with the early years sector to build capacity in time for the first intake in September 2016, and for subsequent increased availability in January and April 2017.</p></reply>

Homelessness can have a negative impact on a child's education and welfare including their sense of security.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, with the local authorities, is working hard to address this problem.</p><p>Homelessness as part of a family group is not, in of itself, a basis for receiving a child into care.  Parents remain their children&rsquo;s primary carer.  Tusla's main role is to provide family support, in the same way as it does for families in the general community, by providing  guidance and parenting supports through its locally based services. </p><p>Where Tusla identifies underlying problems such as parental mental health, addiction or parenting problems, it can refer the family to the appropriate service or provide the support and oversight needed to ensure the welfare and protection of the children.  Tusla has regular meetings with Focus Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and Dublin City Council to identify vulnerable families in order to support them as best they can.</p><p>Where there are child protection concerns, these should be reported immediately to Tusla for appropriate response.  The reporting of these concerns to Tusla is governed by <i>Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children </i>(2011).</p><p>Children who are not in the care of their parent/s or guardians and present as out of home to emergency services have their needs assessed and, if appropriate, are received into care under the Child Care Act 1991.</p></reply>

Employer PRSI was payable at the lower 8.5% rate where, for example, an employee worked a 39 hour week at the minimum wage. </p><p>The Low Pay Commission was established by this Government in early 2015 and was a key commitment in the Statement of Priorities agreed by the Taoiseach and myself in 2014.<i></i>In particular, the Commission makes recommendations to the relevant Minister regarding the level of the national minimum hourly rate of pay without, <i>inter alia</i>, creating significant adverse consequences for employment or competitiveness.</p><p>The Commission reported last July on this issue and the Government was pleased to implement its recommendation of an increase in the hourly minimum wage to &euro;9.15 with effect from this January.  In making this recommendation the Commission was concerned that, without an adjustment in employer PRSI, an increase in the minimum wage rate would have a major impact, particularly on small business costs as the employment of a minimum wage worker for a 39 hour week would now attract the higher Employer PRSI rate of 10.75% (the higher rate commenced at earnings of &euro;356 per week). </p><p>In Budget 2016, it was announced that, from 1 January this year, the upper threshold for paying the 8.5% Class A rate of employer PRSI would be increased from &euro;356 to &euro;376 per week and this was provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2015 enacted in December 2015.  The increase in this threshold addresses the concerns highlighted by the Low Pay Commission on this issue and ensures that employers with employees benefiting from the increased minimum wage continue to attract the lower 8.5% rate of employer PRSI.</p><p>This measure is estimated to cost circa &euro;17 million in a full year and will benefit employers by between &euro;8.01 to &euro;8.46 per week in respect some 88,000 employments.  It is important to note that the measure benefits all employers with employees currently earning between &euro;356 and &euro;376 per week including those who are not necessarily on the minimum wage e.g. employees working for less than a full week but at hourly rates in excess of the minimum wage.  </p><p>It is not possible to estimate the projected increase in the yield from Employers PRSI in respect of those benefiting from the minimum wage as PRSI and earnings data reported by employers does not include the number of hours worked by, or the hourly wage of, an individual employee. </p><p>In addition to the above changes to Employer PRSI, the Government also decreased the PRSI liability for employees earning between &euro;352 and &euro;424 per week through the introduction of a new PRSI credit.  This can benefit some employees by up to &euro;12 per week. </p><p>The employer and employee PRSI changes outlined above were enacted by the Oireachtas in December and came into effect in January.</p></reply>

This increase applied to those on the maximum personal rate of payment e.g. the State Pension Contributory (SPC) rate increased from &euro;230.30 to &euro;233.30 per week, and the State Pension Non Contributory rate increased from &euro;219 to &euro;222 per week.  </p>  <p>  Proportionate increases applied for qualified adults and for those on reduced rates of pensions.  In this regard, qualified adults on SPC aged 66 or over gain &euro;2.70 per week (from &euro;206.30 to &euro;209 per week), while qualified adults aged under 66 in receipt of SPC or SPNC gain by &euro;2 per week.  The policy adopted in this regard is the long-standing practice for rate increases. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the rate of the qualified adult payment payable where the qualified adult is aged 66 or over is equivalent to over 88% of the personal rate of payment or far higher than the proportion which apples to other qualified adult rates of payment (normally around 66%).  In addition, all persons aged 66 and over (including those who are qualified adults) are eligible to apply for the means-tested State pension non-contributory and, depending on the means of the couple, may be eligible to receive a rate of this pension higher than the qualified adult weekly rate the State pension contributory.</p>  <p>  Budget 2016 contained a number of other welfare measures of benefit to pensioners.  A pensioner couple in receipt of the maximum rate of the State Pension Contributory would have received a 75% Christmas Bonus of &euro;327.50 in the first week of December 2015.  In addition, pensioners may also have benefited from the increase in Fuel Allowance from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week for the duration of the fuel season.</p></reply>

The Revised Estimates for 2016 state that in excess of &euro;410 million will be spent on FIS this year.  FIS is currently supporting approximately 56,000 recipients. </p>  <p>  To qualify for payment of FIS, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment, which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria.  The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with him/her or is supported by him/her.  Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount, which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.</p>  <p>  The &ldquo;full-time&rdquo; employment condition has been a fundamental part of the FIS payment since its introduction in 1984, although the number of hours worked in order to satisfy this condition has been reduced considerably.  The requirement was initially set at 30 hours per week but was progressively lowered to 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week in 1996. </p>  <p>  Apprentices during the course of their apprenticeship typically undertake three off-the-job full time education phases.  Attendance on a full-time education course is not considered full-time employment and consequently apprentices cannot qualify for FIS during these periods. </p>  <p>  However, apprentices can qualify for FIS for the four on-the job apprenticeship phases when they are working for their employer.</p></reply>

Where a returned emigrant does not qualify for a social insurance payment, he or she may apply for a social assistance payment, such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  </p>  <p>  In addition to having to satisfy a means test and other eligibility criteria directly relevant to the specific payment being claimed, applicants for most social assistance payments must also be determined as being habitually resident in the State in order to qualify.  The general principles underpinning the application of the habitual residence condition centre on the overall assessment of a person&rsquo;s situation, including consideration of the following factors - </p>  <p>  -  the length and continuity of residence in Ireland or in any other particular country,</p>  <p>  -  the length and purpose of any absence from Ireland,</p>  <p>  -  the nature and pattern of employment,</p>  <p>  -  the person&rsquo;s main centre of interest, and</p>  <p>  -  the future intentions of the person as they appear from all of the circumstances.</p>  <p>  Returning emigrants who had previously been habitually resident in the State and who moved to live and work in another country and then resume their long-term residence in the State may be determined as habitually resident in the State immediately on their return to the State.  In addition, arrangements are in place with Safe-Home Ltd, a registered charity, to assist with the difficulty experienced by a minority of returning emigrants in demonstrating their intention to live in the State permanently for the purposes of satisfying the habitual residence condition.  </p>  <p>  It is open to anyone who is dissatisfied with a decision on the application of the habitual residence condition in relation to entitlement to a social welfare payment to appeal that decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p>  <p>  While I have no plans to change its operation at this stage, the operation of the habitual residence condition is kept under continual review.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes. </p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for SPC also being satisfied. </p>  <p>  The most recently published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund confirms that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  It further confirms that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories, mostly women, have and will continue to obtain the best value for money from the Fund due to the distributive nature of the Fund. </p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), the State pension system provides alternative methods of support.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. </p>  <p>  Work is underway to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;.  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical challenges to be overcome in its implementation.  The position of women who were homemakers will be considered very carefully in developing this reform.</p></reply>

Compensation is based on the worker&rsquo;s length of reckonable service and reckonable weekly remuneration, subject to a ceiling of &euro;600 per week.</p><p>It is the responsibility of the employer to pay statutory redundancy to its eligible employees.  Where an employer can prove to the satisfaction of the Department that it is unable to pay the statutory redundancy to its eligible employees, the Department will make lump sum payments directly to the eligible employees from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF). Amounts paid under such circumstances are sought back from employers. In addition where employers become insolvent, certain other outstanding statutory entitlements (arrears of wages, holiday pay etc.) may be paid from the SIF.  The Minister for Social Protection becomes a preferential creditor in the winding-up of companies in respect of monies paid from the SIF.</p><p>Under the provisions of Section 24(4) of the Social Welfare Act 1990 all moneys standing to the credit of the Redundancy and Employers&rsquo; Insolvency Fund on 30 April 1990 were transferred to the SIF on 1 May 1990.  </p><p>The SIF was established by the Social Welfare Act 1952 (as amended) and operates under the terms of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act (SWCA) 2005. Under section 9 of that Act the SIF comprises of a current account which is managed and controlled by the Minister for Social Protection and an investment account which is managed and controlled by the Minister for Finance. The annual statutory accounts of the SIF are prepared in the form and manner approved by the Minister for Finance. There is a separate account prepared for the current account and the investment account. These accounts are audited by the C&amp;amp;AG and are laid on an annual basis before the Houses of the Oireachtas and are subject to PAC examination.</p><p>The income of the SIF derives mainly from Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) contributions.  In addition to redundancy payment entitlements, social insurance benefits and occupational injury benefits are paid out of the SIF.</p><p>SWCA 2005 allows for PRSI to be paid into either the investment account or the current account of the SIF. It requires surplus funds in the current account not required for expenditure purposes to be transferred to the investment account for investment purposes. In accordance with  section 9 (9) of SWCA 2005, the SIF has received a state subvention since 2010 in order to bridge the gap between its PRSI income and its social insurance related expenditure.<font color="#0000FF"> </font>As at the 31 December 2013 the SIF had no surplus funds on hand. A table is included below, which shows the SIF operating surplus/deficit for the period 2006-2014.</p><p>Significant and increasing amounts were paid out in redundancy rebates to employers from the SIF during the economic crisis.  While the SIF is constituted primarily from employer contributions, the taxpayers&rsquo; contribution is also significant.  One of the factors which influenced the Government&rsquo;s decision in Budget 2013 to abolish the rebate was the increasing cost of rebates to often profitable companies. I acknowledge the contribution made by these enterprises in the creation of employment. However, the cost of making rebates is too significant to allow for its re-introduction.  Therefore, I do not propose to restore the rebate for small or medium enterprises.  </p><p><b>SIF Income and Expenditure 2006-2014</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>SIF Income</th><th>SIF Expenditure</th><th>Operating Surplus/Deficit</th><th>Cumulative Surplus at end of year</th><th>Exchequer Subvention Requirement</th></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>&euro;,000</td><td>&euro;,000</td><td>&euro;,000</td><td>&euro;,000</td><td>&euro;,000</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>6,974,411</td><td>6,325,554</td><td>648,857</td><td>3,049,141</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>7,834,147</td><td>7,250,990</td><td>583,157</td><td>3,632,298</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>8,144,410</td><td>8,399,739</td><td>(255,329)</td><td>3,376,969</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>7,297,601</td><td>9,784,225</td><td>(2,486,624)</td><td>890,345</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>6,709,681</td><td>9,460,835</td><td>(2,751,154)</td><td>1,477*</td><td>(1,862,286)**</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>7,543,883</td><td>9,004,245</td><td>(1,460,362)</td><td>1,477</td><td>(1,460,362)</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>6,785,557</td><td>8,869,567</td><td>(2,084,010)</td><td>1,477</td><td>(2,084,010)</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>7,317,505</td><td>8,631,635</td><td>(1,314,130)</td><td>1,477</td><td>(1,314,130)</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>7,891,344  </td><td>8,433,142</td><td>(541,798)</td><td>1,477</td><td>(541,798)</td></tr></table><i>*The 2010-2014 cumulative surplus represents the book value of the Departments HQ premises vested in the Minister for Social protection on behalf of the Fund.</i></p><p><i>** In this period Vote Subvention commenced in mid-2010.</i></p><p><i>2015 figures are not yet available but provisional estimates indicate Exchequer Subvention will be in the order of &euro;130 million.</i></p></reply>

My Department then expects to make payments every two weeks from the week beginning 1 February 2016. </p>  <p>  Many beneficiaries of the Fuel Grant will have applied online on 1 January of this year, and the intention was to make payments from mid-January. However, some IT issues on the new payment system arose which have delayed payments. These issues are now in the process of being resolved and payments will shortly proceed to be made on a bimonthly basis. </p>  <p>  I think it is important to provide the Deputy with some of the background to the introduction of the Fuel Grant.</p>  <p>  From 1969 to 2014, the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme provided for the repayment of excise duty on fuel used by beneficiaries of the Scheme. Following a judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Union of April 2013, the repayment of excise element of the Scheme was found to be incompatible with the Energy Tax Directive. Following negotiations with the European Commission it was agreed that the repayment of excise duty should be discontinued as of 31 December 2014.</p>  <p>  As I stated in March 2014, to ensure that no beneficiary of the Scheme lost out as a result of the Court's ruling, I decided to introduce a new fuel grant effective from 1 January 2015. Section 81 of the Finance Act 2015 provided for the making of regulations to govern the operation of the fuel grant, which I subsequently made through the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Fuel Grant Regulations (S.I. No. 635 of 2015). The Revenue Commissioners are processing Fuel Grant applications and, as I have indicated, my Department is making the payments to beneficiaries.</p>  <p>  The Fuel Grant is paid at the same rate as the rates for repayment of excise duty on fuel. Accordingly, I have maintained the rate for petrol at &euro;0.59 per litre, the rate for diesel at &euro;0.48 per litre, and the rate for liquefied petroleum gas at &euro;0.10 per litres. This Fuel Grant maintains the previous practice of paying the sum 12 months in arrears, so that the Revenue Commissions began processing applications on behalf of my Department from 1 January 2016. </p>  <p>  With the assistance of the Revenue Commissioners, a number of improvements have been made to the administration of the Scheme. For example, beneficiaries are now able to apply for the fuel grant online on the Revenue website through the 'myAccount' feature, and payments are made directly into beneficiaries' accounts.</p></reply>

The period was recently extended from 31 October 2016 on foot of legislative amendment (Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2015) to give property owners certainty in regard to valuations and to remove concerns that LPT liabilities could rise significantly as the property market recovers.</p>  <p>  The 1 May 2013 declared valuation is not affected by any repairs or improvements made to a property or by any general increase or decrease in property prices over the course of the valuation period.  Where structural defects are detected after 1 May 2013 they impact on current valuation and are not retrospective to the 'valuation date'. Therefore there is no basis in law to reduce an LPT valuation during the 'valuation period'. </p>  <p>  In regard to the specific cases mentioned by the Deputy, Revenue has advised me that the original notifications advising the very small number of persons in question of a reduction in their LPT valuations issued in error and were incorrect.  Revenue has also confirmed to me that where mistakes are made or where taxpayers are provided with incorrect information, contact is made with the affected parties as soon as the error comes to light to firstly apologise and to ensure the correct information is quickly provided and clarified as necessary.  It was in this context that the correspondence to which the Deputy refers  issued.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to introduce an exemption from LPT along the lines suggested by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Three barristers and a solicitor are employed as general claims managers.</p>  <p>  The NTMA has advised that the SCA is adequately staffed to meet its claims and litigation management functions and it is also assisted in its litigation management by its external panels of solicitors, located countrywide and an external panel of barristers.  Currently, the SCA has 41 solicitors and 170 barristers on its panels for the clinical and general claim portfolios.</p>  <p>  In April 2014, the SCA s remit was further extended with the delegation to it by Government of the management of personal injury and third-party property damage claims in respect of an additional 61 public bodies, bringing the total number within the SCA s remit from 56 to 117.  Another delegation by Government in June 2015 has further increased the number of public bodies within SCA s remit to 129.  Any increase in staffing levels is in line with the additional responsibilities of the SCA.</p>  <p>  The Agency constantly keeps its legal staffing under review, having regard to the size and demands of the claims portfolio of the SCA. </p></reply>

That said, a number of new entities have also become regulated providers of financial services in that time. </p><p>My Department has the following data available in relation to staff numbers at Irish banks in 2011 and the most recent figures available:<table><tr><th>Bank</th><th>Full Time Equivalent Staff  Dec. 2011</th><th>Latest Figures for Full Time Equivalent Staff</th></tr><tr><td>Bank of Ireland</td><td>13,234</td><td>11,384 (30 June 2015)</td></tr><tr><td>AIB</td><td>14,501</td><td>10,204 (Dec. 2015)</td></tr><tr><td>PTSB*</td><td>2,305 ( as of Dec. 2012)</td><td>2,449 (June 2015)</td></tr></table></p><p>* Permanent TSB staff numbers have fluctuated due to its separation from Irish Life in 2012, as a result the employee numbers presented in the 2011 accounts are not representative of the current Bank structure.  </p><p>In relation to IBRC (in Special Liquidation), there are currently 25 staff remaining in IBRC, all of which are employed in the Republic of Ireland. 1,186 staff were employed by IBRC as at 31/12/2011 including staff in UK, USA and the rest of the world. 895 of these were employed in the Republic of Ireland.</p><p>In relation to Ulster Bank, as published in the Ulster Bank Limited Report of the Directors and Financial Statements of 31 December 2014, the number of staff employed by the Group excluding temporary staff was 5,007.</p><p>It is worth noting in relation to all the above figures that whilst staff numbers have reduced in certain institutions, some of these jobs have been outsourced and overall numbers employed have not suffered the full reduction.</p><p>The Quarterly National Household Survey shows the seasonally adjusted figures for those in employment in the &quot;Financial, Insurance and Real Estate&quot; sector.

It is already the case that an individual or individuals who are gifted or inherit the residence which is their home can, subject to conditions, be completely exempt from CAT in respect of that gift or inheritance. Otherwise, the values of assets transferred, including residential properties, are subject to relief from CAT by reference to a number of life-time tax-free thresholds based on the nature of the relationship between the disponer and the beneficiary and below which CAT does not arise. </p>  <p>  Broadly, the Group A threshold deals with transfers between parents and their children and  currently stands at &euro;280,000, having been increased by me in Budget 2016 from a previous level of &euro;225,000. It is within this category that I would expect that many of the transfers of what is generally being referred to as the family home would arise. The Group B threshold is &euro;30,150 and deals broadly with transfers between other relatives while the Group C threshold deals with transfers in other cases and stands at &euro;15,075. The values of gifts or inheritances received above the various thresholds are subject to CAT at the rate of 33%. </p>  <p>  I have already indicated that I see the change to the Group A tax- free threshold in this year's Budget as the start of a process. Provided, among other factors, that our economic recovery continues, I would intend to examine the scope for further improvements in the tax-free thresholds in the future.</p>  <p>  As regards the cost of a specific tax-free threshold for CAT purposes in respect of the family home, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there is no reliable basis on which to provide such a costing using the data available as no distinction is made between a family home and a non-principal private residence in CAT returns. I have been previously informed by Revenue, however, that a further increase in the Group A tax-free threshold to &euro;500,000 would cost about &euro;74 million in a full year. </p></reply>

These are that a person must:</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p>  <p>  - be without both hands or without both arms;</p>  <p>  - be without one or both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p>  <p>  - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p>  <p>  The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure. Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the repayment of excise on fuel used by members of the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;50.3 million to the Exchequer in 2015, an increase of 3.5% on the 2014 cost. This figure does not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme. In terms of the numbers of claims to the Scheme in 2015, there were 5,263 claims for relief from Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT, and 12,107 claims in respect of the repayment of excise on the fuel element of the Scheme.</p>  <p>  I recognise the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities, and I have managed to maintain the relief at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation. </p>  <p>  I frequently receive correspondence from applicants who do not meet the qualifying criteria but feel that they could benefit from the Scheme, such as is the case in the letter attached. While I am sympathetic to those, such as the person concerned, who do not qualify for Scheme, I cannot, at this time, in the still challenging fiscal environment and given the scale and scope of the Scheme, expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

My Department has received a number of proposals in relation to social housing. While the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is the Department primarily responsible for the formulation and implementation of policy and for the preparation of legislation in relation to housing, Department of Finance officials are working closely with them.  While these proposals are at an early stage of development, a number of meetings were held with officials from both Departments to examine how credit unions can assist in the area of social housing.</p>  <p>  I should point out that any such proposals are subject to the approval of the Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank of Ireland who is the independent regulator for the credit union sector.</p>  <p>  Section 44 of the Credit Union Act, 1997 provides that a credit union may establish a special fund to be used by the credit union for, social, cultural or charitable purposes by a resolution passed by a majority of its members present and voting at a general meeting. Where individual credit unions intend to establish such a fund the Central Bank would expect the credit union to take account of the need to ensure the protection of the funds of its members.</p>  <p>  Commencement of the remaining sections of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 on 1 January 2016 provides the Registrar of Credit Unions with the power to make regulations in relation to investments in projects of a public nature. This is specifically referenced in legislation and therefore such investments could be facilitated by future regulations, where appropriate, when there are specific proposals put forward by the credit union sector. </p>  <p>  Prior to commencement of the legislation, following consultation between the Department of Finance and the Central Bank during the course of discussion on CP88, the Central Bank agreed to a modification in relation to this matter. Regulation 25(2) makes reference to the fact that the Central Bank may prescribe, in accordance with s43 of the Credit Union Act 1997, further classes of investments for credit unions which may include investments in projects of a public nature. The regulation provides that investment in projects of a public nature include, but are not limited to, investments in social housing projects.</p>  <p>  While the Government recognises the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement in this country, the Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is absolutely determined to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.</p></reply>

With regard to off-licences, a separate licence is required to sell spirits, wine, beer, cider or sweets for consumption off the premises. The duty for each licence is &euro;500 and is charged on a flat rate basis. Therefore, the annual licensing cost for a retailer selling wine only is &euro;500 and the costs for a typical off-licence selling wine, spirits and beer is &euro;1,500.  </p><p>A spirit retailer's on-licence, i.e. a pub licence, allows the sale of any type of alcoholic beverage for consumption on or off the premises. As with an off-licence, a pub licence must be renewed annually. Licence duty is based on the annual turnover of the premises, less excluded turnover. Excluded turnover is turnover which is not related to the sale of alcoholic beverages, or turnover arising from the provision of meals. Different rates of licence duty apply depending on the band of turnover applicable to the premises. The following table sets out the pub licence duty rates currently applying to each band of turnover. <table><tr><th>Turnover Band</th><th>Licence Duty</th></tr><tr><td>0-&euro;190,499</td><td>&euro;250</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;190,500-&euro;380,999</td><td>&euro;505</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;381,000-&euro;634,999</td><td>&euro;1,140</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;635,000-&euro;952,499</td><td>&euro;1,775</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;952,500-&euro;1,269,999</td><td>&euro;2,535</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;1,270,000 +</td><td>&euro;3,805</td></tr></table></p><p>Approximately half of all pub licences qualify for the &euro;250 rate of duty.</p><p>I am not convinced that the Deputy's proposal of linking the licence fee to square footage would be practical to implement and I would have concerns that such a proposal may be open to inconsistent application.</p></reply>

The SBCI was launched in February 2015, and commenced lending via its initial on-lending partners, Bank of Ireland and AIB, in March 2015. KfW, the German State promotional bank, provided the SBCI with a funding facility of &euro;150m for the purposes of providing lower-cost longer-term funding to Irish SMEs. The SBCI also has a funding agreement with the EIB for a finance facility of &euro;400m.</p>  <p>  The SBCI has made significant progress since its launch and to the end of December 2015 almost &euro;172 million has been lent to c.4,600 SMEs across Ireland. The loans have been taken up by SMEs for a variety of purposes and across a range of sectors in the economy.  More than 80% of loans were for investment purposes and the average loan size is approximately &euro;37,000.</p></reply>

These estimates are based on the harmonised methodology for calculating output gaps commonly agreed at EU level. It is important to stress that this methodology has several shortcomings when applied to a small open economy and my Department has highlighted these in the past. </p>  <p>  Estimates of the output gap are used in the calculation of the structural budget balance. </p>  <p>  To comply with the balanced budget rule, the fiscal rules require that Ireland must achieve a 0.6pp improvement in the structural balance until the Medium Term budgetary Objective (MTO) is met. Specifically, the minimum annual improvement in the structural balance must be consistent with what is set out in the Commission's matrix of adjustment based on the cyclical position of the economy. Currently the MTO equates to a 0% of GDP structural balance for Ireland, with the possibility this may shortly be loosened to -0.5% of GDP. Further clarification from the European Commission is expected on this in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  Importantly, estimates of the output gap will vary depending on both the level and composition of budgetary packages pursued by the next government. Changes to the annual estimate of the output gap, which are widely recognised as being particularly volatile in an Irish context, will in turn affect the annual pace of structural budgetary adjustment. </p>  <p>  Future taxation and spending plans will need to be framed in the context of achieving a balanced budget in structural terms and accordingly, compliance with spending ceilings imposed by the expenditure benchmark rule.</p>  <p>  As set out in Tables A.8-A.9 of the Budget book, compliance with the expenditure benchmark suggests the availability of fiscal space of &euro;10.9 billion in gross terms over 2017 to 2021. A decision by the next government to pursue a less stringent MTO (of up to -0.5% of GDP) would add an estimated &euro;1-&euro;1.5 billion to this gross fiscal space. However, anticipated spending obligations such as the cost of demographics, the Public Capital Programme and the Lansdowne Road Agreement will have to be met from within this gross spending envelope.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Current Account Switching came into effect on 1 October 2010.  This Code is designed to make the process of switching current accounts easier and quicker and to offer protection and support for consumers when switching bank account.  The Switching Code places obligations and time limits on both the old and new bank when completing the switching process.  This issue is also addressed in the Payment Accounts Directive which was adopted in 2014. My Department is currently working on its transposition. </p><p>The restructuring plans for Bank of Ireland, AIB and PTSB contained certain provisions in relation to customer mobility and public versions of these are available on the EU website. .  The individual banks' adherence to their commitments are independently assessed by monitoring trustees and reported at least every six months to the Commission.  One element of the State Aid approval process is that the Commission has required AIB and PTSB to fund a public awareness campaign to raise awareness and promote customer switching. My Department is currently in the process of preparing a tender competition to meet this commitment.</p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that the EU Commission published a green paper on retail financial services in December which is available at .  The paper seeks views on how to improve choice, transparency and competition in retail financial services to the benefit of European consumers. The Commission is seeking views from interested parties by 18 March 2016. </p><p>As I have previously said, I would strongly encourage prospective borrowers and other consumers of financial services to shop around for the best deal available. In this regard the Competition and Consumer Protection (CCPC) website, www.consumerhelp.ie has very useful information on comparative offerings of financial services. </p></reply>

Autism assistance dogs are primarily trained to act to improve the behaviour of autistic children by promoting calmness and acting as a safety aid.  These dogs act as a constant companion for the child and in certain circumstances can enhance the child's social skills and interaction with their family and peers.</p>  <p>  While the companionship, improved calmness and other such benefits are well testified, it is not clear that a medical basis that would bring such effects under the health legislation exists, and to allow relief for health expenses in this context would inevitably lead to calls for similar treatments, therapies or pet companions in other cases to qualify for relief.  </p></reply>

This may only take place where the total of all funds available for pension benefits, following payment of any lump sum benefit, is less than &euro;20,000 (increased from &euro;15,000 in 2007). The quantum of retirement benefits from all sources must be taken into account for the purposes of calculating the &euro;20,000 limit.</p>  <p>  The level at which pensions can be commuted under the "Trivial Pensions" rule is kept under review by Revenue. However, as one of the principal objectives of any pensions policy is to provide a regular income to persons during the course of their retirement it would not be advisable to allow the commutation of large numbers of pensions under the "Trivial Pensions" rule. For this reason, there are no plans at the moment to increase the level from &euro;20,000.  </p></reply>

They project GDP growth of 6.2 per in 2015 and 4.3 per cent in 2016, with an average growth rate of around 3 per cent for subsequent years. </p>  <p>  The text in the Budget documentation explicitly recognises that outside of Ireland's main export markets the pace of economic expansion has slowed and the outlook has become increasingly uncertain. The text also notes that while the spillover effects to Ireland's main trading partners appear to have been limited to date, a more pronounced impact cannot be ruled out.</p>  <p>  The Budget documentation also included a comprehensive quantitative risk analysis on the impact on the Irish economy and public finances for a range of economic shocks using outputs from the ESRI HERMES macroeconomic model. One of the shocks estimated the impact of a 1 per cent downturn in global output. The results, published in Table 14 of the Economic and Fiscal Outlook chapter, indicate that a permanent one per cent decrease in global output levels would reduce Irish GDP by one per cent relative to the Department's baseline forecasts,   primarily through a reduction in Irish export growth, with an upward impact on the  deficit of one  quarter per cent of GDP. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will already be aware that my Department's forecasts were endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and also, that in its recent Fiscal Assessment Report, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council welcomed the Department's analysis of risks and noted that it represented an important input into discussions around the macroeconomic and fiscal outlook.</p>  <p>  Overall I am confident that these forecasts are realistic, and take due account of risks which are explicitly recognised.</p></reply>

The Council may also apply to the Office of Public Works (OPW) for funding of flood mitigation works under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  The purpose of this scheme is to provide funding to local authorities to undertake minor works to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas.  Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for approved projects that are estimated to cost no more than &euro;500,000.  Details of the Schemes eligibility criteria are published on the OPW website .</p><p>The OPW has responsibility for the maintenance of a number of rivers and channels in this area, including at the Robe and Bulkaun Rivers, in accordance with its statutory obligations under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.

Companies require the freedom to place contracts and develop their operations on a commercial basis, subject of course to Irish and EU legislation.</p>  <p>  The Development Agencies under my remit work closely with their client companies to maximise the wider added value to the Irish economy.  This includes encouraging multinational companies to embed their operations in Ireland and to develop contracts and outsourcing arrangements with other companies located here.</p>  <p>  This policy has been very successful, especially in terms of job creation.  Unfortunately, on occasion, companies may change their arrangements with a consequent negative impact on the Irish economy and to employment.  While these decisions are regrettable, the overwhelming impact of Foreign Direct Investment in Ireland remains positive, as reflected by the record job growth in 2015.</p></reply>

This is at the heart of the Action Plan for Jobs process and has been a central feature of successive Budgets and The Pathways to Work programme.  This level of policy focus has helped create an environment where 135,000 extra people are at work compared to when the first Action Plan for Jobs was launched, all regions are increasing employment and our economy is the fastest growing in the EU.  In the context of the above enterprise and jobs performance it should be noted that one of the first decisions this Government made was to reverse the &euro;1 cut in the national minimum wage implemented by the previous Government.  In the context of the minimum wage, the report from the Low Pay Commission which supported the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations regarding the appropriate rate for the National Minimum Wage (NMW) stated that research indicates that moderate increases in the NMW are unlikely to have a significantly adverse effect on employment.</p><p>The Commission recommended that anomalies in relation to PRSI which could adversely affect employer costs should be addressed, and I believe that the adjustments to PRSI which have been provided for by my colleague, Minister Noonan, in the recent Budget, will assist employers in reducing costs, thus ensuring a continuing positive climate for job creation.</p><p>Budget Documentation available at the following link gives the example (Example 6 page B.22) of an individual earning the minimum wage of &euro;8.65 for a 39 hour week in 2015.  The minimum wage increase will mean an additional &euro;1,014 per annum for this person, taking their gross income to &euro;18,556 in 2016.  Their income tax liability will increase from &euro;208 per annum to &euro;411 per annum due to their additional earnings.  They will have a PRSI liability of &euro;160. USC liability reduces from &euro;374 to &euro;317. The net gain for this person is &euro;708 per annum or 4.2%.</p><p>Due to the budget changes introduced the employer will pay PRSI at 8.5% and not move to the previously higher rate of 10.75% when paying the additional &euro;1,014 per annum.  This reduces the additional PRSI paid by an employer to &euro;86.19 per annum.</p><p>PRSI changes (New PRSI relief of &euro;12 per week for employees and increase in employer threshold).</p><p>Application where someone earns the new NMW of &euro;9.15 per hour (39 hour week = &euro;18,556 per annum).</p><p>The maximum PRSI relief is &euro;12 a week, applied on wages of &euro;352 a week.  So instead of paying &euro;14.08 a week PRSI the person will pay &euro;2.08 a week.</p><p>The PRSI relief is gradually reduced as wages rise to &euro;424 a week - for every &euro;12 rise in weekly wage the relief is reduced by &euro;2.<table><tr><th>Weekly wage - &euro;</th><th>Hourly rate - &euro;</th><th>Old PRSI - &euro;</th><th>Relief</th><th>New PRSI - &euro;</th><th>Old Annual PRSI - &euro;</th><th>New Annual PRSI - &euro;</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>352.00</td><td>9.03</td><td>14.08</td><td>12.00</td><td>2.08</td><td>732.16</td><td>108.16</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>356.85</td><td>9.15</td><td>14.27</td><td>11.19</td><td>3.08</td><td>742.04</td><td>160.16</td><td>NMW</td></tr><tr><td>364.00</td><td>9.33</td><td>14.56</td><td>10.00</td><td>4.56</td><td>757.12</td><td>237.12</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>376.00</td><td>9.64</td><td>15.04</td><td>8.00</td><td>7.04</td><td>782.08</td><td>366.08</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>388.00</td><td>9.95</td><td>15.52</td><td>6.00</td><td>9.52</td><td>807.04</td><td>495.04</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>400.00</td><td>10.26</td><td>16.00</td><td>4.00</td><td>12.00</td><td>832.00</td><td>624.00</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>412.00</td><td>10.56</td><td>16.48</td><td>2.00</td><td>14.48</td><td>856.96</td><td>752.96</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>424.00</td><td>10.87</td><td>16.96</td><td>-</td><td>16.96</td><td>881.92</td><td>881.92</td><td></td></tr></table>Annual PRSI Cost to Employee on new NMW (working 39 hours p.w.) without the proposed change would be &euro;742.04 (&euro;18,556 * 4%), giving a saving of &euro;581.88 even with the new payment of &euro;160.</p><p>Employer impact - increase in threshold for change of rate from 8.5% to 10.75% from &euro;356.01 to &euro;376.01.<table><tr><th><div> </div></th><th>Weekly NMW &euro;</th><th>PRSI rate</th><th>Weekly cost &euro;</th><th>No of weeks</th><th>Annual Cost &euro;</th></tr><tr><td>Increase of rate to &euro;376 before 10.75% applies</td><td>356.85</td><td>8.50%</td><td>30.33</td><td>52</td><td>1,577.28</td></tr><tr><td>Cost to employer prior to Budget change  </td><td>356.85</td><td>10.75%</td><td>38.36</td><td>52</td><td>1,994.79</td></tr><tr><td>Difference</td><td></td><td></td><td>8.03</td><td>52</td><td>417.51</td></tr></table></p><p>Annual PRSI Cost to Employer without the proposed change would be &euro;1,994.79, giving a saving of &euro;417.51.  <i>(There is an additional saving to Employer also for employees earning up to &euro;9.64 per hour/&euro;376 p.w., who previously would have invoked the 10.75% rate - annual saving to the employer of &euro;439.92 for an employee earning &euro;376 per week).</i></p></reply>

They also provide soft supports such as training and mentoring and the LEO staff can advise as to which supports would be most appropriate.</p><p>In 2014, based on the Annual Employment Survey of LEO clients, total direct employment among the 6,058 LEO client companies stood at 31,326 (full- and part-time), an increase of 4,012 jobs in the year. Details of LEO supported jobs by county in 2014 are shown in the following table.  </p><p>Statistics in relation to the number of jobs created last year through support provided by the LEOs are currently being compiled as part of the 2015 Survey of client companies. Figures for 2015, including on an individual LEO basis, will be announced as soon as the results are available. </p><p>As well as existing businesses, the LEOs support entrepreneurs to start a new business; in 2015, 500 start-up companies were supported through the LEOs. </p><p>In addition, any business can use the LEOs to help them to access finance from Micro Finance Ireland (MFI). The LEOs can support enterprises through the MFI application, review and approval processes. In 2015, 207 applications with a total value of &euro;3.2m and with 477 associated jobs, made via the LEOs, were approved by MFI.</p><p>In 2015, the Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur (IBYE) competition, which was run by the LEOs, attracted applications from 1,400 young entrepreneurs. The financial support provided to the 92 winners will lead to job creation in the future. Furthermore, by November 2015, some 1,500 businesses had completed, or were in the process of completing, their trading online projects under the Trading Online Voucher Scheme, which is also run by the LEOs. </p><p><b>LEO Employment 2014 - by NUTS III Region</b><table><tr><th></th><th>LEO</th><th>No of Clients</th><th>Total Jobs 2014</th><th>Total Jobs Growth 2014</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>Cavan</td><td>195</td><td>1,049 </td><td>108 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Donegal</td><td>159</td><td>1,223 </td><td>45 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Leitrim</td><td>126</td><td>388 </td><td>117 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Louth</td><td>197</td><td>656 </td><td>66 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Monaghan</td><td>170</td><td>904 </td><td>61 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Sligo</td><td>202</td><td>1,103 </td><td>73 </td></tr><tr><td>Border</td><td>Border Total</td><td>1,049</td><td>5,323 </td><td>470 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Kildare</td><td>103</td><td>683 </td><td>63 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Meath</td><td>180</td><td>806 </td><td>154 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Wicklow</td><td>97</td><td>572 </td><td>137 </td></tr><tr><td>Mid-East</td><td>Mid-East Total</td><td>380</td><td>2,061 </td><td>354 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Clare</td><td>161</td><td>1,346 </td><td>202 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Tipperary North</td><td>130</td><td>482 </td><td>107 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Limerick</td><td>216</td><td>1,292 </td><td>198 </td></tr><tr><td>Mid-West</td><td>Mid-West Total</td><td>507</td><td>3,120 </td><td>507 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Laois</td><td>85</td><td>384 </td><td>35 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Longford</td><td>222</td><td>899 </td><td>75 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Offaly</td><td>194</td><td>931 </td><td>115 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>WestMeath</td><td>242</td><td>1,284 </td><td>38 </td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td>Midlands Total</td><td>743</td><td>3,498 </td><td>263 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Carlow</td><td>206</td><td>1,152 </td><td>207 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Kilkenny</td><td>243</td><td>1,154 </td><td>196 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Tipperary South</td><td>148</td><td>895 </td><td>62 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Waterford</td><td>300</td><td>1,515 </td><td>152 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Wexford</td><td>170</td><td>1,070 </td><td>210 </td></tr><tr><td>South-East</td><td>South-East Total</td><td>1,067 </td><td>5,786 </td><td>827 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Cork City</td><td>96</td><td>656 </td><td>191 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Cork South</td><td>155 </td><td>785 </td><td>171 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Cork West/North</td><td>215 </td><td>1,277 </td><td>187 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Kerry</td><td>444 </td><td>1,794 </td><td>85 </td></tr><tr><td>South West</td><td>South-West Total</td><td>910 </td><td>4,512 </td><td>634 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Galway County/City</td><td>239 </td><td>882 </td><td>105 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Mayo</td><td>182 </td><td>1,060 </td><td>53 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Roscommon</td><td>141 </td><td>641 </td><td>6 </td></tr><tr><td>West</td><td>West Total</td><td>562 </td><td>2,583 </td><td>164 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Dublin City</td><td>258 </td><td>1,431 </td><td>453 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown</td><td>211 </td><td>1,304 </td><td>156 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Dublin Fingal</td><td>142 </td><td>562 </td><td>126 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Dublin South</td><td>229 </td><td>1,146 </td><td>58 </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>Dublin Total</td><td>840 </td><td>4,443 </td><td>793 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Grand Total</td><td>6,058 </td><td>31,326 </td><td>4,012 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

The amount of fees received by the PIAB during 2015 from claimants was &euro;1,474,842 and from respondents was &euro;10,281,622. Respondents&rsquo; fees are levied when the respondent consents to an assessment being made by the PIAB.  Where both parties accept the assessment, the matter is resolved without recourse to litigation, resulting in legally enforceable awards on a par with the Courts but with a lower administration cost arising.  Section 22 of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 provides me as Minister with the power to impose charges in respect of applications made under the Act. Steps have been taken to reduce the level of fees for claimants and respondents and the level of fees are kept under review.  In late 2010, PIAB recommended a reduction in the fees and this was accepted by the then Minister, and a reduction from &euro;1,050 to &euro;850 for respondents, and from &euro;50 to &euro;45 for claimants, was applied with effect from 1 February 2011.  </p>  <p>  In December 2012, I further reduced the fee to the respondent from &euro;850 to &euro;600 with effect from 1 January 2013, representing a 29% reduction on 2012 levels.</p>  <p>  With the exception of motor insurance which falls under the remit of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Minister for Finance has policy responsibility for insurance. The sector is regulated by the Central Bank.  I have no direct policy responsibility for insurance.</p>  <p>  The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks.  As a matter of course, insurance companies carry out reviews of the risks against which they are prepared to provide insurance and they consider these risks when determining their policies, including insurance premiums.  There are many factors that influence the cost of insurance and some of the more significant factors include the frequency and scale of claims, the cost of claims and the operation of the insurance market.</p>  <p>  I am aware that my colleague Minister Noonan has asked his Departmental officials to examine the factors which contribute to the increasing costs of insurance and this work is part of an overall review of the insurance sector which the Department of Finance are undertaking in consultation with the Central Bank and other Departments and agencies.</p></reply>

It has specific powers conferred on it by the Greyhound Industry (Racing) Regulations 2007, S.I. 302 of 2007, which set out the detailed rules under which greyhound racing is conducted.  The Irish Coursing Club (ICC) is the controlling authority for the breeding and coursing of greyhounds. The ICC is subject to the general control and direction of Bord na gCon under Section 26(2) of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958.</p>  <p>  The Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 specifies standards for greyhound welfare, establishes a register of Greyhound Breeding Establishments and regulates their operation. A code of Practice in the care and welfare of the greyhound has been established and published by Bord na gCon as per the requirements of the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011. The primary objective of the Code of Practice is to set standards and clearly define what is expected of all individuals engaged in the care and management of registered greyhounds. Greyhound welfare at Bord Na gCon is managed by the Welfare Manager.</p>  <p>  I am assured that cases of cruelty and/or neglect which are reported to Bord na gCon are fully investigated and that sanctions under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 are imposed on persons who have been identified as being in breach of the Act. Persons found to have committed offences under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 are liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &euro;5000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both. Persons may also be prosecuted under the Animal Health &amp;amp; Welfare Act 2013. The Act makes it an offence to do, or fail to do anything or cause or permit anything to be done to an animal that causes unnecessary suffering to, or endanger the health or welfare of an animal.  The Act provides for increased levels of penalties - summary conviction up to &euro;5,000 and on indictment &euro;250,000 and/or imprisonment up to 5 years with fixed penalty payments for lesser offences. In addition, both of these Acts contain provisions permitting the imposition of fixed notice administrative sanctions in cases of less serious breaches of the legislation. The number of monthly Welfare and Kennel Inspections carried out by Bord na gCon Welfare Officers may be viewed on Bord na gCon&rsquo;s website and information on the sanctions which have been imposed on persons who, following Bord na gCon investigations, have been identified as being in breach of the of the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 is also published on Bord na gCon&rsquo;s website.   </p></reply>

EU Regulations governing the administration of these schemes require that full and comprehensive administrative checks, including in some cases on farm inspections, be completed before any payments issue. The 2015 Basic Payment Scheme/Areas of Natural Constraint application of the person named was selected for a remote sensing inspection. This inspection resulted in a reduction in the area claimed 19.62HA to a found area of 14.34HA. As the amount of entitlements held by the person named is lower than the amount of area claimed, there was no monetary reduction under the Basic Payment Scheme and payments due issued to the nominated bank account on 17 December 2015.      This inspection resulted in findings of an over-declaration in area of greater than 20% in respect of the Areas of Natural Constraint scheme. Based on the terms and conditions of the scheme this resulted in no payment in respect of that scheme. The person named was informed of this outcome on 18 December 2015.

The Programme was funded through an EU allocation of approximately &euro;42 million and &euro;24 million in Exchequer funding, bringing total funds to approximately &euro;66 million. The Programme ended in December 2015 and funding for the seafood sector is now provided through my Department&rsquo;s new &euro;240 million EMFF Seafood Development Operational Programme, which I formally launched on 14 January 2016.</p><p>The accounts for the EFF Programme are not yet finalised, so I cannot provide the Deputy with a final figure on how much in EU or Exchequer funds were invested and how much was unused at the end of the Programme. Present estimates from my Department suggest that in the region of &euro;2 million in EU funds were unused, giving a drawdown rate of 95%. This would be a very successful outcome for any EU funding programme and will compare very favourably with other Member States. It is worth noting that all of the funds available were awarded to investment projects, but inevitably some do not proceed, while others do not avail of the full amount of funds offered to them. When this happens in the final year of the Programme there is no scope to re-allocate funds to other projects.</p><p>In July 2015, the Irish Salmon Growers Association published its report &lsquo;<i>Potential for Land Based Salmon Growout in Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS) in Ireland)</i>. The report describes in detail all technical aspects of RAS production and system design and operations. It also covers important biological aspects of land based salmon production. The Report states that its main aim is to assess the viability of land based salmon production in RAS under Irish conditions. This includes detailed information of capital expenditure and operational costs as well as the market situation for salmon. The core conclusions of the report are that RAS is a proven technology and has a role to play in the freshwater part of the life cycle of salmon; It is technically possible to produce market size salmon in an RAS system but based on the assumptions in the report, in Ireland, the capital cost of setting up a large scale commercial unit is very high; There are also still technical difficulties to be overcome to achieve reliability in the production of saltwater salmon in land based facilities. </p><p>I understand that the production of this Report cost &euro;8,600 and that this was 100% funded by Bord Iascaigh Mhara through a 2014 call for projects under the Aquaculture Knowledge, Innovation and Technology Scheme.</p><p>I am advised by BIM that it has carefully considered the Report and is not aware of any inaccuracies in the report. Based on BIM&rsquo;s own knowledge of the topic and informed from a number of sources, BIM considers the report to be thorough and that its findings are reasonable.</p><p>I was delighted to publish in December 2015 Ireland&rsquo;s National Strategic Plan for Sustainable Aquaculture Development. That Plan proposes 24 actions to drive the sustainable development of the aquaculture sector and grow production in the sector by 45,000 tonnes by 2023. The Plan targets a 30% increase in production derived from recirculating aquaculture systems. Considerable international developmental effort is being put into determining the commercial viability of land based RAS systems for the large scale production of salmon. There appears to be a market niche for such a product if the current technological challenges associated with an economically viable production system can be overcome. On 14 January 2016, I launched a new Aquaculture <i>'Knowledge Gateway Scheme'</i>as part of my Department's <i>'EMFF Seafood Development Operational Programme'. </i>I have provided BIM with a budget of &euro;8.2 million for that Scheme. In close collaboration with aquaculture enterprises and researchers, the Scheme aims to develop knowledge, innovation and technology in the aquaculture sector to ensure its sustainable development. An important part of the focus of the Scheme will be the applied research and development required into RAS, identified on page 66 of the National Strategic Plan for Sustainable Aquaculture Development.</p></reply>

A total of 14,041 applications were successfully submitted before the deadline.</p>  <p>  My Department has completed its assessment of all applications in line with the requirements set out in the scheme Terms and Conditions and, as I announced earlier today , I am very pleased to say that a further 11,500 farmers will be approved to join GLAS under this tranche. All will have a 1 January commencement date. This brings the total number of farmers in the Scheme to some 38,000 - a record number of entrants to an agri-environment scheme in a single year. The unprecedented level of interest represents a huge endorsement of the new Scheme by Irish farmers and delivers on this Government&rsquo;s commitment to implementing an accessible agri-environment scheme which recognises the critical role played by Irish farmers in protecting and enhancing our natural resources. Formal letters of approval are issuing to successful applicants this week.</p>  <p>  The very high demand for the new Scheme means that priority is being given to what are called Tier 1 and Tier 2 candidates, as required under the Rural Development Programme. Tier 1 and Tier 2 candidates are those who either manage key environmental assets like endangered birds, protected habitats or high-quality water courses, or who have committed to undertake particularly valuable environmental actions like growing feed-crops for wild birds, adopting low-impact tillage techniques or using low-emission slurry spreading methods.  Farmers had been urged to present the highest standard environmental plans under GLAS 2, and to adopt actions that would promote them to Tier 2 or even Tier 1 status and I am delighted that so many have opted to do so. Applications from 7,097 Tier 1 candidates were received and 6,746 of these are being approved immediately, with the balance under review. For Tier 2, a total of 4,198 applications were received and 3,975 of these are being approved immediately, with the balance similarly under review.</p>  <p>  I can also confirm that all GLAS 2 applications from new entrants to farming in 2015, and from new farm partnerships, are being granted priority access under this round, including applications by Tier 3 candidates. These are applicants who had been unable to apply under GLAS 1, for technical reasons, and I am very happy to be able to accommodate these farmers under this round. In terms of the average value of contracts, it is not possible to establis   h this accurately until payment claims are submitted as part of the 2016 Basic Payment Scheme process, and pre-payment validations are completed. </p>  <p>  A further tranche of the Scheme will be launched in the Autumn, and those who were unsuccessful this time round will be free to apply again, or indeed to upgrade their applications to increase their chance of success. The progress to date on GLAS leaves me in no doubt that our total target of 50,000 participants will be met in this third tranche of the Scheme. </p></reply>

The Programme was funded through an EU allocation of approximately &euro;42 million and &euro;24 million in Exchequer funding, bringing total funds to approximately &euro;66 million. The Programme ended in December 2015 and funding for the seafood sector is now provided through my Department&rsquo;s new &euro;240 million EMFF Seafood Development Operational Programme, which I formally launched on 14 January 2016.</p>  <p>  The accounts for the EFF Programme are not yet finalised, so I cannot provide the Deputy with a final figure on how much in EU or Exchequer funds were invested and how much was unused at the end of the Programme. Present estimates from my Department suggest that in the region of &euro;2 million in EU funds were unused, giving a drawdown rate of 95%. This would be a very successful outcome for any EU funding programme and will compare very favourably with other Member States. It is worth noting that all of the funds available were awarded to investment projects, but inevitably some do not proceed, while others do not avail of the full amount of funds offered to them. When this happens in the final year of the Programme there is no scope to re-allocate funds to other projects. </p></reply>

The report describes in detail all technical aspects of RAS production and system design and operations. It also covers important biological aspects of land based salmon production. The Report states that its main aim is to assess the viability of land based salmon production in RAS under Irish conditions. This includes detailed information of capital expenditure and operational costs as well as the market situation for salmon. The core conclusions of the report are that RAS is a proven technology and has a role to play in the freshwater part of the life cycle of salmon. It is technically possible to produce market size salmon in an RAS system but based on the assumptions in the report, in Ireland, the capital cost of setting up a large scale commercial unit is very high. There are also still technical difficulties to be overcome to achieve reliability in the production of saltwater salmon in land based facilities.  I under stand that the production of this Report cost &euro;8,600 and that this was 100% funded by Bord Iascaigh Mhara through a 2014 call for projects under the Aquaculture Knowledge, Innovation and Technology Scheme.</p><p>I am advised by BIM that it has carefully considered the Report and is not aware of any inaccuracies in the report. Based on BIM&rsquo;s own knowledge of the topic and informed from a number of sources, BIM considers the report to be thorough and that its findings are reasonable.</p><p>I was delighted to publish in December 2015 Ireland&rsquo;s National Strategic Plan for Sustainable Aquaculture Development. That Plan proposes 24 actions to drive the sustainable development of the aquaculture sector and grow production in the sector by 45,000 tonnes by 2023. The Plan targets a 30% increase in production derived from recirculating aquaculture systems. Considerable international developmental effort is being put into determining the commercial viability of land based RAS systems for the large scale production of salmon. There appears to be a market niche for such a product if the current technological challenges associated with an economically viable production system can be overcome. On 14 January 2016, I launched a new Aquaculture &lsquo;<i>Knowledge Gateway Scheme&rsquo;</i>as part of my Department&rsquo;s &lsquo;<i>EMFF Seafood Development Operational Programme</i>. I have provided BIM with a budget of &euro;8.2 million for that Scheme. In close collaboration with aquaculture enterprises and researchers, the Scheme aims to develop knowledge, innovation and technology in the aquaculture sector to ensure its sustainable development. An important part of the focus of the Scheme will be the applied research and development required into RAS, identified on page 66 of the National Strategic Plan for Sustainable Aquaculture Development.</p></reply>

Only the EU Commission may propose changes and any such proposal must be adopted under the co-decision process by the EU Parliament and EU Council. Member States, in consultation with the Commission, Member States affected and stakeholders are only permitted to introduce non-discriminatory measures for the conservation and management of fish stocks within the 12 mile zone subject to compliance with policy and procedures set down in CFP Regulation. </p>  <p>  The monitoring and control of fishing vessels within Ireland&rsquo;s Exclusive Fisheries Zone are matters for the Irish control authorities.  Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006, all operational issues of this nature concerning sea fisheries control are, as a matter of law, exclusively for the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) and the Naval Service. As Minister, I am precluded from getting involved in operational matters including in relation to law enforcement.</p>  <p>  In relation to the overall framework for fisheries control in the EU, in October 2009 a new regulation dealing with fisheries controls was adopted. Council Regulation 1224/2009 establishes a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy. Control and inspection is now focused where it is most effective through an approach based on systematic risk analysis. Inspection procedures are standardised and harmonised for all stages in the market chain, including transport and marketing.  The Control Regulations were introduced so that there is a common EU level playing field and to provide for an effective range of controls across EU waters.</p>  <p>  The SFPA and the Naval Service through the Fisheries Monitoring Centre have monitored the movements of these vessels when in our Exclusive Fisheries Zone, using the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), Automatic Identification System (AIS) and declared catches through   Electronic Reporting System (ERS).</p>  <p>  The SFPA is reliant on the seagoing fishery patrol activity of the Naval Service to verify compliance of vessels not landing into Ireland. The Sea Fisheries Protection Authority has advised that pelagic freezer trawler activity in the Irish Exclusive Fisheries Zone decreased significantly over the Christmas period with most of the vessels returning to port in the Netherlands in late December. It advises that several vessels have returned and despite problematic weather conditions the Irish Navy conducted two inspections within this group of vessels late in 2015, and three further inspections this month. It advises that additional inspections will be undertaken as appropriate and practicable.</p></reply>

A combination of higher carcase weight (up 1.9%) and higher factory prices (up 1.5%) meant that output value of the sector increased by over 3%. Total sheepmeat exports increased by an estimated 5% to &euro;230 million between 2014 and 2015. At farm level, prices reached highs not seen in five years and thankfully these strong prices have continued into this year  Sheep farmers will continue to benefit under the same wide range of schemes and supports that are available to farmers in other sectors. This includes, inter alia, the Basic Payments Scheme, which itself took into account payments under the former Grassland Sheep Scheme, and various schemes under the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014 -2020 that have been designed to support the sheep sector. Many sheep farmers continue to be significant beneficiaries from the Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) scheme. The ANC Scheme is worth &euro;195 million annually to some 100,000 farmers and in excess of &euro;1.3 billion over the life time of the RDP. The GLAS scheme in the RDP will also benefit sheep farmers, many of whom qualify for priority Tier 1 access to GLAS as a result of their Priority Environmental Assets, which include Natura land and Commonage.</p>  <p>  Increased provision has been made for improving efficiency and profitability in sheep production under Knowledge Transfer Groups. It is expected that the sheep Knowledge Transfer Groups will commence in the first quarter of 2016. A range of capital supports for sheep farmers is also available under the TAMS II scheme including grant aided support for sheep housing and both mobile and fixed handling equipment for sheep.</p>  <p>  In relation to a further direct payment per ewe, such a coupled payment would generally come from the CAP Pillar 1 direct payments funded by the EU. This would involve cuts in other farm payments as the overall Pillar 1 funding envelope is strictly defined. A nationally-funded payment would raise issues of exchequer funding availability and would also have to pass a strict EU state aid test. Finally, under CAP Pillar 2/RDP, funding is already being provided as outlined already. Any consideration of further funding for the sheep sector under the RDP could only be considered within an overall review of RDP implementation when a full examination is undertaken of the performance of all existing measures and any emerging priorities.</p>  <p>  Growth in the sheep and hill farming sector will come from an increase in consumer demand and export market opportunities as well as from improved technical efficiencies. My Department continues to search for new markets in cooperation with Bord Bia, Irish Embassies abroad and the meat industry. Last year Commissioner Hogan set up the Sheepmeat Reflections Group to examine the sheep sector and the support it needs going forward in order to continue to make an important contribution to agricultural output and to fragile economic areas. Ireland is participating fully in the new group and it is hoped that their deliberations will contribute to ensuring the sustainability of the sector into the future.</p>  <p>  Turning to the possibility of a targeted agri-environmental scheme for the uplands, the possibility of introducing such a scheme or schemes is being considered as part of the proposed new Locally-Led Measure   of my Department , which is being discussed at prese nt with the European Commission. The first of the Locally-Led schemes to be rolled out will be the Burren Programme, for which applications have already been received and work is progressing on other schemes which will be included under the Locally-Led umbrella later in 2016 and 2017. Freshwater pearl mussel catchments, hen harrier habitats and peat uplands have all been identified as candidates for support. Other candidates will emerge from a competitive process which will be announced towards the end of 2016. However, it should be noted that for the most part, the Locally-Led approach provides for relatively small-scale interventions targeting quite specific environmental challenges.

While first and foremost a working fishery harbour, Howth similar to the other five Fishery Harbour Centres, has its own unique features which is home to a broad range of diverse economic and social activities.</p>  <p>  My Department is conscious of the importance of both fishing and non fishing activities in Howth and endeavours to facilitate and develop both.   This involves day to day operational support by Harbour staff and management and development and repair of infrastructure subject to available financial resources.</p>  <p>  I am happy to advise the Deputy that, notwithstanding the prevailing economic environment in which we operate, in excess of &euro;5.9 million has been invested in maintenance, development and upgrading works at Howth FHC as part of my Department&rsquo;s Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme from 2011 to 2015.</p>  <p>  On the 11 of January I announced funding of &euro;1.45 million for the maintenance and development of Howth Fishery Harbour Centre during 2016 , in addition I have set aside &euro;420,000 for safety and maintenance, disability access and contractual commitments accruing from 2015. Significant works in this years programme include the continued upgrading of the electrical system, provision of pontoons to west pier for ferry landings and traffic management works.   </p>  <p>  Of importance in the context of a possible future dredging project at Howth is the allocation of &euro;100,000 for the preparation of a Dumping at Sea Licence which will be required before any dredging project could commence.</p>  <p>  The deputy refers to the report from a &euro;150,000 site investigation project, commissioned in 2015. This report is due shortly and will include vital information on the nature of the material to be dredged in any future dredging project. This information is necessary for the preparation of the Dumping at Sea licence. The groundwork is being undertaken to facilitate a dredging project at Howth, subject to funding being available.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, all developments in the six Fishery Harbour Centres, including a possible future dredging project at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre will be considered under future Capital Programmes on the basis of available exchequer funding and competing priorities.</p></reply>

The Cultaca Flash provides a method of ensuring that the proud heritage of Reserve Defence Force is preserved under the Single Force Concept and should not be regarded as a badge of separation.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the issue of the Cultaca Flash was raised at recent High Level Implementation Group (HLIG) meetings and the minutes of same were forwarded to RDFRA. The issue was also (informally) discussed with the General Secretary of RDFRA on 30 September 2015 at a meeting of the RDFRA Forum.</p>  <p>  Defence Force Regulations clearly distinguish between the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force. The Defence Force Regulations define both entities and therefore, it is prudent to identify both in regard to Dress Code. The dress code, including Flashes serve to avoid ambiguity or misunderstanding and support the single force concept.    </p>  <p>  It is also worthy of mention that Naval Service Reserve (NSR) has  been using a similar Flash for a number of years  and the adoption of the Cultaca Flash for the Army Reserve (AR) element of the RDF will bring the AR into line with their NSR colleagues. </p></reply>

I look forward to receiving the results of the European Commission's review of the Dublin Regulation in March which will assist us in planning how we wish to move forward in relation to a possible revision of the Dublin Regulation.</p>  <p>  In response to the migration crisis and the escalating security situation, there has been an increased focus at European Level in recent months on integrated border management and the reinforcement of Schengen's external borders.  This has followed the reintroduction of internal border controls by a number of Schengen Member States facing unprecedented migratory pressures.  In December 2015, the European Commission presented their third package of measures since May 2015.  This latest package has a clear Schengen focus and includes proposals for a European Border and Coast Guard (building on the existing Schengen border agency FRONTEX) and Systematic Checks at Schengen's External Borders.</p>  <p>  It is important to stress that in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC that Ireland does not take part in the border related aspects of Schengen.  In the circumstances it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on such matters.

A panel consisting of two senior and five junior counsel was established for that purpose. </p><p>I wish to stress the independence of this process.  The cases have all been considered by independent barristers, all selected, on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system to form the Panel to conduct this review.Following their reviews of the papers in each complaint, counsel made recommendations to me, as to whether or not further action should be carried out by me, and if so the nature of that action.  </p><p>Furthermore, I have previously assured Deputies that where further investigation has been recommended by the review then that will occur.  However,  I have also pointed out that in a large proportion of cases, counsel would be likely to recommend that no further action could reasonably be taken, particularly in cases where the complainant has received due process but remains dissatisfied with the outcome.  The crucial point, however, is that every case has been reviewed by independent counsel, who have made an objective recommendation.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>I also appointed a retired judge, Mr Justice Roderick Murphy, to advise on the preparation of letters notifying individuals as to the outcome of the review in their particular cases.  I was concerned that these letters should not only set out the recommendation of counsel, but also outline as far as possible the reasons for the recommendation, subject to any legal constraints there may be.I made this appointment in order to provide complete reassurance on the probity and independence of this entire process, from start to finish. </p><p>I do not see how the publication of the report that the Deputy is referring to, could be seen as having any bearing on the probity and independence of the independent review mechanism. Following the receipt of the report by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Brian Lenihan, the legal advisors of the person concerned were given access to the report and, following consultation with them, it was decided not to publish the report.  In my view, the circumstances have not altered in the interim and I do not propose to publish the report. I can, however, inform the Deputy that the Panel, in considering this particular case, was provided with a copy of the<b></b>report.</p></reply>

This is consistent with the permission granted to the elderly dependent relatives of Irish citizens or others already entitled to live here.  The key financial consideration in respect of a retiree is that the person must have sufficient and sustainable resources to ensure that they will not now or in the future become a burden on the State.  In the case of retirees this was set at an income of &euro;50,000 per person.  They were also expected to have a lump sum sufficient to cater for unforeseen circumstances and sufficient otherwise to purchase some form of dwelling.  </p><p>All States operate immigration controls for well established reasons of public policy, including considerations of an economic natureTo this end policies regarding all non-nationals wishing to enter the State are kept under review and revised from time to time.  I have in this context asked my officials to review current practices and requirements as applied to retirees wishing to come here. This will have regard to the situation in comparable jurisdictions and in particular the opportunities open to Irish retirees seeking residence overseas.

While in the community, a life sentenced prisoner will be on reviewable temporary release under the supervision of the Probation Service.  Reviewable temporary release is where a prisoner is granted a specific period of temporary release from prison.  This can be at varying intervals, for example, weekly, monthly or annually.   The period of release is reviewed when the prisoner reports to prison and a decision is made whether to refuse or grant a further period of reviewable temporary release.</p>  <p>  The Probation Service provide progress reports to the Irish Prison Service outlining resettlement and reintegration progress and will report on any risk management concerns a life sentenced prisoner may present.

The reviewable temporary release is then revoked and the prisoner is taken back into custody.</p>  <p>  On 31 December 2015 there were 331 prisoners in custody serving life sentences.

The use of such returned properties is, accordingly, a matter for the OPW which agreed to make the former station available for the relocation of the Office of the State Pathologist and the Dublin City Mortuary, and to carry out the necessary refurbishment work. </p><p>The primary objective of the Programme was to identify opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p><p>The Programme was based on a review of the Garda Station Network by Garda management which concluded in relation to certain stations, many of which were only open part-time and manned by a single Garda, that resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if those stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.In reaching these conclusions, Garda management reviewed all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.  The Programme supports the provision of a modern 21st century policing service for both urban and rural areas and allows front line Garda&iacute; to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility, and in a more focused fashion, particularly with regard to various targeted police operations.

The process leading to deportation is extensive with many avenues of appeal, including judicial review in the High Court, open to persons subject to Deportation Orders. Therefore not all Deportation Orders issued will have been enforced and so there is no corresponding figure for 'country of deportation to' in the table below for 2015 in respect of those Orders not yet enforced. In addition, many of the people concerned will claim to be from a particular country of origin and be classified as such on our system but will ultimately be determined to originate from another country.</p><p>In determining whether to make a Deportation Order, I must have regard to the factors set out in Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 (Prohibition of Refoulement) of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, as well as any other relevant statutory provisions, Constitutional or international human rights arising.</p><p>This essentially means that the safety of returning a person, or refoulement as it is commonly referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a Deportation Order i.e. that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State where the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.  </p><p>It should be noted that although a Deportation Order may be issued to a person of a certain nationality, that person will have been given the option of leaving the State in advance of the Deportation Order being made Order and moving to another Member State or country other than their country of origin. Such persons are required to notify INIS when they take this course of action but many fail to do so. There are no reliable statistics to indicate how regularly this occurs.</p><p>With regard to the information in the table, a further disaggregation of the numbers by nationality is not provided because I do not wish to risk potential identification of any individuals involved.<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><b>Deportations Signed in 2015 by Nationality</b><table><tr><th>Nationality</th><th><div>Number</div></th></tr><tr><td>China (Including Hong Kong)</td><td><div>109</div></td></tr><tr><td>Pakistan</td><td><div>95</div></td></tr><tr><td>Nigeria</td><td><div>49</div></td></tr><tr><td>Sudan</td><td><div>36</div></td></tr><tr><td>Brazil</td><td><div>33</div></td></tr><tr><td>Afghanistan</td><td><div>28</div></td></tr><tr><td>Albania</td><td><div>23</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mauritius</td><td><div>26</div></td></tr><tr><td>Congo, The Democratic Republic Of The</td><td><div>26</div></td></tr><tr><td>Somalia</td><td><div>26</div></td></tr><tr><td>Zimbabwe</td><td><div>20</div></td></tr><tr><td>Algeria</td><td><div>20</div></td></tr><tr><td>Georgia</td><td><div>19</div></td></tr><tr><td>Iran (Islamic Republic Of)</td><td><div>18</div></td></tr><tr><td>Ukraine</td><td><div>15</div></td></tr><tr><td>Bangladesh</td><td><div>12</div></td></tr><tr><td>India</td><td><div>15</div></td></tr><tr><td>Malaysia</td><td><div>13</div></td></tr><tr><td>Moldova, Republic Of</td><td><div>14</div></td></tr><tr><td>Viet Nam</td><td><div>12</div></td></tr><tr><td>Iraq</td><td><div>11</div></td></tr><tr><td>Palestinian Territory, Occupied</td><td><div>10</div></td></tr><tr><td>Turkey</td><td><div>10</div></td></tr><tr><td>Egypt</td><td><div>9</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mongolia</td><td><div>9</div></td></tr><tr><td>Philippines</td><td><div>9</div></td></tr><tr><td>South Africa</td><td><div>7</div></td></tr><tr><td>Malawi</td><td><div>7</div></td></tr><tr><td>Benin</td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td>Ghana</td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kosovo / UNSCR 1244</td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td>Nepal</td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td>Others</td><td><div>63</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td><div>766</div></td></tr></table></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-01-28a.551.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016012800062#WRM01000"><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the original policy intention announced in September 2014 by the Minister for Education and Skills and myself was to confine the granting of immigration permission to those English language students who were attending schools which had been recognised through the process known as the Accreditation and Coordination of English Language Services (ACELS),  operated by Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI).   However this approach was successfully challenged in the High Court in a case taken by two institutions that did not hold ACELS recognition.  The essential points of the court decision were that QQI lacked the vires to operate ACELS for such a purpose and that restricting immigration permission to the ACELS sector only involved a fettering of Ministerial discretion, particularly given that ACELS was then and remains closed to new applications.  </p>  <p>  When the ILEP was opened for applications, following a revised Government policy statement in May 2015, it was envisaged that colleges could find alternative external quality assurance but such proved to be unavailable.  Since ACELS is closed to new applications, the result is that those providers without ACELS recognition had no means of obtaining quality assurance.  Imposing a condition in respect of external quality assurance,  which would be impossible for some providers to satisfy,  irrespective of any actions they might take as regards enhancing the quality of their institution, would appear to run counter to the law.  The only way of assessing providers therefore was a combination of desktop examination of applications supplemented by inspections in certain cases. </p>  <p>  The fact that a provider and courses are listed on the ILEP means that in accordance with Ireland&rsquo;s student immigration policy, attendance at that college in respect of one of their listed full time courses on the ILEP is an eligible purpose for a non-EEA national coming to Ireland.  That is of course subject to the normal immigration controls and case by case consideration of individual immigration applications.  The ILEP does not guarantee the quality of the institution but if a provider is listed on the ILEP in respect of courses they will have met certain criteria including the mandatory provision of learner protection in respect of enrolled non-EEA students.  For the English language sector a maximum class size of 15 students applies to all ILEP listed providers and they must also have demonstrated that their teaching staff are properly qualified.   </p>  <p>  By its name and nature the Interim List of Eligible Programmes is a short term solution to address a gap in the lead up to the introduction of the International Education Mark which will provide a full quality framework in the future.  It is nevertheless an ongoing process providers and must continue to comply with the stricter conditions now applicable to the sector in order to retain their listings.  This will be the subject of ongoing monitoring.    </p>  <p>  The International Education Mark is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills.  Our respective Departments continue to cooperate closely in the international student area.</p></reply>

The proper officer of the High Court Central Office will then update the register accordingly and sign a certificate of satisfaction.</p>  <p>  If a judgment creditor does not cooperate it is open to the judgment debtor to apply to the court for an order directing another person to sign the satisfaction piece.</p>  <p>  If the judgment was obtained in the District or the Circuit Court, the satisfaction piece is lodged in the office of that court, and the memorandum of satisfaction is signed in that court and then lodged in the High Court Central Office.  </p>  <p>  Sections 86 and 125 of the Personal Insolvency Acts 2012-2015 provide that a debtor who has successfully completed a Debt Settlement Arrangement or a Personal Insolvency Arrangement stands discharged from all unsecured debts specified in that arrangement, and stands discharged from any secured debts to the extent specified in that arrangement. The Acts also provide a simple procedure for confirming successful completion and for registering it on the Insolvency Service register.  </p>  <p>  I can further inform the Deputy that my Department is examining the possibility of providing for a streamlined process to register satisfaction of judgment debts via the Personal Insolvency Acts in the appropriate Court register, to facilitate both debtors and creditors.</p></reply>

The overall funding allocation for Tusla in 2016 is &euro;676 million, representing an increase of &euro;38 million over the 2015 allocation.  This includes &euro;662.4 million in current expenditure and &euro;13.6 million in capital expenditure. </p>  <p>  The overall level of funding that I have provided significantly strengthens Tusla's base funding level and provides the Agency with the necessary investment to increase staffing levels to meet identified risks and anticipated demand.  The additional resources are intended to alleviate service pressures in child welfare and protection services, in particular pressures being faced in the areas of unallocated cases, private residential and foster care and domestic, sexual and gender based violence services. </p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that Tusla deals immediately with emergency cases, including for instance, if a child has been abandoned or is in immediate physical danger or at immediate risk of sexual abuse.  Social work duty teams keep high priority cases under review by regularly checking to ascertain risk to the child, and where necessary will reprioritise the case.   </p>  <p>  My Department has a range of systems in place to ensure it is informed of risk to children and families.  Tusla, within its national office, has a dedicated Quality Assurance Team.  This team produces monthly, quarterly and annual reports in respect of Tusla's functions, and includes detailed reporting on key performance indicators.  These reports give a good indication of the number of children and families in receipt of or requiring intervention.  The reports also provide statistical evidence of improvements to child welfare and protection services and highlights challenges and areas where further improvement is required.  The reports show the number of child welfare and protection referrals in the period, the numbers that have been screened and assessed and those cases that are awaiting an allocated social worker. </p>  <p>  Tusla also provides me with information on children in care, their placement type, care status and allocation of social workers.  Within my Department there is a Unit which scrutinises these reports and briefs me and senior officials on issues of note.  This Unit also reviews and analyses HIQA and Tusla inspection reports of children's residential centres, special care centres, fostering and child protection services.  The overview from these reports provides me with a level of assurance on the overall capacity of Tusla to identify and provide services to families and children at risk.  Additional information is gleaned from the National Review Panel reports on individual cases, and investigations conducted by the Omudsman for Children. </p>  <p>  Additionally, my officials frequently meet with Tusla to review the overall level of service provision, including areas in need of improvement.  I also meet with Tusla on a quarterly basis in this regard.  There are protocols in place for the Agency to inform my Department of specific issues where risks are identified and to ensure that robust management responses are put in place. </p>  <p>  The Government, since its establishment, has attached particular priority to supporting vulnerable children and families and the significant increase in funding being made available to Tusla this year represents further evidence of our delivery on this ambition.  </p></reply>

The most significant programme in terms of State investment is the Early Childhood Care and Education Programme which currently provides free pre-school care and education for children who have reached the age of 3 years and 2 months by 1 September of the relevant year.  From September 2016, I am expanding this Programme to allow children enrol in free pre-school from the time they are 3 years of age and to remain there until they start primary school.  </p>  <p>  As a result of the Budget extension, the number of children benefitting from the Programme is expected to rise from around 67,000 to 127,000 in a given programme year. For the 2016/17 programme year, it is estimated that 89,500 children will be eligible to enrol in the Programme from September 2016, an additional 22,000 from January 2017 and a further 15,500 from April 2017.</p>  <p>  I decided to introduce this new measure from September 2016 in order to provide the early years sector with the time to build capacity to meet the increased demand. As the increased demand for the Programme is not expected to peak until April 2017, this timeframe should allow pre-school providers to make any necessary infrastructural or service changes and to put in place extra staff resources to accommodate the additional demand. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that there is already some additional capacity in the early years sector to cope with some of the increased demand.  The Annual Survey of Early Years Services, which was conducted in December 2014, estimates that there are more than 24,000 vacancies in early years services across the country with almost 13,000 of these vacancies in sessional services.</p>  <p>  I am also aware that every year a significant number of new pre-school providers apply to participate in this Programme. This increased demand for, and additional investment in, free pre-school provision should encourage a greater numbers of applicants.  </p>  <p>  It is clear that more capacity will be required to cater for the expanded free pre-school year programme.  Officials in my Department are working closely with the City and County Childcare Committees and the Voluntary Childcare Organisations to identify measures to help increase capacity. </p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that Budget 2016 has provided an additional &euro;1.1 million in current youth funding to my Department bringing the total allocation for the youth services to &euro;51 million in 2016. This additional funding will be used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services.</p>  <p>  Some &euro;2.75 million in capital funding, also provided in Budget 2016, will be used to support small scale projects, including refurbishment, health and safety fit-outs and accessibility improvements in local youth services.</p>  <p>  Last October, I announced a new &euro;600,000 Youth Employability Initiative, funded under the Dormant Account Funding Scheme. The initiative will provide grants to youth services for innovative programmes that target young people who are not in education, employment or training to improve their employability skills.</p>  <p>  Last December, I was pleased to allocate &euro;1.17 million in &lsquo;once-off&rsquo; funding to assist youth projects that are experiencing budgetary difficulties as they approach the end of the year. The youth projects came to my Department's attention through engagement with the national youth organisations, youth officers in the Education and Training Boards, through representations and submissions received and through regular meetings with youth services in the course of the year. </p>  <p>  These additional investments in the voluntary youth services in 2015 and 2016 have been widely welcomed by youth sector interests. </p></reply>

As of 31 October 2015, there were 6,331 children in the care of the State. Of these 93% were in foster care, with 4,047 in a general foster care and 1,818 in foster care with relatives. </p>  <p>  As the majority of children in care are in foster care family settings in the community, indicators of stability of the placement and participation in education are useful in monitoring the performance of Tusla in relation to overall welfare.

A significant amount of work takes place between social workers and parents/guardians to create a situation where a child can return home with a focus on their welfare and safety. Provisional figures from Tusla show that of the 1,360 children discharged from care in 2014, 83.2% returned home to their families, with the remainder opting for independent living, supported lodgings or remaining with their carers.   Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has a duty to ensure that returning a child to their parent or guardians is both safe and in their best interests. Sadly, this is not always possible.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a high rate of children in care placed in a family setting, with 93% of children in general or relative foster care at the end of October 2015 (5,865/6,331). This is the preferred option for children who cannot live with their parents. According to the Adoption Authority of Ireland Annual Report 2014, there were 24 adoption orders made for children in long term foster care in that year.  </p></reply>

These services for children are currently provided by arrangement with the HSE. </p>  <p>  The provision of resources for medical services is a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE). </p>  <p>  Children in the care of the State can access publicly funded child and adolescent mental health teams and primary care psychology services provided by the HSE. </p>  <p>  Clinical psychology services are directly provided by Tusla within multi-disciplinary teams deployed by the Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service (ACTS). Services provided include assessment and focused interventions for children and young people with complex clinical needs and high risk behaviours. The service also provides support to other professionals in order to guide interventions for children and families. </p>  <p>  Where children have suffered sexual abuse, therapy services are available in a variety of settings. There are specialist sexual abuse Centres at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin and Temple Street Children&rsquo;s University Hospital. Therapy services are also provided by HSE community based psychologists and HSE Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) for children who have moderate to severe mental health problems.  If a child is taken into care as a result of sexual abuse the allocated social worker will provide counselling and support. </p>  <p>  Tusla, also provides funding to voluntary organisations offering a range of counselling and support services to children and families. In 2015, Tusla provided funding of &euro;5.8 million to support counselling services.  The funding provided by Tusla focuses on the development of support services in the community for families to enhance stability in family life and to assist children and families and their members in dealing with difficult periods in their lives. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I announced a significant increase in the funding allocation to Tusla for this year. Tusla has available to it some &euro;676 million in funding, representing an increase of &euro;38 million over 2015.   </p>  <p>  The Government, since its establishment, has attached particular priority to supporting vulnerable children and families and the significant increase in funding being made available to Tusla this year represents further evidence of our delivery on this ambition. </p></reply>

The Bill  completed Second Stage in the Seanad on the 17th December 2015.</p>  <p>  The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill will make it illegal to sell or advertise for sale alcohol at a price below a set minimum price.  Minimum Unit Pricing (MUP) sets a minimum price per gram of alcohol. The minimum price of an alcohol product would be based on the number of grams of alcohol in the product.  MUP is a targeted measure, aimed at those who drink in a harmful and hazardous manner, and designed to prevent the sale of alcohol at very cheap prices. MUP is able to target cheaper alcohol relative to its strength because the minimum price is determined by and is directly proportional to the amount of pure alcohol in the drink.  The MUP is set in the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill at 10c per gram of alcohol, which equates to a minimum price of &euro;1 per standard drink.</p>  <p>  The University of Sheffield study reported that the alcohol products most affected by this policy are those that are currently being sold very cheaply, often below cost prices, in the off-trade, i.e. supermarkets and off-licences. On the other hand, the study found that a ban on below-cost selling (implemented as a ban on selling alcohol for below the cost of duty and Value Added Tax) would have a negligible impact on alcohol consumption or related harms.</p></reply>

Within a number of those mandatory requirements, Member States may determine certain discretionary elements.  The Department recently undertook a public consultation seeking views on those discretionary elements.  Interested parties, including those from the e-cigarette industry, provided their views through this process.  The submissions from the consultation are being analysed and will inform policy decisions. The Department is working to transpose the Directive into national legislation by the May 2016 deadline and the e-cigarette industry will be informed of their obligations under the Directive.</p>  <p>  In relation to e-cigarettes and refill containers, the Directive will:</p>  <p>  - set mandatory safety and quality requirements e.g. on nicotine content, ingredients and devices, as well as refill mechanisms etc., for e-cigarettes;</p>  <p>  - make health warnings and information leaflets obligatory;</p>  <p>  - introduce notification requirements for manufacturers and importers of e-cigarettes; and</p>  <p>  - impose stricter rules on advertising and monitoring of market developments.</p>  <p>  While e-cigarettes do not contain tobacco, they do contain nicotine, a highly addictive substance which is the driver for cigarette smoking. Because they are a relatively recent product, there is limited scientific information available to balance the potential harms and benefits that might arise from more widespread public use. Hence, there are legitimate concerns about the public health benefits of allowing such products to exist without regulation. The Department will continue to monitor evidence on the potential harms and benefits of these products so as to inform decisions around any future additional regulation in this area.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable. It is estimated that in up to 5% of cases it is necessary to wait for further growth to take place, until after 16-18 years of age, before treatment commences.  Patients are assessed by the HSE Orthodontic Service under the modified Index of Treatment Need. Patients with the greatest level of need are provided with treatment by the HSE.</p>  <p>  Following a national procurement process, a panel of independent practitioners will be contracted by the HSE in the coming weeks to provide treatment for certain categories of misalignment. The practitioners will be under contract over the next three years, with consideration of an extension to four years. This initiative will especially focus on those waiting for four years or longer who are generally 16 years and over. The majority of patients to be treated will come from the Dublin area. It is expected that this initiative will have a positive impact on waiting times.</p>  <p>  In addition, a pilot scheme in the Dublin North East area (DNE), which involves up-skilling staff to work as orthodontic therapists is currently underway.  A dental hygienist and a dental nurse qualified as orthodontic therapists in September 2015 and are now working in the HSE under the supervision of specialist orthodontists. The scheme is currently undergoing an evaluation, which includes consideration of how the scheme is affecting waiting lists. Figures are currently being collated and early indications are positive. It is planned to extend the scheme nationally after the evaluation has been completed.</p>  <p>  The case (details supplied) is a service matter and it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.

It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable. It is estimated that in up to 5% of cases it is necessary to wait for further growth to take place, until after 16-18 years of age, before treatment commences.  Patients are assessed by the HSE Orthodontic Service under the modified Index of Treatment Need. Patients with the greatest level of need are provided with treatment by the HSE.</p>  <p>  Following a national procurement process, a panel of independent practitioners will be contracted by the HSE in the coming weeks to provide treatment for certain categories of misalignment. The practitioners will be under contract over the next three years, with consideration of an extension to four years. This initiative will especially focus on those waiting for four years or longer. The majority of patients to be treated will come from the Dublin area. It is expected that this initiative will have a positive impact on waiting times.</p>  <p>  In addition, a pilot scheme in the Dublin North East area (DNE), which involves up-skilling staff to work as orthodontic therapists is currently underway.  A dental hygienist and a dental nurse qualified as orthodontic therapists in September 2015 and are now working in the HSE under the supervision of specialist orthodontists. The scheme is currently undergoing an evaluation, which includes consideration of how the scheme is affecting waiting lists. Figures are currently being collated and early indications are positive. It is planned to extend the scheme nationally after the evaluation has been completed.</p></reply>

In order to lead and direct these efforts, Government has approved a programme of patient safety measures.  These include the strengthening of my Department's patient safety role and functions through the establishment of a National Patient Safety Office (NPSO) within the Department. This would mean that the NPSO would have a broader mandate than envisaged for the Patient Safety Authority in the Programme for Government and would be firmly linked to the existing systems of accountability and performance oversight. My Department is continuing to work towards finalising the design, structure and work plan for the NPSO in 2016.</p></reply>

Future development at the Beaumont site must also be considered in the context of the establishment of hospital groups.  Each hospital group will be required to develop a strategic plan to describe how it will provide more efficient and effective patient services and reorganise its services to provide optimal care to the populations it serves.  The HSE is concentrating on applying the funding available for infrastructure development in the most effective way possible to meet current and future needs.</p>  <p>  As part of its 2015 - 2016 winter capacity planning, Beaumont is extending the Day Hospital at St. Joseph's, Raheny from a 2 day to a 5 day service.  The Day Hospital provides a multi-disciplinary team for frail older people, thus providing an alternative care pathway for these patients, helping them to avoid ED admission.  Rehabilitation and transitional care services are also provided in St. Joseph's, which facilitates earlier discharge from Beaumont and assists in avoiding re-admissions.</p>  <p>  As the specific question raised by the Deputy are matters for the Health Service Executive, I have therefore asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

As an interim step and in advance of a formal licensing regime for public and private hospitals, I propose to bring the private/independent healthcare sector within the remit of the Health Act 2007.  In November 2015, Government gave approval to the drafting of the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill which will include the necessary provisions to extend HIQA&rsquo;s powers to set and monitor standards, and undertake investigations, where necessary, in the private healthcare sector.

The relevant provisions to establish the Individual Health Identifier Register were commenced in September 2015 to allow for Individual Health Identifiers to be assigned to individuals and to establish the related governance structure.  Operational responsibility for the identifier system has been delegated to the HSE as provided for in the Act.  The data to establish the register will leverage the work that is ongoing in supporting the Public Services Card initiative by the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>The HSE are about to launch a public consultation on the privacy impact of the proposed approach to assigning the identifiers.  A Privacy Impact Assessment or PIA involves examining the privacy implications of a project to ensure that personal information is protected and that the project complies with all relevant legislation.  It is envisaged that where the PIA identifies privacy risks it proposes safeguards that should reduce these risks without impacting on what the project is aiming to achieve.  Late last year HSE successfully developed a technical <i>proof of concept</i>for the assigning of the individual health identifiers to its clients and building the register.  The technical and operational environment for managing the identifier system is currently being finalised.  Following the proof of concept it is envisaged that the system will migrate to a full production environment by the end of Q2 2016. When the system is fully operational it will allow the health services to positively identify patients and clients thus underpinning better patient safety.</p><p>It is important to point out that the roll out of a system of health identifiers for patients, professionals and organisations has no linkage with any eligibility for any type of health service or benefit.  It is primarily a patient safety initiative and a fundamental building block for eHealth and ICT developments into the future.</p></reply>

This practice is now said to have been going on for some years, but to have just come to wider attention.</p><p>The Israeli NGO <i>Gisha</i>, which is supported by Ireland, has put a series of questions to the Israeli authorities about the reasoning for the action and what chemicals have been used.  The spraying of any kind of toxin onto crops intended for consumption is a matter of concern, and an issue on which people anywhere tend to be very sensitive.  It is important therefore that Israel discloses fully what it has been doing, and I would urge them to do so.  It would seem likely that any agent sprayed may also have drifted onto fields on the Israeli side of the fence.</p><p>The broader issue of the restrictions on Gaza, including the restricted zone along the fence, remain a significant concern at EU level, and were addressed in the Conclusions of the Foreign Affairs Council on 15 January.</p></reply>

These processes are clearly contrary to international law, and work directly contrary to efforts to secure a lasting peace in the area.</p>  <p>  These views have been expressed in statements at national and EU level, in interventions at UN and other international fora, and directly to the Israeli authorities at all appropriate opportunities, at both political and diplomatic level.  Both Ireland and the EU have asked Israel not to proceed with its planned forcible transfer of Bedouins from the E1 and other nearby areas.</p>  <p>  The Foreign Affairs Council adopted Conclusions on the Middle East at its meeting on 15 January, including expressing the EU&rsquo;s clear opposition to evictions and forced transfers of Bedouins, and the need for a fundamental change of policy by Israel in relation to Area C.  Ireland was instrumental in the adoption of this language.</p>  <p>  I did not visit Israel in December 2015.</p></reply>

Since 2013, 8 new primary schools have opened under the patronage divesting process.  My officials are continuing to work intensively with the main stakeholders to ensure delivery of choice in the other identified areas for 2016 and beyond.  I have stated previously that this process needs to be re-examined to better accommodate parental demand for diversity.  To that end, I have undertaken a round of consultations with most of the principal patron bodies over the last number of weeks with the aim of reinvigorating the process.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Dublin 6W area, my Department officials are engaged with existing school patrons regarding the possibility of school divestment which may impact on the Dublin 6W area.  My officials are working closely with the current patrons on the practicalities of the property issues involved and work is well advanced in this regard.</p>  <p>  Separately, I announced the establishment of 4 new primary schools and 9 new post-primary schools to open in 2017 and 2018, including a new primary school which will open in September 2018 to serve the Dublin South City Centre areas of Dublin 2, 4 and 6, which is adjacent to the Dublin 6W area and which will provide additional capacity.  I also indicated that my Department will keep the demographic data under ongoing review taking into account updated enrolment data and the impact of ongoing and planned expansion of capacity.</p>  <p>  In relation to the schools in the area having commenced offering places for September 2016, the selection and enrolment of pupils in schools is the responsibility of the authorities of the individual school.  My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area.  As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>  <p>  My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld.  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Education and Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year.</p>  <p>  The Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency (EWS) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The EWS may be able to offer assistance and advice on securing a school placement within the pupil's area. The contact details for the EWS is Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency, Floors 2-5 Brunel Building, Heuston South Quarter, Dublin 8 phone 01 7718500.</p></reply>

Accordingly, non-binding Labour Court Recommendations which will result in a pay increase, such as those referred to by the Deputy, are precluded from implementation. This was provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement and continues to be provided for in the Public Service Stability Agreement (Lansdowne Road) 2013-2018.  Following lengthy discussions facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission (LRC) in August 2013 and February 2014, terms of reference were agreed for an internal job evaluation exercise to establish the correct rate of pay for the employees of all grades within the Tyndall National Institute.  The terms of reference covered all staff in the Institute comprehended by the unions' parity claim, including those staff who were the subject of a previous Labour Court recommendation (LCR20577).  The terms of reference provided for an Oversight Committee comprised of management and union representatives to monitor progress and prevent delays.  An appeals process was also agreed between the parties which could be invoked following the conclusion of the evaluation exercise.</p>  <p>  Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC) were appointed to conduct the exercise following a tender process.  The selection was made by a joint panel made up of representatives of the employer and both unions.</p>  <p>  It was also agreed that, following completion of the internal job evaluation exercise, the parties would engage in discussions to seek agreement on the implementation of PwC's recommendations and the outcome of the appeals process. In the event that agreement could not be reached the matter would be referred to the Labour Court and the parties would be bound by the outcome.</p>  <p>  The PwC job evaluation report was presented to the parties in December 2014 and as part of the appeals process, an independent appeal officer has recently heard and reported on 10 appeals by Tyndall staff.  The parties have also recently met under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission and are due to meet again on the 8th February 2016.</p></reply>

In the context of a rapidly increasing school population, my Department's priority is to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place and in this regard, it is sometimes necessary to make use of temporary accommodation in order to meet the accommodation needs of schools.</p>  <p>  However, under the Department's Prefab Replacement Initiatives, in recent years approval was given to 209 primary and 8 post primary schools nationally to replace their rented prefab accommodation (614 units) with permanent accommodation. In excess of &euro;57m has been allocated for these initiatives of which &euro;52.2m has been paid to date.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, as I recently announced, it is my intention to replace all purchased prefabs with permanent accommodation over the lifetime of my Departments new six-year capital programme (2016-2021).</p></reply>

The autonomy already given to schools to manage small scale capital works should be continued. However, it does not appear feasible to extend to schools autonomy over the management of large scale capital works. Given the limited budget available, the need to prioritise spending, the complexity of major multi-million capital projects, and the limited technical expertise of school boards and the need to adhere to public procurement guidelines, it is not clear whether school boards or principals would have the capacity to engage any further with planning and managing capital projects.</p>  <p>  The option of giving schools a capital grant as suggested by the Deputy is not feasible. It would not allow capital spending to be targeted to those schools most in need of capital investment and, in effect, the Government would end up borrowing capital sums that would be held as funds on deposit in many schools where capital expenditure is not required.</p></reply>

A listing on the ILEP also requires providers to have mandatory protection for enrolled learner policies in place and to operate a separate account facility to safeguard student advance payments.  A number of providers were also subject to an on-site inspection by inspection teams comprised of INIS (Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service) officials and education experts as part of the ILEP application process.</p>  <p>  For all providers their listing on the ILEP is contingent on their ongoing compliance with immigration rules and continuing to meet the other conditions required.  Providers will continue to be subject to unannounced inspections, spot checks and other monitoring of compliance.  The implementation of these reforms will help to improve the overall quality of Ireland's offering to international students, promote protection for learners and enhance Ireland's reputation, strongly in line with the goals of Ireland's international education strategy.</p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water shall collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it in accordance with a water charges plan to be approved by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  Section 22(5) of the Act provides that a water charges plan may provide for charges in respect of the provision of a service connection (within the meaning of the Water Services Act 2007) to, or in respect of, a premises. In its decision on Irish Water&rsquo;s Water Charges Plan, published in October 2014, the CER stated that, until it made a decision on Irish Water&rsquo;s new connection charges, Irish Water should continue to apply the rates which were charged by the local authorities at 31 December 2013.  The CER published, in its Water Charges Plan Decision Paper of 5 March 2015, the areas that it would be progressing, which includes the development of Connection Charging Policy.</p>  <p>  Planning authorities were requested in Circular PS 21/2013 issued by my Department on 30 December 2013 to operate revised procedures in relation to the application of development contribution levies. In respect of planning permissions granted prior to 1 January 2014, planning authorities were advised that the full development contribution charge (where such was attached as a condition of the planning permission), including, where relevant, the portion in respect of water services infrastructure, must be paid to the planning authority in accordance with the terms of the permission.</p>  <p>  In respect of planning permissions granted after 1 January 2014, planning authorities were advised that when granting planning permission, they should no longer include a portion in respect of water services infrastructure in any development contribution applied and that such charges would instead be levied by Irish Water. Planning authorities were further advised that new development schemes made after that date should not contain charges in respect of water services infrastructure.</p>  <p>  I am not aware of any non-compliance by planning authorities with the terms of Circular PS 21/ 2013.

Local authorities are obliged to include data on current and long-term development contribution levy debtors in their Annual Financial Statements, and such data were set out for the Deputy in reply to Question 734 of 16 July 2015.

In addition, prior to that, my Department jointly published with the Department of Education, <i>The Provision of Schools and the Planning System - A Code of Practice</i>in August 2008. The Code sets out co-ordinated actions to be taken in relation to forecasting future demand for school places by the Department of Education and Skills and planning for the provision of school sites within the planning system, as well as the efficient handling of planning applications and associated consultations by the relevant planning authorities to expedite school delivery.</p><p>With regard to assessing the implications of local authority development planning on the issue of schools and school provision in a given area, local authorities are obliged under the Code of Practice to take this matter into account in preparing and finalising their plans, working in conjunction with the relevant forward planning and new school sections of the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>Furthermore, section 10(2)(l) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 requires a development plan to include objectives for &ldquo;the provision, or facilitation of the provision, of services for the community including, in particular, schools, cr&egrave;ches and other education and childcare facilities&rdquo;.  This requirement is restated in my Department&rsquo;s 2007 <i>Development Plan Guidelines for Planning Authorities</i>which, together with the Code of Practice, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links:</p><p>Both I and the Minister for Education and Skills are statutory consultees for the purposes of local authority development plans. My Department will continue to work pro-actively with the Department of Education and Skills in ensuring the issue of schools provision is properly addressed both in local authority plans and in assisting the Department of Education and Skills in ensuring that new schools are delivered in a timely and cost-effective manner and in line with the proper planning and sustainable development of the areas in which they are needed.</p><p>In addition, a new <i>Memorandum of Understanding</i>has been agreed between the Department of Education and Skills, the City and County Management Association and my Department in relation to the acquisition of sites for schools by local authorities.</p><p>The Code of Practice is being implemented by local authorities, working in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills. I believe that the Code is working satisfactorily as evidenced by the many development plans and local area plans that have addressed the schools issue more comprehensively than in the past and as facilitated by detailed forecasting on school requirements now available from the Department of Education and Skills.</p></reply>

In this case, it is a matter for Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council to identify the appropriate initiatives to respond to the housing need. This includes consideration by them of options to acquire available properties, as well as building, leasing and the provision of housing supports through the private rental sector.</p><p>The allocation of social housing support to qualified households is, in the first instance, a matter for the local authority concerned, in accordance with its allocation scheme made in accordance with section 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and associated Regulations.</p><p>However, I did issue a Ministerial Direction, under Section 22(17)(a) of the 2009 Act, which applies until 31 January 2016, requiring key local authorities to prioritise homeless and other vulnerable households in the allocation of tenancies under their control. The four Dublin local authorities have been directed to allocate 50% of all available dwellings to such households. I am currently reviewing the operation of the Direction.</p><p>The <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>sets out a strategic framework for meeting the State&rsquo;s social housing needs to the end of the decade.

The <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>sets out clear, measurable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list with flexibility to meet future demand. In total, 110,000 new social housing units are targeted for delivery with 35,000 new units to be delivered and 75,000 households to be supported mainly through the Housing Assistance Payment Scheme.</p><p>The Strategy has been supported by two successive budgets with &euro;1.7 billion allocated to housing. Given the pressing need to recommence a house building programme almost &euro;3 billion in capital funding will be provided in support of the Social Housing Strategy through the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan - <i>Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021</i>.</p><p>Evidence that the Strategy is delivering can be found in the report, <i>Social Housing Output in 2015,</i>which I published on 26 January 2016 and which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <font color="#1F497D">.</font></p><p>As a result of our focused approach in 2015, 13,000 social housing units were provided, representing an 86% increase on the 7,000 units delivered in 2014. I am committed to maintaining the momentum achieved in 2015 and to that end an ambitious target of a further 17,000 units has been set for delivery in 2016.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s <i>Construction 2020 Strategy</i>is aimed at addressing issues in the property and construction sectors and ensuring that any bottlenecks that might impede the sector in meeting residential and non-residential demand are addressed. A number of important measures have been taken aimed at improving housing delivery viability and increasing supply.</p><p>The measures include the introduction of a vacant site levy; reductions in development contributions and a targeted development contribution rebate scheme in Dublin and Cork to encourage large scale developments at affordable prices; revised Part V provisions; initiatives to improve financing; implementation of new apartment guidelines; and legislative amendments to introduce greater flexibility and streamlining to the Strategic Development Zone provisions of the Planning and Development Acts. In addition, NAMA is aiming to deliver 20,000 residential units before the end of 2020, with 90% of these units to be in the greater Dublin area.</p><p>The Government strategy to address housing supply is comprehensive in terms of policy, legislation and funding. The focus for the period ahead will be on securing full implementation.</p></reply>

The Government has adopted a range of support measures designed to meet our binding target, and although good progress towards our target has been made to date, meeting the 16% target remains challenging. </p><p>In the electricity sector, the primary support mechanisms introduced for renewable electricity, are the Alternative Energy Requirement (AER) schemes and the Renewable Energy Feed-In-Tariff (REFIT) schemes. These schemes have proved successful at incentivising the development of the renewable electricity generation capacity necessary to meet our 40% renewable electricity target, and in 2014 SEAI has calculated that 22.7% of electricity demand was met by renewable sources.</p><p>In the heating sector, my Department is working on the introduction of a new Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) to support the deployment of renewable energy in the sector. The primary aim of the RHI is to build on the progress already made in heating and to help reach our 12% target by 2020. In 2014 it is estimated that 6.6% of heat was derived from renewable sources.</p><p>In the transport sector Ireland aims to meet our renewable target mainly through the increased use of sustainable biofuels, with electric vehicles also making a small contribution. In 2014, 5.2% of our energy needs in the transport sector were met from renewable sources. </p><p>The Energy White Paper, <i>Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future</i>, published in December last, sets out a vision for transforming Ireland's fossil-fuel based energy sector into a clean, low carbon system by 2050. Over the coming period the increasing focus of my Department will be on implementation of the range of actions set out in the White Paper that are aimed at meeting our energy and climate change targets. </p></reply>

I have no statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas pipeline network. </p>  <p>  In 2006, the CER approved a Gas Connections Policy which enabled assessment of the feasibility of connecting new towns to the gas network. In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied. </p>  <p>  The policy provides that the construction and operating costs of connecting a town, or group of towns, to the network are recovered through the consumption of gas and the associated network charges. The distance of a town from the gas network is the major factor determining the costs of building a gas pipeline. The anticipated industrial or commercial gas usage in the town largely determines the revenue from gas network charges which must balance the connection costs. Uneconomic gas pipeline projects would unfairly increase energy costs for all gas consumers. </p>  <p>  Under the 2006 network connections policy Gaslink has completed three comprehensive studies to assess nearly 80 towns for connections to the gas network with the result that more than twenty new towns have been connected in recent years, including Cootehill in Co. Cavan. </p>  <p>  As the successor to Gaslink, GNI will continue to review the towns which did not qualify for connection in 2010 as well as other towns. The key factor which would qualify a town or group of towns in any future review would be a significant increase in demand for natural gas, usually as a result of the addition of a new large industrial or commercial facility.</p>  <p>  In 2015 the CER hosted a consultation on a submission received by it from GNI proposing revisions to the existing gas connections policy, as mentioned above. The CER published its decision (CER/15/227) on 30th September 2015 and this is available on its website. </p></reply>

This does not constitute a takeover as, throughout the process, the ultimate owner of the service has continued to be Liberty Global.</p><p>Concurrent with this rebranding, the MMDS (Multipoint Microwave Distribution Systems) service now operated by Virgin Media, which was introduced in Ireland in the early 1990s to provide multi-channel television services on a nationwide basis, is being prepared to be switched off. This switch off is entirely unrelated to the rebranding of UPC Ireland as Virgin Media, but rather results from a Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) decision (D06/13). In accordance with this decision, the spectrum licence granted by ComReg to the MMDS service will no longer be available from 18 April 2016 as the spectrum associated with the MMDS service (in the 2600MHz band) is being reallocated for mobile broadband usage. </p><p>In preparation for the closure of the service, I understand that Virgin Media has been implementing a specific communications programme and, earlier this month, the company wrote directly to all affected MMDS customers advising them of the situation. </p><p>Ultimately, existing MMDS users will need to switch to another television service provider available in their area and, as part of its communications programme, I understand that Virgin Media has provided guidance for their customers in this regard.

In recent years efforts to reposition the industry through an intensive promotional campaign, data acquisition projects and the reworking and modernising of the regulatory and fiscal frameworks have resulted in the highest level ever of extant authorisations with 44 extant licensing options and exploration licences at the beginning of 2016.</p>  <p>  In response to the 2015 Atlantic Margin Licensing Round, 17 companies submitted 43 applications, by far the largest number of applications received in any round held in the Irish offshore. This very positive response is an indication of the building momentum in oil and gas exploration offshore Ireland. While at this stage I cannot comment on the number of Licensing Options that will be granted as a result of the Round, I expect that the first phase of awards resulting from the Round will be made in mid February.</p>  <p>  The tax terms that would apply to any new commercial discoveries are set out in the 2015 Finance Act and the resulting income would be a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  </p></reply>

Prior to that, the Donegal-Dublin service was operated by Loganair. The new contract with Stobart will operate for two years initially and, subject to a satisfactory review after 18 months, it may be extended for an additional year. The contract contains certain performance requirements in relation to cancellations and delays. The number of flights cancelled for reasons directly attributable to the air carrier shall not exceed 2% on an annual basis and the number delayed by more than 30 minutes, again for reasons attributable to the carrier, shall not be more than 20%.  Financial penalties are provided for in the contract for unsatisfactory performance.

In a scheme introduced in 1991, following lengthy consultation with interested parties, mooring discs were issued to all boat owners having a recognised traditional mooring right on the lakes, subject to an overall limit on the number of discs issued.  It is considered that a limit is necessary so as to balance recreational use with the conservation imperative of flora and fauna of the lakes and surrounding areas, and also taking account of obligations under the EU Birds and Habitats Directives. My Department does not permit the casual placing of boats on the lakes on a daily basis, as boats and engines coming from outside the Park carry the risk of spreading invasive alien species such as zebra mussels and various pond weeds.  To facilitate others, persons applying for mooring pegs are placed on a waiting list and any pegs becoming available are allocated to those on the list.  In order to facilitate the short-term accommodation of some of those on the waiting list, they are entered into a lottery each year for one of 22 temporary mooring pegs to use the lakes for one year.  My Department receives numerous requests for mooring spaces but, unfortunately, the demand far exceeds the number of spaces available.</p>  <p>  The 2015 lottery took place last year under the supervision of my officials and local angling club members.  Offers of discs have issued to those persons drawn from the lottery but it is not my Department&rsquo;s policy at the moment to issue letters to unsuccessful applicants.  I am advised that the person referred to by the Deputy was unsuccessful in 2015 and has been automatically entered into this year&rsquo;s draw as a result.</p></reply>

For example, a number of my Department&rsquo;s programmes are delivered through agencies and other intermediary bodies that operate across county boundaries and in respect of which there is no detailed breakdown on a county basis or constituency basis held by my Department.

This restorative work includes remediating subsidence and the general maintenance works necessary to make the walkway safe for the general public.
