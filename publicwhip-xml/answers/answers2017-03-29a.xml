    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-29a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017032900071#WRA00600"><p>The College of Commissioners adopted the European Defence Action Plan on 30 November last.  This </p><p>Commission proposal has yet to go through the wide ranging and extensive EU procedures before any part of it becomes a reality.</p><p>The aim of the Plan is to explore how EU policies and instruments can ensure that the EU&rsquo;s industrial and skills base will be able to deliver required defence capabilities in view of current and future security challenges.  As part of this Plan, the Commission has proposed the creation of a European Defence Fund.</p><p>The purpose of the Defence Fund is to promote research and innovation and contribute to the strengthening of the European defence technology and industrial base, and to further stimulate the development of key defence capabilities.  The Commission has proposed that the fund would have research and capability windows.</p><p>In the <i>research window</i>, it is proposed that &euro;90 million in funding will be made available for collaborative defence research projects over the period 2017-20 in what is known as the &quot;preparatory action&quot;.  The Commission also proposed that, post 2020, a European Defence Research Programme will be established which will require funding of &euro;500 million per annum.  It should be noted that this has yet to be negotiated as part of the post 2020 multiannual financial framework, the negotiation of which has not yet commenced.</p><p>Under the <i>capability window</i>, the establishment of a fund is proposed.  The fund would facilitate Member States in purchasing capability platforms together through the pooling of national contributions, where possible supported by the EU budget.  The Commission estimates that this fund would be in the region of &euro;5 billion per year.  It is important to highlight that this would depend on individual Member States agreeing to initiate joint projects which they would co-fund from national resources.  To date, no such ambition on pooling resources across the union has been realised.</p><p>For certain Member States in the EU, defence is a significant contributor to their economies, representing an EU industry of &euro;100 billion with 1.5 million direct and indirect employees.  Ireland does not have an issue with funding of defence research.  As I have stated previously to the House, for Ireland to have a well-equipped and capability driven Defence Forces we must support the funding of defence research.  Ireland may not have a defence industry but this does not stop Ireland tapping into funding through our well established companies in the dual-use product and technology sectors.  However we will have to look at how these proposals evolve in the context of the next multi-annual financial framework and where Ireland&rsquo;s best interests lie in that regard, particularly in relation to research funding in general. </p><p>I am also satisfied that the proposals in the Action Plan fully acknowledge and reaffirm that Defence remains a Member State prerogative.  Decisions about expenditure, military capabilities, Research and Technology are and remain matters for individual Member States in the first instance.</p></reply>

As a consequence of taking over command we deployed an additional Company of some 150 personnel as part of Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to this mission.</p><p>Ireland has a long and continuous record of contributing to peacekeeping missions.  Participation in these missions demonstrates Ireland&rsquo;s strong support for the role of the United Nations in international peacekeeping.  The current contribution of some 585 personnel to overseas missions reflects the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to our responsibilities in this area.</p><p>The Department of Defence constantly reviews the deployment of Defence Forces personnel overseas.  With regard to any future deployments of Defence Forces personnel overseas, Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>The question of a further deployment of Naval vessels to the Mediterranean is currently under consideration.</p><p>Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas are listed in the tabular statement.<b></b></p><p><b><i>Members of the Permanent Defence Force Serving Overseas</i></b><i></i><b><i>As of 1 March 2017</i></b></p><p><b>1. </b><b><i>UN MISSIONS</i></b></p><p><b>(i) UNIFIL </b>(United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) HQ - 30 </p><p><b>UNIFIL</b>109th Infantry Battalion - 340 </p><p><b>UNIFIL</b>Sector West HQ - 8</p><p><b>(ii) UNTSO </b>(United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation) Israel &amp;amp; Syria - 12 </p><p><b>(iii) MINURSO</b>(United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara) - 3 </p><p><b>(iv) MONUSCO</b>(United Nations Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo - 4</p><p><b>(v) UNDOF </b>(United Nations Disengagement Observer Force) HQ - 1 </p><p><b>UNDOF</b>Staff Appointments (Camp Ziouani) - 5</p><p><b>UNDOF</b>54th Infantry Group (Camp Ziouani) - 130 </p><p><b>TOTAL - 533</b></p><p><b><i>UN MANDATED MISSIONS</i></b></p><p><b>(vi) EUFOR</b>(EU-led Operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina) - 6 </p><p><b>(vii) EUTM Mali</b>(EU-Led Training Mission) - 18 </p><p><b>(viii) KFOR</b>(International Security Presence in Kosovo) HQ - 12 </p><p><b>TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONNEL SERVING WITH UN MISSIONS - 569</b></p><p><b>2. </b><b><i>ORGANISATION FOR SECURITY AND CO-OPERATION IN EUROPE (OSCE)</i></b></p><p>(i) OSCE Mission to Bosnia &amp;amp; Herzegovina - 1 </p><p>(ii) Staff Officer, High Level Planning Group, Vienna - 1 </p><p><b>TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONNEL SERVING WITH OSCE - 2</b></p><p><b>3. </b><b><i>EU MILITARY STAFF</i></b></p><p>Brussels - 4</p><p><b>4. </b><b><i>MILITARY REPRESENTATIVES/ADVISERS/STAFF</i></b></p><p>(i) Military Adviser, Permanent Mission to UN, New York - 1 </p><p>(ii) Military Adviser, Irish Delegation to OSCE, Vienna - 1 </p><p>(iii) Military Representative to EU (Brussels) - 4 </p><p>(iv) Liaison Officer of Ireland, NATO/PfP (Brussels) - 2 </p><p>(v) EU OHQ Operation Althea, Mons, Belgium - 1 </p><p>(vi) Irish Liaison Officer to SHAPE &amp;amp; Military Co-Op Division, Mons, Belgium - 1 </p><p><b>TOTAL NUMBER OF DEFENCE FORCES PERSONNEL SERVING OVERSEAS - 585</b></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-29a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017032900071#WRA01700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 14, 30, 32 and 42 together.</p><p>As I outlined earlier, the Air Corps is not providing fixed wing aircraft for routine operations, on an ongoing basis, outside normal hours.  However, in exceptional circumstances outside of normal hours, the Air Corps can recall personnel, as happened when Rescue 116 went missing.</p><p>The reduction in experienced personnel in the Air Corps has not arisen due to cuts in personnel numbers.  As with other areas of the public service, challenges have arisen in relation to the recruitment and retention of personnel in particular areas of expertise.  The Air Corps has experience retirements of highly experienced personnel and these retirements are outstripping the recruitment and training of replacement personnel.  The loss of experienced personnel is driven by a range of factors, including the availability of attractive job opportunities in the private and commercial semi-state sectors.  The loss of experience personnel has, in turn, impacted the availability of aircraft.  As can be seen from the following table, 12 Air Traffic Controllers have left the service since 2010. </p><p><font color="#333333">I want to assure the House that every effort is being made to address the personnel requirements of the Defence Forces.  In the case of the Air Corps this includes:</font><font color="#333333"> </font></p><p>- Cadets in training,</p><p>- Cadet Recruitment Campaign underway,</p><p>- Four personnel will complete Air Traffic Control training between May and September this year,</p><p>- The Air Corps is currently inducting a further Air Traffic Control Course,</p><p>- NCO vacanci es in the Air Corps will be filled from the recently launched NCO promotion competition and</p><p>- An Air Corps apprentice class was also inducted in March 2017.</p><p>While there are a number of initiatives underway, realistically it will take time for a return to previous levels of capability in the Air Corps as pilots within the system progress to become aircraft commanders and newly qualified cadets become co-pilots.  The approach will be governed by the overarching requirements of safety.</p><p>In the meantime, the Irish Coast Guard search and rescue services can draw on the support of the Air Corps on an &lsquo;as available&rsquo; basis under a Service Level Agreement between the Department of Defence and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the most recent of which has been in place since 2013.</p><p>If requested, and if available, the Air Corps provide Top Cover for the Coast Guard using a CASA fixed-wing maritime patrol aircraft.  Coast Guard helicopters also provide their own Top Cover during Search &amp;amp; Rescue missions.  This will continue to be the case.</p><p>As the Air Corps returns to the previous level of capability, services will continue to be provided on an &ldquo;as available&rdquo; basis.  Availability is dependent on a number of criteria including the availability of suitable aircraft, the availability of flying crews and the suitability of weather conditions.</p><p>With regard to Air Corps cadets in training, 27 cadets will be commissioned and earn their wings between the end of this year and 2020.</p><p>On successful completion of the Air Corps Cadet syllabus, Cadets will be assigned as Pilot Officers in Air Corps Units.  Pilot Officers do not fulfill the role of technicians, fire crew or Air Traffic Controllers.  These roles are performed by other Defence Forces personnel. <table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Total Retirements </th><th>Officer Retirements </th><th>NCO Retirements </th></tr><tr><td>2010 </td><td>6 </td><td>0 </td><td>6 </td></tr><tr><td>2011 </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>2012 </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>2013 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>2014 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>2015 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>2016 </td><td>3 </td><td>2 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>2017 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>12 </td><td>4 </td><td>8 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

In non-crisis situations, the main focus will be on training to prepare for this role.  The White Paper on Defence also noted that members of the RDF continue to play an important role in contributing to state ceremonial events and that the Government values this contribution and decided that it should be assigned as a formal role for the Reserve. </p>  <p>  My Government colleagues and I recognise the important role that the Reserve Defence Force has played in contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s defence capability, and we recognise the voluntary service which has been the hallmark of the Reserve.  The Government appreciates the service of the members of the Reserve and the White Paper on Defence is clear that there is a continued requirement to retain and develop the Reserve. </p>  <p>  Under the current phase of implementation of White Paper actions, two relate specifically to the RDF i.e. attracting recruits from all backgrounds and conducting a skills survey with a view to establishing a Specialist Reserve.  Over the course of the lifespan of the White Paper, other projects relating to the development of the Reserve will be examined and developed by the Defence Organisation.  These include proposals to be brought forward for the operation of a scheme for opportunities for paid service by members of the Reserve.  Recruitment to both the PDF and RDF remains a priority in 2017.  Membership of the RDF is voluntary and unpaid and the quest for recruits must compete with the other organisations within the voluntary sector.  These conditions along with the unique demands of military service make the issue of attracting recruits a challenging one.  In the context of both finite resources and personnel, it is necessary to strike an appropriate balance in terms of PDF and RDF recruitment, so as to deliver the desired effects of maintaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to undertake all roles assigned to it by Government and to advance the single force structure.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated the next RDF recruitment campaign will commence in the second half of 2017.  Until then the RDF will continue to induct from the 2015/2016 panel.  The Defence Forces are reviewing the 2015/2016 RDF competition and as part of this process are examining the competition model to be used in 2017.  I am anxious to accelerate the rate of recruitment to the Reserve within means and resources.   </p>  <p>  With regard to funding, a budget of &euro;2.15m from the Defence vote is allocated to the Reserve with &euro;2.068m of that figure to support paid training of RDF members.  Financial support to the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association (RDFRA) is also included in the budget provision.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-29a.28.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017032900071#WRA02700"><p>I should say at the outset that, as Minister with Responsibility for Defence, I remain open at all times to considering more efficient and effective approaches to provision of Defence services and, whilst I would never rule out the possibility of seeking an independent review of particular aspects of how the Defence Forces is managed and operates, I have no plans, for reasons that I will outline, to have the type of cost-benefit analysis suggested in the Deputy&rsquo;s question undertaken.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I also wish to state, in relation to the reference to a fully staffed Air Corps, that it is acknowledged that, as with other areas of the public service, challenges have arisen in relation to the recruitment and retention of personnel, including pilots and Air Traffic Control staff.  I want to assure the House that there is significant work underway in the Defence Organisation, both civil and military, aimed at improving the capacity of the Air Corps.  This includes work on a range of actions to improve pilot retention, whilst recruitment of new personnel is also taking place.  Actions are also underway to return a full level of Air Traffic Control services to the Air Corps.  Air Traffic Control training is taking place and options to ensure the longer-term sustainability of such services in Baldonnel are being identified. </p>  <p>  As regards resourcing generally, the White Paper on Defence contains a number of commitments in relation to aircraft replacement, including replacement of the Cessna fleet with three larger aircraft, suitably equipped for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance tasks.  The two CASA Maritime Patrol Aircraft will also be replaced, with consideration given to their replacement with larger more capable aircraft.</p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence was approved by Government in 2015 and followed an extensive consultation process and a comprehensive examination of all Defence requirements over a ten year planning horizon.  On this basis, the White Paper set out the various roles assigned by Government to the Defence Forces.  These roles are varied, but include providing for the military defence of the State from armed aggression, provision of aid to the civil power - meaning in practice to assist, when requested, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who have primary responsibility for the internal security of the State, and also to contribute to national resilience through the provision of specified &lsquo;aid to the civil authority&rsquo; supports to lead agencies in response to major emergencies.</p>  <p>  The Air Corps contributes to the fulfilment of these, and indeed to all of the other roles assigned to the Defence Forces, and clearly has and will continue to have a significant contribution to make in this regard, which is also reflective of the need for the Defence Forces to operate jointly.  The various roles assigned are mutually supporting and the capacity of the Defence Forces to undertake these fully has a multiplier effect.  To look at one service in isolation would fail to capture the value that the services provide through joint approaches to the roles assigned.   </p>  <p>  In contributing to meeting the roles assigned to the Defence Forces, it is currently the case that various aspects of the provision of aviation services are out-sourced by the Air Corps, principally in the areas of aircraft maintenance, pilot training and technician training.  The reasons for this are because the cost of in-house provision of such niche expertise and equipment required would be prohibitively expensive in the context of the number of airframes operated by the Air Corps.  Indeed, I understand that this is normal practice internationally. </p>  <p>  My Department and the Defence Forces continue to keep an open mind in relation to the possibility of out-sourcing generally, but it must be acknowledged that there are clearly limits to how far this can go, given the security sensitive nature of many Air Corps&rsquo; operations provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Customs Service which means that an in-house capacity is critical.</p></reply>

Coast Guard helicopters contribute to the provision of maritime search &amp;amp; rescue within the Irish search and rescue region.</p>  <p>  In the past, the Air Corps provided search and rescue services but was withdrawn from this role in 2004 following a handover to CHC Ireland, a private operator.  This decision was taken on account of what has always been the overriding concern of the Government: the safety of mariners and indeed anyone who gets into difficulty where Search &amp;amp; Rescue can respond.</p>  <p>  The Irish Coast Guard search and rescue services can request the support of the Air Corps on an &lsquo;as available&rsquo; basis under a Service Level Agreement between the Department of Defence and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the most recent of which has been in place since 2013.

This is not new and recalls the European Council's call on member States in June 2015 to allocate a sufficient level of expenditure for defence and the need to make the most effective use of resources.</p>  <p>  There is no requirement on Ireland or any other EU member State to achieve any specific target in relation to Defence expenditure, nor is there any agreement at EU level in this regard.  As I am sure the Deputies are aware, the Lisbon Treaty explicitly provides that it is entirely a matter for Ireland, or any other Member State, to determine the nature and volume of its own defence and security expenditure, as well as the nature of its defence capabilities.</p></reply>

It is acknowledged that the occasional temporary closure of the Hollow Road may be an inconvenience for some local residents. </p><p>I have been advised by the military authorities that signage is temporarily erected at either end of the Hollow Road and Brownstown on the day prior to the required closures.

The Government is making every effort, within available resources, to support all those who face hardship.  In addition, there are various schemes in place through the Department of Social Protection, including Family Income Supplement, housing Assistance to support those on low incomes. </p>  <p>  The circumstances surrounding an application for Family Income Supplement, or indeed any other scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection, is a private matter between the applicant and the Department of Social Protection.  I am, therefore, not aware of the eligibility of individual members of the Permanent Defence Force to receive such allowances, or the total numbers of Defence Force members that may be in receipt of this financial support.  Various factors can give rise to such claims.  However, the important thing is that, despite the difficult economic environment we have witnessed over the last few years, the Government has maintained this important safety net for families who by virtue of their particular circumstances require financial support.</p>  <p>  In terms of remuneration going forward, the new Public Service Pay Commission (PSPC), announced by my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, has been tasked with providing objective analysis and advice to the Government on public service remuneration, including the Defence Forces, in the context of the FEMPI Acts 2009 - 2015 and is due to report in the coming months.  Once this report is available, the Government intends to initiate negotiations on a successor to the Lansdowne Road Agreement ahead of Budget 2018 considerations.  Future remuneration of Defence Forces personnel will be dealt with within this process.</p></reply>

In this context, the full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment are available for deployment in response to any emergencies that may arise.  In relation to the Air Corps , it can provide airborne and other supports to the Principal Response Agencies and my Department has put in place Memoranda of Understandings and Service Level Agreements with other government departments and agencies to both ensure the maintenance of essential services and also to capture the wide ranging supports that the Defence Forces can provide in emergency situations.</p>  <p>  While there has been a loss of experienced personnel in the Air Corps, there is significant work underway in the Defence Organisation, both civil and military, aimed at improving the capacity of the Air Corps and it is important to note that in exceptional circumstances, including outside of normal hours, the Air Corps can recall personnel, and deploy.</p>  <p>  The acquisition of new equipment and equipment upgrades for the Defence Forces remains a clear focus for me, and the White Paper on Defence published in 2015 recognises that there are several new and enhanced platforms to be procured.  Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper as part of the capability development and equipment planning processes.</p>  <p>  In the case of the Air Corps, equipment priorities set out in the White Paper recognise that there are a number of new and enhanced platforms to be procured, including the replacement of the Cessna fleet with three larger aircraft suitably equipped for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance tasks, and replacement of the two Casa maritime patrol aircraft.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces keep their operational plans and response capabilities for dealing with a wide range of emergencies under constant review and significant and continuous effort is put into ensuring that they remain up-to-date with regard to best practice.</p>  <p>  On the issue of training, considerable training expertise exists within the Defence Forces and this expertise is continually benchmarked against best international practice.  Where the capability exists, relevant training is delivered in-house by highly trained and knowledgeable training instructors.  Where appropriate, Defence Forces personnel are also sent on relevant external courses, both within Ireland and overseas.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the resources are available to the Defence Forces, to e nable the fulfilment of all roles assigned by Government, including in emergency situations.</p></reply>

Also of significance however, is the fact that the re-organisation has led to an improvement in the deployability and sustainability of the Defence Forces, both at home and overseas.

These may not be awarded in any case unless a recommendation is made through the usual channels to the Chief of Staff, not later than two years in the case of the Military Medal for Gallantry, and not later than four years in the case of the Distinguished Service Medal, after the performance of the act in respect of which the recommendation is made.  Such awards are made on the recommendation of a Military Board appointed by the Chief of Staff for the purpose of examining and reporting on every recommendation for an award.</p>  <p>  The issue of the award of medals to the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion was comprehensively addressed in 1965.  A properly constituted Medals Board considered the various cases presented and made a decision that no medals would be awarded.  The Chief of Staff of the day considered the decision of the Board and was satisfied with the findings.  Subsequently, the question was raised again in a letter to a newly appointed Chief of Staff.  He forwarded the letter to the original Medals Board and asked that they reconvene and review their decision. </p>  <p>  The Board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that they were not prepared to alter their findings.</p>  <p>  The review conducted in 2004 was not conducted by a Board established to consider the award of medals, but for the purpose of a broader examination of the Jadotville case.  This Board of Military Officers recommended that the events of Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Battalion be given recognition.  In this context, in November 2005, a plaque was unveiled in Custume Barracks Athlone to commemorate the events at Jadotville and the very significant contribution of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and of the 35th Battalion, as a whole, to the UN Peace Support Mission in the Congo.</p>  <p>  Further recognition of their contribution over subsequent years was as follows:</p>  <p>A. There was a pre sentation of scrolls in 2006.</p>  <p>B. Portraits of Lt Col McNamee (35th Battalion Commander) and Comdt Quinlan (Company Commander &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company) were commissioned.  On the 23 rd February 2007 these portraits were unveiled at the Military College and now hang in the Congo Room in the United Nations Training School in the Curragh.</p>  <p>C. In July of 2010 the 50th anniversary of the first deployment to the Congo was commemorated in a highly publicised and well attended event in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel.  A Congo photographic book was also produced for the occasion; a section of which was dedicated to the events at Jadotville in 1961.</p>  <p>D. A nominal roll of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, printed in copper, has been affixed to the monument in Costume Barracks and was unveiled as part of the 50th Anniversary of the Jadotville affair in September 2011.</p>  <p>  On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville, I decided to issue a Unit Citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company.  I organised and hosted a ceremony in Custume Barracks, Athlone on Saturday 17 September 2016 at which a Unit Citation was presented to the Company in recognition of their collective heroism and professional performance during the Siege of Jadotville whilst cut-off from support and reinforcements.  During the ceremony I presented a copy of the Citation to each member of the Unit or next-of-kin in the case of deceased members.  This was the first time a Unit Citation was awarded within the Defence Forces and I was delighted to be able to formally recognize the brave actions of these men.  In addition, a specially commissioned insignia will be provided to the members and the next of kin of deceased members of &ldquo;A&rdquo; company in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  These are awards that are used internationally by other militaries to recognise those Units that have served with particular distinction.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the events and happenings to date, in particular the award of a unit citation and specially commissioned Insignia, properly honour the collective bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company.</p></reply>

As I previously advised the House, there have been proposals around for some time, that the EU should establish a joint operational headquarter capacity to support the planning and conduct of its civil and military operations.  A permanent joint civil-military operational headquarters, appropriately configured, could potentially deliver more effective and responsive CSDP operations in support of the UN and international peace and security, a position which Ireland supports drawing together the civil and military aspect of crisis management operations in the comprehensive approach.</p>  <p>  The proposal currently being advanced is the development of civil/military planning and conduct capabilities, coordinated through a joint coordination cell, to improve the EU's capacity to react in a faster, more effective and more seamless manner.  The proposal is to build on existing structures with a view to enhancing civilian-military synergies to support the effective planning and operation of civilian and non-executive military CSDP missions, as part of the EU's Comprehensive Approach.</p>  <p>  In effect this means the creation of a Military Planning and Conduct Capability (MPCC), within the existing EU Military Staff structures in Brussels, which will be responsible at the strategic level for the operational planning and conduct of non-executive military missions working under the political control and strategic guidance direction of the Political and Security Committee.  Non-executive military missions are capacity building, training and advisory missions.   </p>  <p>  This newly created MPCC will work in parallel and in a coordinated way with the Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability (CPCC) supported by a Joint Support Coordination Cell which brings together the civilian and military expertise in key mission support areas.  This will further strengthen and enable effective civilian/military coordination and cooperation in the operational planning and conduct of CSDP civilian and non-executive military missions.</p>  <p>  I do not believe that it represents an increase in or a move towards militarisation of the EU.  The Lisbon Treaty provides that the Common Security and Defence Policy &ldquo;shall provide the Union with an operational capacity drawing on assets, civil and military.  The Union may use them on missions outside the Union for peace-keeping, conflict prevention and strengthening international security in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter.  The performance of these tasks shall be undertaken using the capabilities provided by the Member States&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the issue of having an effective joint planning and operational capacity to support civilian and non-executive military CSDP missions is one which is reasonable, particularly having regard to the EU&rsquo;s comprehensive approach to international crises.</p></reply>

There is a constant through flow of personnel into and out of Custume Barracks and indeed other Barracks.  This is because military service involves personnel moving into and out of particular postings as they serve at home and overseas, receive training and undergo educational and career development courses.</p>  <p>  As has been previously stated at meetings between my officials and local representatives regarding the matter of Custume Barracks, I am committed to the future of the facility as an important, operational military Barracks.  There are no plans to change this.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-29a.93.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017032900072#WRB03700"><p>As part of a major re-organisation of the Defence Forces in 2012, a decision was taken to consolidate what were then three under-strength Army brigades into two full strength brigades.  The decision was taken because it was clear that the three brigade structure was no longer viable, particularly when compared to international norms.</p>  <p>  Key aspects of the re-organisation included the consolidation of under-strength units into a smaller number of full strength units, a reduction in the number of headquarters and the associated re-deployment of personnel from administrative and support functions to operational units.</p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence, which was published in 2015, resulted from a comprehensive examination of Defence requirements over a ten year planning horizon and it specifically provides for the retention of the Army&rsquo;s two Brigade structure.</p>  <p>  The re-organisation has maintained the operational capacity of the Defence Forces to the greatest extent possible within the available resource envelope and has improved the deployability and sustainability of the Defence Forces, both at home and overseas.  There are no plans to return to a three brigade structure which would cause a range of unnecessary inefficiencies, such as an increased administrative burden arising from the need to re-introduce a layer of non-operational middle management, and a return to under-strength units.  </p>  <p>  Given the unique and demanding nature of military life, there is understandably a very high level of turnover among Defence Forces personnel.  However, this is not new and pre-dates the 2012 re-organisation.  The Defence Forces have always had a large turnover of approximately 500 personnel on an annual basis.  Moreover, a certain level of turnover is of course desirable as a human resources and organisational objective in order to maintain an appropriate age profile across the Defence Forces and to retain an approach to regular revitalisation. </p>  <p>  In order to ameliorate the challenges associated with the turnover of personnel, a continuous yearly recruitment drive is operated by the Defence Forces and in 2017 it is planned to recruit 860 personnel across all services.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the Defence Forces operates a scheme of voluntary exit interviewing of personnel of all ranks and from all services to ascertain any potential trends or future challenges.  The reasons provided are many fold and can range from economic factors, to family circumstances, lifestyle, and a desire for a change in career.   </p>  <p>  One of the key policies supporting personnel retention is the opportunity for extensive personal and professional development offered by the Defence Forces through accredited courses, and a unique range of careers.  But it is also the case that the extensive professional training they receive makes them very attractive to the private sector.  It is acknowledged that the resurgence in the private sector jobs market is impacting on the Defence Forces at this time. </p>  <p>  In terms of pay, the position is that the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts of 2009-2015 and the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2018 (Lansdowne Road Agreement) define current pay policy across the public service.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces Climate Survey published in 2016 was conducted in order to inform consideration of the ongoing human resource and strategic needs of the Defence Forces.  The Survey findings clearly point to challenges for the Defence Forces, particularly in the areas of leadership, communication, organisational culture, the working environment and active management of personal expectations.  However, many positives also emanated from the Survey, especially in relation to the commitment of personnel to the values and mission of the Organisation, high levels of work satisfaction, pride in the Organisation and positive views on culture and work support.</p></reply>

The 2015 White Paper on Defence commits to maintaining the strength of the Permanent Defence Forces at 9,500 personnel, comprising of 7,520 Army, 886 Air Corps and 1,094 Naval Service as stated in the 2015 White Paper on Defence.  The strength of the Air Corps on 28 February 2017 stands at 701.</p>  <p>  Recruitment of new personnel is taking place and pilot cadets are in training.  However, it will take time for these cadets, when qualified, to develop their skills and expertise.  As such, a return to previous levels of capability in the Air Corps will be a gradual process as pilots within the system progress to become aircraft commanders and newly qualified cadets become pilots.   </p>  <p>  Actions are also underway to return a full level of air traffic control services to the Air Corps.  Air Traffic Control (ATC) training is taking place and options to ensure the longer-term sustainability of ATC services in Baldonnel are being identified.  These measures will facilitate a gradual extension of operational hours for air traffic control services in Baldonnel over the year, beginning this May, as newly qualified personnel develop their experience and with an anticipated return to full 24/7 service in early 2018. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Air Corps is currently inducting a further Air Traffic Control Course, eight students commenced training on Monday, 27th March 2017, this is in addition to six (6) Air Traffic Services personnel who are part-way through their training.  </p>  <p>  A new NCO promotion competition, to fill the ranks of Sergeants and above, including those in the Air Corps, has been launched.  It is anticipated that promotions from this competition will commence in Quarter 3 2017.</p>  <p>  The 2017 Air Corps Apprenticeship competition is due to commence shortly and it is planned that following this process, 25 new Air Corps apprentices will be inducted in late September 2017 to commence their training.  This is in addition to 11 Air Corps Apprentices who are due to commence their training shortly.</p>  <p>  I have requested the detailed information sought by the Deputy from the Military Authorities and I will revert to the Deputy in due course when this information is available.</p></reply>

The purpose of the scheme is to provide a means for the determination of claims and proposals from the Associations relating to remuneration and conditions of service.  Since 1993, there have been significant developments and improvements in the pay and conditions of military personnel.  The Representative Associations have been to the fore in advancing the interests of their members in this regard, bringing them in line generally with the pay and conditions available in other public service employments.  The Conciliation and Arbitration scheme includes access to an independent adjudication.</p>  <p>  In addition, a framework exists which facilitates the Associations engaging with the official side in talks parallel to those taking place between ICTU and the official side at National level.  This parallel process operated in respect of the 2015 rounds of discussions, facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission, on an extension to the &lsquo;Public Service Agreement 2013 &ndash; 2016&rsquo; leading to the Lansdowne Road Agreement.</p>  <p>  I have received representations from PDFORRA seeking to have access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court made available to them in the event of any future legislative changes being made to provide An Garda Siochana with access to same.

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources.</p><p>It is important to note that all Garda&iacute; have a responsibility in the prevention and detection of criminal activity whether it be in the area of drug offences or otherwise.  I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to pro-actively and resolutely tackle all forms of drug crime in this jurisdiction.  The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau leads out the policing strategy for tackling drugs supply and works closely with dedicated Divisional Drugs units and other national units, including the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs.  This approach allows for the co-ordinated use of Garda resources in tackling all forms of organised crime, including illicit drug activity nationwide.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, some 839 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am also informed that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across the organisation including the Divisional Drugs Units.</p><p>The investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling illicit drug activity.</p><p>The following table below gives a breakdown of the number of Garda members assigned to the Kerry Division Drugs Unit in each of the years 2012 to 28 February 2017, the latest date for which figures are currently available.<div>Kerry Division Drugs Unit</div><table><tr><th><div>Year</div></th><th><div>Strength</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2013</div></td><td><div>8</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2014</div></td><td><div>10</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2015</div></td><td><div>9</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2016</div></td><td><div>7</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2017</div></td><td><div>7</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

This was superseded by the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) which allows for Syrians and other nationalities to benefit from resettlement and relocation schemes, and offers them protection in Ireland in their own right.  This is a much improved programme allowing thousands to benefit from international protection here.  There has been a significant challenge at EU level to maximise the functioning of the resettlement and relocation programmes.  We will be 100% ahead of target on resettlement when the programme ends in September and following my recent visit to Greece, I am satisfied that the number coming in under relocation will scale up to the agreed levels this year.</p>  <p>  I am not of the view that the best solution to this crisis is to increase the number of programmes and all the administrative and legal complexities that go with them.  My emphasis is to increase the number of people arriving in Ireland under the programmes currently in place.  I am satisfied that we are making progress now and that there is still capacity to ensure more Syrians and other vulnerable nationalities who require protection can come to Ireland under our resettlement and relocation programmes and all our focus needs to be on meeting these targets.  In addition, existing avenues remain open as pathways for family reunification.</p>  <p>  Significant resources are currently being invested in these humanitarian efforts through the Offices of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration and the International Protection Office.  As a result, we have established functioning mechanisms and associated expertise to deal with resettlement and relocation.  Our response to the migrant crisis in terms of accepting refugees is through the IRPP and all available resources are being directed to that Programme in order to meet the commitment entered into and I have no plans, at this point, to introduce any additional admission programmes.  It is essential that we continue all our efforts to completing the IRPP successfully before we can look to apply that learning and resources to any new programme.</p></reply>

The CSO publish figures for recorded incidents involving discrimination.  I expect to receive the final figures for 2016 today, which I will make available to the Deputy, but, in the meantime, I can inform the Deputy that up to the end of quarter 3 of 2016, there were 153 recorded incidents with a discrimination motive.   </p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that there are mechanisms in place to deal with hate motivated crime.  Where a criminal offence such as assault, criminal damage or a public order offence is committed against a person based on their race, religion, colour, ethnicity or some other ground, the offence is prosecuted through the wider criminal law.  It is also accepted that such an offence is more serious on account of the hate or prejudice motivating the crime and Irish courts do consider evidence of a crime being motivated by hate or prejudice as an aggravating factor at sentencing.  </p>  <p>  With respect to legislation establishing hate crime as a specific and punishable crime, it is important that any legislation which is introduced will allow for effective prosecution of these type of offences.  I would also remind the Deputy of the second stage debate in this House in October last year with respect to a Criminal Justice (Aggravation by Prejudice) Bill which is a Private Member's Bill introduced by Deputy O'Loughlin and Deputy Murphy O'Connor.  While there was support for the principle of the Bill, there were a number of concerns raised in respect of the approach proposed and the Deputies sponsoring the Bill undertook to further engage in respect of the proposals therein.  I recently received further correspondence from Deputy O'Loughlin in respect of that Bill and I intend to further engage with the Deputies in relation to their proposals.  </p>  <p>  I would also like to draw the attention of the Deputy to the 2016 Annual Report of the EU Fundamental Rights Agency which found that to address racism and xenophobia, EU Member States should ensure that any case of alleged hate crime or hate speech is effectively investigatied, prosecuted and tried.  The Garda Racial Intercultural and Diversity Office (GRIDO) has responsibility for coordinating, monitoring and advising on all aspects of policing Ireland's diverse communities.  GRIDO monitors the reporting and recording of hate and racist crime on a continual basis.  Garda Ethnic Liaison Officers (ELOs) are appointed to work with minority communities at local level throughout the country.  These officers combined with GRIDO play a fundamental role in liaising with minority groups and work in partnership to encourage tolerance, respect and understanding within communities in the pursuit of preventing the commission of hate and racist crime. GRIDO and ELOs provide advice and assistance to victims of hate or racist crime where required or deemed necessary. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration, an Office of my Department, is the focal point for the Government's commitment on anti-racism as a key aspect of integration, diversity management and broader national social policy.  The Office continues to work with all the relevant sectors to further progress the integration and diversity management agenda. </p>  <p>  Following the completion of a review of our approach to the integration of migrants the Migrant Integration Strategy was published on the 7th of February, 2017.  The Integration Strategy includes an anti-racism component and is available at www.integration.ie.</p></reply>

In particular, my concerns stem from the fact that sizeable numbers of the general public have interacted and will interact with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the context of road traffic enforcement, including at a Mandatory Alcohol Testing checkpoint.  As such, it is critical that there is public confidence in the operation and oversight of these vital enforcement systems. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has confirmed that it has put solutions in place to deal with the procedural and practice issues that have been detected to ensure that such errors do not recur.  Specifically, in the case of breath tests/Mandatory Alcohol Testing, I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na initially put in place new paper based recording and verification processes, and, in November 2016, a new specific data recording IT upgrade was installed on the Garda PULSE system.  The net effect of the new IT upgrade was that personnel now have to record the serial number of the device used for each breath test plus the meter reading before and after the checkpoint was concluded.  Data from the device is now used to verify the total number of breath tests conducted at each checkpoint.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner has announced the creation of a dedicated team under newly-appointed Assistant Commissioner Michael O&rsquo;Sullivan to investigate in detail the MATs issue, including with a view to identifying and holding responsible for their actions any Garda members, whether at junior, supervisory or management level, who acted improperly; and committed to forwarding the report of this investigation to the Policing Authority and Department of Justice and Equality when completed.  </p><p>Notwithstanding any internal review, the Government believes that an external investigation into these two specific matters needs be carried out.  The Government believes the level of public concern is now so profound that it may now be time to conduct a thorough, comprehensive and independent root-and-branch review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is clearly a proposal that will require further detailed consideration by the Government.  The Government also believes that any such proposal should command widespread support in the Oireachtas and accordingly be the subject of consultation with the Opposition, and ultimately approval by the Oireachtas. </p><p>Assistant Commissioner Finn outlined new arrangements agreed this week with the Medical Bureau on Roads Safety to the effect that that body would supply An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with its data on breath-testing devices on a quarterly basis, in order to ensure an independent benchmark against which Garda data can be measured.  The MBRS will shortly be tendering for new breath testing equipment.  New equipment which is available in the market place has the capacity to record the time, GPS location and number of persons breath-tested, and has the capacity to download the information automatically reducing the chances of errors occurring in the data.</p><p>The Garda Commissioner has been in direct contact with the Policing Authority in relation to the matters referred to in the Deputy's question and the Chairperson of the Policing Authority, Josephine Feehily, has confirmed that the Authority will have an independent professional audit undertaken of the steps taken to resolve the issues;and oversee the investigation being undertaken by Assistant Commissioner O&rsquo;Sullivan.</p><p>I welcome the fact that the focus of the Authority's next public meeting with the Garda Commissioner will be on road traffic enforcement.  This public meeting will be held on 27 April 2017 and will provide a most timely opportunity for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to engage with the Authority and the general public on these key procedural and practice issues that are now before us.  The reason that I prioritised and set up the Authority was to shine a light on and examine issues such as these.</p><p>I will continue to maintain close contact with the Garda Commissioner and the Chairperson of the Policing Authority in relation to these matters.  <b><font color="#000080"></font></b></p><p>I have requested a report from the Garda authorities in relation to the statistics requested by the Deputy and I will contact the Deputy directly upon receipt of a Garda report.</p></reply>

The most obvious would be as an international student.  The Immigration and Naturalisation Service has comprehensive guidelines on student migration () which clearly set out the circumstances in which a person may take up residence in the State as a student.</p><p>Young persons might also be in full time primary or secondary education in the State as the family member of certain classes of persons who have permission to reside in the State.  It does not follow, however, that such non-nationals residing in the State have an automatic right to access State-supported education, particularly at tertiary level.  For example, the children of a person working in the State on an employment permit may not be able to avail of State-supported university education for his or her children, and will be required to pay international fees.  This is the policy position relating to access to state-supported education by non-EEA nationals generally (young persons recognised as refugees excepted).</p><p>I should add, of course, that policy generally in relation to access to full time education in the State is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills.</p></reply>

The Interdepartmental Working Group issued its report in August 2016 and, in that report, made a number of recommendations.</p>  <p>  The Interdepartmental Working Group's report recommended that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) issue guidance in relation to the use of fixed term contracts beyond normal retirement age.  The Interdepartmental Working Group also recommended that the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) prepare a code of practice under section 42 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 in the context of longer working. </p>  <p>  Following discussions between my Department and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) which arose as a result of the above recommendations, it was agreed that the most appropriate way to offer guidance in this matter to employees and employers would be for IHREC to develop a Code of Practice under section 31 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 in relation to possible age discrimination in the context of retirement.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy can appreciate, it is important that the IHREC and WRC issues set out above be treated in a manner that reflects their complementarity and that there be no duplication of efforts in this regard.  I am advised that IHREC has engaged with the WRC with a view to ensuring that there is no unnecessary overlap between their respective work in this area.  I am informed that it is anticipated that these discussions and the WRC's consultations with stakeholders on the approach to the recommendations for which it is responsible are nearing completion and I look forward to receiving IHREC's proposals for a Code of Practice as soon as IHREC has considered the best approach and completed its own subsequent consultations with stakeholders.</p></reply>

A key element of this framework is the requirement on members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in carrying out their functions in relation to persons in custody, to act with due respect for the personal rights of those persons and their dignity as human persons, and to have regard for the special needs of any of them who may be under a physical or mental disability. </p>  <p>  Part 6 of the Children Act 2001 is specifically concerned with the treatment of child suspects in Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na stations.  It deals with issues including the detention of a child in a Garda station, notification of parents and guardians, contacting a solicitor and where necessary the HSE, and interviewing a child.  The 1987 Regulations also contain provisions governing the treatment of children in Garda custody and these are consistent with the requirements of the 2001 Act. </p>  <p>  A key protection for children is the requirement on the member in charge of the station where the child is in custody to inform an appropriate adult that the child is in custody and to request that adult to attend at the station.  In circumstances where the member in charge is unable to communicate with a parent or guardian, or where the parent or guardian indicates that he or she cannot or will not attend at the station, the child is entitled to have an adult relative or other adult reasonably named by him or her informed that he or she is in custody and be requested to attend at the Garda station.  Failing this, the member in charge must ensure that an appropriate adult, other than a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, attends.</p>  <p>  A child may not be questioned or requested to make a written statement unless he or she is in the presence of a parent, guardian or other appropriate adult. </p>  <p>  There are also specific rules governing searches.  For example, a person in custody cannot be searched by a person, other than a doctor, of the opposite sex.  Where a search involves removal of clothing, other than outer garments, no person of the opposite sex can be present unless either that person is a doctor or the member in charge considers that the presence of that person is necessary by reason of the violent conduct of the person to be searched.  Where a search involves the removal of underclothing, it will normally be carried out by a doctor.</p>  <p>  Every person in custody is provided at the outset with a document explaining the custody processes and setting out the rights of the persons including in relation to:</p>  <p> - legal advice;</p>  <p> - medical treatment;</p>  <p> - telephone calls and personal visits;</p>  <p> - searches; provision of meals;</p>  <p> - the taking of photographs, fingerprints and other bodily samples.</p></reply>

That said, the bank's continued commitment to the Irish market is to be welcomed.  Officals of the bank briefed my officials on this issue last week.</p>  <p>  I understand that employee representatives have been kept informed and that it is hoped that the staff reductions can be achieved on a voluntary basis by agreement.</p>  <p>  The Irish Government has no formal role in the commercial decisions of Ulster Bank, these are a matter for the Board and Management of the Bank and its parent company, RBS.</p>  <p>  That said, I expect that Ulster Bank will do everything that it can to mitigate the impacts of these branch closures on local communities.  I also expect that the bank will ensure that customers are kept informed about developments and provided with the appropriate assistance to move branches, switch to other banks and avail of alternative means of accessing financial services.  I am not aware of any request from the Financial Services Union to meet with me or my officials at this point in time.</p>  <p>  The continued presence of a viable and active Ulster Bank in the Irish market will be important in fostering competition for banking services.  It is vital that businesses and consumers have a range of banking options available when using financial services and accessing credit and that they continually assess their options to ensure that they are getting the best value and service possible.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-29a.219.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017032900074#WRD03600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 94 together.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that as a country, Ireland has invested significantly in building research capacity in strategic areas allied to industry needs.  This includes investment in top quality researchers, physical infrastructure, equipment and structures to commercialise research. </p><p>Investment in research is a key element of overall enterprise policy and seeks to drive innovation and competitiveness in business and the public sector and enable the creation of sustainable jobs.  Higher education institutions are central to the delivery of this ambition.</p><p>In that context, the national IP Protocol &ldquo;Putting public research to work in Ireland&rdquo; was developed by a task group comprised of leaders from industry, the investment community and TTOs in 2012.  The new protocol built on earlier guidelines and codes of practice, using the lessons learned from their use. </p><p>In 2013 the Government established a centralised function with responsibility for technology transfer in the State which led to the creation of Knowledge Transfer Ireland, launched in May 2014.  Knowledge Transfer Ireland (KTI) now has responsibility for setting direction for research performing organisations (RPOs) best practice to enable compliance with IP policy and procedures.</p><p>The publication of the national IP protocol in 2012, and its subsequent refresh in 2016, sought to establish policy and guidelines on the interactions between industry and Ireland&rsquo;s Higher Education Institutes, including the treatment of intellectual property.  It provides guidelines and sets expectations for the RPOs and for industry.</p><p>The national IP Protocol 2016 comprises two volumes:</p><p>- the National IP Protocol policy document which sets out the framework underpinning research collaboration and access to intellectual property from state-funded research</p><p>- the IP Protocol Resource Guide which provides an overview of the national IP management guidelines and links to resources and template documents, available for industry and RPOs.  It also provides an overview of the knowledge transfer structures in Ireland and the kinds of agreements that can be used to formalise research-industry engagements.</p><p>The protocol explains the National IP Management Requirements and requires that RPOs have in place and operate internal IP management systems that meet or exceed these.  The protocol also includes &ldquo;good practice&rdquo; that will normally be followed.  However, industry and RPOs are free to adopt a different approach where this is in the best interests of successful relationships and research commercialisation.  Practices are also highlighted that may be followed if industry/RPOs choose to do so.</p><p>The IP Protocol is a key reference source for Ireland&rsquo;s HEIs and research funders.  HEIs have developed IP policies that are in line with national guidelines and good practice.  These will include policy on spin-out formation.  The detail of policies will differ amongst institutions. </p><p>The research funding agencies for the publicly funded research system all require that the higher education institutions own the intellectual property arising from research projects that they fund.  Each University and IoT has a set of policies that cover how they will govern the use of that IP.</p><p>The national IP Protocol explains that commercialisation may benefit HEIs and provide incentives to the researchers involved in creating IP.  IP may include protectable IP and know-how.  Furthermore, the national IP management requirements make provision for HEIs to have in place a system for sharing of income from commercialising within the organisation, including with relevant researchers.</p><p>It is international practice that researchers may hold shares in spin-out companies.  The national IP Protocol makes it clear that HEIs should have policies and procedures in place that minimise or manage potential or actual conflicts of interest concerning the commercialisation of IP.</p><p>The IP Protocol (National IP Management Requirements) refers to conflict of interest as it applies to commercialisation of IP.  </p><p>The national IP Protocol is clear on the policy and processes to identify, protect and commercialise IP that arises in HEIs.  This includes guidance on licensing of IP.  A suite of Model Agreements, available for use if HEIs and companies choose, covering a range of IP licensing scenarios is available on the KTI website.</p><p>In addition, all HEIs are requested yearly as part of their governance statements to state that a code of conduct for Governing Body members and a Code of Conduct for Employees has been adopted and is being monitored.  Guidelines for these codes are included in the IOT and University Codes of Governance (section 3.2).</p><p>The University Code of Governance has been implemented since 2007 and was updated in 2012.  A copy of the code is available here:</p><p>The Institutes of Technology Code of Governance published in 2012 replaces an earlier document published in 2003.  A copy of the code is available here:</p><p>At institutional level, the Code of Conduct for employees and members of governing authorises would include statements related to conflict of interest and outside employment. </p><p>In addition to the national framework set out in the IP Protocol, each of the research funding bodies has contracts and agreements which set out the requirements on HEIs, including in relation to knowledge transfer.</p><p>As I have previously indicated to the Deputy, I have not been informed of occasions where breaches of policy have occurred.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, a review is underway in Waterford Institute of Technology.  The purpose of the review is to establish if the institution's interests have been appropriately represented and protected, that all relevant policies, protocols and procedures have been complied with and satisfactory governance processes have been applied.  Once finalised this review will be presented to the Governing Body.</p></reply>

The YEI allocation for Ireland of &euro;68m is matched by equal amounts from our ESF allocation and from the Exchequer, giving an overall allocation of &euro;204m.  </p>  <p>  The ESF Regulations provide for initial pre-financing/advances of EU support at 1% (or 1.5% for Member States under financial assistance in 2014 and 2015) of the full programme support, payable for each year from 2014 to 2016, together with annual pre-financing of between 2% and 3% payable from 2016 to 2023.  In May 2015 an amendment to the relevant EU Regulations resulted in an unprecedented increase in the YEI advances to be paid to Member States.  The Commission subsequently released pre-financing payments from the dedicated YEI budget line, worth 30% of the YEI budget, to provide additional financial liquidity to support YEI implementation.  However, the relevant Regulations specified that where a Member State did not submit an interim payment application by 23 May 2016 for at least 50% of the additional pre-financing amount, that the Member State must reimburse the Commission the total YEI pre-financing contribution.  The ESF regulations also provide that annual pre-financing for any year in which an interim payment application is not made in that year must also be reimbursed.</p>  <p>  As work on the designation of the relevant ESF authorities, including the provision of a national computerised accounting and information system for EU funds to meet the 2014-2020 functionality requirements is continuing, Ireland did not comply with the requirement to submit an interim YEI payment application by the due date.  Accordingly, &euro;19.8m additional pre-financing received was reimbursed to the Commission.  Furthermore, as there was no ESF application made in 2016, the &euro;11.6m annual pre-financing for 2016, including &euro;1.36m for the YEI, will be offset against the 2017 pre-financing due. </p>  <p>   The reimbursement of these amounts has not resulted in any loss of EU monies to the Exchequer.  The YEI funding is available for drawdown before the end of 2018 and while a claim for funding has not been made to date it is expected that the funding will be fully drawn down.  The ESF Managing Authority and the Operational Programme Monitoring Committee (PMC) maintain an ongoing overview of the funding allocations under the PEIL and will re-allocate the available funding as required, in accordance with the EU Regulatory provisions.  The PMC has agreed in principle to the inclusion of the Community Training Centres, which are funded by the ETBs in consultation with SOLAS, as an approved activity under the YEI with effect from 1 January 2017.  The other actions originally selected for YEI funding, are the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance; JobBridge; JobsPlus Incentive Scheme; T&uacute;s; Youthreach, Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme and Momentum.  As the activities concerned are fully funded up-front by the Exchequer there is no resulting reduction or delay in the funding available to those activities.</p></reply>

Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. </p>  <p>  No school, including the school to which the Deputy has referred, will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model.  In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year. </p>  <p>  For the introduction of the new allocation model, from September 2017, the NCSE &lsquo;Low Incidence&rsquo; allocations which had been made for each school during the preceding 2016/17 school year, have been used to establish the complex needs component of the new model for each school.  This has ensured that the most up to date data on the distribution of pupils in this category accross the school system has been used.</p>  <p>  No allocation made for such pupils by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. </p>  <p>  An additional 900 teaching posts have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011. </p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1000 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model.  Supports for children with special educational needs is a key priority for this Government.  The new funding will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils, including pupils who have yet to enrol in their school, who require such support. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular school referred to by the Deputy in his question, this school had a General Allocation Model allocation of 50 hours for the 2016/17 school year, which combined with 30.18 resource teaching hours allocated to the school by the National Council for Special Education, gave a total allocation to the school of 80.18 additional teaching hours for the 2016/17 school year.</p>  <p>  As the profiled allocation for the school did not indicate an increased allocation requirement for the school for 2017/18, the school has maintained its existing level of allocation.</p>  <p>  The special education teaching allocation for this school for 2017/18 is 80.18 hours.</p>  <p>  There has therefore been no reduction to the special education teaching allocation for this school.</p>  <p>  Schools must notify the Department on Form S.E.T.Cluster 2017, Appendix D of the primary Staffing Schedule, of their clustering arrangements for their new Special Education allocation. </p>  <p>  Completed forms should be returned to the Department&rsquo;s Primary Teacher Allocations Section as soon as possible but no later than close of business on 30th March 2017. </p>  <p>  S.E.T. hours that are clustered into new full-time permanent posts and received before this deadline will be automatically approved by the Department.  Schools that do not return the completed form within the above timeframe or where all of a school&rsquo;s S.E.T hours are not clustered into full-time posts will be included, as appropriate, in the Department led clustering process. </p>  <p>  Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs are also being prepared and will be published shortly.</p>  <p>  The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs.

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  If the parents of the child, the subject of this question, have specific concerns about his educational progress I would advise in the first instance that they speak to the Principal of the school with a view to raising these concerns with the assigned psychologist.</p></reply>

My Department will keep the position under review, through closely monitoring the supply of housing generally and the options housing providers use for delivering on their Part V obligations.</p>  <p>  With regard to delivery of units under Part V to date, it should be noted that Part V applies only to developments of 10 or more houses, and therefore does not apply to one-off houses or schemes of 9 or fewer houses.  It should also be noted that the provision of land rather than houses remains the default position if the developer wishes to exercise that option.  In addition, some developments completed in 2015 and 2016 may have been subject to older Part V agreements made before 1 September 2015, when other options - such as a financial contribution, the provision of fully or partially serviced sites or the provision of land elsewhere in the functional area of the planning authority - were available.</p></reply>

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme.  To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least 1 year. </p><p>The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the Scheme is determined by the relevant housing authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014.  In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, housing authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. </p><p>In order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme, it is essential that an applicant&rsquo;s income is of a long-term and sustainable nature.  This is necessary to ensure that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p><p>In line with the commitment given in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government,</i>and reaffirmed in the <i>Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness,</i>a review of the first 12 months of the scheme&rsquo;s operation is currently being undertaken by my Department.

The proposals seek to ensure that:</p><p>- There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;</p><p>- There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;</p><p>- Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and</p><p>- The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.</p><p>The Deputy may be interested to note that people who previously benefitted from the now-closed Motorised Transport Grant, may, if they satisfy the criteria under that scheme, be eligible for tax relief under the Drivers and Passengers with Disabilities Tax Relief Scheme.  This scheme is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Finance and is operated by the Revenue Commissioners.  Details of the scheme can be found on www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  A financial assessment is carried out by the HSE to determine how much a participant in the Scheme will contribute to the cost of their care.  The Programme for a Partnership Government has committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms. </p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies, including the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  This work is currently underway.  Once all of the relevant Review recommendations have been considered, any amendments required to the Scheme will be identified.  Changes which require legislative implementation will be addressed collectively, and it is important to remember that the NHSS is largely underpinned by primary legislation.</p></reply>

A report published in December 2016, which HIQA undertook at the request of the Department of Health, shows how much services have improved for the women using maternity services at the hospital. The extent of progress in patient safety measures in Portlaoise maternity services demonstrates the commitment of the staff and the leadership team at Portlaoise Hospital and the team at Hospital Group level.</p>  <p>  Reports on Portlaoise Hospital in recent years point to the need for reconfiguration of some services to ensure that patients are treated in the most appropriate setting by specialist staff that can safely meet their needs. The HSE has submitted a draft Action Plan to my Department and it is currently being reviewed in detail.</p>  <p>  The most important issue in relation to any changes at Portlaoise Hospital is that patient safety and good quality outcomes must come first.  Any changes to services at Portlaoise, once approved, will be undertaken in a planned and orderly manner to further improve services for patients at the hospital and will take account of existing patient flows and demands in other hospitals, as well as the need to develop particular services at Portlaoise in the context of the overall service configuration in the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.</p></reply>

This declined to 68 admissions in 2016, out of a total of 380 admissions of child and adolescents, despite increasing demands overall.  The number of  admissions  does not necessarily equate to the actual number of children involved, as an individual child may be admitted on more than one occasion in any given year.  There has to be some operational flexibility surrounding emergency placements in Adult Units, particularly where very short-term placements occur,  and where full account is taken of all relevant factors such as the preferences of all those involved, or geographical factors relating to access or visiting.  The HSE closely monitors on a weekly basis all child admissions to adult units, with a view to minimising these.</p>  <p>  Additional resources over recent years means that we now have 67 CAMHS teams, and 3 Paediatric Liason Teams, supported by 66 operational CAMHS beds across the country.  A lack of funding for the mental health care programme is not a difficulty at present for the HSE, but there are acknowledged staff recruitment and retention difficulties across the health care system, including CAMHS, that the Executive is addressing.  A new Standard Operating Procedure introduced in June 2015 has provided greater clarity and consistency on how this specialist mental health service for children should be delivered nationally.  Despite increasing demands overall on CAMHS, irrespective of the source of referrals, individual cases professionally assessed as requiring urgent access to services receive priority.</p>  <p>  The HSE Service Plan 2017 provides for further development of the CAMHS service, including better out-of-hours liaison and seven-day response cover, against a background where the population of children is expected to increase by around 8,500 over 2016-17.  Around 18,500 children will attend the HSE CAMHS service this year, including around 14,000 referrals.  Detailed activity data on CAMHS is published by the Executive in its monthly Performance Reports available on the HSE website.  This shows, for example, 68% of children referred are seen within twelve weeks.  My objective, and that of the HSE, is to further improve all aspects of mental health care nationally for those under age 18, including those relating to age appropriate care settings.</p></reply>

The reports address a range of barriers and issues relating to the recruitment and retention of doctors in the Irish public health system.</p>  <p>  The Strategic Review recommendations are being implemented through a range of structures and processes across the health system.  Each recommendation has an identified business owner and progress updates are sought by my Department on a regular basis.  To support implementation of the recommendations, my Department has also established an Implementation Monitoring Group, comprising key stakeholders.  To date, four progress reports on the implementation of the recommendations have been published on my Department&rsquo;s website.  Implementation of the recommendations of the Strategic Review continues to be a priority for my Department and the Health Service Executive. </p>  <p>  Other positive developments which will also address issues around recruitment and retention include: restoration of the Living Out Allowance for non-consultant hospital doctors appointed since 2012, which will be incorporated in to the basic salary of these doctors from 1 July 2017; the launching of a careers and training website; agreement by the HSE to double the number of family-friendly training places over a three year period, and the streamlining of processes and the elimination of paperwork burdens associated with rotations through the online National Employment Record. </p></reply>

As already mentioned, I have also created a Stakeholder Consultative Committee, which is complemented by frequent contact with representative organisations and companies on an ongoing basis.  </p>  <p>  Last October, as part of Budget 2017, I announced measures aimed at alleviating the pressures of exchange rate volatility associated with Brexit.  These measures included the introduction of the &lsquo;Agri Cashflow Support Loan&rsquo; fund of &euro;150 million; enhanced taxation measures and an additional allocation of &euro;1.6m in 2016 and &euro;2m in 2017 to Bord Bia to ensure that they are in a position to provide Brexit-related supports to affected companies.  I also provided for increased funding under the Rural Development Programme and Seafood Development Programme.</p>  <p>  I recently awarded over &euro;1.8 million in grants to 19 seafood enterprises under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme for the seafood sector.  The aim of these grants is to incentivise seafood innovation and new product development as a means of meeting the Brexit challenge.</p>  <p>  I am also involved in a series of bilateral meetings with my EU counterparts which is aimed at building alliances to ensure that agri-food and fisheries issues are at the top of the EU negotiation agenda.  I want to discuss and get a sense of the importance of Brexit for them and of the degree to which they could support Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to have these issues specifically and adequately taken account of in the negotiations. </p>  <p>  I have just returned from a series of such bilaterals in Germany, Netherlands and Denmark, and most recently in Estonia and Poland.  I have plans to meet other EU Ministers next month.</p>  <p>  I am also in regular communication with Commissioner Hogan, and my officials have taken part in meetings with the Commission and the Barnier Task Force.</p>  <p>  In all of these engagements I am making clear our demand for continued unfettered access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures, as well as keeping the UK market viable for Irish producers by minimising the risk from UK trade agreements with third countries.  In relation to fisheries, Ireland wants to maintain current access to fishing grounds in the UK zone in the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and north of Donegal and protect our quota share for joint fish stocks. </p>  <p>  The Government remains very focused on supporting the agri-food industry through the challenges ahead.  I will continue to consult with the industry as the negotiations develop, and press Ireland's case for continued free access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures.</p></reply>

A dog microchip has limited functionality due its small size and, since it contains no internal power source, it cannot, on its own, lead to the reunification of a stray dog with its owner unless the 15 digit number is recorded on a database that can be easily located.  Likewise, the owner of a dog involved in killing sheep cannot be traced unless a robust microchipping system is in place.  A number of databases are operational in Ireland and I am satisfied that there is adequate competition in the market place in Ireland.  However, my Department is currently reviewing the legislation relating to dog microchipping.</p></reply>

Scientific and management assessments of each stock, including the Suir and the Nore, are carried out every year with IFI engaged in an extensive stock monitoring which feeds into the scientific committee's annual reviews.</p><p>The SSC estimates the number of salmon likely to return to each river in the next fishing season based on salmon runs over the most recent five years to determine if each river is meeting its individual conservation limit to maintain a healthy population.  If the estimate of returning salmon is above this limit, then salmon from that individually genetic river population may be harvested commercially or by rod and line.</p><p>The primary index for evaluation of likely returning numbers is the recorded rod (harvest or catch and release) and commercial catch (if any) averaged over the previous 5 years.  The scientific committee applies a range of rod exploitation rates for recreational fishing activity and adds the commercial catch to calculate the total run of salmon.</p><p>For the 2017 season, based on rod catch and exploitation rates, the Suir was estimated to be meeting 79% of its conservation limit (CL) and the Nore achieving 70% of the CL.  Management advice is that as both rivers are meeting greater that 65% of the CL they can be open for catch and release angling but this is not sufficient for harvest fisheries either commercial (including snap net) or angling.</p><p>The percentage of the CL achieved on the Nore and Suir for the last 5 years is shown in the following table. <table><tr><th></th><th>% CL achieved</th><th>% CL achieved</th><th>% CL achieved</th><th>% CL achieved</th><th>% CL achieved</th></tr><tr><td>River</td><td>2017</td><td>2016</td><td>2015</td><td>2014</td><td>2013</td></tr><tr><td>Nore</td><td>70</td><td>60</td><td>91</td><td>121</td><td>153</td></tr><tr><td>Suir, Clodiagh, Lingaun, Blackwater</td><td>79</td><td>68</td><td>80</td><td>83</td><td>117</td></tr></table></p><p>The salmon assessment methodologies used in Ireland are considered internationally as best practice.  Many other countries are moving towards the development of similar scientific assessment models for salmon stock conservation.</p></reply>

This builds on the 2015 Energy White Paper and recognises that solar has the potential to provide a community dividend, thereby also enhancing citizen participation in Ireland's energy future.</p><p>My Department is currently developing a proposed new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) which will be designed to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contributions out to 2030.  Analysis is on-going on a range of technologies to be included.  This analysis includes an assessment of the cost of supporting Solar Photovoltaics - both rooftop and ground-mounted.</p><p>The new scheme design requires detailed economic analysis, currently underway, on the viability and cost effectiveness of supporting several renewable technologies at various scales.  Once this analysis is complete, my Department will publish a second public consultation on the design of the new support scheme.  Details will be advertised on my Department's website at<i><font color="#2F2F2F"> www.dccae.gov.ie</font></i>.  There will be several decisions to be made on this scheme with regard to scale, technologies and, in particular, how communities will have a greater involvement than in previous schemes. </p><p>Before any new scheme is introduced, it will need to secure Government approval and State Aid clearance from the European Commission.  Subject to this, it is expected that the new scheme will become operational in the first half of 2018.</p></reply>

However, it is not intended to issue a further funding call in the immediate future.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for Partnership Government commits to making additional funding available for greenways and I am pursuing this funding in the context of the mid-term review of the Capital Plan.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is developing a new Strategy to underpin investment in Greenways and I expect that the Department will go out to public consultation in the near future seeking views on relevant issues to inform the development of the Strategy.  When the capital plan review is finalised and there is clarity on the totality of the funding that will be available for greenways in the coming years, my Department will issue further funding calls and local authorities would then be able to submit projects for funding.</p></reply>

Working with our enterprise agencies and with colleagues across Government, we are committed to delivering a range of actions outlined in our National and Regional Action Plans for Jobs to ensure that quality and sustainable jobs continue to be created throughout all regions of the country.</p><p>Ireland has a robust suite of employment rights legislation, which offers extensive protections to employees.  Those protections include the Protection of Employment Acts 1977-2007, which provide for a process of information and consultation between the employer and the employee representatives in circumstances where a collective redundancy is proposed, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973 to 2005, which give employees entitlements to specified notice periods or payment in lieu of such notice and the Payment of Wages Act 1991 which protects outstanding wages, holiday pay, commission and bonuses.  In addition, the Redundancy Payments Acts, which are administered by the Minister for Social Protection, provide for minimum statutory redundancy payments.</p><p>The Protection of Employment Act 1977 provides that, where employers are planning collective redundancies, they are obliged to supply the employees&rsquo; representatives with specific information regarding the proposed redundancies and to consult with those representatives at least 30 days before the first dismissal takes place, to see if the redundancies can be avoided or lessened or their effects mitigated.</p><p>The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) is mandated to secure compliance with employment rights legislation.  The WRC&rsquo;s Customer Service Section provides information in relation to employment, equality and industrial relations rights and obligations, and how to obtain redress where appropriate.  WRC information officials are available to meet staff, either individually or collectively, to discuss their employment rights, including matters related to redundancy.  The WRC&rsquo;s Customer Service Section can be contacted at Lo-call: 1890 80 80 90.  The website  also provides extensive information on employment rights.</p></reply>

Private Doherty was later found dead from gunshot wounds and Private Joyce was missing.  The attackers are unknown.  Over the years, extensive diplomatic and military efforts to locate Private Joyce have proved fruitless.  To date, no information has been elicited to lead to the recovery of Private Joyce&rsquo;s remains.</p>  <p>  In late June 2015, Mr. Roderick Murphy presented his draft report to the Minister for Defence.  Following a review of his report a number of clarifications were raised with Mr. Murphy which were addressed.  The Department of Defence also sought and received legal advice from the Attorney General in relation to the publication of the report. </p>  <p>  In March 2016, a copy of the draft report was forwarded on a confidential basis to the families and persons identified by the Reviewer for comment prior to publication of the report.  The Reviewer received comments from families and a number of persons identified.  He has considered these comments and has amended the draft Report where he has considered it appropriate to do so.  As a result of this exercise further legal advice was sought from the Attorney General.  This advice has been received and is under consideration.  It is intended to publish the report once all issues have been finalised.</p></reply>

Leadership training is the medium through which the Defence Forces ensures that personnel are prepared for exercising command authority across the full range of military functions both at home and overseas in international operations.  Skills training is the medium through which the Defence Forces ensures that its personnel have the requisite individual, specialist, and crew skills.  Career training and education provides the organisation with the necessary pool of leaders and commanders at all levels.  Collective Training allows military personnel to use their individual, crew, specialist and career training together, to develop integrated and coherent combat forces.</p>  <p>  The scheduling of training in the Defence Forces is underpinned by an analysis of training needed to meet operational output requirements and capability development needs.  A long term strategy is adopted with current planning horizons out to 2021.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces seek to constantly benchmark training across all three arms against best military and academic practice.  Military best practice is ensured by implementing a policy of standardisation that is in line with EU and NATO/Partnership for Peace partners.  Academic best practice is ensured by benchmarking courses through accreditation under the National Framework of Qualifications which is validated by Quality and Qualifications Ireland.  The Defence Forces delivers military programmes and modules meeting national and international standards.  The Defence Forces also engages with external educational institutions in order to facilitate organisational learning.  This engagement with national and international educational institutions, military and civilian, aims to ensure that the Defence Forces retains currency with regards to best international practice.</p></reply>

Equipment priorities for the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment planning process.</p>  <p>  In this context the White Paper provides that the Army will continue to retain all-arms conventional military capabilities.  The principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements both at home and overseas.   </p>  <p>  There is focus on the essential force protection provided by armoured vehicles, and in this regard a maintenance and upgrade programme has commenced for the current fleet of 80 Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs) which will seek to ensure viability of the fleet out to 2030.  A small number of armoured logistical and utility vehicles are also being procured for force protection. </p>  <p>  The White Paper underpins the ongoing replacement of the Naval Service fleet.  A significant investment over recent years has been on the procurement of new Off-Shore Patrol Vessels for the Naval Service.  The third ship in the programme, L&Eacute; William Butler Yeats, was commissioned in to service in October 2016.  A contract for an additional sister ship was placed with Babcock International in June 2016 at a cost of &euro;54.3m, bringing investment in the new ships programme to over &euro;250 million since 2010.  The fourth ship is scheduled for delivery in mid 2018. </p>  <p>  Future Naval Service capabilities are being planned as part of the White Paper project planning process which will determine the Defence Organisation&rsquo;s maritime capability requirements.</p>  <p>  The White Paper provides that the Air Corps will see the Cessna fleet replaced with three larger aircraft suitably equipped for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance tasks.  The aircraft specification is currently being prepared, and it is expected that the tender competition will be initiated and advertised on the e-tenders website in the near future.  The White Paper also provides for the replacement of two CASA 235s Maritime Patrol Aircraft by 2019, with consideration of their replacement with larger more capable aircraft.  This would enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks.</p>  <p>  A decision was made in 2016 to replace a PC-9M aircraft which was written off following a fatal crash in 2009.  The replacement PC-9M aircraft, scheduled for delivery this year from Pilatus Aircraft in Switzerland at a cost of &euro;5m plus VAT, will bring the fleet up to 8 and will assist in a required increase in pilot training in the Air Corps.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current provisions, together with the courses of action in the White Paper, will continue to ensure that the Defence Forces is suitably equipped, in line with international best practice, to fulfil all roles assigned by Government.</p></reply>

The main overseas missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with 378 personnel and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in Syria with 136 personnel. </p><p>The 378 personnel in UNIFIL serve alongside Finnish Armed Forces as part of a joint Battalion of which Ireland took over command in November 2016.  As a consequence of taking over command we deployed an additional Company of some 150 personnel as part of Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to this mission.</p><p>Ireland has a long and continuous record of contributing to peacekeeping missions. Participation in these missions demonstrates Ireland&rsquo;s strong support for the role of the United Nations in international peacekeeping.  The current contribution of some 585 personnel to overseas missions reflects the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to our responsibilities in this area.</p><p>The main EU-led mission in which Irish personnel have been serving since March 2013 is the EU-led Training Mission in Mali, EUTM Mali.  The objective of the mission is to improve the capacity of the Malian Armed Forces to maintain security in Mali and restore the authority of the Malian Government and the territorial integrity of the Malian State.  Currently, eighteen (18) members of the Permanent Defence Force are deployed to the mission.  Following Government approval, two further Irish personnel will be deployed as trainers to the mission in the near future in response to a recent request from the Mission Commander.</p><p>During each EU Presidency both formal and informal meetings of Defence Ministers are held.  On 6 March 2017, I attended the extraordinary formal Defence Ministers Meeting under the auspices of the Foreign Affairs Council.  Discussions were focused on current EU-led operations and future proposed developments.</p><p>The Department of Defence constantly reviews the deployment of Defence Forces personnel overseas.  With regard to any future deployments of Defence Forces personnel overseas, Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>The question of a further deployment of Naval vessels to the Mediterranean is currently under consideration.</p><p>Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas are shown in the following table.</p><p><b><i>Members of the Permanent Defence Force Serving Overseas</i></b><i></i><b><i>As of 1 March 2017</i></b></p><p><b>1. </b><b><i>UN MISSIONS</i></b></p><p><b>(i) UNIFIL </b>(United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) HQ - 30 </p><p><b>UNIFIL</b>109th Infantry Battalion - 340 </p><p><b>UNIFIL</b>Sector West HQ - 8</p><p><b>(ii) UNTSO </b>(United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation) Israel &amp;amp; Syria - 12 </p><p><b>(iii) MINURSO</b>(United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara) - 3 </p><p><b>(iv) MONUSCO</b>(United Nations Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo - 4</p><p><b>(v) UNDOF </b>(United Nations Disengagement Observer Force) HQ - 1 </p><p><b>UNDOF</b>Staff Appointments (Camp Ziouani) - 5</p><p><b>UNDOF</b>54th Infantry Group (Camp Ziouani) - 130 </p><p><b>TOTAL - 533</b></p><p><b><i>UN MANDATED MISSIONS</i></b></p><p><b>(vi) EUFOR</b>(EU-led Operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina) - 6 </p><p><b>(vii) EUTM Mali</b>(EU-Led Training Mission) - 18 </p><p><b>(viii) KFOR</b>(International Security Presence in Kosovo) HQ - 12 </p><p><b>TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONNEL SERVING WITH UN MISSIONS - 569</b></p><p><b>2. </b><b><i>ORGANISATION FOR SECURITY AND CO-OPERATION IN EUROPE (OSCE)</i></b></p><p>(i) OSCE Mission to Bosnia &amp;amp; Herzegovina - 1 </p><p>(ii) Staff Officer, High Level Planning Group, Vienna - 1 </p><p><b>TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONNEL SERVING WITH OSCE - 2</b></p><p><b>3. </b><b><i>EU MILITARY STAFF</i></b></p><p>Brussels - 4</p><p><b>4. </b><b><i>MILITARY REPRESENTATIVES/ADVISERS/STAFF</i></b></p><p>(i) Military Adviser, Permanent Mission to UN, New York - 1 </p><p>(ii) Military Adviser, Irish Delegation to OSCE, Vienna - 1 </p><p>(iii) Military Representative to EU (Brussels) - 4 </p><p>(iv) Liaison Officer of Ireland, NATO/PfP (Brussels) - 2 </p><p>(v) EU OHQ Operation Althea, Mons, Belgium - 1 </p><p>(vi) Irish Liaison Officer to SHAPE &amp;amp; Military Co-Op Division, Mons, Belgium - 1 </p><p><b>TOTAL NUMBER OF DEFENCE FORCES PERSONNEL SERVING OVERSEAS - 585</b></p></reply>
