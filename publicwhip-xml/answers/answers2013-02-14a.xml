    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-14a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021400068#WRA00900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 39 and 343 together.</p><p>I am pleased to inform the Deputies that MRSA rates are at a 6-year low and would like to assure the Deputy that the management of Healthcare Acquired Infections (HCAIs)  including MRSA  is a key patient safety issue for my Department and the Health Service Executive (HSE) and a number of significant initiatives have been developed to address that important public health issue. These include the HSE's National Infection Control Plan  which was launched in March 2007.    A National Surveillance System  was also established by the HSE to collect data and provide information to monitor HCAIs in our health system along with the establishment of the Clinical Care Programme for HCAIs. </p><p>  In relation to the recent  Health Information and Quality Authority's (HIQA) Reports my Department and the HSE recognise that the HIQA inspection of hospitals against the National Infection Prevention and Control Standards is an important element of the overall strategy to reduce HCAIs across healthcare in Ireland.   welcome the positive comments on the 14 Hospitals inspected.  Likewise, both my Department and the HSE recognise that improvement is still necessary in some areas.</p><p>  With regard to hand hygiene the findings of the Authority would suggest that a culture of hand hygiene best practice needs to become more operationally embedded at all levels.  wish to emphasise that it is of vital importance that healthcare workers recognise their personal responsibility to protect patients by maintaining their own hand hygiene.</p><p>   To date the HSE has published three national audits on hand hygiene practices with a fourth due in the next six to eight weeks.  These reports have shown a level of hand hygiene improving from 78% to 82% against a national target of 90% by the end of 2013.  To improve hand hygiene a series of actions are in place a key element of which is the continuing hand hygiene audits.  These are happening both in the acute sector and in the long stay area as well.</p><p>  Other actions include:</p><p>- the existing 2005 guidelines on hand hygiene are being revised and will be published this year</p><p>- a hand hygiene e-learning programme is being piloted in Dublin North East</p><p>- a training video for staff on the WHO 5 Moments for hand hygiene concept</p><p>- revised hand hygiene posters were introduced across the system in the summer of 2012</p><p>- a major section on website on hand hygiene</p><p>- in collaboration with the Department of Education an educational programme for schools - E-Bug</p><p>- a monthly national HCA implementation group monitors and reviews all HCA activity in the health system.</p><p>  All 12 hospitals audited by HIQA are now being asked to develop quality improvement plans that prioritise changes necessary to fully meet the National Standards for the Prevention and Control of Healthcare Associated Infections.  These plans must be published by the hospitals concerned on the Internet within six weeks of the publication of HIQA's reports.</p><p>  All hospitals will receive a letter shortly indicating general outcomes of HIQA investigations and lessons to be learnt.    </p><p>  With regard to the prevention of the spread of MRSA  it should be noted that the number of cases of MRSA has fallen by 55% between 2006 and 2011 (from 592 to 263 cases) and the downward trend is holding per statistical returns to date.    Individual hospital MRSA rates are also collected and published &ndash; annually for 2006 and 2007 and quarterly from 2008 onwards. These results provide a good benchmark into the future to enable us to measure effectively the progress of each hospital on their performance in infection prevention and control.  The data can be used by individual hospitals to monitor their progress in the control of HCAIs and the regular reports  allow for public assessment of that progress. </p><p>  Finally, officials of my Department  are currently working on the Licensing of Health Facilities Bill which will provide for a mandatory system of licensing for public and private health service providers.  The legislative proposals are being prepared broadly in line with recommendations made in the Report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance and are designed to improve patient safety by ensuring that healthcare providers do not operate below core standards which are applied in a consistent and systematic way.  The intention is to have a proportionate system which has the confidence of the public.  Standards and other requirements will be enforceable through inspection and imposition of sanctions as necessary.  Licensing will be targeted at areas which are not currently subject to regulation.  It is expected that outline proposals for the new system of licensing should be finalised in the near future.</p></reply>

Immediately following my appointment, I set out to address the issues which have been causing unacceptable delays in patients being treated in our hospitals. I established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), as set out in the Programme for Government. The SDU is working to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system.  Since its establishment there has been significant improvements in the waiting times for unscheduled care against a background of reduced funding for health, reconfiguration of services, a very challenging socio-economic climate and a growing number of older persons with an overall increase in life expectancy.</p><p>  There was significant progress during the course of 2012 in reducing the number of patients waiting on trolleys.  Over 2012 there were 20,352 less patients waiting on trolleys in comparison to 2011, representing an overall reduction of 23.6%.</p><p>  With particular regard to Sligo General Hospital, the SDU is satisfied that the hospital is engaged in ensuring that emergency patients are seen in a timely manner, focussing on working to achieve the national targets for unscheduled care. Specific measures taken have included the opening of a 15 bedded <i>Medical Short Stay Unit</i> adjacent to the Emergency Department and the Acute Assessment Unit.  This ward has had the impact of improving the streaming of medical patients throughout the hospital as well as a continued reduction of patients accommodated on trolleys overnight.</p></reply>

The opening of an Acute Medical Unit in the hospital as well as Medical Assessment Units at St John's and the Mid-Western Regional Hospital Nenagh have alleviated the pressures on the Emergency Department by enabling Medical Physicians to take direct referrals from GPs. Other measures planned include converting some in-patient beds to medical short stay beds. By grouping these patients together under the care of Acute Medical Physicians it is hoped to increase the number of medical discharges within 48 hours, thus freeing up capacity.</p></reply>

It is envisaged that the new contract, when finalised, will focus on prevention and will include a requirement for GPs to provide care as part of integrated multidisciplinary Primary Care Teams.</p><p>  The Department and the HSE are currently examining the changes that need to be made to the GMS contract to facilitate the introduction of Universal Primary Care.  There have been discussions with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Competition Authority with regard to Competition Law.  </p><p>  I have recently had discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) during which I outlined our policy in relation to free GP care.

Since its establishment, there have been significant improvements in waiting times for unscheduled care, against a background of reduced funding for health, reconfiguration of services, a very challenging socio-economic climate, a growing number of older people and an overall increase in life expectancy.</p><p>  In December 2012, there were 20,352 fewer patients waiting on trolleys in comparison to December  2011, representing an overall reduction of 23.6%. However, the overall progress made has to be secured and continually improved upon, and the SDU continues to engage at all levels with hospitals to do this. The work of the SDU with executive management teams in hospitals (CEOs, Directors Of Nursing and Clinical Directors) has seen local leaders and experts driving the change required to reduce the numbers of patients waiting on trolleys and improve standards for patients.</p><p>  Another major contributing factor in reducing waiting times has been the implementation of new clinical care pathways, based on international clinical evidence, which has enabled improved planning of services to ensure optimal resource utilisation. An escalation protocol has been introduced by SDU liaison officers to assist with hospitals which are experiencing particular difficulties. This involves conference calls between key decision makers to review the situation and agree actions. This usually includes Directors of Performance, Directors of Unscheduled and Scheduled Care, the National Clinical Director, the National Director of Clinical Programmes and senior HSE managers, including all HSE Regional Directors. </p><p>  Key actions agreed during this conference may include:</p><p>- Opening of additional capacity in the hospital;</p><p>- Ensuring the presence of senior clinical decision makers to maximise patient discharges from occupied beds;</p><p>- Utilising available capacity in residential facilities for approved patients;</p><p>- Consideration of adjustments to elective (scheduled) care in the short term.</p><p>  The SDU has therefore planned well for the possibility of surges in demand in ED-related hospital services and the better management of the surges has mitigated their impact. The system has been clearly responsive in the way this has been done. It is very heartening to see the level of commitment and actions that have been taken to cope with very difficult winter circumstances.</p><p>  There are consistent reports of high attendances at emergency departments at present, with increasing numbers of frail elderly presenting with acute viral and respiratory-related illness. Clinical Directors across the country have reported that all staff, including consultants, nurses, allied health staff and management have been working extremely hard to address these pressures.  These exceptional efforts will continue but the nature of many of the patients is such that they require extended inpatient care, which is resulting in additional trolley waits in emergency departments.  The SDU has been in constant contact with regional management teams, the National Clinical Directors and National Leads for Clinical Programmes.  The situation is being actively managed at a national level and in addition, small teams of SDU staff are visiting key hospitals to ensure that all possible actions to ameliorate the present situation are being implemented. The impact of these measures is seen in the reduction of numbers of patients on trolleys during the day.  The objective of the measures being implemented at hospital level and by the HSE is to continue to manage the downward trend on the number of patients waiting until the system stabilises. </p><p>  Trolley figures in hospitals are managed a number of times a day through an internal counting system known as TrolleyGAR &ndash; which refers to the trolley count and alert levels: green for within acceptable limits, amber for approaching acceptable maximum limits and red for above acceptable maximum limits.  These counts take place at 8am, 2pm and 8pm each day.  </p><p>  With specific reference to St James' Hospital, the hospital has advised that they have robust internal controls and processes in place to ensure that Emergency Department volumes and wait times are managed consistently and appropriately. The hospital has also advised that it constantly seeks to deliver improvements in terms of Emergency Department access and overall patient experience. The figures from 18 January 2013 to 11 February 2013 (25 days, 75 counts) show red for only 21 counts, red for all three daily counts on only one occasion and one day with green for all counts. The hospital has invoked its escalation procedures in response to the ED demand surge. It has opened additional beds and is working with the HSE on accelerated discharge of patients to home care and long term stay. The monitoring of numbers of people on trolleys in St James's will continue.</p></reply>

The HSE will accept applications on an ongoing basis for Phase 1, covering registered general nurses for the acute hospital setting and the community, from 2012 graduates and also those who graduated in 2010 and 2011. Further recruitment will continue during 2013. Phase 2, which will cover Mental Health, Intellectual Disability, Midwifery and Paediatrics, will launch in the coming days. There will also be opportunities for those who graduate in 2013 to participate in due course.  The scheme was introduced on the assumption that intake would be spread over a period, especially since the scheme was being introduced some months after most 2012 graduates completed their training.</p><p>  The initiative will give nursing and midwifery graduates an employment opportunity and facilitate their professional development.  They will be able to avail of a suite of educational programmes including intravenous canulation and training in anaphylaxis treatment. It has also been agreed that participants will be facilitated in obtaining a certificate in advanced healthcare skills to cover areas such as health assessment and pharmacology.</p><p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform approved this employment initiative on the basis that participants would not be counted in health service staff numbers and that it would contribute to savings on unsustainable levels of agency and overtime expenditure. The HSE's National Service Plan for 2013 provides for a saving of &euro;10m in the current year, arising from the introduction of this scheme.  This level of saving will need to be achieved regardless of uptake.  Based on the fifth point of the staff nurse salary scale, the average monthly cost to the health service of an agency nurse is approximately &euro;5,000 including administration costs,VAT, PRSI and allowances.  Given the requirement on the HSE to reduce numbers employed and to maximise savings, there is only very limited scope to offer permanent nursing posts at present.</p><p>  The graduate nurse/midwife scheme represents an opportunity for a substantial number of recently-qualified nurses and midwives to work in Ireland for a two-year period and to gain valuable experience and additional skills at a time when job opportunities in the public service are, regrettably, very limited.  Graduate nurses and midwives are of course entitled to choose whether to participate in the initiative or to pursue their careers elsewhere but I would hope to see a steady increase in applicants over the coming months.  I consider that the boycott of the scheme by the nursing representative bodies is ill-judged and I would ask them to reconsider their opposition to this measure.</p></reply>

There will always be more construction projects than can be funded by the Exchequer and the Health Service Executive must prioritise infrastructure projects within its overall capital envelope.     </p><p>  I requested that the HSE accelerate the projects in both Wexford and in Kilkenny and for very good reasons.  At Wexford General Hospital the admissions lounge is in a portakabin-style building, as is the medical assessment unit at St Luke&rsquo;s Hospital Kilkenny.</p><p>  The new Wexford project comprises an emergency department, a maternity delivery suite and theatre and the necessary equipping.  A main entrance / new concourse will also be provided.   The project is under construction and is making good progress.  It is expected to be completed and operational in mid to late 2014.</p><p>  The new Kilkenny project comprises an emergency department, a medical assessment unit and a day services unit including endoscopy. Construction commenced in 2012 and the project is expected to be completed and operational in mid to late 2014.</p><p>  Both projects were approved for inclusion in the HSE capital programme in 2008 and have been included in all of the HSE&rsquo;s multi-annual Capital Plans since then. </p><p>  My decisions fully supported the Government priority which is to improve conditions for patients and reduce overcrowding in Emergency Departments through the delivery of improved accommodation including medical assessment units.  </p><p>  As you will be aware, one of the concerns over many years has been capacity issues in the Emergency Departments. Since 2006 capital funding has been made available for an A&amp;E Initiative to provide a series of admission lounges and medical assessment units in order to relieve pressure on A&amp;E departments.   Continuing to address these capacity issues has always been a fundamental aspect of HSE&rsquo;s Capital Plans. The 2008 Capital Plan contained funding to complete developments underway, deliver new A&amp;Es and to upgrade and extend existing departments.   The Wexford and Kilkenny projects were part of this initiative to address capacity.  </p><p>  Following the 2009 Budget and Supplementary Budget the HSE&rsquo;s capital allocation was reduced by about 32%. As a consequence, certain projects were paused or deferred.  Those projects which were in construction or at the equipping stage were completed, whereas those which were at earlier stages of development such as appraisal or design were paused / deferred once those stages were completed.  The projects deferred included the Wexford and St Luke&rsquo;s Kilkenny projects.</p><p>  Both projects had advanced sufficiently by 2011 which enabled me to make my decision to accelerate them. Planning permission was in place and both had undergone the design phase.  No projects were delayed, held or omitted from the capital programme to accommodate these projects.</p><p>  I was delighted to receive an additional &euro;12 million from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in order to expedite the sorely needed facility in Wexford General Hospital.   Given that savings were achieved in the construction area due to reduced costs associated with the economic downturn it was also possible to expedite the St Luke&rsquo;s project.</p><p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sanctioned the 2011 Capital Plan which included these much needed projects.</p></reply>

The Executive is currently finalising its National Operational Plan to support the implementation of the National Service Plan. is will specify in greater detail the actions to be taken in relation to EWTD compliance. e HSE was asked by my Department in January to ensure that clear responsibility is placed with a hospital CEO and a senior manager and/or clinical lead  for the achievement of specified improvements in compliance, such that the end 2014 target will be met.</p><p>  As part of the measures agreed between health service management and the consultant representative bodies at the Labour Relations Commission in September 2012, consultants have a key role in supporting the implementation of required revisions to NCHD work patterns and  working hours.  These include ward-based rostering, use of cross cover at SHO level, replacement of NCHD hours by Advanced Nurse/Midwifery Practitioner hours where appropriate, transfer of certain duties to other staff and other measures set out in Ireland's 2012 Plan to drive EWTD compliance.  </p><p>  I want to ensure that NCHDs can progress to consultant level.  However, it is not sustainable, in the light of the State's serious financial difficulties, to continue to recruit at the previous rates.  If we are to continue to provide consultant-level career opportunities for doctors and, subject to the limitations on available resources, to replace consultants who retire and where possible expand overall capacity, this can only happen on the basis of a lower-cost model.</p></reply>

I established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), as set out in the Programme for Government. The SDU is working to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system.  Since its establishment there has been significant improvements in the waiting times for unscheduled care against a background of reduced funding for health, reconfiguration of services, a very challenging socio-economic climate and a growing number of older persons with an overall increase in life expectancy.</p><p>  There was significant progress during the course of 2012 in reducing the number of patients waiting on trolleys.  Over 2012 there were 20,352 less patients waiting on trolleys in comparison to 2011, representing an overall reduction of 23.6%.</p><p>  Since before Christmas hospitals have seen a significant increase in the number of very sick patients needing admission.  The increase in norovirus in hospitals has been well publicised; we are also seeing high levels of admissions of frail elderly people, patients presenting with respiratory illness and of patients presenting with fractures.  </p><p>  However, evidence from the last year, and particularly over the last ten months, has proved that the health system has the capacity to respond to these challenges more quickly and is better at managing increased demand. </p><p>  The situation is being actively managed at a national level with an intensive work programme having begun between the SDU&rsquo;s liaison officers, the Clinical Programmes and the hospital teams. The SDU is satisfied that hospitals are engaged in ensuring that emergency patients are seen in a timely manner, focussing on working to achieve the national targets for unscheduled care.</p><p>  I will have the information requested on each hospital sent out to the Deputies as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The health sector must make its contribution to that reduction.   This policy requires that by the end of 2013, the health service achieves a workforce of 98,955 whole time equivalents (WTEs).  This is a very challenging target given the level of staff reductions that have been achieved in recent years.</p><p>  In order to mitigate the impact on front-line services of the reduction in employment numbers, the priority is to reform how health services are delivered in order to ensure a more productive and cost effective health system. Therefore, the HSE is using the provisions of the Public Service Agreement to bring about greater flexibilities in work practices and rosters, redeployment and other changes to achieve more efficient delivery of services. </p><p>  Staff reductions will be pursued throughout 2013 through natural turnover (retirements and resignations) and such other targeted measures or initiatives as may be determined by Government in relation to the health sector or the wider public service.</p><p>  The HSE National Service Plan provides for investment of an additional 1,025 WTEs in a number of key prioritised areas, as well as the completion of the 2012 mental health investment programme (400+) posts.   Also, a graduate nurse employment programme will be implemented, involving the recruitment of up to 1,000 nurses on two-year contracts.

The NAS deploys its emergency resources in a dynamic manner and works on an area and national, rather than a local, basis.The dynamic deployment of ambulance resources ensures that the nearest appropriate resource within a region is mobilised to the an incident. </p><p>  For dynamic deployment of emergency resources within a region to be effective, those resources must be available to be used as efficiently as possible. Following a referral to the Labour Court under the Public Service Agreement, the NAS is progressing a number of efficiencies arising from the Court's ruling, including more efficient rostering and the removal of overtime built in to rosters.New rosters are now in place and are operating successfully.The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has developed key performance indicators (KPIs) for pre-hospital emergency care, which classify 999 emergency calls by clinical status. Clinical Status 1 Echo calls involve life-threatening emergencies of cardiac or respiratory origin, while Clinical Status 1 Delta calls involve life-threatening emergencies other than cardiac or respiratory. The target times for responding to Echo and Delta calls are 7 minutes 59 seconds by a first responder (a person trained in minimum basic life support and use of a defibrillator) and 18 minutes 59 seconds for a patient-carrying vehicle. With effect from January 2012, HIQA set the target for first responders to meet the response time (7 minutes 59 seconds) in 75% of cases. From January 2013 the target for patient-carrying vehicles is to meet the Clinical Status 1 ECHO incidents response time (18 minutes 59 seconds) in 85% of cases.</p><p>  The NAS has been taking a number of steps to improve emergency responses. These include development of a Performance Improvement Action Plan, an intermediate care service for non-emergency patient transfers, to release emergency resources for emergency use, the national control centre reconfiguration project and a trial emergency aeromedical service.</p><p>  In light of the above, and following a review of the validity of time-based KPIs, it is considered, in line with international views, that clinical outcomes would be more appropriate as performance indicators. Accordingly, work has begun on their development.I also welcome the fact that use of clinical indicators will enable a focus on Clinical Status 1 (Echo and Delta) calls. </p><p>  In relation to the specific queries raised by the Deputy, as these are service matters, they have been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

The Unit&rsquo;s purpose is to improve access to the emergency and elective care system.  Since it was established last year, it has been working to unblock public access to acute services by improving patient journeys through the system and by streamlining public hospital waiting lists. I am pleased to be able to say that very significant progress has been made by the SDU in relation to scheduled care waiting times. The initial focus for the Special Delivery Unit's Scheduled Care Team has been on waiting times for in-patient and daycase elective surgery.  </p><p>  The HSE Service Plan 2012 set a target that no adult should have to wait longer than nine months for in-patient or daycase surgery. By the end of December 2012, the number of adults having to wait more than 9 months for in-patient and day case surgery was down to 86 from 3,706 in December 2011, a 98% decrease. </p><p>  This is a significant achievement which shows what can be done to tackle access to in-patient and daycase services. The progress made in 2012 does not mean all problems are solved, and 2013 will remain very challenging against a target waiting time for this year of eight months. However, the improvement reflects my commitment, and that of this Government, to ensuring patients can access the acute hospital services they need, when they need them.</p><p>  Access to outpatient waiting times is also a key priority and a maximum waiting time target has now been set that no-one should be waiting longer than 12 months for a first-time outpatient appointment. The setting of this target has been made possible by the considerable work done by the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) working in conjunction with the SDU.  For the first time, clear and comprehensive data on outpatient waiting times is available (www.ptr.ie).  The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format reveals the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals. In the first instance, this allows resources to be targeted towards those patients who are waiting longest, to ensure that they are seen and assessed.  In parallel with reducing the numbers of longest waiters, the SDU will this year work with the HSE National Clinical Care Programmes to reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time. </p></reply>

They recommended that the number of GP training places be increased to 150.  In July 2010, the GP trainee intake increased from 120 to 157 training places per year.  The Department commissioned research in 2011 to develop a model of demand for and supply of GP and practice nurse services. The outcome is a functional and adaptable Excel spreadsheet model which can be used in assessing future GP manpower needs.</p><p>  The Health (Provision of General Practitioner Services) Act 2012 came into effect on 12 March 2012.  This legislation eliminates restrictions on fully qualified and trained GPs wishing to obtain contracts to treat public patients under the GMS contract.  It will encourage more young GPs to remain in Ireland and to establish their practice here and will make it more attractive for GPs to move here from overseas.  As of 31st November 2012, a total of 97 GPs had obtained a GMS contract since the new legislation came into effect and a further 33 applications are being processed/awaiting Garda clearance, etc.  On 31st December 2012, there were over 2,800 GPs, 2,368 of whom are GMS contract holders.</p></reply>

It will deliver a number of important benefits, including </p><p>-  significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs,</p><p>-   a lowering of the drugs bill to the State,</p><p>-  timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and</p><p>-  reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.</p><p>  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400m over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will make available new drugs to patients over 3 years. Thus, the deal will result in a net reduction in the HSE expenditure on drugs of about &euro;190m.</p><p>  The Department of Health and the HSE have also successfully finalised discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic industry, on a new agreement to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs. It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013.</p><p>  The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nominated EU member states in which the medicine is then available.  The prices of a range of medicines were reduced on 1 January 2013 in accordance with the agreement.</p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which is currently before the House, provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing. The Bill provides that when the HSE is setting a reference price for, or reviewing a reference price set for, a relevant group of interchangeable medicinal products it shall take into account the following criteria:</p><p>-  the ability of suppliers to meet patient demand for the relevant item;</p><p>-  the value for money afforded by the relevant item;</p><p>-  the equivalent prices of the relevant item in all other Member States where the product is marketed;</p><p>-  the prices of therapeutically similar items; and</p><p>-  the resources available to the HSE.</p><p>  It is important to balance achieving best value for money for the taxpayer with assuring continuity of supply for critical medical products, particularly in a small market like Ireland. Consequently, the Bill aims to achieve value for money while avoiding disruption in the availability of medicines on the Irish market.</p></reply>

The health sector must make its contribution to that reduction. Subject to compliance with national policy, particularly in relation to the employment control framework, it is a matter for the HSE to determine the composition of its staffing complement.</p><p>  The HSE is continually pursuing measures to achieve staffing economies. The National Service Plan for 2013 identifies a range of objectives to be advanced, including work practice changes for identified health disciplines, systematic reviews of rosters, skill-mix and staffing levels, increased use of re-deployment, further productivity increases and a focussed approach to addressing absenteeism and implementing revised new sick leave arrangements.</p><p>  The Plan also provides for tight control of the use of higher-cost staffing arrangements and in particular the use of agency staffing and overtime working.  The graduate nurse placement initiative will provide participants with frontline working experience and professional development opportunities, while at the same time providing additional nursing capacity at service level.</p><p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform approved this employment initiative on the basis that participants would not be counted in health service staff numbers and that it would contribute to savings on unsustainable levels of agency and overtime expenditure. The HSE's National Service Plan for 2013 provides for a saving of &euro;10m in the current year, arising from the introduction of this scheme. Given the requirement on the HSE to reduce numbers employed and to maximise savings, there is only very limited scope to offer permanent nursing posts at present.</p></reply>

This Group was appointed to oversee implementation of the Report.  <i>AVFC</i> contained a commitment that it would be reviewed after seven years and we have now reached that 7-year anniversary.  The current priority, however, is to review the Mental Health Act 2001 after which  urgent consideration will be given to reviewing <i>AVFC</i> and establishing independent monitoring arrangements.  expect that the review of the Act will be completed and presented to me in quarter two of this year.  In the interim, the HSE continues to implement <i>AVFC</i> with substantial additional funding provided in  2012 and 2013, and reports on this on a monthly basis, through the HSE National Service Plan.</p><p>  The recommendations of the Independent Monitoring Group are consistent with the recommendations in <i>A Vision for Change, </i>our National Strategy for mental health.  Implementation of the Strategy and the reform of our mental health services is a priority for this Government. However, implementation has been slower than originally expected as it has been delayed by a number of factors including the changed economic context, constraints in public spending and the moratorium on recruitment.  It is expected that the appointment of a Director for Mental Health, which was advertised recently by the HSE, will greatly accelerate the pace of implementation.</p><p>  Nonetheless, a great deal of progress has been made with the accelerated closure of old psychiatric hospitals and their replacement with bespoke new facilities, better suited to modern mental health care.  Progress also includes shorter episodes of in-patient care and the involvement of service users in all aspects of mental health policy, service planning and delivery.  In addition, Clinical Care Programmes for the treatment and care of patients with Eating Disorders, Early Intervention in Psychosis and the Management of Self  Harm Presentations to Emergency Departments are being progressed by the HSE.  The clinical care programme plan will provide service models that implement <i>AVFC.</i>  Core to the overall plans will be the principles of recovery, individualised care delivered in partnership with voluntary agencies and based on early intervention and evidence based practice.</p><p>  A modern mental health service is best delivered in the community and in 2012 a special allocation of &#8364;35m was provided primarily to further strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both adult and children&#8217;s mental health services, to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention, to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care, specifically for people with mental health problems and to facilitate the re-location of mental health service users from institutional care to more independent living arrangements in their communities<i>.</i></p><p>  Budgetary pressures within the HSE delayed the full utilisation of this funding, but this sum is now available to mental health services along with an additional &#8364;35m allocated in Budget 2013 for the continued development of mental health services across a range of headings, including the further ongoing development of community services.  This represents a total of &#8364;70m additional revenue to modernise and reform our mental health services in 2013.  Over 850 new mental health professionals are being employed to strengthen these services.</p></reply>

This Government regards the building of the hospital as a priority and no effort will be spared in expediting its completion.  </p><p>  Following the announcement of the Government's decision, detailed consideration has been given to the project management structures and governance arrangements required to enable delivery of the project as quickly as possible and to the highest quality.  In this regard I intend to restructure the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and to establish a Children's Hospital Group which will include the three existing paediatric hospitals. The restructured National Paediatric Hospital Development Board will focus on the capital project only. The membership of the restructured Board will align with this core function and include the necessary capital development expertise.</p><p>  The required legislation will, inevitably, take some time and as the terms of office of the majority of Board members expired on 5 December, I have appointed senior representatives from my Department and the HSE as an interim measure aimed at ensuring effective governance and decision-making for the project during this transitional phase. </p><p>  At this important initial stage it is crucial that the project continues without delay and, in parallel with consideration of governance arrangements, work has also been progressing in relation to the site and site preparation, while a review of urgent care centre(s) configuration is underway and a time-limited review of Dublin maternity services configuration is due to commence shortly.</p><p>  This Government&rsquo;s priority is to ensure that the project proceeds securely to completion as quickly as possible and with optimal results. I am confident that the project management and governance structures now being put in place will enable the fastest possible delivery of this key infrastructure for children&rsquo;s hospital services. </p></reply>

Under UHI, everyone will be insured and will have equal access to a standard package of primary and acute hospital services, including acute mental health services.  A new Insurance Fund will subsidise or pay insurance premiums for those who qualify for a subsidy. </p><p>  The Department is preparing a White Paper on Universal Health Insurance which will provide further detail on the UHI model for Ireland in addition to the estimated costs and financing mechanisms associated with the introduction of universal health insurance. The work involved is both complex and technical, necessitating significant research and financial modelling to support analysis and costing of different design options.  This, in turn, demands a wide-range of specialised expertise. The Department is engaged in a process to ensure the provision of this expertise to feed into work on the preparation of the White Paper during 2013.  The White Paper will be published as early as possible within the Government&rsquo;s term of office.  </p><p>  In advance of the White Paper, my Department has produced a Preliminary Paper on UHI, which I intend to publish very shortly.  </p></reply>

This is  in line with national clinical care protocols for best practice and safe management of the patient with a heart attack or stroke.  These protocols require such patients to be treated in a level 3 or 4 hospital as a level 2 hospital does not have a Critical Care Unit.  Stabilisation of such patients is a key function of pre-hospital emergency care and is carried out by paramedics who assess, treat and stabilise patents prior to transporting them to an appropriate facility for care.</p><p>  Accident victims should only be managed in a hospital with a full ED department with the necessary available acute care back-up including ICU.   The essence is that patients should go to the hospital that is best able to treat them &ndash; this is particularly important for heart attack and stroke victims whose survival rate and long term prognosis is dependent on how quickly they reach an appropriate hospital.  </p><p>  Roscommon County Hospital is leading the way by demonstrating the range of services that can be developed in a smaller hospital.  In July 2011, Roscommon County Hospital commenced a process of reconfiguring services in line with HIQA recommendations.  It now has a Medical Assessment Unit that is open 9-5pm Monday to Friday for the assessment of medical patients who are referred by GPs, after initial phone triage with one of the medical consultants to ensure that the MAU is the appropriate care pathway for that patient.  In addition, it has an Urgent Care Centre (UCC) open 8am-8pm, 7 days a week, which deals with minor injuries/trauma. </p><p>  Developments in 2012 include: Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Sleep Studies, Urology Services, Radiology Upgrade, a newly developed Endoscopy Suite, Dental Service, Nurse Prescribing and re-accreditation for student nurse training.</p><p>  Roscommon played a key role in Galway/Roscommon Hospital Group, with more than 520 endoscopy procedures transferred from Galway to Roscommon. Future plans for Roscommon hospital see increases in elective inpatient care, in particular in endoscopy &ndash; plans for which are well advanced with design agreed, site identified, tender documents complete, funding secured and awaiting planning permission. Roscommon is an excellent example of delivering appropriate care in the appropriate setting to maximise patient safety and resources.   With regard to the Deputies specific query on reviewing the provision of &quot;non-planned&quot; services at Roscommon County Hospital, as this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.</p></reply>

The intention is that persons aged 70 years and over, whose gross weekly income is not more than &euro;600 in the case of single persons and &euro;1,200 in the case of couples, will qualify for full eligibility (medical cards); persons aged 70 years and over, whose gross weekly income is more than &euro;600 but less than &euro;700 in the case of single persons and more than &euro;1,200 but less than &euro;1,400 in the case of couples, will qualify for GP Visit Cards.</p><p>  People who do not qualify for a medical card are entitled to make use of the Drugs Payment Scheme (DPS) which reimburses the cost of medication that exceeds a monthly threshold. The new rules will not take effect until later in 2013, after primary legislation has been enacted. The implementation date will be announced and publicised in advance by the Department and the HSE. </p><p>  It was also announced that, in relation to eligibility for the standard medical card, the rules relating to a person&rsquo;s spending that are taken into account when carrying out the means test will be tightened.

The problem has been exacerbated as a result of our changing social, economic and physical environment and by a dramatic reduction in physical activity, and changing dietary patterns.  Alone, no single  initiative will reverse the trend, but it is hoped that a combination of actions against obesity will help.  As Minister for Health, I have made overweight and obesity a public health priority and have established a Special Action Group on Obesity (SAGO) with whom I meet regularly to progress the obesity agenda.</p><p>The Special Action Group on Obesity is concentrating on a range of measures including actions such as calorie posting in restaurants; as a means of educating the general public on the calorie content of food portions;  revision of this Department's Healthy Eating Guidelines, including the Food Pyramid, which were launched last year to help inform people about the food and drink choices required for a healthy lifestyle and set out in plain and simple language the food servings the Irish population need to<b></b>consume to maintain health and well-being. Work is also being progressed in such areas as treatment algorithms which have been agreed and will inform primary care staff of the steps to be taken with regard to managing obesity.  The Special Action Group on Obesity has been considering<i></i>opportunistic screening and monitoring with the HSE with a view to earlier detection of overweight and obesity in children. Research is underway in association with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to establish the use and types of foods and drinks stocked in vending machines in post primary schools.  The HSE has also developed a Physical Activity Plan for Ireland to give clear direction for the promotion of physical activity in Ireland and address the risk of developing health problems associated with sustained inactivity.  </p><p>  A sugar sweetened drinks levy is just one of a range of actions that have been under consideration. A Steering Group was established to oversee the carrying out of a Health Impact Assessment on the health and economic aspects of introducing a Sugar Sweetened Drinks tax.  The Institute of Public Health facilitated the Department of Health with this assessment.  I intend to publish this assessment in the near future.</p><p>  The Special Action Group on Obesity is now looking at ways of reducing food consumption from the top shelf of the food pyramid, in accordance with this Department's Healthy Eating Guidelines.</p></reply>

Pre-hospital emergency care supports wider healthcare reform such as the reorganisation of acute care provision, including the Small Hospitals Framework, and implementation of the clinical care programmes. </p><p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority has developed a set of key performance indicators (KPIs), which classify 999 emergency calls by clinical status. Clinical Status 1 Echo calls involve life-threatening emergencies of cardiac or respiratory origin.  Clinical Status 1 Delta calls involve life-threatening emergencies of other than cardiac or respiratory origin. The target times for responding to Echo 1 and Delta 1 calls are 7 minutes 59 seconds by a first responder (a person trained in minimum basic life support and use of a defibrillator) and 18 minutes 59 seconds for a patient-carrying vehicle. With effect from January 2012, HIQA  set the target for first responders to meet the  response time (7 minutes 59 seconds) in 75% of cases. From January 2013 the target  for patient-carrying vehicles is to meet the  Clinical Status 1 ECHO incidents  response time (18 minutes 59 seconds) in 85% of cases.    </p><p>  Following a review of the validity of time-based KPIs for clinical status data, and in line with international views, it is considered that clinical outcome indicators would be more appropriate, and work has begun on their development.  I also welcome the consequential outcome that use of clinical indicators will enable a focus on Clinical Status 1 (Echo and Delta) calls.</p><p>  The NAS has been taking a number of steps to improve response times. These include development of a Performance Improvement Action Plan, an intermediate care service, the control centre reconfiguration project and a trial emergency aeromedical service.  Following a referral to the Labour Court under the Public Service Agreement, the NAS is progressing a number of efficiencies arising from the Court's recommendations, including the issue of overtime built in to rosters.  New rosters are now in place and are operating successfully.</p><p>  Through its control centre reconfiguration project, the NAS is continuing to rationalise the number of ambulance control rooms across the country, with a target of one system across 2 sites - Tallaght and Ballyshannon. The current total is nine. This project is focused on improving call taking and dispatch functions and on delivering improved technology. This will assist in improving response times and will allow the NAS to deploy resources in a much more effective and efficient manner, on a regional and national basis rather than within small geographic areas.  </p><p>  The Emergency Aeromedical Service (EAS) was initiated as a 12 month trial in June 2012, with two purposes - to reduce the transit time to an appropriate facility for certain conditions, particularly in the West, and to determine the extent, if any, of the need for aeromedical support to the NAS and, if required, how best to provide it. The trial involves the Irish Air Corps providing aeromedical support to the HSE NAS, from a base in Custume Barracks, Athlone.  The aircraft is operated by the Air Corps, with clinical staffing from the NAS. The Irish Coast Guard also provides additional support to the primary aircraft, using its new search and rescue helicopter in Shannon, staffed by its own paramedics and an NAS advanced paramedic when necessary.  </p><p>  The NAS is developing non-emergency transport, through a national intermediate care service (ICS), which is key to resolving bed and clinical management pressures.  ICS will allow for safe, planned and timely clinical transfers of inpatients to the most appropriate facility, depending on their acuity and clinical needs.  This will allow for beds to be made available for higher acuity admissions through emergency departments.  ICS will also release emergency resources for emergency functions, for improved response times and performances in pre-hospital care.  To date, ICS has been implemented in Cavan, Castleblayney, South County Dublin, Letterkenny, Sligo, Galway, Limerick, Roscommon, Mallow and Bantry.  Supported by the 2013 National Service Plan, the NAS intends to expand ICS to Waterford, Cork, Tralee, Castlebar and Drogheda and to increase services in Dublin and Galway during 2013.</p><p>  The NAS, with the Retrieval and Transport Medicine Programme, will also use these additional services to support the Critical Care Programme, through the establishment and extension of critical care retrieval services.</p></reply>

The Unit's purpose is to improve access to healthcare, both scheduled and unscheduled. Since it was established last year, it has been working to unblock public access to acute services by improving patient journeys through the system and by streamlining public hospital waiting lists. I am pleased to be able to say that very significant progress has been made by the SDU in relation to scheduled care waiting times.</p><p>  Waiting times for endoscopy procedures have been a particular focus for the Special Delivery Unit's Scheduled Care Team, with a target set for 2012 in the HSE Service Plan was that no-one should wait more than 13 weeks for a routine endoscopy procedure. By year-end, the numbers waiting longer than 13 weeks for routine endoscopy had fallen by 99%, from 4,590 in December 2011 to 36 patients at the end of December 2012.  This is a significant achievement which shows what can be done to tackle access. The progress made in 2012 does not mean all problems are solved, and 2013 will remain very challenging. However, the improvement reflects my commitment, and that of this Government, to ensuring patients can access the acute hospital services they need, when they need them.</p></reply>

The LPT Return must be submitted and payment details provided to Revenue by 7 May, if using the paper return, and by 28 May if using Revenue&rsquo;s online facility. </p><p>  I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a wide range of payment options is available to liable persons (including those who qualify for deferral but who wish to pay the tax), which will allow them to pay their LPT liability in full or by way of phased payments.   Payment of LPT can be made in full by way of a Single Debit Authority, which is the equivalent of an electronic cheque; by using a debit or credit card online; or in cash through approved payment service providers. There will also be an option to pay the tax for 2013 in equal instalments over the period 1 July to 31 December 2013.  Instalment payments can be made by way of deduction at source from employment, occupational pension income or from certain payments made by the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, by direct debit or also in cash through approved payment service providers. </p><p>  I am further informed by Revenue that, for 2013, the Single Debit Authority payment will be deducted from the nominated bank account on 21 July 2013.  The timing of phased payments depends on the particular payment option chosen such that payments made by way of deduction at source will commence from 1 July 2013 onwards, whereas payments made by direct debit will commence on 15 July 2013 and will be deducted on the 15th day of each month thereafter and phased payments by cash through a payment service provider should be spread equally by the property owner over the period 1 July to 31 December 2013.  </p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners also advise that where any of the phased payment options is chosen, no additional administration or interest charge is imposed by Revenue.  Normal transactional charges, however, may be levied by the property owner&rsquo;s financial institution or by a payment service provider where the property owner chooses to make their payment via a Single Debit Authority, a debit or credit card, a direct debit or by way of cash payments.</p><p>  Finally, I am satisfied that the range of payment options provided will allow liable persons choose whatever payment option suits their own particular circumstances.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Local Property Tax (LPT) is a self-assessment tax so in the first instance it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property.  The impact of serious and regular flooding on a property would be one of the factors that a property owner would take into account in valuing their property. </p><p>  In addition, one of the advantages of the banding system of values provided for in the legislation is to remove the need for precision in relation to the market value, except for properties worth over &euro;1million.  The Revenue Commissioners are preparing valuation guidance and developing a guide to assist liable persons in assessing the value of their property which will take account of location. Where these guidelines are used honestly, together with a liable person&rsquo;s own knowledge of their property, the property valuation will not be challenged by Revenue in accordance with its normal Customer Service Charter.</p></reply>

This provision is however specific to beer, and there is no corresponding provision to cover other fermented beverages, including cider. Under EU law (Art 13(2) of Council Directive 92/83/EEC) we are obliged to apply the same rate of excise duty to all other fermented beverages, which include cider. Ireland has however used the option under paragraph (3) of that article, to apply two lower rates to cider below 8.5% vol and 6% vol.     A reduced rate of tax for low strength cider was also introduced, with effect from 15 October 2008, for cider of a strength not exceeding 2.8% alcohol by volume, as provided for under Article 5 of the Directive.  Under the current EU legislative framework, a reduced rate could not be introduced for cider produced by small operators. </p><p>  While there is an exemption for small scale cider producers in the UK of up to 7000 hectolitres, I understand that this exemption pre-dates the Directive.</p><p>  A cider manufacturer's licence is also required for the production of cider on a commercial basis under the Finance (1909-1910) Act 1910.	</p></reply>

Where there is no transaction, there is no tax. Lowering the rate does not guarantee an increase in the number of transactions.   The drop in the CGT yield over recent years can be attributed to declining asset values and a reduction in the number of property and share transactions.  In order to protect and enhance the yield it was necessary to increase the CGT rate in Budget and Finance Bill 2013 to 33%. As well as required reductions in expenditure to reduce our budget deficit, some increases in taxation are also necessary. Increasing tax on capital is less damaging for the economy than increasing taxes on income. I do not propose to reduce the rate of CGT for the reasons outlined.</p></reply>

Any amounts withdrawn will be subject to tax at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate. The option will be available for 3 years from the passing of the Finance Bill. These provisions were included in Finance Bill 2013, which was published yesterday.   This is a restricted measure which will enable rather than incentivize certain individuals to access part of their pension savings beyond their regular or compulsory pension contributions. I do not wish to damage future pension provision and it is important that individuals continue to provide for their retirement.

However, by way of general information, the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 provides for a number of specific exemptions from the Local Property Tax (LPT) as well as the possibility of deferring the charge in certain cases of inability to pay.    Under Section 5 of the Act an exemption may be obtained where a property that was previously occupied by a person as his or her sole or main residence has been vacated by the person for 12 months or more due to long term mental or physical infirmity. An exemption may also apply where the period is less than 12 months, if a doctor is satisfied that the person is unlikely at any stage to return to the property. In both cases, the exemption only applies where the property is not occupied by any other person. </p><p>  I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that where a residential property is the sole or main residence of a liable person who has estimated gross income from all sources of less than &euro;15,000 for a single person or &euro;25,000 for a couple, the liable person(s) will be eligible to apply for full deferral of the LPT charge. To determine whether deferral applies for 2013, liable persons are required to estimate on 1 May 2013 what their total gross income for 2013 is likely to be.  Gross income from all sources means income before any deductions, allowances or reliefs that may be taken into account for income tax purposes and includes income that is exempt from income tax and income received from the Department of Social Protection. </p><p>  In addition, owner-occupiers will qualify for deferral of 50% of the LPT liability where their estimated gross income from all sources is less than &euro;25,000 if they are single and &euro;35,000 for a couple.  The balance of 50% of the tax must be paid. </p><p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 also contains a number of specific deferral provisions that cater for cases of low income and significant mortgage burden. </p><p>  I appreciate that there will be some property owners who may find themselves unable to pay LPT but who do not qualify for a deferral under the existing provisions.  For this reason, I have brought forward enabling legislation in the Finance (Local Property Tax)(Amendment) Bill 2013, which was published yesterday, to allow for a measure of discretion to be exercised by the Revenue Commissioners in deciding whether to grant a deferral in particular circumstances. The detail of how this type of discretionary deferral will operate and the criteria that will be used to determine eligibility is not set out in this Bill, but instead, will be set out in guidelines that will be published by the Revenue Commissioners before they commence corresponding with liable persons about LPT in March 2013.  The type of circumstances that will apply are where a liable person is unable without excessive hardship to pay LPT when it becomes payable as a consequence of a significant and unexpected financial loss or expense.  This particular deferral will operate on a different basis to the existing deferral arrangements.  It will not automatically be available on the making of a valid claim. Instead, a liable person must apply in writing to the Revenue Commissioners for the deferral and must meet whatever criteria will be set out in the guidelines to be published by the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

A process has been prescribed which will ensure the optimum value is advanced in the disposal of the assets.   Following an independent valuation process, the Special Liquidators will sell the assets of IBRC (which are subject to a floating charge which secures IBRC debt to the Central Bank which will be sold to NAMA) to third parties at or above their independent valuation and failing that the Special Liquidators will sell the assets to NAMA at their valuation price. Third parties including loan counterparties and other financial institutions will be given the opportunity to bid for specific portfolios as part of an open and transparent sales process. If after the independent valuation exercise, the value of the assets sold by the Special Liquidators is not sufficient to compensate NAMA for the amount it paid for the net IBRC debt owed to the Central Bank, then the Minister for Finance will reimburse NAMA for the shortfall. However if the value of the assets is sufficient to repay that debt in full, the Special Liquidator will retain surplus assets for the benefit of other unsecured creditors. This process will ensure that a fire sale of assets will not occur.

A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits and profits from certain petroleum, mining or land dealing activities.  In a number of answers to previous Parliamentary Questions on this issue I have repeatedly stated that there is no agreed international methodology for calculating the &#8216;effective rate&#8217; of corporation tax.  With that in mind, I am unsure as to the premise of the Deputy&#8217;s question which seems to be that Ireland has an effective rate that is lower than 10%.</p><p>  I am aware of recent media reports which refer to the ways that some companies structure their international tax affairs to minimise their tax costs, and the fact that some of these reports make reference to Irish companies being part of these structures.  I understand that some of these reports have suggested that some companies in multinational groups pay Irish corporation tax at rates that are significantly lower than 12.5%.</p><p>  At this point it is important to state clearly that such companies are not paying a low rate of Irish tax &#8211; as already stated all companies in Ireland pay the standard 12.5% rate on their profits which are generated in Ireland.  The reports concerned appear to have incorrectly attributed to Ireland profits that represent the return due to assets in other jurisdictions, owned by group companies that are not resident in Ireland.</p><p>  It is incorrect to relate the 12.5% corporation tax rate to both the profits of the Irish-resident group companies <i>and</i> the profits of foreign-resident group companies&#8212; which are not profits chargeable to Irish corporation tax.  By mixing up the Irish profits and the foreign profits of multinational groups like this, these reports can produce an average tax rate for the companies concerned that is very significantly lower than 12.5% &#8212; and an incorrect inference that the full Irish profits are not being charged.</p></reply>

The Irish self-assessment system ensures that there are tight controls in place for tax return filing rates which are borne out by the timely filing rates of 98% for large cases, 95% for medium cases and 80% for all other cases, across all taxes.  This strategy is supported by a comprehensive compliance programme of audits, risk management interventions, special investigations and prosecutions.  I am further advised that, as Self-Assessment for income tax was introduced in 1988 and for corporation tax in 1989 and as the data is not maintained in a suitable format, it is not possible to provide all the details sought by the Deputy without an extensive examination of Revenue records.  However, they have supplied me with the Tables below, which give comprehensive data for seven years from <b>2006 to 2012</b>.

Not all Revenue interventions take the form of formal audits or investigations and in accordance with their risk-based approach cases are selected for intervention based on the presence of various risk indicators.  Each Revenue intervention is intended to be in the form which is most efficient in terms of time and resources, and which imposes the least cost on the taxpayer, whilst addressing the perceived risk and consequently Revenue carry out Risk Management Interventions, which take the form of Aspect Queries and Profile Interviews.</p><p>Revenue's objective in case working is to ensure that each case (taxpayer or business) is fully compliant with their legal obligations in relation to the keeping of proper books and records, the timely and accurate submission of required declarations and the prompt payment of tax and duty liabilities.  This approach ensures that, as far as possible, the self-assessment system operates effectively and minimises instances of fraud or mistake.</p><p>The selection of cases in which to intervene is a critical step in Revenue&rsquo;s compliance programme and case selection derives from a variety of sources.  In addition to specific projects like the shadow economy project, Revenue also uses extensive third party data, good citizen&rsquo;s reports and other intelligence to drive its compliance interventions.  In the past two years, Revenue has also been using advanced analytics to help it identify indicators of fraud or error from taxpayer&rsquo;s filings and they are regarded as a leading tax administration in the deployment of these technologies.</p><p>I am also informed that a major focus of Revenue&rsquo;s activities in relation to self-assessed cash businesses is to tackle shadow economy activities including the suppression of sales, wages and income by registered businesses and fraudulent repayment claims.  It is a multi-faceted issue that requires a co-ordinated and varied response.</p><p>Revenue tackles the problem of the shadow economy through its range of compliance and audit interventions including through targeted special projects. Case interventions are undertaken based on Revenue&rsquo;s assessment of compliance risks, the level of those risks and other relevant information available.  Revenue is using a wide range of methodologies to identify those operating in the shadow economy and is deploying the full range of compliance interventions.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware of the continuing strengthening of legislation to provide for a robust framework within which the Revenue Commissioners may tackle tax evasion, including recent provisions relating to the making of returns of transactions by merchant acquirers, and other payment settlement organisations, to the Revenue Commissioners and Regulations, introduced in 2011, requiring Government Departments and State Bodies to supply details to the Revenue Commissioners of payments made.</p><p>Revenue investigations have also detected the use of computer programmes or electronic devices to alter or conceal sales records.  To counteract these risks, legislation was also enacted in 2011 providing penalties for the possession, use or supply of automated sales suppression devices known as &quot;zappers&quot; for the purpose of evading tax.</p><p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the results from all the various projects undertaken by Revenue are reflected in the general audit and compliance results from audits, assurance checks, and other risk management intervention which are published in Revenue&rsquo;s Annual Report.  The high level of success in securing settlements is a reflection of the targeted approach used by Revenue which is to focus its compliance resources on the areas of greatest risk.  An associated strategy is to minimise the number of contacts with compliant taxpayers.</p><p>I am confident that the Revenue Commissioners have a very clear focus to target and confront those who do not comply, as set out in their Statement of Strategy for 2011 to 2013.</p></reply>

The charge is based on the amount of the expense that is not made good to the employer by the employee.  Facilities provided to hospital consultants for use in their private practice can include equipment, premises and staff.  Determining the expense incurred by the employer in the provision of these facilities is particularly difficult.  For example, the value of the use of hospital premises is defined as the annual rent that might be expected to be obtained on a yearly letting.  In the case of a specialised building such as a hospital this would be difficult to ascertain.  In the case of other assets such as machinery the value of the use of the machinery is taken to be 5% of its market value.  Again, this would be difficult to determine given the nature of the equipment in a hospital.</p><p>  Hospital facilities are not provided solely to enable the consultants to carry on private practice in the hospitals concerned.  Clearly, the primary purpose of the provision of the facilities is to enable the consultant to treat public patients.</p><p>  The difficulty in determining a benefit in kind charge is further compounded by the fact that the facilities can be shared by a number of consultants to varying degrees and that usage can vary depending on the availability of a consultant and the extent to which his or her specialist services may be required.  Taking all these factors together it is difficult to establish for each individual consultant a charge that reflects the benefit received.  Given that benefit in kind is operated via the PAYE system attempting to quantify a charge would impose a significant burden on payroll departments.</p><p>  The application of benefit in kind in these circumstances is complicated but I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that this particular issue is under active consideration.</p><p>  In the circumstances it is not possible to estimate the yield from the imposition of a benefit in kind charge.</p></reply>

Consequently I am not in a position to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals.  My Department has however made enquiries with the Irish Insurance Federation (IIF) about the provision of flood cover in the circumstance you have described.

With regard to the capital element the &#8364;25bn par value will be repaid in line with the schedule given above. With regard to the interest projections, as the Deputy will be aware, the Irish Government Bonds that have been issued in exchange for the Promissory Notes are floating rate bonds.  The coupon on these bonds is 6-month Euribor plus a margin ranging from 2.50% to 2.68%.  Given the nature of this floating rate it is impossible to be accurate with regard to the exact interest cost in 2013 to 2015. </p><p>  As part of the explanatory information that was released by the Department of Finance in relation to the transaction last week, estimates were produced which showed an interest expense of &#8364;750 million for 2013, &#8364;875 million for 2014 and &#8364;950 million for 2015.  A copy of this presentation is available on the Department of Finance website under the following link: <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i></p><p>  With regard to the projected annual cash return to the State from the Central Bank of Ireland this is also impossible to forecast accurately due to the associated cost of funding that the Central Bank of Ireland must pay to the ECB, the floating rate interest that it receives on the bonds that it holds and any mark-to-market implications for valuing the bonds. Again, estimates were produced in the explanatory information that was released by the Department of Finance in relation to the transaction last week.  This assumed zero mark-to-market implications for the bond as it was not possible to estimate if the bonds would trade upwards or downwards post issuance.</p><p>  Under the old financing structure IBRC would have held the Promissory Notes for a weighted average of 7-8 years, whereas under the new structure the Central Bank of Ireland will hold the bonds for a weighted average of 4c.14.3 years.</p><p>  The net present value of the portfolio of bonds is &#8364;25bn which is equal to the par value of the Promissory Notes that they have replaced.</p><p>  With regard to the net present value gain in this arrangement, as the Deputy is aware, the calculation of a net present value is based on a number of mathematical assumptions, including what discount rate to apply and assumptions around future refinancing rates, all of which will depend upon the outcome of future events.  These assumptions can have a material impact on the ultimate valuation which is subject to a wide range of possible outcomes. For that reason, the Department did not produce a net present value figure for publication last week and I am not in a position to give one now.  I can assure the Deputy that a key determinant of the value of the new arrangement was debt sustainability.</p><p>  The Central Bank of Ireland will sell the bonds but only where such a sale is not disruptive to financial stability.  They have however undertaken that minimum of bonds will be sold in accordance with the following schedule: to end 2014 (&#8364;0.5bn), 2015-2018 (&#8364;0.5bn p.a.), 2019-2023 (&#8364;1bn p.a.), 2024 and after (&#8364;2bn p.a.).</p></reply>

The Department subsequently invited patron bodies to make applications for patronage of the new primary schools to be established in 2012 and 2013.  Following the assessment process of the applications concerned, approval was conveyed in March 2012 last for the establishment in September 2013 next of two primary schools in the area referred to by the Deputy.  My Department is working closely with the Local Authority to acquire a suitable site for the construction of permanent accommodation for both schools.  A major building project for the provision of this accommodation was included in the five year construction programme announced in March 2012, and is scheduled to proceed to construction in 2014/2015.  The current status of all projects on the school building programme may be viewed on my Department's website at www.education.ie and this is updated regularly throughout the year. </p></reply>

The primary aim at the core of the Five Year Plan is focussed on meeting demographic demands to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to cope with increasing pupil numbers.</p><p>  Details of the projects included in the Five Year Plan, including those projects referred to by the Deputy, may be viewed on my Department's website www.education.ie.

The following reflects the current position of the specific school building projects to which the Deputy refers:</p><p>  SN Mhuire, Ma Nealta Ceannanus Mor - A new 4 classroom school reached substantial completion in 2012. Dunshaughlin Community College - A large scale extension project commenced on site in September 2012.</p><p>  New 1,000 pupil school in Ashbourne, Gaelscoil na M&iacute;, Ashbourne and a New ET school for Ashbourne - my Department has sought the assistance of, and is working closely with, the relevant Local Authority in relation to identifying and acquiring a suitable sites for the schools.  White Cross NS - the project is currently at an early stage 2 of architectural planning. Upon completion of Stage 2(a) and subject to no issues arising, the project will then progress to stage 2(b) which is the final design stage in the architectural planning process and includes the planning application and completion of tender documents.</p><p>  St Peter's College, Dunboyne and Ratoath Community College &ndash; the projects to deliver extensions to the schools were devolved for delivery to Co. Meath VEC.  The VEC has appointed a Design Team to each project. The project for St Peter's College is at the early stages of Architectural Planning and Ratoath Community College is at an advanced stage of Architectural Planning.</p><p>  SN Bheinn Naofa Duleek (Boys and Girls) &ndash; the project has been devolved for delivery to the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) and the NDFA has recently appointed a Design Team to advance the project.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-14a.491.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1035" speakername="Ruairi Quinn" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021400078#WRL00900"><p>Tackling the costs associated with school is a major priority of mine and there are practical steps that schools can take to reduce these costs for parents.</p><p>  One such step is the establishment of Textbook Rental Schemes by schools. I am very much in favour of schools establishing such schemes.  Schools that have such rental schemes can save parents up to 80% of the cost of buying new books. Because of this, I launched &quot;Guidelines for Developing Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools&quot; on 28 January 2013. The Guidelines provide practical advice to primary and post-primary schools on how rental schemes can be established and operated.</p><p>  These Guidelines along with a Guide for Parents to inform them of how the schemes operate and how parents can help schools to establish and run them are currently being sent out to every school in the country and are also available on my Department's website. They were also made available for the websites of both national parents' councils, Barnardos and the society of St Vincent de Paul.</p><p>  In addition, I received a commitment from the Irish Educational Publishers Association to limit the publication of new editions of textbooks and to maintain editions of books in print, unchanged for at least six years.  The publishers  have assured me  that they would sell books for rental schemes to schools at substantial discounts.  Furthermore, I have once again secured protection of the budget for school book grants at &euro;15 million in 2013.   I have previously put on the record of this House my support for any measures that can be put in place to reduce uniform costs for parents including measures such as the use of generic type uniforms or the use of &quot;sew on&quot; crests.</p><p>  I have raised this matter informally with the National Parents Council at primary level and I recommended that the National Parents Councils &ndash; Primary and Post Primary mobilise parents associations to raise this issue with school authorities.  It is important that schools are sensitive to the financial pressures on parents in making decisions, not just about school uniforms but about any matter that has cost implications for parents.  The position in relation to voluntary contributions is that the charging of fees by a school is permissible only in the case of recognised fee-charging second level schools.</p><p>  All other recognised schools are precluded from charging school fees. Voluntary contributions by parents of pupils in such recognised schools are permissible provided it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay and that, in making a contribution, they are doing so of their own volition. The manner in which such voluntary contributions are sought and collected is a matter for school management; however their collection should be such as not to create a situation where either parents or pupils could reasonably infer that the contributions take on a compulsory character.</p></reply>

To facilitate easier reporting by Public Bodies a new website, e.gov.ie, was launched on 23 January 2013. A first progress report under eGovernment 2012-2015 will be submitted to Government by the end of the first quarter of this year. I intend to make this report publicly available.</p><p>  In advance of the progress report being completed, I am pleased to note that a huge amount of public data is being published and that organisations are actively working to ensure that this data is re-usable.</p><p>  Examples of how public data is being published and re-used include: the cooperation between the Central Statistics Office and the All-Ireland Research Observatory (AIRO) to provide the public with a new set of mapping tools to allow users to take advantage of the massive amount of census data that is available; the Irish Spatial Data Exchange (ISDE) which allows users to search for data or data services from multiple participating Public Bodies; the National Transport Authority&#8217;s Journey Planner which contains all public transport route and timetable information across all public transport providers; the fixyourstreet.ie facility which allows citizens to report faults to their local authorities. An application programming interface (API) is available and is being used by interested groups; and Oireachtas debates are published in both PDF and machine-readable formats.</p></reply>

It is intended to carry out a major refurbishment project at this location.  In that regard, a significant amount of preparatory work has been completed by the Office of Public Works (OPW) on design and contract documentation.  Due to current financial constraints, affecting this and other construction projects, it is not possible at this stage to say when tenders will be invited or when construction works will commence on site.  The matter will continue to be reviewed in light of the availability of capital funding in the OPW Vote and the priority attached to the project by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the context of its overall building programme.</p><p>  Separate facilities have been provided for the Garda Water Unit in Athlone.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-14a.519.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021400078#WRL02800"><p> The Land Conveyancing and Law Reform Act, 2009, abolished upward-only rent reviews for all new leases signed on or after 28th February 2010.  When the Government came into office, it gave extensive consideration to abolishing upward-only rent reviews in leases signed before 28th   February 2010.  </p><p>  The advice received by the Government was that it was not possible to develop a scheme to tackle this issue that would not be vulnerable to a Constitutional challenge or compensation claims from landlords.  On the basis of this advice, the Government concluded that it was not feasible to legislate to abolish upward only rent reviews.</p><p>  However, the Government has taken steps to address the issue where possible.  In the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, the Government undertook to place downward pressure on commercial rents where the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) had acquired the loan on the underlying property.  NAMA approves requests for rent easement or abatement from its debtors where a tenant demonstrates that the rent payable under the lease is in excess of current market levels and that the viability of a business is, as a consequence, threatened.  </p><p>  I understand that by the end of 2012, NAMA had received 276 eligible applications and had granted 212 applications for rent abatement with an aggregate annual value of &euro;13.5 million. A further 56 applications were under review. Of the 276 eligible applications received, only 8 were refused, representing a 97% approval rate by NAMA. NAMA&rsquo;s Guidance Note on upward only commercial leases is available on the agency&rsquo;s website, www.nama.ie. The agency engages with industry representative bodies in the retail sector to promote understanding of the Guidance Note and its applicability. </p><p>  In addition, the Property Services (Regulation) Act, 2011, provides for the establishment and maintenance of a Commercial Leases Database by the Property Services Regulatory Authority, which is expected to capture information in relation to the rent agreed and other clauses within commercial leases agreed in the future.  I understand that work is under way to ensure that the database will be operational at an early date. The database will go toward enhancing transparency in the commercial property market.</p><p>  Businesses can, of course, seek to negotiate a rent reduction directly with their landlord, even where upward only rent reviews exist in leases.  There are a number of instances where businesses have secured rent reductions through negotiations of this nature.  </p></reply>

Part of the remit of the South East Forum, which I established following the Talk Talk job losses, was to examine ways of ensuring better synchronisation of effort by these agencies and stakeholders in order to avoid duplication, and produce synergies that would lead to job creation and investment opportunities in the region. The South East Action Plan has a number of recommendations which the agencies and stakeholders are charged with implementing. I am satisfied that all these key players in the region have been working together, from within existing budgets, to achieve the Plan&rsquo;s recommendations.</p><p>  Between 2010 and 2012, Enterprise Ireland approved over &euro;40m to companies in the South East to support a range of activities from Start-up, R&amp;D, Management Development, &lsquo;Lean&rsquo; business processes and expansion.   There were a number of significant jobs announcements for the South East in 2012 e.g. the Eishtec Call Centre in Waterford city created 280 Enterprise Ireland-supported jobs; a further 65 Enterprise Ireland-supported jobs new jobs were created by Dawn Meats as a result of a 5 year &euro;300m contract with McDonald&rsquo;s restaurants; the two local Waterford City and County Enterprise Boards have created 59 new jobs; and Danone Baby Nutrition in Wexford announced an investment of &euro;20m in its manufacturing facility which will create around 45 new jobs at its plant.</p><p>  The cost of creating and supporting IDA Ireland&rsquo;s jobs in the South East, between 2010 and 2011, was &euro;25m. IDA Ireland has been very active in seeking to win additional investment for Waterford. This is evidenced in the most recent announcement on 12 February that Sanofi, a world-leading healthcare company, will invest &euro;44m in Genzyme&rsquo;s biotechnology campus in Waterford. This follows a &euro;150m investment made more than a year ago, and will ensure that this facility can produce the company&rsquo;s latest product. It provides an indication of the Waterford site&rsquo;s strategic value to the company. Sanofi&rsquo;s investment represents a very positive result for Waterford and Ireland and fits in with IDA Ireland&rsquo;s focus on the life sciences as a key growth area.</p><p>  All the key State players have been actively pursuing initiatives to facilitate development and job creation in the South East region, and I look forward to continued co-operation and collaboration with real benefits for the region.</p></reply>

The aim of the Action Plan for Jobs is to support the creation of 100,000 net new jobs by 2016, while the objective of Pathways to Work is to ensure that as many of those jobs as possible go to those who are currently unemployed. The Plan is a whole of Government plan with a national focus across all regions.</p><p>  The Enterprise Development agencies are at the forefront of implementing the Action Plan for Jobs and continue to ensure that enterprises can maximise their contribution to economic recovery and jobs growth. Despite a very difficult domestic and external economic environment, we are beginning to see the positive impact of the Government&rsquo;s policies. 2012 saw significant net job creation by EI and IDA-supported companies, building on the positive results of 2011 and following successive years of significant net job losses. </p><p>  My Department has successfully delivered on national actions, such as the establishment of the Microfinance Loan Fund and the Credit Guarantee Scheme, both of which will increase access to finance for enterprises and entrepreneurs throughout the country.</p><p>  IDA continues to market the North East Region for new inward investment through its Gateway of Dundalk, in line with the Government&rsquo;s National Spatial Strategy (NSS).   IDA works closely with its 34 client companies in the North East Region that currently employ circa 3,211 people.  At the end of 2012, there were 6 IDA Ireland supported companies in Monaghan employing circa 350 people and IDA continues to promote the county as part of its marketing strategy.  </p><p>  Enterprise Ireland provides a range of supports for High Potential Start-Up (HPSU&rsquo;s) companies including, financial supports, business and marketing advice, mentoring, product development etc. Five HPSU&rsquo;s were created in Monaghan since 2008 with a number of projects in the pipeline. EI also works with Monaghan County Enterprise Board and Monaghan County Development Board in enhancing economic development within the County. Payments of over &euro;4 million were made to EI companies in Monaghan in 2012. To date in 2013, over &euro;100,000 has been approved to Monaghan companies.  In 2012, EI client companies employed 3,871 people in County Monaghan.</p><p>  Ensuring that more micro and small businesses can start up, expand and export is a key pillar of the Government&rsquo;s plans for jobs and growth. In November 2012, I announced that primary legislation will be drafted to dissolve the existing County and City Enterprise Boards and create an enhanced national micro-enterprise support model, delivered through Local Enterprise Offices to be established in each Local Authority area. </p><p>  Pending the introduction of these arrangements, County and City Enterprise Boards, including Monaghan CEB, will continue to ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development and engage and work with micro-enterprises employing less than 10 persons, on an on-going basis, with strong referral to sister agencies to progress the needs of the businesses in their respective areas. In 2012, Monaghan CEB provided funding of &euro;712,306 to micro-enterprises in Monaghan. </p><p>  I am currently preparing the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government, and in that context, am exploring further measures which can be taken to transform our economy and support job creation across all regions of the country. </p></reply>

There may be rare situations where a company in the gambling sector also operates in another sector, whether through a &ldquo;ring-fenced&rdquo; unit or subsidiary, and provided this other activity is one of the eligible activities permitted under the Industrial Development Acts, Enterprise Ireland may provide support for these other activities and the persons employed in that unit or subsidiary.</p><p>  Given the very narrow scope of intervention which Enterprise Ireland can pursue legally and in line with policy, the strategy in place for supporting companies in these sectors is to work with Irish companies where the primary activity is the development for sale on world markets of new technologies (or the products and services associated with these new technologies), within the confines of legislation and policy. </p></reply>

The statutory order of priority is of no consequence where a scheme winds up with sufficient assets to meet all of its liabilities.  In a wind&ndash;up situation where there are insufficient funds to meet all liabilities, all pensioner benefits except post-retirement increases, are given the highest priority after wind-up expenses and additional voluntary contributions made by individuals.

It is applied uniformly and without distinction as to gender or ethnicity. The HRC guidelines were reviewed in 2011 and the updated guidelines were made available on the Department&rsquo;s website in June 2011 after training had been rolled out to all staff.

Carer's allowance is a means tested payment for people who are providing full time care and attention to a person who needs that level of care.  Since September 2007, if a person is getting certain social welfare payments and also providing full time care and attention to another person, they can keep their main social welfare payment and also get a half-rate carer's allowance.</p><p>  The income disregard and means test for carers is the most generous within the social welfare system.  A couple under 66 with two children, earning a joint annual income of up to &euro;35,400 can qualify for maximum payment carer&rsquo;s allowance while such a couple earning &euro;59,300 will still qualify for the minimum rate and may also qualify for the household benefits package.</p><p>  There are currently over 52,000 people in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s allowance payment.  The expected expenditure for the scheme in 2013 is &euro;509 million.  Of those in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance over 23,000 are getting half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance in addition to another social welfare payment at an annual cost of some &euro;90 million.  All carer&rsquo;s allowance recipients are entitled to the annual respite care grant and a free travel pass.  The number in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s allowance payment from the Department has increased by more than 150% in the last 10 years from 20,000 in 2001 to 52,000 in 2012.  Expenditure on the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme has increased by almost 220% in the same period.</p><p>  The rate of the annual respite care grant was reduced from &euro;1,700 to &euro;1,350 in the Budget.  This grant is paid automatically to all those in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit and domiciliary care allowance in June of each year.  The grant is not means tested and is also available to those people who are not in receipt of one of the above payments but are providing full-time care and attention to a person who needs this care.  The estimated expenditure on the respite care grant in 2013 is &euro;110 million.</p></reply>

The approach differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice.  The first two elements involve the enhancement of the website   and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline within the Citizens Information Board (CIB), both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears. </p><p>  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders. This advice will be provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service. </p><p>When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender will advise the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, then the lender will pay &#8364;250 to an accountant of the borrower&#8217;s choosing for the provision of this advice.  The independent financial advice is available to all mortgage holders in respect of a mortgage secured on a primary residence who have been offered long-term forbearance options by their lenders.  An operating protocol for the provision of this advice has been agreed between the main accountancy bodies and the Irish Banking Federation.  To date, some 2,700 accountants have confirmed to their accounting body that they wish to be part of the panel and their details are listed on a county by county basis on the website .  </p><p>  The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 provides new and more flexible options to address the circumstances of insolvent debtors.  Among the non-judicial debt resolution processes to deal with personal debt is the granting of a Debt Relief Notice to persons with no assets or no income with unsecured debts of up to &#8364;20,000.  With the assistance of an approved intermediary, a person may apply for a Debt Relief Notice which will allow for the full write-off of qualifying unsecured debt after a three year supervision period.<b></b>The Citizens Information Board, which has the statutory responsibility for the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) has<font color="#4181C0"> </font>agreed to my request that MABS be an approved intermediary for the purpose of processing applications for Debt Relief Notices.  Those who can avail of Debt Relief Notices are typically part of the MABS core client cohort of people on low incomes in debt or in danger of falling into debt. </p><p>  Sanction has been given for 16 temporary staff to be assigned to MABS for up to 2 years, to establish an Approved Intermediary Service (AIS) for the purposes of processing Debt Relief Notices.  An implementation process is underway and the CIB/MABS are working closely with the new Insolvency Service to ensure that the AIS will be operational in time for the establishment of the Insolvency Service. </p><p>  I am confident that these new developments will provide people with the necessary supports to assist them address their debt difficulties.  </p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently over 87,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million for 2013.  Revised maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012 and are in place until June 2013.  The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.  It is essential that State support for rents are kept under review and do not distort the market in a way that could increase rent prices for others, such as low paid workers and students.</p><p>  Departmental records show that there were over 4,300 rent supplement claims in payment in County Kildare at the end of 2012, with over 1,000 in North Kildare (in Maynooth, Celbridge, Leixlip and Kilcock).  The number of rental properties available in North Kildare is somewhat lower than the numbers available in the rest of the county and therefore impacts on the number of accommodation units available for rent supplement.  Department officials dealing with rent supplement tenants will continue to ensure that their accommodation needs are met.</p><p>  The Department will continue to monitor rent levels throughout the country. The next review of rent limits will take place before June 2013 and any changes to the existing limits will be considered as part of this review.</p></reply>

This updated Action Plan reaffirms Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to a 20% energy savings target by 2020 in pursuit of our EU obligations.  This 20% saving is equivalent to 31,925 Gigawatt hours (GWh) or a reduction in annual CO2  emissions of around 7.7 Mega tonnes (Mt).</p><p>  The actions outlined in the Plan are projected to realise more savings than the 20% target, i.e. 34,060GWh of energy savings in 2020, which is equivalent to a 21.1% saving on the baseline period; an overachievement of 1.1 percentage points.  Should all measures detailed in the plan reach their full potential by 2020, it is estimated that a potential reduction in energy spend across all sectors of approximately &euro;2.36 billion (at 2011 prices) will be realised.  A very significant element of this will be savings in the public sector.</p><p>  The Plan will contain 97 actions, each of which will play a part in securing a more sustainable energy future for Ireland.  Of the 97 actions, the following five will play an integral role in the delivery of the national target: 1. In the Public sector, the introduction of a series of obligations on public sector bodies to address consumption, procurement and reporting of energy use; 2. the establishment of a national Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) process to deliver innovative models of retrofitting and financing of energy efficiency measures in the commercial and public sectors.  This will be underpinned by an Energy Efficiency Fund to which Government has already committed &euro;35 million in the 2013 Budget as seed capital; 3 the introduction of an appropriate Pay-As-You-Save (PAYS) model for Ireland to replace existing exchequer supports for domestic and non-domestic energy efficiency upgrade measures; 4 the Better Energy programme will deliver energy efficiency improvements across a number of sectors including energy saving targets for energy suppliers; and 5.a Cross-Departmental Implementation Group will be established to ensure that all the actions contained in the Plan are delivered.</p><p>  A key focus of the Action Plan is the public sector, building upon the comprehensive suite of services and programmes provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).  To date, 15 public sector bodies have signed partnership agreements with the SEAI, targeted at reducing energy consumption in the public sector by 33% in 2020.  This year will also see the first public sector energy consumption report published by the SEAI.</p><p>  The SEAI&rsquo;s work in the public sector programme suggests that savings of 5-15% are possible with good structured energy management practices.  The SEAI is promoting this through its energy management tools, Energy MAP and ISO 50001.  To date, over 20 local authorities have undertaken Energy MAP training with an average saving of 5-10% after 6-12 months.  Another 50 public bodies have also undertaken Energy MAP training with similar results, including the HSE, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  A programme called Energy in Education promotes these principles to schools.</p><p>  Additionally, SEAI&rsquo;s partnership programme is now working with over 40 of the largest energy using public bodies.  These organisations are committed at the highest level to excellent energy management and realising their energy saving potential.  Through the partnership programme, good energy management practices and tailored supports, these public bodies are well established to deliver early, rapid and significant energy savings.  From a pilot of 18 organisations trialling the methodology to track public bodies&rsquo; progress towards the 2020 target, over 50% of them were well in advance of the 3% per year target.  The remaining public bodies will be served on a group basis and will achieve similar impacts.</p><p>  My Department and the SEAI in 2010 began a 3 year project to develop a Monitoring and Reporting system to track public bodies&rsquo; progress towards the 33% and 3240GWh targets.  To date, over 33,000 meter points have been collated on a database to source the consumption data direct from the meter operators.  In 2013 a dedicated software system will be developed which will also integrate with the National Procurement Service (NPS) for procurement purposes and the Environmental Protection Agency for carbon reporting.  In Q2 2013 the 2011 progress report will be issued for the top 135 energy using public bodies.  In Q4 2013 the 2012 progress report will be issued by the SEAI.  It is envisaged that the various initiatives and monitoring process will greatly encourage and motivate public bodies to increase their level of activity.</p></reply>

It is part of a range of measures in this regard including the Review of Capital Investment (2011), which sets out investment priorities for the years 2010-2016.  The Review represents a reappraisal of the Government&rsquo;s Public Capital Programme, designed to re-focus investment plans and ready the Irish economy for a return to growth.</p><p>  The focus of the Value for Money and Policy Reviews is to provide a tool for systematic analysis of programmes and polices rather than agencies per se, and this tool is available, together with guidelines prepared by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on its application, to all of the bodies under the aegis of my Department.</p><p>  My Department has completed a number of Value for Money and Policy Reviews, most recently publishing two initial reviews on proposed mergers of bodies under the aegis of the Department (Broadcasting Authority of Ireland with ComReg, and Digital Hub Development Agency with Dublin City Council), and participated in a review of merger of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland, the Property Registration Authority and Valuation office, which has been led by the Department of Justice and Equality.  My Department is currently carrying out a review on the method of financing public service broadcasting.</p></reply>

For that reason information on the number of homeless persons in Meath is not available.  However, the Housing Agency&#8217;s Housing Needs Assessment 2008 and 2011 reports break down the categories of housing need, including in respect of homelessness, for all 88 housing authorities nationwide.  These are available on my Department&#8217;s website at   This statutory assessment of housing need, carried out every three years by all housing authorities, only counts homeless persons where an application has been made to a housing authority.  On 6 September 2012, the CSO published its special Census report, <i>Homeless Persons in Ireland</i> and it indicated that 32 persons were either sleeping rough or in accommodation designated for the homeless on the night of 10 April 2011 in the d East Region which includes Counties Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.  I will shortly publish a policy statement on homelessness.  In this statement I will be indicating what I expect from housing authorities and other stakeholders in accelerating progress towards realising the ambition of eliminating involuntary long-term homelessness.</p></reply>

The guidelines are also intended to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country in the identification of suitable locations for wind energy development and the treatment of planning applications for such developments.  This mapping of suitable locations is carried out through the development plan process which makes extensive statutory provision for public consultation.  Planning legislation and Regulations provide for extensive public notification of proposed development by way of site notice and notice in a newspaper approved for this purpose.</p><p>  The planning authority is required, under section 34(3) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, to have regard to any observations or submissions received concerning the proposed development in accordance with the relevant regulations.  Furthermore, any person who makes a submission to the planning authority may appeal the decision of the planning authority to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.

Unfinished housing developments were divided into four categories as follows: Category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist; Category two, where a receiver has been appointed; Category three, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; and, Category four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious problems for residents.</p><p>  This categorisation formed the basis for the list of those unfinished developments eligible for a waiver on the annual household charge.  Only households in developments in categories three and four are eligible for the waiver from payment of the household charge.  The list of developments in which households are eligible for the waiver in 2012 is set out under the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012.  It is a matter for the relevant local authority to interpret and apply the relevant provisions.</p><p>  In the context of Budget 2013, the Government announced the introduction of a local property tax which will replace the annual household charge.  It was also decided that a waiver will apply in certain circumstances; a prescribed list of unfinished estates, subject to certain criteria and identified as part of the National Housing Development Survey 2012, in respect of which the property tax for 2013 will be waived in accordance with the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 will be prepared.  I anticipate that this list will be published shortly.</p></reply>

Dublin City Council provides the fire service for the four Dublin local authorities &ndash; Dublin City Council itself, Dunlaoghaire/ Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin County Councils.</p><p>  My Department supports fire authorities through the setting of general policy and guidance and the provision of capital funding, including the recoupment (within the overall funding available) of costs incurred by fire authorities in relation to approved construction projects and the purchase of fire appliances and equipment.  The current national priority for capital funding is supporting the fire appliance fleet. Dublin Fire Brigade has been approved for 2 new appliances, which are at the tender stage of the procurement process.</p><p>  A proposal to extend Tallaght fire station was approved in principle in 2006 under the  Fire Services Capital Programme.  However, given the current constraints on public finances it has been necessary, in keeping with other reductions, to reduce the fire service capital allocations in 2011, 2012 and 2013.  Accordingly, my Department is not in a position at present to fund the significant investment (circa &euro;3 million) required to progress the extension of Tallaght Fire Station from the fire services capital programme.  As an alternative, in light of the business case made by Dublin City Council in August 2011, my Department approved grant-aid of &euro;300,000 to supplement funding committed by the Council in respect of necessary and urgent works at the fire station.  These necessary upgrading works were completed during 2012 and grant-aid of &euro;300,000 was paid by my Department in respect of this.</p></reply>

Section 180 provides, in relation to estates which have been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority in accordance with the permission, that the planning authority must, if requested to do so by the developer or by the majority of the qualified electors who are owners or occupiers of the houses involved, initiate the procedures in section 11 of the Roads Act 1993 for declaring the road(s) to be public roads, for whose maintenance the local authority will then be responsible. It is a matter for the elected members to decide whether or not to take in charge the roads in question. In relation to estates which have not have been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority and where enforcement proceedings have not been commenced within the relevant period, section 180 also provides that the planning authority must, if requested to do so by the majority of the residents as defined above (but not the developer), initiate the procedures in section 11 of the Roads Act. Section 180 also provides that, where a planning authority makes an order under section 11 of the Roads Act, it must also take in charge any open spaces, car parks, sewers, water mains or drains within the attendant grounds of the development.</p></reply>

The total number of all types of visas issued to those nationals in the same period was 27,000 indicating that over 16,000 visitors availed of the Visa Waiver Programme in that time.</p><p>The detailed breakdown of these visa applications is currently being processed but I can inform the Deputy that rounded figures for the countries with the top ten highest number of Visit Visa applications are as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th> Country</th><th>No. of applications</th><th>No. approved</th><th>Approval rate</th></tr><tr><td>Russia</td><td>6500</td><td>6370</td><td>98%</td></tr><tr><td>India</td><td>5300</td><td>5050</td><td>95%</td></tr><tr><td>Nigeria</td><td>4300</td><td>2900</td><td>68%</td></tr><tr><td>China</td><td>3400</td><td>3250</td><td>95%</td></tr><tr><td>Philippines</td><td>2075</td><td>1650</td><td>79%</td></tr><tr><td>Saudi Arabia</td><td>1630</td><td>1625</td><td>almost 100%</td></tr><tr><td>Pakistan</td><td>1600</td><td>1040</td><td>65%</td></tr><tr><td>Turkey</td><td>1450</td><td>1400</td><td>97%</td></tr><tr><td>Ukraine</td><td>1200</td><td>1070</td><td>90%</td></tr><tr><td>Thailand</td><td> 950</td><td> 850</td><td>90%</td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-14a.738.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021400082#WRP03500"><p>The question relates to the spending and procurement policy of the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA), a functional unit of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department, which is responsible for the accommodation of persons while their applications for international protection are being processed. Currently there are 4,836 persons accommodated throughout the State in 35 centres under contract to RIA.</p><p>  Of the 35 centres in the State, 7 are State owned.  That is to say, while the centres are managed by private contractors under contract to RIA, the land and buildings are owned by the State.  Details of all centres currently under contract to RIA are available on its website - <i>www.ria.gov.ie</i></p><p>  A list comprising the value and other details of all contracts for commercial centres, issued by RIA between 2000 and the end of 2010, has been prepared for the Deputy.  Because of the size of this table, it is not possible to insert it into this answer and it is therefore being forwarded to the Deputy separately.  As explained in replies to previous D&aacute;il Questions, it is not in the interest of the taxpayer that details of current individual contracts are known to the public or to other parties who are, or may be in the future, engaged in negotiations with RIA. Therefore, details of current contract rates are not provided.  The policy is that at the end of January each year a table of contracts is updated to show all financial information up to the end of December two years previously, i.e.. at the end of January, 2013 the records are updated to end of December 2010.  This policy has been upheld by the Office of the Information Commissioner.</p><p>  In relation to RIA's procurement policy, it is important to note that RIA does not lease or rent premises from commercial contractors. Rather, it 'contracts-in' a comprehensive range of services and facilities, which include accommodation, food provision, housekeeping etc., for a fixed sum over the period of the contract.</p><p>  A distinction needs to be drawn in relation to procurement processes as between RIA's State-owned accommodation centres and the commercially owned and operated centres. The most recent  tender process for the management of the State owned centres was carried out last year by way of public competition in accordance with EU Council Directive  2004/18/EC (co-ordinating procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts) as implemented into Irish law by Statutory Instrument 329 of 2006.</p><p>  In relation to the commercially owned and operated centres, RIA had in the past advertised in the national press for expressions of interest from persons interested in providing accommodation and other ancillary services for asylum seekers.  That procurement process was subject to scrutiny in the Value For Money (VFM) review in respect of spending by RIA on asylum seeker accommodation which was published in May, 2010. A copy of this review is in the Oireachtas Library and is also viewable on the RIA website: <i>www.ria.gov.ie</i>.  The Review acknowledged the unique challenges in this particular area of procurement, e.g. the unpredictability of demand, the requirement to disperse asylum seekers around the country, local opposition to the opening of new centres, children settled in schools and so on.  Among the recommendations of the VFM report was the introduction of a mix of &#8216;contracts for capacity&#8217; and &#8216;contracts for availability and occupancy&#8217; as well as a 'more open' tendering system in respect of the commercially owned and operated centres in the RIA portfolio.  </p><p>  The completion of the tender competition last year in respect of the management of the State owned centres enabled RIA to begin preparatory work, now well underway, on devising a more open tendering process for the commercially owned centres. As an interim measure, existing contracts are being carried over on short term bases. The contracts, as far as practicable, have introduced a number of elements recommended in the VFM report, for example, contracts involve a mix of &#8216;contracts for capacity&#8217; and &#8216;contracts for availability and occupancy&#8217; which have the dual purpose of maximising the occupancy of the centre while minimising RIA's expenditure. The task of devising a long term 'open' tender process is a difficult exercise as it has to take account of &quot;non-money&quot; issues such as access to social, educational and health services; adherence to long standing Government policy on dispersal of asylum seekers; as well as a recognition that other State agencies may have already committed resources in a particular region or area.</p><p>  It is worth noting generally the decline in the number of persons seeking accommodation in the RIA system in recent years which has necessitated the consolidation of the accommodation portfolio.  At the end of 2008, RIA was accommodating 7002 persons in 60 centres.  At the end of 2012 RIA was accommodating 4,841 persons in 35 centres. During that 4 year period RIA had closed 25 centres and was accommodating 2,161 fewer persons. In that same period, spending on the RIA system declined from &#8364;91.5 million to &#8364;62.3 million i.e.32%.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-14a.742.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021400083#WRQ00300"><p>I would like to state at the outset that Ireland's National Traveller/Roma Integration Strategy is envisaged to be a living document and as time goes on there is nothing to prevent the development and inclusion of new actions in any of the sectors; therefore the necessity for a revised strategy as suggested by the Deputy does not arise as such at this point.</p><p>  The Commission&rsquo;s assessment of the national strategies focused on evaluating the Member States&rsquo; approach to the four key areas of education, employment, healthcare and housing, and on how structural requirements (cooperation with civil society, with regional and local authorities, monitoring, antidiscrimination and establishment of a national contact point) as well as funding are addressed as relevant for their Roma population. In each section of their report, a summary table indicates the Member States that have in place specific measures required by the EU Framework. Ireland was identified in the Commission's report as a Member State with a number of such policies in place.</p><p>  In fact, contrary to drawing attention to specific gaps in Ireland's strategy, I was pleased to note that the Commission praised measures taken by Ireland in relation to Healthcare for Travellers.</p><p>  Based on the assessment of all Member States, a set of policy recommendations in each section points to priorities that all Member States should further address, depending on their national circumstances, in order to meet their responsibilities. As I have already stated, the Strategy is a living document and it is envisaged that further actions will be developed for Ireland when and where it is deemed necessary. </p><p>  The Strategy was developed following a  communication from the EU Commission entitled &ldquo;An EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies&quot; (April 2011) which requested that member states would, in proportion to the size of the Roma population living in their territories and taking into account their different starting points, adopt or develop further a comprehensive approach to Roma integration.</p><p>  As a first step towards a national strategy, all of the initiatives that exist already across Government were brought together so as to include them in a national strategy document.  This document thus includes relevant strategies that already exist in the four crucial areas of education, employment, healthcare and housing.  It also mentions initiatives in place in the same areas to assist the Roma community who are citizens of the European Economic Area and are legally resident in the country.  It should be noted that Traveller representatives are active participants in National Committees dealing with policy in all four areas and, in this way, were involved in the development of these policies.</p><p>  In relation to Roma specifically, from Ireland's perspective it is important to note that the term &ldquo;Roma&rdquo;, as defined by the Council of Europe, refers to Roma, Sinti, Kale and related groups in Europe, including Travellers and Eastern groups (Dom and Lom), and covers the wide diversity of the groups concerned, including persons who identify themselves as &ldquo;Gypsies&rdquo;.  By this definition, the vast majority of Travellers/Roma in the Irish State are indigenous Irish Travellers. There are no official statistics on the number of Roma in Ireland. A figure of 3,000 (approximately 0.07% of the population) has been cited by the Roma Support Group Pavee Point. However, the vast majority of Roma in this State are EU citizens and, as such, in terms of immigration controls, are covered by the provision of the European Communities (Free movement of Persons) (No. 2) Regulations 2006. Such persons are not required to register their presence in the State. </p><p>  The Deputy should be aware that my Department's role in the Strategy is one of coordination while the development of particular policy is a matter for my Government colleagues in the relevant Government Departments. In the Commission's report Ireland was identified as having a strong monitoring and review mechanism for adapting the strategy.Traveller representatives are active participants on National Committees in the various Government Departments dealing with the policy areas mentioned and, it is in this way, that they will be involved in the further development of relevant policies in relation to the strategy. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-14a.745.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021400083#WRQ00500"><p>This question concerns two issues. Firstly, it concerns the welfare and protection of children and vulnerable adults living in direct provision asylum seeker accommodation centres under contract to the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department. Secondly, it concerns the remit of the independent inspections by a Galway based firm, QTS Limited contracted by RIA to carry out inspections in the 35 such centres currently contracted to it throughout the State.</p><p>  On the latter issue, inspections are carried out not just by QTS Ltd. but also, separately, by RIA staff.  These inspections are always unannounced and the inspectors look at all aspects of the accommodation centres in relation to the proprietors' obligations under the contract. The inspections cover such areas as reception, staff cover, menus, food safety and hygiene, facilities being provided, maintenance of the property and fire and safety issues.  As explained below, these inspections do not check whether staff have been Garda vetted or have been trained in relation to the welfare and protection of children and vulnerable adults.  These matters are indeed of critical importance to RIA but they fall to be dealt with outside that inspection process.</p><p>  RIA takes the issue of Garda vetting and child protection very seriously. There is a specific unit in RIA called the Child and Family Services Unit, which is fully staffed and whose role is to manage, deliver, coordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all asylum seekers residing in the direct provision system.  It also acts as a conduit between RIA and the HSE, the latter having statutory functions in this area.  The Unit is headed up by an official seconded from the HSE who has clinical expertise in the area of child welfare and protection.</p><p>  Since 2009 Garda Vetting is carried out on all staff of centres under contract to RIA.  The procedure to effect this vetting, and why it is not possible to have QTS Ltd. check this on its inspection process, is explained below.</p><p>  All asylum accommodation centres are operated by private companies under contract to RIA. The responsibility for the employment of staff lies with the private contractor concerned; that is to say, no staff in centres are employed directly by RIA.  The second point is that a distinction needs to be drawn between &quot;vetting&quot; and &quot;clearing&quot;.  &quot;Vetting&quot; is the process by which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na conducts an examination of an individual's record in relation to court convictions and pending prosecutions and, with the person's permission, conveys this information to an authorised person.  &quot;Clearing&quot; is the process by which an employer and/or a responsible authority makes a decision, based on the result of the Garda vetting process, as to whether to employ, or continue to employ (possibly with restrictions), the individual concerned.</p><p>  It was agreed with the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) based in Thurles, Co. Tipperary that RIA alone would act as the central conduit for all communications between GCVU and RIA accommodation centres. All RIA contractors and their designated contact person in relation to Garda vetting have been vetted and cleared by RIA itself.  In respect of all other staff in centres, although the vetting process is conducted through RIA, the 'clearing' of employees is a matter for the contractors who, after all, are the employers. It should be noted that, aside from those relating to contractors and designated persons, RIA does not retain any records on centre employees in relation to Garda Vetting.  The sole records kept on RIA's confidential database relate to the employee's name, when the relevant vetting forms were received in RIA, sent to GCVU, returned by GCVU and submitted to the relevant designated contact person. As this is an ongoing process, contractors have the responsibility of informing RIA of new members of their staff, who need to undergo the Garda Vetting Process. Because RIA itself acts as the conduit for Garda vetting of staff in centres, the issue of having the matter dealt with in the inspection process does not arise.</p><p>  In relation to training of staff in centres, the HSE has provided 'Keeping Safe' child protection training to each centre's designated officers and other staff members. RIA's Child Protection Policy is based on the HSE's &ldquo;Children First - National Guidelines for the protection and welfare of children&rdquo;.  </p></reply>

In its judgment, the High Court was critical of the Tribunal's decision in the applicant's appeal citing, inter alia, errors of law and fact.  In light of the High Court's judgment the Chairman has informed me that the case has been settled and that the applicant's appeal will be rescheduled to be heard by a different Member of the Tribunal.  As the Deputy may be aware, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal is independent in the performance of its functions and the Chairman alone is responsible for the assignment of cases to individual Tribunal members.  The Tribunal is currently comprised of thirteen individual Members each of whom represents a division of the Tribunal.</p><p>  Work on the details of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010 is ongoing at my Department pursuant to current Government policy which is committed, under the Programme for Government, to &quot;introduce comprehensive reforms of the immigration, residency and asylum systems, which will include a statutory appeals system and set out rights and obligations in a transparent way&quot;.  The Bill provides, in Part 7, for a Protection Review Tribunal and, in that context, already contains a number of provisions to address issues of the type which arose in the case of concern to the Deputy.  Among the functions proposed for the Chairperson of the Protection Review Tribunal under Section 102 of the Bill, for example, is the possibility for him or her to request a member of the Tribunal to review a draft decision in circumstances where the Chairperson considers that the decision is likely to contain an error of law or fact .  A member so requested must review the decision and make any amendments considered necessary.  In addition, provision is made for the Chairperson to refer any final decision of a member for the direction of the High Court where he or she considers that the decision contains an error of law.  These are among the many aspects of the Bill that are under ongoing consideration at my Department, including in cooperation with the Offices of Parliamentary Counsel and of the Attorney General. This process will take into account any relevant findings by the Courts, such as those raised by the Deputy.</p><p>  As I have outlined previously to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence, several hundred amendments to the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill are anticipated, the majority of a technical nature. On that occasion, I also expressed the considered view that instead of engaging in an extremely cumbersome process of tabling hundreds of amendments to the 2010 Bill it would be much more efficient to publish a new and enhanced text.  Such an approach can incorporate the many anticipated amendments while addressing key outstanding issues, several of which have been of concern to Members. This proposition was broadly welcomed by the Joint Committee. It remains my objective under this new approach, and mindful of our having to deal with the competing legislative demands of our EU/IMF/ECB Programme commitments, to be in a position to bring a revised Bill to Government for approval and publication later this year.</p></reply>

The Bill does not make any provision in relation to the role or status of &quot;legal executives&quot; nor is any such provision envisaged. </p><p>  It is clear from the correspondence I have received from the Irish Institute of Legal Executives Ltd that the scope of their proposals to confer legal status and a whole range of functions on such a category of persons is extensive and goes beyond those measures to be introduced under the Legal Services Regulation Bill. </p><p>  It is evident that the proposals being made by the Irish Institute of Legal Executives Ltd, on behalf of its members, are far-reaching from the fact that they relate <i>inter alia</i>  to &quot;a right of audience in the District and Circuit Courts, before tribunals and, subject to review, subsequently in all courts&quot;, and to the eligibility of members for quasi-judicial and judicial appointments (e.g as District Court judges or members of Tribunals). These proposals also draw heavily from the  regulatory and practise models of England and Wales which do not always correspond to those of our jurisdiction nor to those set out under current Government policy in the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011.</p><p>  While recognising that there may be additional benefits and efficiencies to be found for consumers and for the legal services sector in a more developed role for &quot;legal executives&quot;, the far-reaching proposals being made on their behalf at this time lie beyond the scope of the Legal Services Regulation Bill impinging, as they do, on aspects of the courts and the judiciary. Such matters will, therefore, need to be considered separately on their own merits, while others may come to be considered in due course by the new  Legal Services Regulatory Authority</p></reply>

Currently there are 4,836 persons accommodated throughout the State in 35 centres under contract to RIA.</p><p>  QTS Ltd. was contracted by RIA following an open competition under the relevant EU Procurement Directive 2004/18/EC dated 31 March, 2004.  The tender was published on the Government's procurement website - www.etenders.gov.ie - on 9 September, 2010.</p><p>  The contract was awarded to the company following an assessment that its tender was the most economically advantageous.  Under the terms of the tender document, the contract was awarded on 10 November, 2010 for a 12 month period with the option to extend the contract for a further 24 months.  The contract extension was put in place on 11 November, 2011 and will expire on 10 November, 2013.  I am informed that RIA has already started drafting a new tender and the target date for its publication on www.etenders.gov.ie  is September, 2013.</p><p>  By way of background, RIA monitors its contract delivery through a series of tools, one of which is an inspection process.  The purpose of inspections is to obtain a 'snap-shot' of the physical condition of the building on the day the inspection is carried out and to identify maintenance issues before they become problems.  Inspections are carried out not just by QTS Ltd. but also, separately, by RIA staff.  These inspections are always unannounced and the inspectors look at all aspects of the accommodation centres in relation to the proprietors' obligations under the contract. The inspections cover such areas as reception, staff cover, menus, facilities being provided, maintenance of the property and fire and safety issues.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-14a.820.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021400084#WRR02000"><p>Since taking office I have been concerned by the poor age structure in Irish farming.  Recent analysis shows that there are more farmers over 80 than under 35 in Ireland.  I have been working to encourage more new entrants to take up farming as a career.  Budget 2013 saw the extension of key reliefs that were already in place for young new entrants (such as the 100% relief from Stamp Duty and the 100% stock relief for Young Trained Farmers).  Extending these reliefs is not straightforward given that there is a requirement for EU State Aid approval for such measures.  The deputy will also be aware that changes were made to retirement relief in budget 2012 to encourage inter-generational land transfers.  </p><p>  The correspondence provided by the deputy suggests that course will not help the situation.  I believe that education is fundamental to the future of farming.  I am delighted that the number of applicants for Teagasc courses has greatly increased the last two years.  Teagasc has responded well to this demand and have introduced new courses to cater for a variety of needs.  For example Teagasc has recently launched a new Professional Diploma in Dairy Farm Management (Level 7) in association with University College Dublin (UCD). Teagasc have also developed recently a new<i></i>  Level 6 Specific Purpose Certificate in Farm Administration course to help meet the training requirements for full-time or part-time farmers. </p><p>  Young people are essential to delivering the smart, green growth being sought under the food harvest strategy.  It comes as no surprise to me that the young Entrepreneur of the year is a farmer and used his farming experience to create an innovative product that farmers worldwide are now using.  I hope that other entrepreneurial young farmers will follow this example and develop Irish farming so that it becomes a model for others.  </p><p>  Measures to provide targeted support to young farmers are part of the current negotiations on the reform of the CAP and will I hope form part of any final agreement.  I have strongly supported the proposal for a top-up for young farmers under pillar 1 of the CAP, and indeed Ireland was one of the first countries to suggest this measure in the negotiations.</p><p>  I am also happy that the new restructuring relief has been announced in the 2013 budget.  This is the result of detailed work which analysed the reasons why the old consolidation relief was not working.  I am confident that the new relief in relation to Capital Gains Taxes, once State Aid approval has been received, will be more effective, especially given that Stamp Duty rates have been reduced.  Re-structuring is essential for us to meet the Food Harvest 2020 targets.  We need to use land more productively and encourage more young farmers to make the best use of the land. A recent EU Commission study found that </p><p>&#8216;<i>younger [farm] managers tend to perform better than the EU average, with 46% more area and 57% more economic potential for 21% more labour force</i>&#8217;<sup> [[1]</sup>  Commission Staff Working Paper, Impact Assessment, CAP towards 2020, <i>Annex 1: Situation and prospects for EU agriculture and rural areas</i>  , p. 25. Brussels, 12/10/2011.<sup>1]</sup>.  </p><p>  Ireland has a very low level of land sales, with most land staying within the same family for generations. Only 0.4% of land changes hand in any given year.  Young farmers that want to expand need to be able to access land.  According to the latest census of agriculture the average farm has 3.8 land parcels.  This means that our farmers are wasting time and diesel driving between plots of land, increasing the stress and the risk of accidents.  Young farmers will now have an opportunity to consolidate their holdings and increase efficiency.  I am hopeful therefore that the measures that I have introduced will encourage more young people into farming and address the age profile imbalance in Irish farming.</p></reply>

The 215 recommendations in FH 2020 are largely capacity building measures which are directed at supporting and improving the employment potential of this sector.  As such they do not directly lend themselves to annualised job figures. Indeed, the FH2020 report recognised that the greatest scope for employment gains would flow from the increased output in the dairy and aquaculture sectors. These productivity and employment gains will be in medium term, as the abolition of milk quotas will not arise until 2015 and work is ongoing to ensure that aquaculture developments comply with national and EU environmental legislative guidelines. </p><p>  In relation to assessing the direct and indirect employment potential in the agri-food and fishing sector which could flow from the projected 2020 growth envisaged by the Food Harvest report, a recent academic analysis by a working group, established by the Food Harvest implementation committee, suggested that if the FH2020 growth targets were achieved that around 25,000 additional direct and indirect jobs could be created by 2020.</p><p>  As part of its work programme, the FH2020 Implementation Committee is actively monitoring the 17 inter-agency projects included by this Department and relevant agencies in the 2012 AJP and has also contributed to the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs which is expected to be published next month. </p></reply>

Minimum Benefit Regulations, made under the Health Insurance Acts, require insurers to offer a minimum benefit to every insured person.  The key purpose of the Regulations is to ensure the continued availability of the type of broad hospital cover traditionally held as a minimum by the insured population and to ensure that individuals do not significantly under-insure. Minimum Benefit Regulations were introduced in 1996, under Section 10 of the Health Insurance Act, 1994 and cover in-patient, out-patient and day-patient services provided by publicly funded hospitals, private hospitals, registered nursing home and hospital consultants. </p><p>  The Minimum Benefit Regulations ensure that all consumers obtain an appropriate minimum level of health insurance cover regardless of what plan they purchase and that every plan available is inclusive of a minimum suite of benefits/procedures, some of which are available to the market as a whole and some of which will be applicable specifically to either men or women. Importantly, under Community Rating everybody is charged the same premium for a particular health insurance plan which includes this minimum suite of benefits, irrespective of age, gender and the current or likely future state of their health. Thus, the broad base line of procedures provided by minimum benefit should not be looked at in gender specific terms, but rather as a cohort of procedures that are important to the community of the insured population and thus should be protected and provided as a minimum base to all.   </p><p>  In these circumstances, I do not consider that there is any role for the Competition Authority in the matter.</p></reply>

In respect of capital expenditure many of the projects would serve the health care needs of the whole country, such as the new Children's Hospital, and therefore there would be no basis for breaking expenditure down on a per capita basis within regions.  The most recent national per capita expenditure figures on a current and capital basis are &euro;3,001 and &euro;76 respectively.</p><p>  In tandem with the proposed new HSE governance structures,  new administrative structures are being put in place within the HSE to reflect the need for a greater operational management focus on the delivery of key services and greater transparency about funding, service delivery and accountability.  Good progress is also being made on the development and implementation of a Money Follows The Patient system which will facilitate more transparent and detailed analysis of expenditure and health care delivery across a range of variables, including regional analysis.</p></reply>

These proposals cover all of the areas mentioned in the report, including legislation on minimum unit pricing; labelling of alcohol products; and prevention and intervention activities on alcohol. My Department is also working closely with the Department of Justice and Equality, which is responsible for the issue of the structural separation of alcohol from other products in mixed trading outlets. </p><p>  The Cabinet Committee on Social Policy has considered these proposals and I intend to bring forward specific proposals for consideration by Government as soon as possible.  In the meantime, work on developing a framework for the necessary Department of Health legislation is continuing.  For example, in conjunction with Northern Ireland, a health impact assessment is being commissioned as part of the process of developing a legislative basis for minimum unit pricing.  The health impact assessment will study the impact of different minimum prices on a range of areas such as health, crime and likely economic impact.</p></reply>

The HSE established an Intern Implementation Group in 2009 to implement aspects of the Report of the NCMET on the Intern Year and I am aware that this Group has issued two Implementation Reports, most recently in April 2012 (Second Implementation Report).  The intern year is an integral part of medical training, and a medical practitioner cannot be fully accredited without it.  There were 572 posts available in Ireland for the July 2012 intern intake, an increase of almost 70 posts since 2007. To date, there have been sufficient posts for all EU graduates from Irish medical schools, and a number of available posts for some non-EU applicants.</p><p>  My Department has been in regular contact with the HSE in relation to the issue of intern places, with the aim, in so far as is possible, to provide a sufficient number of intern places for Irish/EU graduates from Irish medical schools.  In addition, under EU law, intern posts must be open to graduates from other EU countries.</p><p>  The application process for internships closed in November last, but the HSE will not know the final number of eligible applicants for some time. The final numbers that will proceed to the first round match have not yet been determined, as the overseas candidates must pass the entrance test, pass the HSE English language requirements, provide a Basic Life Support (BLS) certificate, and pass their final year medical exams. Candidates applying from within Ireland must provide a BLS certificate and pass their final year medical exams.</p><p>  This year the HSE will have approximately 80 additional posts available for interns commencing their training in July. In total, therefore, there will be in the region of 650 places available for 2013, and the HSE estimates that this will be sufficient to ensure that every EU graduate of the six Irish medical schools can access an internship.</p></reply>

Building on work already undertaken by the HSE, the NTPF has now taken over the reporting of outpatient waiting time data.   For the first time, clear and comprehensive data is available on www.ptr.ie.  The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format will reveal the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals. In the first instance, this will allow the SDU and NTPF to target their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  A maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment by 30 November 2013.</p><p>  In parallel with reducing the numbers of longest waiters, the SDU will also work with the HSE Clinical Programmes to reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time.</p><p>  In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.</p></reply>

The KPMG Independent Review of Maternity and Gynaecology Services in the Greater Dublin noted that Dublin&rsquo;s model of stand alone maternity hospitals is not the norm internationally and recommended that the Dublin maternity hospitals should be co-located with adult acute services and that one of the three new Dublin maternity facilities should be built on the site of the new national paediatric hospital. Maternity and paediatric service co-location has advantages for infants with congenital malformations, for foetal medicine or complications which require neonatal surgery.  Maternity and adult service co-location has advantages for mothers in providing on-campus rapid and ready access to non-obstetric specialist expertise, and to specialist surgery and intensive care in the case of major obstetric emergency.</p><p>  The proposal in 2008 was that the National Maternity Hospital be relocated to St Vincent's, the Coombe to Tallaght and the Rotunda to the Mater, and the maternity hospitals have been working with the relevant adult sites to progress this. There will be early discussions with the maternity hospitals regarding their maternity /adult co-location plans in the context of the Government decision to build the new children&rsquo;s hospital on the St James&rsquo;s campus.  Notwithstanding this, I am committed to the intent of the report - that the Dublin maternity hospitals be located alongside adult acute services - while also bearing in mind the  need to plan for the provision of tri-located paediatric , adult and maternity services, as is the intention in relation to the new children&rsquo;s hospital.</p><p>  With regard to the children's ambulatory care unit, the report of the Review Group on the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital (Dolphin report) concluded that the existing plan for the Ambulatory and Urgent Care Centre in Tallaght must be revisited, in light of a decision made about the location of the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital.  The number and location of urgent care centres in the Dublin area must be determined now that the decision has been made to locate the new children's hospital on the St James campus. It is envisaged that there will be an urgent care centre or urgent care centres based on consideration of the geographical distribution of attendances and acuity of the patient. The location and number of such centres will be given careful consideration and analysis is underway to inform this in order  to reach a decision as soon possible.</p></reply>

Under UHI, everyone will be insured and will have equal access to a standard package of primary and acute hospital services, including acute mental health services.  A new Insurance Fund will subsidise or pay insurance premiums for those who qualify for a subsidy. </p><p>The reform programme is a major undertaking that requires careful planning and sequencing over a number of years.  <i>Future Health: A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012-2015 </i> highlights the importance of a step-by-step evidence-based approach to achieving an effective, equitable and efficient system and sets out key actions to systematically deliver on reform. </p><p>  One of these actions is the production of a preliminary document on UHI by end 2012.  This Preliminary Paper was produced in December in line with the target.  It was considered by the Cabinet Committee on Health in January and will be published very shortly.</p><p>  The Department is preparing a White Paper on Universal Health Insurance which will provide further detail on the UHI model for Ireland in addition to the estimated costs and financing mechanisms associated with the introduction of universal health insurance.  The work involved is both complex and technical, necessitating significant research and financial modelling to support analysis and costing of different design options.  This, in turn, demands a wide-range of specialised expertise.  The Department is engaged in a process to ensure the provision of this expertise to feed into work on the preparation of the White Paper during 2013.  The White Paper will be published as early as possible within the Government's term of office.  </p><p>  It is anticipated that by 2016 the necessary groundwork will be in place to enable us to phase in implementation of UHI, as promised in the Programme for Government. </p></reply>

While it is not possible, at this time, to give start and completion dates for any of the individual 20 potential locations, the best estimate is that these primary care centres will be completed by late 2016.</p><p>  Using the operational lease mechanism the HSE has delivered primary care infrastructure at 30 locations and is continuing its collaboration with the private sector to progress suitable locations.  Another two locations are expected to open in Q1 2013.  There will always be more construction projects than can be funded by the Exchequer using the direct-build mechanism.  The Health Service Executive must prioritise healthcare projects including primary care infrastructure within its overall capital envelope taking into account its existing capital commitments and costs to completion over the period.  </p><p>  Work is underway on the Executive's multi-annual Capital Plan 2013-2017.   My Department is reviewing the proposals and following up with the HSE where further details may be required.  This draft Plan will require my approval with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Once approved the Executive will publish on its website details of the Plan including primary care facilities to be delivered.</p><p>  As the delivery of healthcare infrastructure is a service matter the Deputy's question has been referred to the Executive for direct reply on facilities delivered in the south east and nationally.</p></reply>

The basis of the complaint, which was upheld by the Data Protection Commissioner, was that NSCs should not be retained indefinitely without consent as this breached the Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003.  There followed a series of meetings between the Deputy Data Protection Commissioner, representatives from my Department, the Health Services Executive (HSE) and the Children's University Hospital, Temple Street, which resulted in the decision to destroy existing cards that are older than ten years.  I received representations from a number of people and organisations, who pointed out their potential value for research.  Consequently, I requested the HSE to conduct a review of the decision to destroy these cards.  This review examined both the legal and ethical basis for retention of NSCs and the potential use of the existing cards for research purposes.  The report and recommendations of the review group were submitted to me in January 2012.  The review group supported the decision to destroy cards more than ten years old.  Following careful consideration I accepted this recommendation.</p><p>  However, the review group also explored how the cards could be made available to the research community in a way which is compatible with ethical and legal obligations.  It must be remembered that there is no written consent from parents for the retention or use of these newborn screening cards taken before 2002 for research, or other, purposes.  In line with its recommendations, the HSE has begun an information campaign offering people the opportunity to have their screening card returned to them, prior to any cards being destroyed.  I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy setting out how people can donate, or give consent for the donation of, NSCs for research purposes; and providing details of their information campaign.</p></reply>

The following priority programmes are particularly relevant to primary care: Stroke; Heart Failure; Asthma; Diabetes; and COPD.  The Diabetes programme is the most advanced.  The delivery of the National Asthma Programme (NAP) is a priority for progression in primary care settings in 2013.  85% of asthma is managed in primary care, which is in line with the Government's policy of providing care as close as possible to the patient's home.  The overarching aim of the NAP is to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with asthma in Ireland and to improve clinical outcomes and the quality of life of all patients with asthma.  A key component is improved management of people with asthma in primary care and<i><font color="#4181C0"> </font></i>thereby, avoiding emergency attendance at General Practitioner (GP) out-of-hours services, hospital emergency departments and in-patient admission services.  The target is to reduce bed days by 10% per year over three years through implementing the programme&#8217;s asthma guidelines and national model of care, which is in development.  The model of care document will be available by the end of Quarter 1, 2013.  In 2011, the first year of programme implementation, there was an 8% reduction in acute hospital bed days for acute asthma.</p><p>  The initial focus of the work of the NAP has been on the development and implementation of national asthma guidelines based on international best practice, both for acute care and ongoing asthma management.  The National Model of Care for Asthma will detail how physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals will work with engaged patients to make the clinical decisions most appropriate to their circumstances and to collaborate with specialist colleagues in providing a safe, seamless experience through their journey within the health system in Ireland.  This includes a model for the management of asthma in primary care and the necessary links with secondary specialist services.</p><p>  It is reported that one person dies from asthma each week, however, the most recent year of validated data is 2009.  Studies on asthma deaths internationally, such as Confidential Enquiries in the UK, have shown that up to 90% of asthma deaths have preventable factors.  The NAP is developing a proposal to undertake a similar study.  Adult Emergency Asthma Guidelines were published in November 2011 and are available on .  These guidelines are being revised at present and will be submitted to the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC).  Paediatric Emergency Asthma Guidelines have also been developed and will be available for circulation by the end of Q1, 2013.  Asthma Control in General Practice (guidelines for managing a patient with asthma in primary care) have been developed and recently approved by the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP).  These are currently being circulated.</p><p>  A self-learning asthma e-learning 6 modular theoretical programme, based on the national evidenced based guidelines and developed by NAP in conjunction with the Asthma Society of Ireland (ASI), is available on <i></i>and  for any health care professional who wishes to update their knowledge.  This will enable healthcare professionals to underpin their skill sets with theory.  There is also a similar programme available for GPs on the ICGP website.</p></reply>

The numbers requested by the Deputy are therefore not available.  The Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act 2012 provides for equal treatment as between temporary agency workers and direct employees in relation to basic working and employment conditions.

No dedicated programme for simultaneous or sequential implantation is being carried out in Ireland at this time. However, some bilateral implantation has already occurred for patients, mainly very young children with certain medical conditions such as a history of meningitis or blindness.</p><p>  I understand that Beaumont Hospital, HSE Management and the HSE&rsquo;s Audiology Clinical Care Programme (ACCP)have met recently to discuss a joint process to identify the options for developing and resourcing a programme of simultaneous cochlear implantation in children into the future.  An important element of this will be the development of clear clinical criteria to prioritise clients for assessment and follow on implantation.</p><p>  In relation to services for the deaf the Health Service Executive provides funding of in excess of &euro;4m annually to DeafHear (formerly the National Association for the Deaf) to provide a range of services to over 32,500 deaf and hard of hearing people and their families.  Some of the services provided by DeafHear include Personal and Family Support Services, an Assistive Technology Service, a Citizens Information Service, Speedtext which assists deaf and hard of hearing people to participate fully in meetings, educational courses etc. and Hearing and Communication Therapy.  In addition, DeafHear provide Deaf and Hearing Awareness Training to public and private sectors, bridging the gap between service providers and deaf consumers.</p><p>  The HSE also provides funding of approximately &euro;4m annually to the Catholic Institute for Deaf People, towards the provision of the residence accommodation at the following services; St. Joseph's School and Residence for Deaf Boys; St. Mary's School and Residence for Deaf Girls; St. Joseph's House for Adult Deaf and Deaf Blind.  The school programmes are funded by the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>  The HSE National Audiology Review Group Report, published in April 2011, made recommendations to address inconsistencies and shortcomings in audiology services.These recommendations are currently being implemented and are expected to provide improvements in audiology services throughout the country. All aspects of audiology patient management are currently being reviewed with an aim to provide an equal, efficient and effective clinical service. The recommendations being implemented include:</p><p>- An Audiology Clinical Care Programme has been put in place under the Clinical Strategy and Programmes Directorate; </p><p>- Newborn hearing screening programme has now been rolled out in HSE South, Dublin Mid Leinster and Dublin North East and is scheduled for roll out to HSE West later in 2013. </p><p>- A National Clinical Lead for Audiology post will be filled on 1 March 2013 and four Assistant Lead posts will be filled in the 2nd Quarter of 2013</p><p>- A unified career structure is being developed; The HSE has sponsored 10 M.Sc. in Audiology students, who will be ready to enter the workforce in the 3rd Quarter of 2013; </p><p>- Systems for the collation of activity data and patient management are being developed; </p><p>- A procurement exercise for the purchasing of hearing aids, hearing aid fitting systems and audiological assessment equipment has been completed; </p><p>- The Bone Anchored Hearing Aid Programme has commenced and roll out will be completed in 2013.</p></reply>
