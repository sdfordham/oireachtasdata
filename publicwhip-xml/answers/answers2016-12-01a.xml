This has focused on additional funding for homecare in particular and is aimed at allowing people to continue to live in their own homes and at facilitating discharge of older people from acute hospitals.  </p>  <p>  The HSE Service Plan 2016 originally provided for 10.4 million hours and 15,450 Home Care Packages.  These targets were revised to 10.57 million hours and 16,450 packages as a result of the additional funding announced under the revised Estimates, which included resources for this year&rsquo;s Winter Initiative. The expected level of activity provided in the 2016 Plan for Sligo, Leitrim and West Cavan is 425,000 home help hours and 345 Packages.   </p>  <p>  In a situation where demand continues to grow, challenges remain in managing home care budgets.  However, the increased resources provide additional flexibility to managers who are responsible for meeting these challenges in each geographic area within the resources available.</p>  <p>  The level of health services to be provided next year will be set out in the HSE&rsquo;s 2017 National Service Plan, which is expected to be finalised shortly.</p></reply>

As well as supporting other paediatricians, the Consultant also provides clinical support and advice to maternity hospitals and neonatologists.  The programme also included the appointment of eight Children&rsquo;s Outreach Nurses  whose role is to ensure that children being cared for at home by their families have access to co-ordinated and supportive services. The nurses liaise closely with statutory and voluntary service providers including local GPs, Public Health Nurses, Disability Services, the Jack and Jill Foundation and LauraLynn.  A further two Children's Outreach Nurses are being recruited under the Programme, one in Letterkenny and the other to the Children's Hospital Group. </p><p>The Letterkenny post will be advertised in the coming weeks and will be entitled Clinical Nurse Co-ordinator for Children with Life-limiting Conditions. This nurse will work closely with the existing Paediatric Liaison Nurse based in Donegal and will provide a service to children and families in Donegal as well as acting as an informed resource for colleagues in Sligo.</p><p>The HSE is currently considering how both in-home and in-patient respite services might be made more available for children in Donegal and surrounding areas.  All possibilities will be considered, including through cross-border co-operation or collaboration with relevant voluntary groups.</p></reply>

While recognising that demand for acute hospital services has increased this year with a 4% increase in inpatient and day case activity to end October compared with the same period last year, the important issue for patients is how long they wait.</p>  <p>  Under the HSE Service Plan 2016 targets, 95% of people should be waiting less than 15 months for their inpatient or daycase appointment. The latest NTPF inpatient/daycase waiting list figures show that 99% of patients at Temple Street are waiting less than 15 months for their inpatient/daycase appointment and 94% of patients are waiting less than 12 months.</p>  <p>  There are a number of factors contributing to the hospital's waiting list including the appointment of additional consultants resulting in additional demand on theatre and an increase in the number of referrals from across the country. There  has been a 6.2% increase in in-patient activity in Temple Street over the last two years. The HSE has advised that the waiting list is proactively managed to ensure that patients who clinically require admission are prioritised and then patients are admitted in chronological order.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 provides for the treatment of our longest-waiting patients. &euro;20m is being allocated to the NTPF in 2017, rising to &euro;55m in 2018.  I met the Chair and CEO of the NTPF last Tuesday and I have granted approval to their proposal which outlines the use of a first tranche of funding, in the region of &euro;5m, for an initiative focusing on daycase procedures.  The NTPF and HSE are currently engaging regarding a proposal for the use of the remaining funding for patient treatment in 2017. This gradual, stepped approach will enable the NTPF to build new operational capacity towards its 2018 allocation.</p>  <p>  In addition, it is intended that the NTPF's proposal will free up capacity in the public hospital system to provide treatment to those patients awaiting inpatient treatment, whose requirements are more complex and thus more suited to the public hospital system.</p>  <p>  I will shortly be asking the HSE to develop a Waiting List Action Plan for 2017 working collaboratively with the NTPF to address inpatient, daycase and outpatient waiting times, including at Temple Street Children's Hospital.</p></reply>

My Department, working with the HSE, has been driving a range of measures to improve patient ED experience times. </p><p>Following the formation of Government an additional &euro;40 million was provided to assist in the management of winter pressures. Utilising this additional funding the HSE  developed the Winter Initiative Plan 2016 &ndash; 2017 which was published in September. Key aspects of this plan are being implemented at hospital and community services level across the country. </p><p>South Tipperary General Hospital is one of nine hospitals which have been targeted in this year&rsquo;s Winter Initiative. In order to alleviate ED overcrowding at the hospital, a range of specific measures have been put in place. These include the expansion of access to Community Intervention Teams services to support the hospital by facilitating hospital avoidance and timely discharge. Additional homecare packages are also being provided; from 3 October to the 5 February, an additional 3 homecare packages per week will be provided in the Sth Tipperary area.  Additional access to aids and appliances to support timely discharge will also be provided. A tender process to establish a National Framework Agreement for Temporary Accommodation is currently being evaluated.  Based on the outcome of this process, the HSE will consider options, to provide additional capacity at the hospital.  <font color="#FF0000">  </font></p><p>Today the HSE convened a Winter Initiative Health Summit and I met with Hospital Group CEOs, as well as hospital and Community Health Organisation managers, to reinforce the importance of driving key performance improvements across primary, acute and social care to reduce ED overcrowding and to plan for expected surges in demand in our EDs in the New Year.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that there is a very strong focus on reducing ED overcrowding in all my interactions with the HSE, hospitals and the wider health service.</p></reply>

This dossier included details on all relevant costs and relevant cost offsets including those associated with hospitalisation, disease management costs, intravenous antibiotics, adverse events and any additional costs arising in patients not taking Orkambi.</p>  <p>  The NCPE has completed its Health Technology Assessment and this is available on its website. It was submitted to the HSE in June 2016. The NCPE determined, following an evaluation of the economic dossier, that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug. The NCPE have confirmed that all relevant costs were included in the analysis.</p>  <p>  The HSE has recently completed its most recent round of negotiations with the manufacturer. On foot of this, the HSE&rsquo;s Drugs Committee, having considered the NCPE recommendation and other expert advice, is in the process of sending its latest recommendation on the cost-effectiveness of Orkambi to the HSE Directorate. The HSE Directorate will then make a decision taking into consideration the manufacturers latest price offer. This decision will be made on objective, scientific and economic grounds in line with the 2013 Act.</p>  <p>  I share the HSE's disappointment that the manufacturer in this case has maintained a very high price in the course of negotiations in relation to the potential reimbursement of Orkambi for Irish patients.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that this is a very stressful time for Cystic Fibrosis patients and their families.  However, I want to assure them that I do not consider this to be the end of the process. I would strongly urge Vertex, as the manufacturer in this case, to fundamentally reconsider its position and to table a pricing proposal which can facilitate the provision of Orkambi at a price that will represent value for money for the Irish health service, patients and the taxpayer.</p>  <p>  I would also like to inform the Deputy that I have written to the Health Ministers in England, Scotland, Canada and Australia asking them to collaborate to try and make progress on accessing Orkambi at a cost effective price for cystic fibrosis patients in each of their countries.</p></reply>

While recognising that demand for acute hospital services has increased, the important issue for patients is how long they wait.</p>  <p>  Under the HSE Service Plan 2016 targets, 85% of people should wait less than 52 weeks for their first outpatient appointment. The latest NTPF Outpatient Waiting List figures indicate that 81% of patients in the Children's Hospital Group are waiting less than 52 weeks for their first outpatient appointment. 94% of patients are waiting less than 18 months for access to outpatient services.</p>  <p>  In August, I asked the HSE to develop a Waiting List Action Plan for 2016 to reduce by year end the number of patients waiting over 18 months for an inpatient or daycase procedure. Since then, approximately 6,500 patients have been removed from the waiting list nationally. </p>  <p>  Regarding outpatient waiting lists in particular, the HSE recently launched the Strategy for the design of Integrated Outpatient Services 2016-2020.  It seeks to improve waiting times for outpatient services by enhancing patient referral pathways and utilising technology to enable better planning.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 provides for the treatment of our longest-waiting patients. &euro;20m is being allocated to the NTPF in 2017, rising to &euro;55m in 2018. Planning of these initiatives is currently being finalised. I will shortly be asking the HSE to develop a Waiting List Action Plan for 2017, working collaboratively with the NTPF, to address inpatient, daycase and also outpatient waiting times including in the Children's Hospital Group.</p></reply>

This group is chaired by a Chief Officer. I am confident that the review will have a positive impact on the future delivery of Occupational Therapy services throughout the country.  </p>  <p>  In relation to treatment waiting lists, the majority of clients once they are assessed move straight to treatment and therefore an additional waiting time does not arise. I am advised by the HSE that Occupational Therapists are addressing high-risk Priority 1 cases including a large number of children's Assessments of Needs cases, which are a legal entitlement. Priority 1 cases also include those with urgent equipment needs to address high safety needs thereby reducing risks to children and their families, and children at high risk of placement breakdown. The Priority 2 waiting list is addressed based on the availability of resources and the HSE endeavours to provide the highest quality of services within available resources.</p>  <p>  As of September 2016, the HSE directly employs 1,168 (WTE) Occupational Therapists, which is an increase of 40 WTE since December 2015.</p></reply>

The Programme emphasises the need and focus on enhancing primary health care services including the building up of GP capacity, increasing the number of therapists and other health professionals in primary care and continuing to expand the development of primary care facilities/centres. </p>  <p>  Looking beyond 2017, I have consistently said that I strongly believe that the health service would benefit enormously from a single unifying vision that we can all get behind and that can help to drive reform and development of the system over the next 10 years.  The Programme for a Partnership Government committed to the establishment of an Oireachtas All-Party committee to develop a long term vision for healthcare and direction of health policy over a 10 year period, with cross party support. The Committee on the Future of Healthcare was established in June this year and has set its objectives including to achieve cross-party consensus on a ten year vision for the health service with an emphasis on quality of patient care, supported by strong managerial and organisational accountability and also to develop a model of integrated healthcare with an emphasis on primary and community care.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 delivered the highest health budget ever at &euro;14.6 billion. The level of health services to be provided within the available funding will be set out in the HSE&rsquo;s 2017 National Service Plan, which is currently being finalised. Of the HSE 2016 budget for the Health Services, the proportion assigned to primary care in 2016 is 28% and I anticipate a comparable apportioning in 2017.</p>  <p>  The OECD does not provide a cross-country analysis for spending on primary health care services, as the definition of primary care varies from country to country.  However, Eurostat publishes relevant statistical information at European level. For the year 2014 it has published data for twenty-two of the EU 28 Member States- no such data is available from Denmark, Italy, Malta, the UK, Romania or Slovenia. From this data the best available approximation for total expenditure on primary care  (private and public spending) can be created by combining expenditure on ambulatory health care providers and pharmacies. Based on this data, Ireland is ranked 8th of the 22 Member States for per capita expenditure on ambulatory health care and  pharmacies, adjusted for Purchasing Power Standards.</p></reply>

At present 93% of people receive specialist palliative care services in the community within seven days of referral while 96% have access to a specialist bed within seven days.  Specialist palliative care is now provided in 11 locations countrywide, and the number of specialist palliative care beds will reach 217 once all 15 beds in Kerry Hospice are open.</p>  <p>  The successful development of palliative care services in Ireland has been based on a long standing tradition of positive engagement between the voluntary  and statutory sector.  Organisations such as the North Westmeath Hospice play a vital role in this work by collaborating in a very positive way on a range of fronts to strengthen the provision of palliative care. </p>  <p>  With funding provided through the North Westmeath Hospice a position of Social Worker in Westmeath is due to filled in January 2017.

Portlaoise Hospital has developed a Winter Capacity Plan to assist in managing the demand for services over the winter period. Measures include additional consultant hours assigned to the ED, appointment of a second advance nurse practitioner for ED and appointment of a bed manager. These appointments will assist in ensuring optimal use of available beds, timely patient flow and an improved patient experience for minor injuries. </p>  <p>  Today the HSE convened a Winter Initiative Health Summit and I met with Hospital Group CEOs, as well as hospital and Community Health Organisation managers, to reinforce the importance of driving key performance improvements across primary, acute and social care to reduce ED overcrowding and to plan for expected surges in demand in our EDs in the New Year.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that there is a very strong focus on reducing ED overcrowding in all my interactions with the HSE, hospitals and the wider health service.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-01a.69.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016120100068#WRA04900"><p>A National Rare Disease Plan was published in 2014 and it contains 48 recommendations covering areas such as research, establishment of a national clinical programme and a national office for rare diseases, and the identification of Centres of Expertise. The report did not make a recommendation on increasing the number of genetic counsellors but rather that there is appropriate access to pre-conception genetic testing and counselling and that National Centres of Expertise be identified in accordance with European Union criteria for the care of patients with rare diseases. </p>  <p>  One of the principal recommendations in the Plan was the establishment of a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases. This programme was to be responsible, over time and among other functions, to assist with developing care pathways for rare diseases and facilitating timely access to centres of expertise.</p>  <p>  In line with this recommendation, a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases was established in 2013 under the National Clinical Strategy and Programmes Division of the HSE. The programme is a joint initiative between the HSE and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. This clinical programme is a channel for assisting with the advancement of a number of other recommendations in the plan, such as those on National Centres of Expertise for rare diseases; and in this vein, the programme designed a framework for the designation of Irish Centres of Expertise in cooperation with HSE Acute Hospitals Division in line with the recommendations stipulated in the national plan.</p>  <p>  The National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Department of Health encouraged designated Centres of Expertise to participate in European Reference Networks (ERNs) for Rare Diseases in line with the national plan. ERNs are European networks connecting health care providers and centres of expertise so that international expertise on specific rare diseases may be pooled together for the benefit of patients. Any centre applying for membership of an ERN must have strategies in place to ensure that care is patient-centred; that patients' rights and preferences are respected; and must show a research component to their work. </p>  <p>  Hence, the recommendations in the national plan that relate to empowering and protecting patients and carers, including treatment will be fulfilled in part through this process. It is expected that ERNs will have a major structuring effect by linking thematic expert centres across the EU. </p>  <p>  With the encouragement of the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases, Acute Hospital Divisions in the HSE and the Department of Health, five centres of expertise were designated in June this year during the first round of calls from the European Commission for participation in European Reference Networks. Three of these designated centres applied for membership of ERNs. It is anticipated that the National Centre for Medical Genetics will have a role in these European Reference Networks in due course.</p>  <p>  The establishment of a National Rare Disease Office (NRDO) featured prominently in the recommendations of the Rare Disease plan. The national office was established by the HSE in June 2015. Its work is currently led by the NCPRD Clinical Lead, supported by an Information Scientist, part-time Administrative Officer, part-time Genetic Counsellor and by a 0.2FTE Consultant Geneticist. It is, among other functions, providing up-to-date information regarding new treatment and management options, including clinical trials. In addition, the post of Information Scientist for the office is being funded jointly by the HSE and the EU Commission.</p></reply>

This plan includes the strategic objective of informing and influencing Government policy and legislation to safeguard the rights of people who may be vulnerable, including a focus on issues such as adult safeguarding, advocacy, the use of chemical restraint and deprivation of liberty.</p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive has operational responsibility for planning, managing and delivering home and other community-based services for older people and people with a disability.

We are also aware that in recent years that the nature and scale of drug misuse has changed, with an increased prevalence of poly-drug use, as well as use of benzodiazepines, and other prescription or non-prescription medications.  Treatment figures indicate an increase in the number of people seeking treatment for benzodiazepine use. </p>  <p>  The fourth national drug prevalence survey, carried out in 2014/15, examined the use of psychotropics such as sedatives and tranquillisers (which include benzodiazepines) in the adult population aged 15 or over; 14% of those surveyed reported having used such drugs at some point in their lives. The number of drug-related deaths is one of the key indicators used to measure the consequences of problem drug use. The number of deaths where benzodiazepines were implicated increased by 24%, to 160 in 2013 compared with 129 in 2012. Two fifths of poisonings in 2013 involved benzodiazepines.</p>  <p>  The drugs prevalence survey also found that more than 6 in 10 (61.5%)  Irish people report having used &ldquo;other opiates&rdquo; at some stage in their life. However these reports do not include information on the source of these drugs; whether they have been prescribed for them or sourced illicitly.</p>  <p>  The Medical Council is the statutory body for the registration and regulation of doctors engaged in medical practice. The Council has set out specific requirements for doctors regarding prescribing of drugs at section 42 of its Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners (2016).   While the Guide is not a legal code, it sets out the principles of professional practice and conduct that all doctors registered with the Medical Council are expected to follow.  At 42.3 it states that when prescribing medications, doctors must comply with Misuse of Drugs legislation and other relevant regulations and/or guidelines. Whilst at 42.7 the Guide advises that doctors must be aware of the dangers of drug dependency when prescribing benzodiazepines, opiates and other drugs with addictive potential.</p>  <p>  In 2013 the Irish College of General Practitioners published guidance for its members on diagnosing and managing mental health difficulties in children and adolescents.  In June of this year the Early Warning Emerging Trends (EWET) subcommittee of the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol, with the agreement of my Department, wrote to health care professionals highlighting the need for vigilance when prescribing and dispensing pregabalin and gabapentin, as these drugs present a risk of addiction and a potential for illegal diversion and misuse. Prescribers were advised to always undertake a risk benefit assessment prior to prescribing either of these medicines for patients under their care.</p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to benzodiazepines there are prescribing guidelines in place at national level for both general practitioners (GPs) and psychiatrists. The Good Prescribing Practice for Clinicians guidelines were published in 2002 to guide GPs about prescribing benzodiazepines. Standards of practice should ensure short term use of benzodiazepines, using the lowest dose possible and, where their use has been for longer than four weeks, clear evidence of education on reducing with a view to discontinuing. If this is not possible there should be clear documentation on reasons for continuing the prescription.</p>  <p>  The College of Psychiatry issued a Consensus Statement on the Use of Benzodiazepines in Specialist Mental Health Services in 2012. The College recommends that members who prescribe benzodiazepines should follow good practice guidelines for their use. This includes conducting regular audit of practice.</p>  <p>  The HSE has written to all GPs outlining their levels of benzodiazepine and other hypnotics prescribing on the GMS scheme in an initiative to encourage better quality prescribing of these drugs. This was in line with a recommendation from my Department&rsquo;s 2002 Report of the Benzodiazepine Committee.  GPs received individualised and confidential reports every three months. The reports, compiled from PCRS data on the number of benzodiazepine and hypnotics prescriptions dispensed by pharmacists, allowed GPs to see exactly how many times they have prescribed these drugs in the preceding months.  Most benzodiazepines and the so-called &ldquo;z-drug&rdquo; zolpidem are already controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Acts. Regulations and Orders made under the Misuse of Drugs Acts specify the level of control which apply to these substances.</p>  <p>  The Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2016 was passed by the Oireachtas in July. Stricter controls will apply to certain psychotropic drugs including phenazepam, lisdexamphetamine, zopiclone and zaleplon. Controlling these substances in the Act was part one of a two-step process. The Act provides for the revocation and remaking of various Regulations and Orders which had been confirmed by the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2015. </p>  <p>  Work on drafting various new Regulations and Orders is complex and technical in nature but is at an advanced stage and is expected to be completed in the coming weeks. Among other things, these new Regulations will introduce stricter prescribing and dispensing rules on a number of psychotropic drugs including benzodiazepines and z drugs.</p></reply>

However, the issue of pricing and reimbursement of medicines and patient access to affordable medicines has been addressed at European level.  In June of this year the EU Council adopted conclusions on strengthening the balance in the pharmaceutical systems in the EU and its Member States.  Those conclusions invited Member States to explore opportunities for cooperation on pricing and reimbursement of medicines and to identify areas for cooperation which could contribute to higher affordability and better access to medicines.  I have indicated my support for these measures and I welcome the opportunity for Member States to cooperate by sharing information so that we can achieve affordable and sustainable access to medicines.</p>  <p>  I intend to travel to Lisbon on 7 December to attend the Round Table Meeting of European Ministers of Health and Pharmaceutical Companies and my officials continue to engage with their counterparts in other Member States.</p></reply>

I can assure the Deputy that the prevention and control of healthcare associated infections (HCAIs) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a significant patient safety and public health priority for the Government.</p><p>I am aware of the challenges in relation to tackling multidrug-resistant superbug infection rates in Irish hospitals. I am advised that Irish hospitals, like other  hospitals internationally, are taking steps to reduce HCAIs and AMR including the prudent use of antibiotics.A wide range of initiatives has been put in place in the Irish health system over several years to tackle HCAIs and AMR, including improved surveillance of infections and prescribing and infection prevention and control processes.Also included are antimicrobial stewardship initiatives and public and professional awareness-raising with a significant emphasis on the education and training of healthcare professionals.  The HIQA National Standards for the Prevention and Control of Healthcare Associated Infections (2009) are being updated.</p><p>In addition, on foot of concerns about outbreaks of  Multi-Drug resistant Organisms (MDROs) in recent years a National Taskforce on AMR to address the issues of managing and reducing AMR and HCAI was established by the HSE  in 2015. The Taskforce's remit is to direct and coordinate an effective system-wide response to the issue of HCAI/AMR. </p><p>The Taskforce is a multi-disciplinary high-level group that supports and advises HSE Divisions on reducing incidences of MDRO through ensuring rational antimicrobial use across all healthcare settings, providing effective diagnostic support for infection, improving professional education, training and public engagement to promote wider understanding of the need for appropriate use of antibiotics, ensuring compliance with the National Standards for the Prevention and Control of HCAI across all healthcare settings and ensuring implementation of national guidelines across all healthcare settings.  </p><p>Ireland is also developing a National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance in line with the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s 2015 Global Action Plan on AMR and the European Council&rsquo;s 2016 Conclusions : &lsquo;The next steps under a &lsquo;<i>One Health&rsquo;</i>approach to combat antimicrobial resistance&rsquo;.  The National Action Plan is being developed with the oversight and guidance of the Interdepartmental AMR Consultative Committee.  The Committee was established in 2014 by my Department&rsquo;s Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Veterinary Officer of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in recognition of the need for a &lsquo;whole of Government&rsquo; approach to tackling the issue of AMR.  This intersectoral approach crosses the health, veterinary and environmental spheres to encompass all stakeholders&rsquo; efforts to address what is a world-wide concern.  This work will continue in 2017 and it is intended that the National Action Plan will be published in 2017.</p><p>Nationally, I expect that the HSE will place particular emphasis on prevention and management of healthcare associated infections and antimicrobial resistance in its service planning for 2017.</p><p>Tackling AMR will require the whole system to prioritise key initiatives, working with our international colleagues. Ireland is fully committed to and engaged in addressing resolution of the problem of AMR and will continue to collaborate at international, EU and national levels to this end.</p></reply>

I do appreciate that there are immediate strains within our acute hospital system. But I am also conscious that our growing and ageing population is going to drive demand for health and social care services more broadly. We know that the overall population increased by 6.8% over the period 2007 &ndash; 2016, while the numbers over the age of 65 increased by nearly 33%. This demographic pattern is going to continue in the coming years. </p><p>A comprehensive review which will assess current capacity and future capacity requirements across our primary, social and acute care services will allow us to properly examine and determine how the system as a whole can respond to these challenges. My Department has commenced work on an overall model of care which will inform the assessment of future capacity requirements across the different parts of the health sector. This model of care will be informed by international best practice and the work underway has included engagement with experts from the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies in this regard.</p><p>My intention is that the capacity review will be undertaken by my Department, with suitable external expert inputs as required. Initial work on scoping the project is already underway. I envisage that the review itself will commence early in the New Year and will be advanced sufficiently to enable it to contribute to next year&rsquo;s mid-term review of the current Capital Plan (2016 &ndash; 2021).</p></reply>

The Company must submit a separate application to extend a treatment to a new cohort of patients.  Each application is considered separately on its merits and in line with the 2013 Act.</p><p>In reaching its decision, the HSE examines all the evidence which may be relevant in its view for the decision (including the information/dossier submitted by the Company) and will take into account such expert opinions and recommendations which may have been sought by the HSE at its sole discretion (for example, from the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics). </p><p>In considering an application, the HSE will also have regard to Part 1 and Part 3 of Schedule 3 of the 2013 Act. Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria: </p><p>1.  the health needs of the public;</p><p>2.  the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;</p><p>3.  the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement;</p><p>4.  the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks; </p><p>5.  the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item; </p><p>6.  the clinical need for the item or listed item;</p><p>7.  the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety;</p><p>8.  the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and </p><p>9.  the resources available to the HSE. </p><p>I am informed that the HSE received a request and economic dossier from the manufacturer of Ivacaftor, brand name Kalydeco, for the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients aged 2 years and older weighing less than 25kg.  In March of this year the HSE asked the NCPE to carry out a health technology assessment of the applicant&rsquo;s economic dossier on the cost effectiveness of this treatment.</p><p>The NCPE completed its assessment and made a recommendation in October 2016.  The NCPE determined that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness of the drug for its intended cohort of patients and did not recommend that it should be reimbursed for this indication at the submitted price.  In the economic dossier submitted to the NCPE the manufacturer estimates that there are 18 patients eligible for early ivacaftor treatment. </p><p>A summary of the health technology assessment has been published on the NCPE website and is available at:<i></i><i>. </i></p><p>As the HSE is responsible for the negotiations with manufacturers I have asked them to reply to the Deputy directly in relation to the status of negotiations with the manufacturer.</p><p>I understand how patients and their families must feel in these circumstances as they await the decisions by the HSE in relation to reimbursement.

The Programme for a Partnership Government aims to recruit and retain talent within the public health service by implementing new procedures to ensure more efficient and timely recruitment of doctors and nurses.  The Government has secured a total budget of &euro;14.6 billion for the health service in 2017, the highest ever health budget.  This funding will allow for the filling of a significant number of medical, nursing and other key service delivery posts. </p>  <p>  A national integrated strategic framework for health workforce planning is being progressed by my Department.  It is working with other Government Departments, the Health Service Executive and other agencies to implement an approach to workforce planning and development with the objectives of recruiting and retaining the right mix of staff.  This National Integrated Strategic Framework for Health Workforce Planning is intended to reshape Ireland&rsquo;s future health workforce planning to support and enable the productivity of the existing workforce and the recruitment and retention of a highly valued workforce.  It will also encompass the expansion of the size, skills, competences and behaviours of the future workforce to meet current and emerging demands.  It is expected that a report and a high level implementation plan will be submitted to the Minister in early 2017.</p>  <p>  The MacCraith Group established  in 2013 submitted three reports and made 25 recommendations aimed at improving the retention of medical graduates in the public health system and planning for future needs.  My Department has established an Implementation Monitoring Group, comprising key stakeholders to support the implementation of the recommendations with each recommendation having an identified business owner.  One of the Group's key recommendations led to improved new entrant pay scales for consultants implemented with effect from 1st September 2014. </p>  <p>  There are many initiatives currently underway to improve nursing and midwifery staffing levels throughout the country.  The HSE is focused on offering graduating nurses and midwives permanent posts and on replacing agency with permanent staff.  A number of specific measures in relation to pay that will support the recruitment and retention have been taken including, the restoration of incremental credit for the 36 week undergraduate placement, higher rates of pay for the placement and additional pay for nurses taking on tasks previously undertaken by doctors. </p>  <p>  My Department regularly engages with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on matters concerning pay and working conditions for medical and nursing personnel and methods to address recruitment and retention difficulties.  Arrangements are in place to commence partial restoration of public service pay in 2017, reflecting the Government's recognition of the need to address pay and, at the same time, manage the public finances in a prudent manner.  Further engagement with the staff side on pay and related matters is also in train as announced by my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on 29th November.</p></reply>

I examined the report and submitted it to Government last week prior to its publication on my Department's website on 22 November last.  I have not been in contact with the three survivor groups, as the work of the Scheme has now concluded. </p>  <p>    The total cost of the Scheme was just under &euro;34 million and payments of &euro;50,000, &euro;100,000 or &euro;150,000 were made to 399 women, who met the criteria for an award.  All of the women have received their respective payments totalling &euro;29.85 million.  The majority of claimants were over 75 years and payments were made to women between the ages of 51 and 96 years.  185 women who applied to the Scheme could not establish that they had a surgical symphysiotomy.  Pubiotomy was frequently claimed but was established in only 1 case.  Significant disability was established in this case.</p>  <p>  As the Scheme was designed to be simple, straight forward and non-adversarial, the women were not expected to give oral testimonies as they might do in a court setting.  In the interests of accountability, the Scheme required each applicant to prove that she had a surgical symphysiotomy or pubiotomy in order to be considered for the assessment of an award.  The level of proof required was clearly set out in the terms of the Scheme.  The Judge worked with each woman or her legal representative to locate medical records.  The Judge met some women in different parts of the country where she considered this was necessary.  Where claims could not be reconciled with established facts, women were examined by relevant medical experts.  </p>  <p>  Judge Clark encouraged women who believed they had a symphysiotomy to apply to the Scheme, advising them that they did not give up their right to pursue their case through the courts.  It was only on accepting an award under the Scheme that a woman had to discontinue her legal proceedings.  The vast majority of women opted to do so. </p>  <p>  The brief given to Judge Clark in November 2014 was not an easy one.  At that time the advice to the Department of Health was that many women would face an uphill struggle in proving their claims in the courts, with an uncertain outcome, as each case would be adjudicated on its merits.  In her substantial Report Judge Clark has provided a comprehensive overview of the historical and medical context of symphysiotomy.  Judge Clark had a unique opportunity to do this and her findings support the earlier findings of Prof Oonagh Walsh, whose report, commissioned by the Department of Health, was published in 2014.</p>  <p>  Payments under the Scheme, together with the ongoing provision of medical services by the HSE, including medical cards, represent a comprehensive response to this issue by Government, which should help bring resolution to the women and their families.</p></reply>

Healthy Ireland takes a whole-of-Government and whole-of-society approach to improving health and well-being and the quality of people&rsquo;s lives and provides an overarching approach to addressing health inequalities among Travellers.  </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the implementation of Ireland&rsquo;s first National Maternity Strategy - Creating a Better Future Together 2016 - 2026 which sets out the vision for the future of Ireland&rsquo;s maternity services.  The Strategy states that the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme will ensure that additional supports are provided to pregnant women from vulnerable, disadvantaged groups or ethnic minorities, and take account of the family's determinants of health.  </p>  <p>  In the context of these policy frameworks, the HSE addresses the health needs of Travellers by providing some traveller specific health services, largely in primary care, in order to link Travellers to mainstream services.  To this end, the Traveller Primary Health Units (THUs) have been set up throughout the country to provide primary health care to Travellers in a culturally appropriate service model which comprises a partnership of health professionals - G.P.s, dedicated Nurse Specialists and Public Health Nurses - and traveller link workers. </p>  <p>  The THUs teams have adopted a preventative/well-being model that promotes better health by linking infants and women to preventative public health and screening programmes.  Improvements have been achieved in the rate of immunisation amongst traveller infants and increased presentation for developmental checks. Preventative programmes addressing cause specific issues for respiratory illness and other chronic conditions such as cardiovascular illness and Type 2 Diabetes are ongoing.  As respiratory illness is the single most common presenting illness amongst Traveller infants, health promotion education and awareness programmes, through the THUs, play an important role in addressing the lifestyle factors such as smoking that contribute to infant mortality. </p>  <p>  The THUs also provide advice on family planning and on pre and post natal care aimed at producing better health outcomes for mothers and infants.  The All Ireland Traveller Health Study found that the interval between births to mothers in the Travelling Community to be much shorter than that within the general population.  With the increase in contraceptive usage and breast feeding, which is being promoted by the THU's, the interval between births is expected to widen with the resultant beneficial impact on maternal health at birth and, consequently, on infant health and weight at birth.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Department of Justice and Equality plays an important leadership role in developing a concerted response to Traveller needs, including health needs.  That Department is leading on the development of a new National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy.  The Strategy aims to provide a set of specific actions that need to be taken to improve the situation for Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland.  It is envisaged that the Strategy will include agreed actions in relation to improving the health of travellers. </p></reply>

However, the information sought by the Deputy on the amount spent on commissioning therapists in private practice to undertake assessments under the assessment of need process is not routinely collated and aggregated into a statistical profile. </p><p>The HSE are currently reviewing costs for private therapy services expended via the nine CHO Areas and if the Deputy wishes to be advised of more up to date data in this area, we will endeavour to provide this detail at a later date.  In the interim, a comprehensive data collection exercise was undertaken in 2013 to ascertain the number of private assessments (and associated costs) arranged during an 18 month period between 1 January 2012 and 30 June 2013.  A total of 1,794 private assessments were commissioned at a total cost of &euro;1,350,175. </p><p>The HSE endeavours to meet its legislative requirements for Assessment of Need reports and acknowledges the current challenges in achieving this.  There were 3,318 Assessment of Need Reports completed in 2015.  A total of 1,035 of these (31%) were completed within the timeframes set out in the Disability Act 2005.  The length of time to complete the assessment of need will vary depending on the person&rsquo;s complexity of need; however, the average duration of the assessment process per report completed in 2015 was 10.4 months. </p><p>The HSE continues to treat this issue as a priority and is putting in place a number of targeted initiatives in 2017 to improve the current timeframes.  To this end, as part of its planning for 2017 there will be a number of specific actions including:</p><p>-prioritising assessments; </p><p>-holding additional clinics; and</p><p>-reconfiguring resources to target areas of greatest need.</p><p>Therapists in private practice have been contracted to conduct assessments, where appropriate.  Guidance Notes have been issued to Assessment Officers for use when contracting private practitioners to undertake assessments under the Disability Act, to help ensure that children are being assessed in line with the provisions of the legislation and in line with the standards laid down by HIQA.</p></reply>

However, per capita figures are only one of a number of measures that can give a view of drugs spending in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The OECD report cited by the Deputy uses data from 2014, the last year for which full figures are available.  In 2014, expenditure on prescription and over the counter medicines accounted for just over 14 percent of overall health expenditure in Ireland.  Although this was higher than several other EU countries, including Denmark, Finland, and Belgium, it was lower than Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, and significantly lower than Greece or Hungary.</p>  <p>  OECD data on pharmaceutical expenditure includes expenditure on both prescription and over the counter medicines but excludes expenditure on pharmaceuticals consumed in hospitals and other health care settings as part of an inpatient or day case treatment.  As acknowledged by the OECD "comparability issues exist with regards to the administration and dispensing of pharmaceuticals for outpatients in hospitals."</p>  <p>  Looking at expenditure in Ireland alone, the report noted the significant reversal in the growth of pharmaceutical spending in Ireland between 2009 and 2014.  There has also been a number of significant developments since 2014 that will further reduce the cost of medicines in Ireland.  The Framework Agreement on the Pricing and Supply of Medicines will reduce the price of medicines to the average of 14 other countries and provides for an annual downward only price realignment.  This will ensure that Irish medicine prices continue to reduce in line with price reductions across reference countries.  This Agreement is expected to deliver savings of up to &euro;750 million over the next four years.  </p>  <p>  Other initiatives will continue to be pursued, to ensure that we achieve affordable prices for medicines for both patients and the State including the HSE's Medicines Management Programme, which has a particular focus on cost-effective prescribing, and the continued implementation of generic substitution and reference pricing.</p>  <p>  In relation to Orkambi, the HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines under the community drugs schemes, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. </p>  <p>  I am informed that, following a request from the HSE, the NCPE carried out an assessment of the manufacturer's economic dossier submitted in March 2016 on the cost effectiveness of Orkambi.

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that HSE has recognised that early intervention services and services for school-aged children with disabilities need to be improved and organised more effectively and this process is well under way.  I would like to emphasise that there has been continual additional investment in this area in order to support the HSE as it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory time-frames which apply to the assessment of need process. </p>  <p>  Since 2014, the roll out of the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18s) Programme has entailed targeted investment of &euro;14m and the provision of 275 additional therapy staff, to increase services for children with all disabilities.  The HSE is currently engaged in a reconfiguration of existing therapy resources to geographic based teams for children (0-18 years).  The objective of the new model of assessment and intervention is to provide one clear referral pathway for all children (0-18s), irrespective of their disability, where they live or the school they attend.</p>  <p>  It is expected that this re-configuration of services will have a significant impact on our ability to meet the needs of children and young people in a more efficient, effective and equitable manner and, in particular, on our ability to comply with the statutory time-frames set out in the Disability Act and the accompanying regulations.</p></reply>

In 2016, the GP training intake increased from 157 to 172 places and I am anxious to achieve further increases in future years.</p><p>In September 2015, the HSE published a medical workforce planning report entitled<i>Medical Workforce Planning - Future Demand for General Practitioners 2015 - 2025. </i>The report identified a current unmet service demand of around 500 GPs, and estimatedthat there will be a shortage of around 493 GPs in Ireland by 2025 if the impact of population ageing on GP consultation rates alone is considered.  This estimate was based on the assumption that there would be no inward migration of GPs and that the GP training intake would remain at the 2015 level of 157 training places annually.  As I have indicated, the Government is committed to increasing GP trainee places on a phased basis.</p><p>Further efforts undertaken in recent years to increase the number of practising GPs include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible/shared GMS/GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday, as well as the introduction of an enhanced supports package for rural GP practices.  These steps should help to address the future demand for GPs by enticing GPs who may have ceased practising for family or other reasons back into the workforce, facilitating GPs to work past the standard retirement age and encouraging more GPs to work in rural areas.</p><p>In addition, I am cognisant of the need for a new GP services contract which will help modernise our health service and develop a strengthened primary care sector, and health service management have already progressed a number of significant measures through engagement with GP representatives. The GP contracts review process will, inter alia, seek to introduce further measures aimed at making general practice a fulfilling and rewarding career option into the future.</p></reply>

While recognising that demand for acute hospital services has increased this year with a 4% increase in inpatient and day case activity nationally to end October compared with the same period last year, the important issue for patients is how long they wait.</p>  <p>  Under the HSE Service Plan 2016 targets, 95% of people should wait less than 15 months for their inpatient or day-case  appointment.  The latest NTPF inpatient/day-case waiting list figures indicate that the total number of people on the inpatient/day-case waiting list for Beaumont Hospital is 5,769 and that 87% of people at the hospital are waiting less than 15 months for their inpatient or day-case appointment. 4,667 or 81% of people are waiting less than 12 months for their inpatient or day case appointment.</p>  <p>  In August, I asked the HSE to develop a Waiting List Action Plan for 2016 to reduce by year end the number of patients waiting over 18 months on the Inpatient Day-case Waiting List.  Since then, approximately 6,500 patients have been removed from the waiting list nationally.  Additional funding of &euro;11.25 million has been allocated under the Winter Initiative in order to support patient treatment under this Action Plan.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 provides for the treatment of our longest-waiting patients. &euro;20 million is being allocated to the NTPF in 2017, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  Planning of these initiatives is currently being finalised.  I will shortly be asking the HSE to develop a Waiting List Action Plan for 2017 working collaboratively with the NTPF to address inpatient, day-case and outpatient waiting times.</p></reply>

The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.  NIAC recommended that the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine be given to all girls aged 12-13 in 2009 and in September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools.  It is estimated that HPV vaccination will eventually save 60 lives annually in this country.</p>  <p>  By January 2016, over 200 million doses of Gardasil had been distributed worldwide.  In Ireland over 580,000 doses of Gardasil have been administered and over 220,000 girls have been fully vaccinated against HPV since it was introduced in 2010.</p>  <p>  Negative publicity and misinformation is affecting the uptake of the vaccine.  We must ensure that people understand that the vaccine is safe and can save lives. </p>  <p>  Since early this year The HSE are working with other stakeholders to counteract negative publicity and misinformation about the vaccine.  The Irish Cancer Society held two public meetings in Galway and Cork.  These are two areas where uptake rates of the vaccine had reduced significantly.  These meetings included talks by renowned international HPV cancer expert, Professor Margaret Stanley, cervical cancer survivors and hospital consultants.</p>  <p>  The parents of girls in first year of second level school have been given a revised information leaflet, consent form and contact phone numbers for their local immunisation office.  Any queries they have concerning the vaccine can be addressed by the school immunisation team prior to vaccination day.  In addition girls, who may have declined the first dose of vaccine, will get an opportunity to receive this when the school immunisation team revisits the school.</p>  <p>  Information about the vaccine and its benefits has been circulated to all school principals, management bodies, National Parents Councils and GPs.  The HSE have also met with the Department of Education and school management bodies.</p>  <p>  In addition, prior to the start of the 2016/2017 school immunisation programme there was a coordinated local and national media campaign involving the Irish Cancer Society, HSE Communications and the National Cancer Screening Programmes.  It is intended that the promotion of HPV vaccine as a safe and effective vaccine will continue and the HSE plans to commence focus groups with parents in the near future.</p>  <p>  These actions should address the concerns of many parents and encourage their daughters to receive this important cancer preventing vaccine.</p></reply>

This group was established by the Department of Health in 2015 and it has met on a number of occasions. </p>  <p>  One of the principal recommendations in the Plan was the establishment of a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases.  This programme was to be responsible, over time and among other functions, to assist with mapping and  developing care pathways for rare diseases; facilitating timely access to centres of expertise &ndash; nationally and internationally; in developing care pathways with European Reference Centres for those ultra-rare disorders where there may not be sufficient expertise in Ireland.</p>  <p>  In line with this recommendation, a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases was established in 2013 under the National Clinical Strategy and Programmes Division of the HSE.  The programme is a joint initiative between the HSE and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  This clinical programme is a channel for assisting with the advancement of a number of other recommendations in the plan, such as those on National Centres of Expertise for rare diseases; and in this vein, the programme designed a framework for the designation of Irish Centres of Expertise in cooperation with HSE Acute Hospitals Division in line with the recommendations stipulated in the national plan.</p>  <p>  The Rare Diseases National Plan also recommended that &lsquo;the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases through a National Office for Rare Diseases develop the clinical and organisational governance framework that would underpin care pathways and access to treatment for rare disease patients, particularly in the context of transition from paediatrics to adult care'.</p>  <p>  As such the National Clinical Programme has developed a draft transition model of care which will be entering a consultation stage very shortly.</p>  <p>  The National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Department of Health encouraged designated Centres of Expertise to participate in European Reference Networks (ERNs) for Rare Diseases in line with the national plan. ERNs are European networks connecting health care providers and centres of expertise so that international expertise on specific rare diseases may be pooled together for the benefit of patients.  Any centre applying for membership of an ERN must have strategies in place to ensure that care is patient-centred; that patients' rights and preferences are respected; and must show a research component to their work.</p>  <p>  Hence, the recommendations in the national plan that related to empowering and protecting patients and carers, and research on rare diseases will be fulfilled in part through this process.  It is expected that ERNs will have a major structuring effect by linking thematic expert centres across the EU.</p>  <p>  With the encouragement of the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases, Acute Hospital Divisions in the HSE and the Department of Health, five centres of expertise were designated in June this year during the first round of calls from the European Commission for participation in European Reference Networks.  Three of these designated centres applied for membership of ERNs.</p>  <p>  In 2014, the Minister for Health announced &euro;850,000 for investment into charity-led research priorities, which particularly benefits rare disease research.  Five charities were to provide matching funding bringing the total investment to &euro;1.9 million.  They were to share &euro;850,000 in State funding to take part in international research into rare medical conditions.  In 2016, the next cohort of projects was funded by the State with &euro;1.686 million, matched by charity funding of &euro;1.224 million.  The total funding of &euro;2.91 million is shared between 14 charities.  The next round of this joint funding initiative will open in 2017. The EU commission now intends to explore the possibility to further strengthen the collaboration between member states and the Commission in the area of research on rare diseases.</p>  <p>  The establishment of a National Rare Disease Office (NRDO) featured prominently in the recommendations of the Rare Disease plan.  The national office was established by the HSE in June 2015.  Its work is currently led by the NCPRD Clinical Lead, supported by an Information Scientist, part-time Administrative Officer, part-time Genetic Counsellor and by a 0.2 FTE Consultant Geneticist.  It is, among other functions, providing up-to-date information regarding new treatment and management options, including clinical trials. In addition, the post of Information Scientist for the office is being funded jointly by the HSE and the EU Commission.</p>  <p>  The NRDO has already performed a preliminary situation analysis of the existing rare disease registries and is in the process of assigning these known registries on our national Orphanet site, which is the international rare disease reference and information portal funded by the EU. The EU Commission has started the development of a European Platform on Rare Diseases Registration.  Its principal goal is to enable sharing and use of rare diseases patient data across Europe, among the multitude of existing patient registries, within and across rare diseases. </p>  <p>  A number of recommendations about access to appropriate drugs and technologies were contained in the plan.  One chief recommendation in this regard refers to the HSE developing a Working Group to bring forward appropriate decision criteria for the reimbursement of orphan medicines and technologies; and that the approach should include an assessment system similar to that for cancer therapies established under the National Cancer Control Programme.  The HSE has advised my Department that its Acute Hospitals Division is developing the terms of reference, required membership and reporting relationship for this committee which will parallel the National Cancer Control Programme Technology Review Committee.</p>  <p>  This Committee will also be supported by the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases Clinical Advisory Group.  The national plan for Rare Diseases recommended that the Health Identifiers Bill and the Health &amp;amp; Patient Safety Bill be published.  The former was published in 2013 and enacted in 2014.  It is now being implemented by the HSE.  A revised and much expanded General Scheme of a Health Information and Patient Safety Bill was approved by the Government in November 2015 and published on the Department's website. </p>  <p>  Two recommendations referred to training in rare diseases for healthcare professionals.  The Department of Health has contacted formally the various healthcare representative and professional bodies about implementing these recommendations.</p>  <p>  Finally, rare diseases have already been tabled on the agenda for North-South meetings.  Therefore, future work to deepen cooperation between both jurisdictions on rare diseases is anticipated.</p></reply>

Based on the HSE Performance Reports, inpatient discharges have increased by 5.5% since the end of 2013 at the hospital.</p>  <p>  In August, I asked the HSE to develop a Waiting List Action Plan for 2016 to reduce by year end the number of patients waiting over 18 months on the inpatient/day-case waiting list.  Since then, approximately 6,500 patients have been removed from the waiting list.  Additional funding of &euro;11.25 million has been allocated under the Winter Initiative in order to support patient treatment under this Action Plan.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 provides for the treatment of our longest-waiting patients. &euro;20 million is being allocated to the NTPF in 2017, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  Planning of these initiatives is currently being finalised.  I will shortly be asking the HSE to develop a Waiting List Action Plan for 2017 working collaboratively with the NTPF to address inpatient, day-case and outpatient waiting times.</p></reply>

Currently, 2649 people live in congregated settings and the objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.  It is anticipated that 97 people will have completed their move to the community during 2016, with a further 63 ready to move early in 2017.  A similar additional number of people will be supported to move throughout 2017.</p><p>A subgroup, under the<i>Transforming Lives </i>Programme is developing an implementation plan for moving people from institutions in accordance with the recommendations of the <i>Time to Move on from Congregated Settings </i>report.  The needs and wishes of people moving from congregated settings will be prioritised during this process with a model of support based on a person centred plan.</p><p>I wish to emphasise that appropriate plans and resources are being put in place to ensure that people are properly supported as they move out of institutional care.  Earlier this year, I announced the provision of &euro;100 million in capital funding between now and 2021 to provide more appropriate homes for people currently living in a number of institutions.  Further supports are provided by a Service Reform Fund involving the Department of Health, the Atlantic Philanthropies, the HSE and Genio.</p><p>Separately, the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government has provided &euro;10 million under the Capital Assistance Scheme for people transitioning from institutions in 2016, benefitting an estimated further 100 people.  &euro;1 million in ring-fenced funding is also being made available by that Department in 2016 to support people moving from institutions into suitable social housing.  This demonstrates the joined up commitment of both Departments to support the de-congregation programme.</p><p>This process of moving people to more suitable accommodation in the community will take place over a number of years and will be done in full consultation with all residents and their families.</p></reply>

These are companies registered under the Companies Act, the members of which are the owners of residential units within the development, which are established for the purposes of ownership and management of such areas. The 2011 Act contains provisions relating to matters such as:</p><p>-  the transfer of common areas to the OMCs (sections 4 and 5);</p><p>-  voting rights of members of OMCs (sections 14 and 15);</p><p>-  the provision of annual reports by OMCs to members (section 17);</p><p>-  arrangements for the holding of annual meetings to approve annual service charges (section 18);</p><p>-  establishment of a sinking fund to cover refurbishment outlays (section 19);</p><p>-  arrangements for the making of House Rules (section 23); and</p><p>-  establishment of a court-based dispute resolution process (section 24).</p><p>The Act also contains provisions which encourage the resolution of disputes that may arise between parties by means of mediation rather than recourse to court proceedings.</p><p>While I have no plans at present to conduct a formal review of the Act, I can assure the Deputy that the operation of the Act is being kept under review in my Department.</p></reply>

In a letter of reply, dated 14 October 2016, which was received from the Director of the body concerned, it has been formally confirmed that the body in question is satisfied that the internal procedures in respect of its nominations to the Legal Services Regulatory Authority were followed.</p>  <p>  As I have previously conveyed, the selection process for membership of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority is built around a framework of ten prescribed nominating bodies as set out in section 9 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015. The ten prescribed nominating bodies put forward their nominees under the procedures set out in Part 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015. They do this as appropriate to their functions and objectives as may be set out, in each case, under legislation or under common law. It remains the case that it is for each of those bodies, in the first instance, to identify their nominees for membership of the new Regulatory Authority under their applicable internal governance procedures. Specifically, in this instance, it remains for the governing body of the entity concerned, as a private body, to competently conduct the indoor management and to oversee the conduct of its own business in accordance with its own rules and procedures.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division. </p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out below in tabular form the allocation of Community Garda&iacute; by Division as of 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available from the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>The Commissioner has advised that it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises. In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations. In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security. Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates. I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. It is expected that Community Policing and all other Garda activities, will undoubtedly benefit from these resources now coming on stream.</p><p><b>Community Garda&iacute; 31 Oct 2016</b><table><tr><th>DIVISION</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>D.M.R.South Central </td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>DMR North Central </td><td>107</td></tr><tr><td>DMR NORTH</td><td>53</td></tr><tr><td>DMR EAST</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>DMR SOUTH</td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td>DMR WEST</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny/Carlow</td><td>88</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Cork North</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Cork West</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan/Monaghan</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo/Leitrim</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon/Longford</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Laois/Offaly</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>738</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This  is scheduled for Spring 2017 and will set out the preferred feasible measures, both structural and non-structural, that can manage the flood risk in each of the 300 areas.</p>  <p>  The CFRAM Programme is assessing the risk for the majority of those properties in communities at potentially significant risk from flooding. The implementation of flood risk policy must address solutions for both properties assessed through the CFRAM Programme and for other at risk properties.  Each category will involve both structural and non-structural solutions.</p>  <p>  In relation to the area of Riverview Estate, Tower, Blarney, Co Cork, it was identified as an area for further assessment in the South Western CFRAM Programme.  It was initially assessed as part of the Lee CFRAM Study, the outputs of which have been incorporated into the draft Flood Risk Management Plans (FRMP) for the South Western CFRAM.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the public consultation on the draft flood risk management plans for the South Western CFRAM Study, including  the further assessment of Tower finished on 23 September, 2016.  The draft plans will now be finalised and all observations and comments received will be considered.  A prioritised list of feasible measures will then be drawn up to address flood risk in an environmentally sustainable and cost effective manner. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the OPW and Insurance Ireland has provided for a system of information sharing in relation to completed flood works.  The nature of this arrangement is such that it should lead to a greater availability of flood cover in previously high risk area, and at better prices.  The MOU is currently being reviewed in order to see what can be done to strengthen it. </p>  <p>  Finally, you should be aware that a consumer can make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated.  In addition, individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance or believe that they are being treated unfairly may contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance.</p></reply>

This independence is seen as critical to maintaining the integrity of the taxation system and forms a key pillar of Revenue's Governance framework, and it would therefore be neither appropriate nor possible for a Minister for Finance to instruct the Revenue Commissioners as to their policy with regard to the administration of tax legislation.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that patronage shares were received by suppliers of milk as a consequence of and in proportion to the quantity of milk supplied.  Where the number of shares issued is based on and dependent on the level of business between the members and the cooperative or nominated purchaser and where the cooperative does not receive the market price for the shares issued, then the profit accruing i.e. the difference between the market value of the shares issued and the price paid for these shares, to the member is a trading receipt of the member's farming income and accordingly chargeable to income tax.  </p>  <p>  Capital Gains Tax (CGT) applies to the growth in the value of a capital asset.  For example, if an individual sells a share that grew in value after it was acquired, CGT would apply, subject to the availability of any exemption, on the increase in value.  The matter at issue in the particular case, however, is the initial value of the shares received by farmers as a result of their trading relationship either with the co-op or the nominated purchaser.  The shares were a form of payment received for the milk supplied by the farmers and therefore, in the view of Revenue, the value of the shares forms part of the trading income for the relevant years.  It is this value which forms the base cost for CGT in relation to any subsequent disposal.</p>  <p>  I am informed by Revenue that the letter which issued to farmers was in the first instance an enquiry as to whether the value of the shares received was included in the accounts for the years in question.  Farmers who did include the value of the shares in their accounts will not have any additional income tax liability in relation to the specific matter raised in these enquiries. </p>  <p>  Early engagement with Revenue will, where the share value received has been included in the accounts for the years in question, result in an early conclusion of Revenue's enquiries.  Early engagement with Revenue, where the share value received was not included in the accounts for the years in question, will facilitate a discussion between the individuals concerned and Revenue with a view to agreeing a mutually satisfactory arrangement, including if necessary, a phased payment arrangement, to deal with the tax liability involved.  I am advised by Revenue that there have been extensive contacts with them in regard to this matter generally and they are and will be responding very quickly to those contacts in order to assist farmers to bring matters to an early conclusion. </p>  <p>  I would ask the Deputy to encourage any farmers who have received a letter from Revenue in this matter to engage with Revenue without delay.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This inability to intervene in such matters is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products. </p>  <p>  However, the State can play a role in helping to stabilise the market and influence factors which contribute to costs.  Consequently, I established the Cost of Insurance Working Group and appointed Minister of State Eoghan Murphy as Chair.  The initial focus of the Working Group is on the factors that are contributing to the cost and availability of motor insurance and identifying what short-term, medium-term and long-term measures can be introduced to help consumers and businesses.  A broad range of issues affecting the cost and availability of motor insurance are being examined by the Working Group, including the issue of transparency of pricing in the insurance industry. </p>  <p>  The Working Group and the four subgroups have engaged in a consultation process and has met with and heard from a variety of relevant stakeholders including: Insurance Ireland, individual insurance companies, the Irish Brokers Association, AA Ireland, the Consumers Association of Ireland, the Law Society, the Bar Council, Irish Road Haulage Association, the Car Rental Council, the National Transport Authority and Tiomanai Tacsai na hEireann.  I have also invited submissions to the Working Group from all interested parties to insurance@finance.gov.ie.  In addition, the Working Group has engaged with relevant insurance companies as part of this consultation process. </p>  <p>  The Working Group provided me with an initial set of emerging recommendations at the end of October 2016 which have been published on the Department of Finance website and are available at www.finance.gov.ie/what-we-do/banking-financial-services/financial-services-division-2-eu/insurance-policy-and-0.  Since then, the Working Group has been working to finalise their Report and to develop an action plan to enable the relevant Government Departments and Offices to commence the implementation of agreed priority actions.  The report and action plan will detail any legislative or regulatory changes that may be required and will include a detailed timeline for implementation.</p></reply>

In the case of a self-build home, they must have drawn down the first tranche of the relevant mortgage on or after that date.  The full conditions of the scheme and its commencement remain subject to the approval of Finance Bill 2016 by the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  The date of 19 July was chosen as this was the date of the launch of 'Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness' when the introduction of the incentive was initially announced.  The backdating of this incentive was announced at that time with a view to avoiding any potential interruption in house sales, by purchasers who may otherwise have deferred purchases, pending the announcement of full details of the incentive.</p>  <p>   In relation to the use of the word drawdown, the Revenue Commissioners will follow the standard meaning of mortgage drawdown as it is applied by the financial lending institutions.  As transfers of mortgage funds are conducted electronically, a mortgage is deemed to have been drawn down as soon as the relevant funds are debited from the individual's mortgage account.  This is also the point from which the financial institution begins to calculate interest repayments on the loan.  These principles are the ones that will be followed by the Revenue Commissioners with regard to calculating the relevant date for eligibility for a rebate of income tax under the Help to Buy incentive.</p></reply>

However, I am aware that most banks will consider that a mixed-use property is an acceptable form of security for business loans, except where any particular use is likely to restrict the Bank's ability to realise its security in the event of borrower default.  It has also been brought to my attention that there are regulatory challenges to overcome in the implementation/fulfilment of mixed use lending where the customer is using the premises for both business and personal residential requirements. </p>  <p>  AIB have informed me that, at present, where the bank receives a request to facilitate mixed-use lending, the bank would investigate with the customer to see if the folio for such mixed use properties could be split which would require two separate loans (Business Loan for the business part of premises and a Mortgage for the residential part of the premises).  The bank understands that this type of split can be necessary in such mixed use lending cases, to meet the different regulatory obligations arising under the Mortgage Credit Regulations 2016, SME Lending Regulations 2015 and the Consumer Lending/arrears regulation (CPC, CCMA).</p>  <p>  Permanent TSB has advised me that the bank offers business loans to both new and established small business enterprises to fund trading activities, and that the loans may be secured or unsecured.  The Bank offers potential new customers the opportunity to discuss business plan funding requirements in order to determine the most suitable funding options and funding structures given the individual circumstances of the business.  PTSB have also advised that where the overall use of the property is such that the loan would be classified as a commercial real estate investment loan, the Bank does not currently provide new lending facilities, as it is restricted from this type of lending under its agreed restructuring plan with the European Commission.</p>  <p>  As the deputy will be aware, my department is involved in a number of initiatives to assist in the supply of credit to new businesses starting out.  Where an entrepreneur has had a difficulty in securing a loan from a bank, there are a large number of options available to them.  For example the Credit Review Office which helps SME or Farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition.  Also, the Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, provides support in the form of loans for up to &euro;25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises employing less than 10 people, with viable business propositions.</p></reply>

Firms making enquiries can be thought of in three broad categories: new entrants seeking first time authorisations; currently authorised firms seeking to expand existing operations in Ireland; and firms seeking to reverse plans to wind down operations in Ireland as a result of the Brexit vote.</p>  <p>  As part of its authorisation mandate, the Central Bank is committed to providing a clear, consistent, open and transparent authorisation process, while ensuring a rigorous assessment of the applicable regulatory standards.

In other areas the timing prescribed by EU law is a matter of months, once an application is considered as complete.  In between these extremes there is a wide variety of timeframes depending on the sector and type of business being proposed.  Actual time will depend on the type of business for which a license is being sought and the extent to which the authorisation procedure can be considered more or less standardised or more or less complex. </p>  <p>  In relation to unique and complex applications, the authorisation process is inevitably more layered than routine cases, requiring a substantial commitment of resources and the assembly of dedicated project teams with the requisite technical skills.  It is also important to note that since the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) in 2014, the ECB, with input of the Central Bank as the national competent authority (NCA), is the competent authority for the granting and revocation of banking licences.</p>  <p>  Timelines for applications processing are set out on a sector by sector basis on the Central Bank website.  The length of the application process is set from the date of submission of a complete application, which in itself can be a challenging exercise for firms and take some time to achieve.  This process can include an important period of engagement, discussion and back and forth on key issues before the application is considered complete.  To assist this and to ensure that the process is as transparent as possible, the Central Bank regularly meets and engages with firms in advance of the completed application being submitted.  This can be particularly helpful in more complex cases. </p>  <p>  To ensure transparent and predictable authorisation timelines for high-volume processes, the Bank publishes on a semi-annual basis its Regulatory Service Standards Performance Report.  These reports, which are available on the Bank's website, provide real transparency around the authorisation process for firms including measurement against standards to which the Bank is committed in terms of application processing across each of the sectors it regulates. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has not amended its stated target timelines for any sector since June 2016.</p></reply>

This is a dynamic approach to supervision which means that priority areas of focus are kept under constant review with resources being deployed to meet the evolving priorities.

Approved headcount for Financial Regulation has also increased.  However, this is against the backdrop of tightening labour markets, which has continued to impact on staff turnover.  Consequently, real growth since June 2016 is 1.2% (5.7% since the start of the year).  A significant focus on resourcing in recent months' estimates growth of 5% in FTE by the end of 2016 since the announcement of Brexit.

I am also conscious that where a bank comes into possession of a property the institution has a fiduciary responsibility to dispose of the property in a manner that satisfies its independent, commercial mandate.  However I welcome the fact that this is now also happening through interaction with the Housing Agency, local authorities or other means.</p>  <p>  As the deputy is aware, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government this summer launched Rebuilding Ireland, the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  The Action plan represents a whole of government response to the issues in the housing market with actionable measures across a wide range areas, designed to stimulate housing supply and remove many of the barriers to a normally functioning market.</p>  <p>  The Department does not have the information requested by the Deputy however I have received the following responses from the three banks in which the State has a shareholding:</p>  <p>  AIB has advised that all disclosures in relation to AIB's residential mortgages and properties in possession can be found on page 53 of AIB's Half-Yearly Financial Report 2016.  It is the bank's policy to sell all assets on a vacant possession basis.  AIB has engaged directly with the Housing Agency to provide a list of more than 500 properties for consideration.  As at end of November the Housing Agency has expressed an interest in over 200 of these properties.  AIB also noted that the bank continues to work directly with the Housing Agency to ensure all suitable properties are made available for consideration.</p>  <p>  Permanent TSB has advised me that the data requested by the deputy is not readily available for each of the past 10 months.  However they indicate that on the latest practicable date (25 November 2016) the total possession stock was 466 units.  The bank stated that, allowing for tenanted units, student accommodation and derelict units the number of vacant homes would be approximately 422 units.</p>  <p>  According to Bank of Ireland, all regulatory required disclosures for Bank of Ireland, including those related to property, can be found in their annual report.</p></reply>

Under the VAT Consolidation Act, goods sold over the internet on behalf of a supplier in another Member State to a customer in Ireland are liable to VAT in the Member State of the supplier, provided the value of their total sales to customers in Ireland does not exceed the Irish registration threshold of &euro;35,000 for distance sales.  Where sales to customers in Ireland exceed this threshold the supplier must register and account for VAT in Ireland.  Suppliers that do not exceed the Irish registration threshold can opt to register and account for VAT in Ireland on their distance sales.</p>  <p>  Where the goods are excisable products, such as alcohol and tobacco, the excise duty must be paid by the supplier before the goods arrive in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Goods purchased online by persons here from suppliers established outside the EU are subject to customs duty, VAT and excise duty, which is normally payable prior to the release of the goods.  However, small consignments, below a value of &euro;22, imported from outside the EU are exempt from VAT and such consignments, below a value of &euro;150, are not subject to Customs Duty.</p>  <p>  A Revenue publication notification PN 1882 - Ordering Goods for Personal Use over the Internet or from Mail Order Catalogues - that is available on their website, details the import taxes and duties that apply to goods supplied from EU and non-EU suppliers.  It points out that internet shoppers need to be aware that the full price of the goods involved may exceed the price quoted since some websites do not make allowance for charges such as Customs Duty, Excise Duty or VAT.</p>  <p>  In terms of compliance, Revenue staff are deployed at ports, airports and postal/courier depots to ensure compliance with customs and tax legislation.  They are supported by equipment and resources such as scanners, x-ray machines and detector dogs, which are deployed to detect prohibited goods and high duty goods, such as tobacco and alcohol, and high value imports where VAT and Customs Duty may be evaded.  These compliance activities are very successful and Revenue seizes considerable quantities of excisable and prohibited goods annually in the course of delivery through postal and other delivery channels.</p>  <p>  Revenue inform me that they are very aware of the growth in business to consumer internet sales and of the risks this presents, both to tax revenues and domestic business, and that they are working continuously to strengthen their controls in this area.  Revenue uses a range of measures to monitor internet retail activity directed at customers in Ireland and takes action to require suppliers in other EU Member States that have reached or are likely to reach the distance sales registration threshold to register and account for VAT in the Ireland.  Enquiries into the activities of suppliers based in other EU Member States are undertaken through the relevant national tax administrations under EU Mutual Assistance provisions.</p></reply>

I am aware that other State related claims have also have been submitted but these are a matter for those entities.  The Special Liquidators have advised that the likely financial result for the State from the Special Liquidation of IBRC is not yet known as it will be dependent on the ultimate level of dividend available.</p>  <p>  As per the IBRC Progress Update Report of May 2016, the Special Liquidators have previously advised that they will pay an interim dividend of 25% to all admitted unsecured creditors of the liquidation of IBRC before 31 December 2016.</p>  <p>  As also previously advised in the IBRC Progress Update Report of May 2016, it is the expectation of the Special Liquidators, based on current information, that the eventual unsecured creditor dividend will be in the range of 75% - 100% of all eligible claims.  This eventual dividend range is subject to change depending on future events which are outside the control of the Special Liquidators.  The ultimate level of dividend paid to each creditor cannot be known until such time as all loan assets are sold, the total level of adjudicated creditors is finalised and the other contingent creditor claims which may crystallise, including those from litigation, are known.</p>  <p>  As a result of The European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010), IBRC is classified in government.  Any payment from the Special Liquidators of IBRC to the State would be considered an intra-government payment with no impact on the deficit.  It would however improve the exchequer borrowing requirement as the cash received would increase the cash balances in the Central Fund and thereby reduce the required level of borrowing.</p></reply>

As part of this core function, the Central Bank committed itself to keeping the measures under review and making the necessary adjustments to reflect the evolving financial and economic situation.  Following the conclusion of the first macro prudential review, the Central Bank decided to refine the rules to ensure the sustainability and effectiveness of the current framework.</p>  <p>  Whilst the Central Bank is independent in terms of macro prudential policy, the decision to adjust the regulations is welcome.  In particular the change to the ceiling on the loan to value (LTV) ratio for all first time buyers (FTB), should better support first-time buyers in accessing the required mortgage to buy a home.  Changes to the rules should also support increased construction and transaction activity and help to alleviate some of the pent-up demand in the rental market.  Following the adjustments to the regulations, which come into effect from the 1   January 2017, the Central Bank will continue to monitor the effectiveness of the regulations taking into account evolving financial and economic circumstances.</p>  <p>  With regards to the Help to Buy initiative, the fiscal measures announced in Budget 2017 to support the housing market form an important element in the broader package of measures announced as part of Rebuilding Ireland, The Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  Rebuilding Ireland has been designed to address the key structural constraints which continue to inhibit supply.  It is within this context that the Help-to-Buy initiative has been designed to provide immediate and targeted support for first-time buyers before the structural measures contained in the Action Plan start to yield results.  The targeted nature of the initiative should provide support to first-time buyer in meeting their deposit requirements whilst also encouraging the construction of new housing units.</p>  <p>  In terms of inflation in the housing market, I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department continues to monitor developments in the property market including property price inflation on an ongoing basis.  With regards to Help to Buy initiative in particular, my Department will commission an independent impact assessment of the initiative to determine its general impact.  This report will be completed by September 2017, prior to Budget 2018.</p></reply>

Its goal is to increase the availability of low cost, flexible funding to SMEs.  The SBCI channels its funds through lending partners known as on-lenders.  The SBCI currently has three bank and five non-bank on-lending partners.</p>  <p>  The level of lending to SMEs is to a large degree driven by market demand, and the SBCI is engaged with a range of potential new on-lenders to broaden its distribution capability and market coverage.  In doing so, the SBCI is seeking to deliver a wide variety of financing products to Irish SMEs.  In this regard, it is encouraging to note that FEXCO Asset Finance were announced this week as the SBCI's newest on-lender and will provide leasing and hire purchase finance to Irish SMEs.</p>  <p>  To the end of September 2016, over 10,600 SMEs, operating across all business and economic sectors of the Irish economy, have benefitted from &euro;458 million of SBCI loans.  There is a broad geographical spread of the SMEs supported with the majority of them based outside Dublin.</p>  <p>  The SBCI is working on a number of projects, with the aim of increasing finance options for SMEs, and it is expected that announcements will be made in the coming months.</p></reply>

For the years 2011, 2012 and 2013 the rate was 0.60% of the scheme assets.  For the year 2014 the rate was 0.75% of the assets and for the year 2015, the final year of the levy, the rate was 0.15%.  Under the legislation, the payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled where needed to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy.  It is up to the trustees or insurer to decide whether, when and how the levy should be passed on and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible.</p>  <p>  However, the legislation also includes safeguards aimed at ensuring that should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, it must be applied in an equitable fashion across the different classes of scheme members that could include active, deferred and retired members. In no case may the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levy.  Where pension scheme trustees or an insurer took the decision to treat the levy as an expense of the pension scheme, they would have adjusted current or prospective benefits payable to members under that scheme.  The consequence of this treatment by the trustees or insurer could be a permanent reduction in members' benefits.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance I do not have responsibility for Semi-State Companies in general and would not therefore have detailed information on how each operated the Pension Scheme Levy and can only deal with treatment of funded schemes of bodies within the aegis of my Department.  I will write directly to the Deputy in respect of the treatment of funded schemes within the aegis of my Department as all the relevant material has not been made available in time to provide a complete response.</p></reply>

Special classes for students with ASD are staffed with a lower pupil&ndash;teacher ratio of 6:1 at primary level and 6:1.5 at post primary level, and also have Special Needs Assistant support normally amounting to 2 SNAs for a class of 6 children.</p><p>The sections of the EPSEN Act 2004 which placed the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) on a statutory footing, were also commenced in 2005.  The NCSE through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required. </p><p>Progress in developing this network has been significant and in addition to the special school placements there are 1,153 special classes available, which is an increase of over 100% in the number of special classes which were available in 2011, which was 548. </p><p>Currently there are 127 ASD early intervention classes, 525 primary ASD classes and 237 post-primary ASD classes, which represents an increase of approximately 16% on the previous school years provision of ASD special classes.</p><p>The NCSE continues to engage with schools in opening special classes where there is an identified need for special class provision.</p><p>The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill was published on 6th July 2016.  The Bill contains a provision which will empower the NCSE to designate a school for a child who has no school place for reasons related to the child&rsquo;s special educational needs and for the Child and Family Agency to designate a school for a child who has no school place (other than a child with special educational needs). </p><p>In line with recommendations from the NCSE in policy advices provided in 2011, it is the policy of the Department to include a Special Needs Unit in the accommodation brief for new school buildings, unless local circumstances indicate that it will not be required.  In addition, the Department may also provide capital funding to schools to establish special needs provision e.g. reconfigure existing accommodation to provide a special class where this has been approved or recommended by the NCSE.  </p><p>The NCSE recently launched guidelines for Boards of Management and Principals of Primary and Post Primary schools which provide information on setting up and organising special classes.

The December 2015 Government decision extended these career break/unpaid leave provisions to all staff in the education and training sector.   </p>  <p>  The 2011 Government decision is communicated to school management and teachers in Chapter 4 of the Terms &amp;amp; Conditions of Employment for Registered Teachers in Recognised Primary and Post Primary Schools - Career Break Scheme where it states &ldquo;The main objectives of this scheme below, which are not exhaustive, is for employers, wherever possible to facilitate applicants in the areas of: ... Public Representation".</p>  <p>  The effect of the Government decisions is that the only means by which a person employed in the education and training sector who takes up a seat in the Oireachtas can temporarily take leave from their post and subsequently return to it is through taking a career break/period of unpaid leave.</p>  <p>  To permit Oireachtas members to job share in a teaching post whilst still members of the Oireachtas would mean such members receiving two public salaries at the same time.  One as a public representative and one as a teacher with consequent reduced hours for the existing replacement teacher. </p>  <p>  The reason public representation is not stated in chapter 5 of the Terms &amp;amp; Conditions of Employment for Registered Teachers in Recognised Primary and Post Primary Schools - Job Sharing Scheme is because public representation is already covered in Chapter 4 of the book.</p>  <p>  I am aware that a number of Oireachtas members are employed as teachers or at other grades in the education and training sector.  The career break/unpaid leave arrangements apply to all such individuals while they are sitting Oireachtas members.  I am sure that you, along with all members of the Oireachtas, will appreciate the thinking behind the Government decisions in this matter and to allow an Oireachtas member to job share in a teaching post whilst at the same time attend the Oireachtas as a member would not be in keeping with the Government decision.</p></reply>

The primary purpose of the Act is to replace the system whereby a vehicle was declared off the road retrospectively with a system under which the vehicle must be declared off the road in advance.  The Act provides that a vehicle can be declared off the road for a minimum period of three months and a maximum period of twelve months.  Where the owner of a vehicle wishes to make a declaration of non-use, he or she must do so during the final month of an existing tax disc or a previously made declaration of non-use.  The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Computer Services Division of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport issues renewal notices at the beginning of the final month to remind motorists that a vehicle must be either taxed or declared off the road for a further period. </p>  <p>  Where a declaration of non-use is not made in the final month of a tax disc or previously made declaration of non-use, a vehicle must be taxed for the minimum period provided in motor tax legislation, which is three months in the case of the majority of the vehicle fleet and twelve months in the case of vehicles with a concessionary annual tax rate of &euro;119 or less.  Arrears of motor tax must also be paid, if applicable, if the vehicle is being taxed more than a month after the disc or the declaration of non-use has expired.  A new declaration can then be made at any stage during the final month of the new motor tax disc if the vehicle is thereafter not going to be in use in a public place.</p></reply>

However, the appointment of a receiver to a dwelling can cause confusion and distress to tenants and in circumstances where a receiver is appointed to a rented dwelling, it is essential that the rights of tenants are protected.  The Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness commits to developing a real and meaningful strategy for the rental sector.  The strategy will provide a vision of the role that the rental sector will play in the short, medium and long term, in the context of the Government&rsquo;s objectives for the housing sector overall, as set out in Rebuilding Ireland.  The position of encumbered buy-to-let properties in the overall context of rental market supply is an important focus for the strategy and in that context I am examining the possibility of further amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act that could help to bring greater clarity in this area and would be of benefit to tenants and receivers alike.</p>  <p>  However, the interplay between receivership law and the Residential Tenancies Act is complex and it is important that changes are not made to legislation that either make matters worse or lead to legal uncertainty.  The fundamental objective of any amendments made must be that tenants&rsquo; rights are protected and that clear and correct information is available to any tenant affected.</p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.</p><p>Security of tenure under the 2004 Act is based on rolling four-year tenancy cycles.  Where a tenant has been in occupation of a dwelling for a continuous period of 6 months and no notice of termination has been served in respect of that tenancy before the expiry of the period of 6 months, the tenancy is established for the remainder of the four year period. This is referred to in the Act as a &lsquo;Part 4&rsquo; tenancy.</p><p>A landlord may not terminate a Part 4 tenancy except in very clearly defined circumstances such as a failure by the tenant to comply with his or her obligations in relation to the tenancy.  Notice periods for the termination of a tenancy by the landlord vary depending on the duration of the tenancy but periods of up to 224 days are provided for under the Act.  Where there is a dispute regarding the appropriate period of notice to be given in respect of a tenancy or the validity of a notice of termination, the dispute may be referred to the RTB for resolution.</p><p>While the circumstances of each case may vary depending on the terms of the mortgage or charge under which a receiver is appointed, the appointment of a receiver does not affect the statutory or contractual rights of tenants under the Residential Tenancies Act.  However, the appointment of a receiver to a dwelling can cause confusion and distress to tenants and in circumstances where a receiver is appointed to a rented dwelling, it is essential that the rights of tenants are protected.</p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness commits to developing a real and meaningful strategy for the rental sector.  The strategy will provide a vision of the role that the rental sector will play in the short, medium and long term, in the context of the Government&rsquo;s objectives for the housing sector overall, as set out in Rebuilding Ireland. It will examine a range of matters aimed at improving security, including the position of tenancies during receivership.  However, the interplay between receivership law and the Residential Tenancies Act is complex and it is important that changes are not made to legislation that either make matters worse or lead to legal uncertainty.  The fundamental objective of any amendments made must be that tenants&rsquo; rights are protected and that clear and correct information is available to any tenant affected.</p><p>Some legislative changes are being accelerated for early enactment in the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Bill 2016 which is currently before the Oireachtas<font color="#FF0000">.</font>The Bill includes measures to prevent a future recurrence of situations where large numbers of residents in a single development are simultaneously served with termination notices to facilitate vacant possession and sale of the property.  These are accompanied by a number of other early actions to enhance the Residential Tenancies Board&rsquo;s (RTB) enforcement and dispute resolution powers.  Tenants and landlords alike will therefore see a number of improvements as a result of these legislative changes.</p></reply>

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  Commercial rates form an important element of the funding of all local authorities.  However, the legislative basis for the levying of rates is spread over a number of enactments, some dating back to the 19th century.  I have asked my Department to develop proposals for the preparation of a consolidated Rates Bill to modernise and consolidate the legislation in this area.  No public consultation has been instigated at this stage.  However, I hope to bring proposals in this area to Government shortly and I would expect the Heads of the Bill to be referred to the relevant Oireachtas Committee for pre-legislative scrutiny in due course.</p></reply>

VAT).  The main aim of the consultation, communication and engagement strategy is to ensure that the momentum for implementation is maintained throughout the life of the Plan.  A key part of the successful implementation of Rebuilding Irelandwill be ensuring that all stakeholders and the wider public are fully aware of the commitments, understand the range of initiatives and actions being rolled out and can access relevant and up-to-date information on progress. </p><p>A number of initiatives have been put in place aimed at maintaining and updating the information flow and providing a forum or point of contact for feedback, where needed.  For example, a dedicated website, www.rebuildingireland.ie., has been put in place and a dedicated email address, rebuildingireland@housing.gov.ie has also been created.  The total investment to date in the development and management of this website has been approximately &euro;54,600 (incl. VAT). </p><p>In addition to the standard provision of text and graphic information to view and download, the website facilitates engagement with the general public through the use of video presentations and social media, at a cost of approximately &euro;38,900 (incl. VAT) to date.  It is important to note that the video production costs include filming and content generation resources that may be used in future video presentations, thus potentially reducing the costs of future requirements in this area.</p><p>Pillar specific launches have also taken place to build implementation momentum by allowing for a deeper focus on a specific pillar area.  Three Pillar launches have taken place thus far and similar launches for the two remaining pillars will take place in due course.  In relation to one of the Pillar launches, there was a cost of approximately &euro;2,200 for room hire and associated costs.</p><p>There has also been a series of local authority-hosted regional events, to stimulate and encourage active involvement and early engagement by all key stakeholders at local and regional levels.</p><p>Further requirements in terms of the website, video production and social media services for the next twelve month period, are currently being considered.  All efforts will continue to be made to keep expenditure in connection with Rebuilding Ireland to a minimum.</p><p>Further information in relation to the Consultation, Communication and Engagement Strategy and in relation to progress more generally under Rebuilding Ireland is available in the First Quarterly Progress Report on Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness (in respect of Quarter 3 2016 commitments and actions), which was published on 1 November 2016 and can be accessed at:</p><p><i>.</i></p></reply>

The MLVC is a multi-disciplinary standing committee which has provided scientific, technical and engineering advice on applications for foreshore consent for the past three decades.  It is an ad hoc mechanism used to bring together officials with scientific, technical and engineering expertise from a range of Government Departments and agencies.  The MLVC is normally chaired by the Marine Institute, however for the purposes of assessing the Marine Institute's 35 year foreshore lease application in Galway Bay it will be chaired by a senior professional within my Department.</p>  <p>  With regard to the expertise of the participants, it is a matter for each relevant public body to ensure that its officials are appropriately qualified and experienced.  Information on the qualifications and experience of employees of other organisations is not held by my Department.

The application of a three-day waiting period avoids the disproportionately high administrative costs involved in processing large numbers of claims of a very short duration.</p><p>The waiting day rule is not applied in every case.  For instance, a &ldquo;period of interruption of employment&rdquo; exists where a person is unemployed or sick for any three days (consecutive or not) within six days.  Where a person is subject to intermittent spells of unemployment it would clearly be unreasonable to impose the three waiting days for each such claim.  </p><p>Accordingly legislation enables, by means of a &quot;linking rule&quot;, the aggregation of spells of unemployment so that the waiting period is confined to the first three days of the aggregate period of interruption of employment.  Specifically, this linking rule provides that any two such periods of unemployment not separated by more than 26 weeks are treated as one such period.  Consequently, where a person makes a repeat claim for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit within 26 weeks of their previous claim, the repeat claim links to the earlier claim and no waiting days apply.  </p><p>I would emphasise that people who need financial support are not left without such support during &lsquo;waiting&rsquo; days.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-01a.512.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016120100080#WRN00400"><p>The jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes provide income support for people who have lost work and are unable to find alternative full-time employment.  The 2016 Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes of &euro;2.8 billion. </p><p>Jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is a social assistance means tested payment.  Jobseeker's benefit is a social insurance benefit.  Social insurance benefits are not means tested payments but rather payments which are covered by pay related contributions.  Jobseeker's benefit is paid for 9 months (234 days) for people with 260 or more PRSI contributions paid. It is paid for 6 months (156 days) for people with fewer than 260 PRSI contributions paid.</p><p>Since the extension of full social insurance cover to part-time workers from April 1991, a range of measures were introduced to the short-term illness and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit schemes in order to ensure that disincentives to employment were not created.  In the absence of these measures, a situation would exist whereby many workers on low incomes would have access to weekly social welfare payments in excess of their income from employment.  For instance, while someone earning &euro;31.17 a week or more would have been liable for PRSI Class A contributions, the maximum personal rate of illness and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in January 1993 was &euro;70.60 a week, i.e. the social welfare benefits available could have been more than twice the level of income from employment for some people.</p><p>To overcome the potential disincentives involved, new arrangements were introduced from January 1993 to relate the rate of benefit payable to the level of the claimant&rsquo;s earnings.  These measures were regularly updated to keep pace with changes in benefit levels. </p><p>Jobseeker's Benefit rates are graduated according to an applicant&rsquo;s earnings in the relevant tax year and reduced rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit are payable where the average reckonable weekly earnings are less than the prescribed amount.  Under the current arrangements jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit recipients with earnings of less than &euro;300 per week in the relevant tax year &ndash; for claims in 2016, the relevant tax year is 2014 &ndash; get a personal rate ranging from &euro;84.50 to &euro;147.30, and reduced rates for qualified adults may also apply.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit recipients with average earnings over &euro;300 per week in the relevant tax year will receive a personal rate of &euro;188 per week.  Recipients of a graduated rate jobseeker's benefit payment can claim instead of jobseeker's benefit if it is more beneficial.</p></reply>

Waterways Ireland has informed me that the tender for the final stage of works, the construction of Derrykerrib Bridge, issued on 27th October with a submissions deadline of 12th December 2016.  Subject to a successful tender and award process, it is proposed that works would start on site in 2017 with an anticipated 18 month contract period.</p>  <p>  The outcome of the UK referendum will not have direct implications for the Ulster Canal project in the short term. There could potentially be implications in the longer term as Waterways Ireland has benefitted from EU structural funds in the past and, before the Brexit outcome, could potentially have developed such proposals in the future. Also, there is still considerable uncertainty regarding both the terms of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU and the nature of its future relationship with Ireland and the rest of the EU.  My Department will be keeping these matters under very close review.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-01a.585.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016120100081#WRO02500"><p>My Department has not undertaken a review into the cost of health insurance, as the main contributors to costs in the market are well established. The cost of private health insurance is influenced by a number of factors such as the number of persons in the market, the age profile of those holding private health insurance and ongoing medical innovations.  Each of these are contributors to the cost of care, the cost of claims and therefore the cost of premia payable. The insurance companies operate as commercial providers and as Minister for Health, I have no legal power to intervene in relation to any insurer&rsquo;s pricing strategies.</p><p>A community-rated health insurance market depends on inter-generational solidarity and requires a constant influx of young and healthy members to support the older, less healthy members. Lifetime Community Rating and &quot;Young Adult&quot; rates of premium were introduced last year to encourage young people into the market. Following on from their introduction, the number of people now holding private health insurance is 2.14 million, or 46% of the Irish population, which includes an increase of over 104,000 from January 2015 to January 2016. This upward trend has continued in 2016 when the market grew by a further 17,000 to end-September. An increase in the numbers taking out health insurance helps to control premium inflation, thereby keeping health insurance more affordable for those who wish to avail of it.</p><p>We have a highly competitive insurance market.  Many consumers can make savings on their health insurance premiums by taking advantage of promotional offers and by reviewing their level of cover to ensure their needs are being met, without being over-insured. The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) has recently launched an information campaign to coincide with policy renewal called &ldquo;<i>Before you renew, see what&rsquo;s right for you</i>&rdquo;, to help consumers make informed decisions. The HIA website offers a clear price comparison and can be accessed at www.hia.ie.  All of the health insurers provide plans at a variety of price points, which provides scope for consumers to find value in the market and to access the level of cover appropriate to their individual or family needs.</p></reply>

The Company must submit a separate application to extend a treatment to a new cohort of patients.  Each application is considered separately on its merits and in line with the 2013 Act.</p><p>In reaching its decision, the HSE examines all the evidence which may be relevant in its view for the decision (including the information /dossier submitted by the Company) and will take into account such expert opinions and recommendations which may have been sought by the HSE at its sole discretion (for example, from the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics). </p><p>In considering an application, the HSE will also have regard to Part 1 and Part 3 of Schedule 3 of the 2013 Act. Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria:</p><p>1. the health needs of the public;</p><p>2. the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;</p><p>3. the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement;</p><p>4. the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks;</p><p>5. the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item;</p><p>6. the clinical need for the item or listed item;</p><p>7. the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety;</p><p>8. the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and</p><p>9. the resources available to the HSE.</p><p>I am informed that the HSE received a request and economic dossier from the manufacturer of Ivacaftor, brand name Kalydeco, for the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients aged 2 years and older weighing less than 25kg. In March of this year the HSE asked the NCPE to carry out a health technology assessment of the applicant&rsquo;s economic dossier on the cost effectiveness of this treatment.</p><p>The NCPE completed its assessment and made a recommendation in October 2016. The NCPE determined that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness of the drug for its intended cohort of patients and did not recommend that it should be reimbursed for this indication at the submitted price.</p><p>A summary of the health technology assessment has been published on the NCPE website and is available at: . </p><p>As the HSE is responsible for the negotiations with manufacturers I have asked them to reply to the Deputy directly in relation to the status of negotiations with the manufacturer.</p></reply>

Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria:</p><p>1. the health needs of the public;</p><p>2. the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;</p><p>3. the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement;</p><p>4. the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks;</p><p>5. the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item;</p><p>6. the clinical need for the item or listed item;</p><p>7. the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety;</p><p>8. the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and</p><p>9. the resources available to the HSE. </p><p>I am informed that, following a request from the HSE, the NCPE carried out an assessment of the manufacturer's economic dossier submitted in March 2016 on the cost effectiveness of Orkambi.  This dossier included details on all relevant costs and relevant cost offsets including those associated with hospitalisation, disease management costs, intravenous antibiotics, adverse events and any additional costs arising in patients not taking Orkambi.</p><p>The NCPE has completed its Health Technology Assessment and this is available on its website.  It was submitted to the HSE in June 2016.  The NCPE determined, following an evaluation of the economic dossier, that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug.  The NCPE have confirmed that all relevant costs were included in the analysis.</p><p>The HSE has recently completed its most recent round of negotiations with the manufacturer.  On foot of this, the HSE&rsquo;s Drugs Committee, having considered the NCPE recommendation and other expert advice, is in the process of sending its latest recommendation on the cost-effectiveness of Orkambi to the HSE Directorate.  The HSE Directorate will then make a decision taking into consideration the manufacturer&rsquo;s latest price offer.  This decision will be made on objective, scientific and economic grounds in line with the 2013 Act.</p><p>I share the HSE's disappointment that the manufacturer in this case has maintained a very high price in the course of negotiations in relation to the potential reimbursement of Orkambi for Irish patients.</p><p>I appreciate that this is a very stressful time for Cystic Fibrosis patients and their families.  However, I want to assure them that I do not consider this to be the end of the process.  I would strongly urge Vertex, as the manufacturer in this case, to fundamentally reconsider its position and to table a pricing proposal which can facilitate the provision of Orkambi at a price that will represent value for money for the Irish health service, patients and the taxpayer.</p></reply>

While recognising that demand for acute hospital services has increased this year with a 4% increase in inpatient and day case activity to end October compared with the same period last year, the important issue for patients is how long they wait.</p>  <p>  The targets set out in the  HSE Service Plan 2016 indicated that 95% of people should be waiting less than 15 months for their inpatient or daycase appointment.  The latest figures published by the NTPF indicate that approximately 11 % of patients are waiting over 15 months for an inpatient or daycase appointment.</p>  <p>  In August, I asked the HSE to develop a Waiting List Action Plan for 2016 to reduce by year end the number of patients waiting over 18 months on the Inpatient Daycase Waiting List.  Since then, approximately 6,500 patients have been removed from the Waiting List. Further, approximately &euro;11m of Winter Initiative funding has been allocated in order to support patient treatment under this Action Plan.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 provides for the treatment of our longest-waiting patients.  &euro;20m is being allocated to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) in 2017, rising to &euro;55m in 2018.  Planning of these initiatives is currently being finalised with the NTPF.  I will shortly be asking the HSE to develop a Waiting List Action Plan for 2017 working collaboratively with the NTPF to address inpatient, daycase and outpatient waiting times.</p></reply>

Over the coming months it is essential that the health service plans effectively for expected surges in emergency care demand.  My Department, working with the HSE, has been driving a range of measures to improve patient ED experience times. </p>  <p>  Following the formation of Government an additional &euro;40 million was provided to assist in the management of winter pressures.  Utilising this additional funding the HSE developed the Winter Initiative Plan 2016 &ndash; 2017 which was published in September.  Key aspects of this plan are being implemented at hospital and community services level across the country. </p>  <p>  Today the HSE convened a Winter Initiative Health Summit and I met with Hospital Group CEOs, as well as hospital and Community Health Organisation managers, to reinforce the importance of driving key performance improvements across primary, acute and social care to reduce ED overcrowding and to plan for expected surges in demand in our EDs in the New Year.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that there is a very strong focus on reducing ED overcrowding in all my interactions with the HSE, hospitals and the wider health service.</p></reply>

In accordance with the Act, the assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependents.  Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines but where they may face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  </p>  <p>  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.</p>  <p>  It is important that people with medical needs and it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner.  It is clear greater discretion is being exercised by the HSE because the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation has increased from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 113,200 as of 1st November this year.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I have recently received permission from Government for my Department to prepare the Heads and General Scheme of a Bill to give children in receipt of DCA automatic entitlement to a medical card.  This new legislation will effectively mean that all children in respect of whom a DCA payment is made will automatically qualify for a medical card and, therefore, no longer be subject to the medical cards means test at any point in the future while in receipt of DCA.  It is my objective to have this legislation prepared and brought before the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.  In addition to the preparation of the legislation, I have asked the HSE, so that the proposal can be implemented in a smooth and efficient manner, to commence the process of planning for the requirements of the scheme and how the cards will issue.</p></reply>

Primary Care Centres facilitate the shift from acute care towards primary care through the range of multi-disciplinary services they can provide and the role they can play in keeping people who don't need to be in an acute setting out of hospital.  There are 97 Primary Care Centres now in operation, 40 centres are in construction or at advanced planning stage.  A further 43 locations are at preliminary stages of development.</p><p>There is a range of initiatives and services provided in a primary care setting and which I hope to see further developed, which are intended to prevent unnecessary hospital admission or attendance and to facilitate early discharge of patients.  These initiatives include the implementation of Community Intervention Teams (CITs), Outpatient Parenteral Antimicrobial Therapy (OPAT), Ultrasound Diagnostics and the GP Minor Surgery Pilot Initiative.</p><p>With 13 CIT teams in place, there have been over 22,667 referrals from January to October of this year<font color="#FF0000"> </font>which have reduced hospital bed requirements by approximately 76 beds per day.  Referrals to CITs from Emergency Departments and hospital wards have increased by 58.4% in 2016 compared to the same period last year.  Referrals from GP's to CITs have increased by 31.9% over the same period.</p><p>A project to increase access to diagnostic services in GP surgeries is currently delivering approximately 1,500 ultrasounds per month, while the GP Minor Surgery pilot has delivered just over 4,200 procedures since commencement.  Also, usage of out-of-hours GP services from January to September 2016 has increased by 11%, compared to the same period last year.</p><p>The 2016/2017 Winter Initiative provides for the expansion of Community Intervention Team services in four areas (Dublin North, Louth/Meath, Galway/Roscommon and South Tipperary) with potential to support more than 6,500 additional patients through the winter and during 2017. </p><p>As the provision of Primary Care Centres and related staffing and service matters are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE), I have arranged for the question to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

As part of this process the manufacturer must submit the price at which it is seeking reimbursement for its product.  Under Clause 6.2.1 of the Framework Agreement the maximum supplier proposed price shall be no greater than the average of the currency-adjusted relevant price (being the ex- factory price or equivalent thereof and using the applicable Exchange Rate) applicable in such of the Nominated States in which the Medicine is available on the date of application.  Under Clause 6.2.3 medicines are also subject to an annual price realignment so as to ensure that prices in Ireland fall in line with prices in other basket countries.</p>  <p>  Once submitted to the NCPE the product will then be assessed in terms of its safety, clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness at the price submitted.  The cost-effectiveness of the drug at the price submitted is factored into the NCPE's recommendation on whether or not the product should be reimbursed.</p>  <p>  Following a recommendation from the NCPE the HSE enters into negotiations with manufacturers often seeking price reductions.  The HSE frequently seeks to address what it may regard as excessive pricing demands around new medicines so as to bring those medicines within the range of affordability.</p>  <p>  It is important to point out however that the HSE does not select the prices of patented medicines, that is determined by the pharmaceutical industry.  Therefore I would urge all pharmaceutical companies to submit pricing proposals which are affordable and sustainable and which represent value for money for the Irish health service, patients and the taxpayer.</p></reply>

Under the proposal Ireland has potential to use 2.7 Mt CO2 eq per annum from LULUCF in order to meet its emission reduction requirements, based on a combined contribution of net afforestation and cropland and grassland management activities.</p>  <p>  Collectively the Irish Government has agreed its approach to responding to these proposals and will take advantage of the opportunity to raise the matter at European Parliament and at Working Group level which are ongoing at present.</p>  <p>  Our forests sequester carbon by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and then storing it in trees, other vegetation and in soils.  Farm practices such as the establishment and maintenance of landscape features which can assist with achieving carbon sequestration benefits are supported through our Rural Development Programme. We are also engaging in research focussed on the carbon sequestration potential of agricultural soils.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that Ireland is one of a small number of EU countries to have elected to report on cropland and grazing land management activities under the Kyoto Protocol (KP). This would allow Ireland to take advantage of any sequestration benefits that may be allowed in the future from these activities.</p></reply>

It identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the sector and provides an enabling strategy that will allow the sector to grow and prosper. Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectorial recommendations. </p>  <p>  In light of the UK vote to leave the EU, Brexit has been included as a standard item on the agenda of each meeting of the High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC) and will be fully factored into all the work of the State Agencies and the private sector in pursuing the sustainable growth ambitions of the Food Wise strategy. It is clear that driving the implementation of the Food Wise recommendations, particularly those related to market development, competitiveness and innovation, will assume even greater importance in the light of the UK decision.</p>  <p>  The recent report from the ESRI examines a WTO  scenario for post-Brexit UK-EU trade.  The report shows that Ireland will be the most severely affected EU Member State in this scenario.  This is in the main due to the high tariff rates imposed on agri-food products.  Given that up to 43% of our agri-food products were exported to the UK in 2015, their decision to leave the EU reinforces the need for Ireland to continue to diversify and seek growth opportunities into other markets in order to minimise our dependence on any one market.  Indeed this principle of market development is already a key component of Food Wise.  We have been very active in recent years in efforts to diversify markets, and in aiming to respond to consumer demands in emerging markets.</p>  <p>  In September, I led a very successful trade mission to China and Singapore, while my colleague, Minister of State Andrew Doyle led a Trade Mission to Vietnam and South Korea. I believe that these activities will prove very valuable in developing the rapidly growing Asian markets as important export destinations for the Irish agri-food sector. I also led a trade mission to Morocco and Algeria earlier this month.  These trade visits will continue to play a key role in our efforts to provide as many markets as possible for Irish agri-food products.</p></reply>

Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter transport target also being legally binding. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland has calculated that 25.3% of electricity, 6.5% of heat and 5.7% of transport energy requirements were met from renewable sources at end 2015. The SEAI analysis also shows that 9.1% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall energy requirements in 2015 were met from renewable sources.</p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">The Government has a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy and although good progress towards the target has been made to date, meeting the 16% target remains challenging. My Department is currently developing a proposed new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) and a new Renewable Heat Incentive Scheme. The introduction of any new scheme - including the overall costs and technologies to be supported - will be subject to Government approval and State aid clearance from the European Commission. </font></p><p>In the transport sector, Ireland aims to meet its renewable target mainly through the increased use of sustainable biofuels, with electric vehicles also making a small contribution.  Further increases to the obligation rate in the Biofuels Obligation Scheme will take effect from 1 January 2017 when the biofuels obligation rate will increase to 8% by volume. Concerning the post 2020 period,  on Wednesday of this week the European Commission published a proposal for a new Renewables Directive that envisages a binding European Union target of at least 27% in 2030. Over the coming period, the details of this proposal will be scrutinised by my Department.</p><p>As regards 2030 targets for the non-ETS sector, the specific details of the contribution to be made by each Member State in respect of this sector were the subject of a European Commission proposal published on 20 July 2016. The full implications of this proposal from a domestic perspective are currently being examined.</p></reply>

In addition, a number of other schemes targeted at removing bottlenecks and upgrading port access, will commence subject to necessary consents. It was not possible to include the M20 in the Capital Plan as the scale of investment to deliver it was not affordable.  </p>  <p>  While I have agreed that TII can proceed with some early activities related to restarting planning for the proposed M20 scheme, additional funding would need to be made available to my Department if the project is to be progressed.  It is, therefore, premature to consider whether the project, if it were to go ahead, could be procured by way of a Public Private Partnership (PPP).  In this context I would note that in the case of road PPPs significant State investment is required up front.   It is also the case that, as part of the Capital Plan, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform introduced an Investment Policy Framework for PPPs which limits expenditure on PPPs to a percentage of annual capital spending.</p></reply>

These responses include market diversification, cost reduction, value-addition, innovation and price repositioning.  My Department and Agencies are putting in place measures to address these issues for client companies.</p>  <p>  In terms of the Government response to Brexit, my Department, together with the Department of Finance, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and Enterprise Ireland (EI), is working on the issue of short term support for vulnerable but viable companies impacted by the Brexit referendum.</p>  <p>  One of my clear objectives is to pursue and design a tailored, targeted evidence based response to industry&rsquo;s real needs.  In this respect, I initiated a structured dialogue with industry via focus groups in order to tailor a survey of needs and, on conclusion of that process, I will, if appropriate, bring forward proposals to address the ongoing concerns of Irish firms.  Focus groups have met within the past week in Dublin, Cork, Athlone and Monaghan, and arrangements are being put in place to rapidly conduct a follow up survey.</p>  <p>  At this point, and in view of the steps outlined above, it is too early to say whether the low cost credit initiative aimed at the agricultural sector and recently introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Mr Michael Creed, T.D., can be replicated for the wider SME community.  As mentioned above I will await the outcome of the evidence gathering process before determining the next steps.</p>  <p>  From the strategic perspective, Enterprise Ireland continues to assist companies to maintain and grow UK exports and extend their international reach, as well as to help companies to enhance their competitiveness, and diversify into new markets.  In addition, the Local Enterprise Offices and Inter-Trade Ireland are working closely with those clients likely to be impacted by Brexit to ensure that negative impacts are minimised and managed across all business sectors.</p></reply>

Using quantitative indicators on a range of business regulations that can be compared across 190 economies and over time, Doing Business goes beyond identifying that a problem exists and points to specific regulations or regulatory procedures that may lend themselves to reform.</p>  <p>  In the 2017 report, Ireland&rsquo;s was ranked 18th &ndash; down 3 places, compared with our revised 2016 ranking.  While this is disappointing, Ireland is ranked 8th amongst EU member states and 5th in the euro area.  Doing Business also highlights many of Ireland&rsquo;s strengths &ndash; for example, we are ranked 5th for &ldquo;paying taxes&rdquo; and 10th for &ldquo;starting a business&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in terms of the Distance to Frontier benchmark - which measures Ireland&rsquo;s score against the benchmark set by the best performing economy across ten different category headings &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s performance has actually improved slightly since 2016.  Of course, other countries are also striving to improve their business environments, hence the improvement in our score but drop in our ranking.</p>  <p>  This serves to remind us that competitiveness is a relative measure.  The process of reform and improvement must be continuous.</p>  <p>  I would also note that Ireland is a strong performer in other international competitiveness rankings &ndash; this year, for instance, we are ranked 7th out of 61 countries in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook - an improvement from 16th in last year&rsquo;s report.</p>  <p>  In July of this year, the National Competitiveness Council published its annual Competitiveness Scorecard benchmarking report which provides an in-depth assessment of all aspects of Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness performance.  The Council found that while Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness has improved in recent years &ndash; and has been central to recent strong economic growth, a number of threats persist, not least of which is Brexit.</p>  <p>  The analysis contained in the Scorecard report is informing the development of the Council&rsquo;s annual policy report Ireland&rsquo;s Competitiveness Challenge 2016 which I will shortly be bringing to Government for consideration and which will contain a range of actions to enhance competitiveness.</p>  <p>  My officials will continue to monitor publications such as the World Bank Doing Business report.  Further actions and reforms - driven by the 2017 Action Plan for Jobs which is currently being prepared - will enable us to further narrow the gap with the world&rsquo;s most competitive countries and improve the ease of doing business, ultimately helping us to achieve our objective of sustainable full employment.</p></reply>

The final arrangements between the UK and EU may not reflect this scenario.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the precise implications of the UK referendum result will depend on the position of the UK and the results of the negotiations ahead, involving the UK and our EU partners.</p>  <p>  However, this research will be of interest not just to Ireland but to all member states in the EU.  It clearly demonstrates why membership of the EU's Single Market with common rules and standards and zero tariffs is so important and beneficial for EU trade and for Ireland.</p>  <p>  Trade constitutes an increasingly important means of creating more and better jobs and trade opportunities stimulate growth, create employment, and grow economies.</p>  <p>  Ireland will be ready to meet the challenge of Brexit.  Our planning ahead of the negotiations &ndash; both for the risks and opportunities for Ireland &ndash; is currently intensifying at both political and official level.  We are already working closely with the EU Commission and our EU partners to ensure that we have a shared understanding of the implications and effects of the UK's departure from the EU.</p>  <p>  As part of our ongoing Brexit preparations, further research being undertaken by Government will look at the sectorial and firm level impacts of Brexit on our complex trade and investment infrastructure.</p>  <p>  We will continue to support the EU in creating open markets and we will ensure that our interests are to the fore in future negotiations with the UK.  Ireland will continue to make the most effective use of the framework of bilateral trade agreements and multi-sectoral trade agreements that the EU already has in place under the World Trade Organisation, and to support the opening of new markets by the EU.  An important example of this is the recently signed Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement between the EU and Canada.</p>  <p>  Enterprise 2025, Ireland&rsquo;s National Enterprise Policy, sets out our vision for Ireland to be the best place to succeed in business, delivering sustainable employment and higher standards of living for all.  Enterprise 2025 highlighted the importance of sustaining the progress made on diversifying to non-UK markets and we will continue to support enterprises in that regard.  We will continue to implement Enterprise 2025 through the Annual Action Plan for Jobs.  Our jobs target remains 200,000 new jobs to be created by 2020, with 135,000 of these outside of Dublin.  We will work across government to progress any additional specific measures necessary to sustaining and growing jobs in the 2017 Action Plan for Jobs which is currently being developed.</p></reply>
