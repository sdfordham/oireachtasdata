It will remain a major priority during the period of Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency.  We will continue to be fully supportive of the High Representative in her work on this issue and will use our influence to advance the efforts being made by the European Union to bring about a political resolution of the conflict working closely with the relevant official structures.</p><p>  The immediate priority is to achieve an end to the violence and the initiation of some form of political process.   Ireland and the EU fully back the efforts of the UN/Arab League Joint Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi.  We were very pleased to facilitate a meeting between Mr. Brahimi, Hillary Clinton and Sergei Lavrov at the OSCE Summit in Dublin last month.  This has led to further tripartite meetings between the UN, US and Russia in the search for a political solution.  Such a solution is likely to draw extensively from the Geneva Communiqu&eacute; of last June which foresaw the establishment of a transitional Government responsible for mapping out a path towards political transition.</p><p>  I have also repeatedly made clear that there must be accountability for what has transpired in Syria and that those guilty of committing war crimes must know that they will ultimately face justice. That is why Ireland has been fully supportive of the efforts to have the situation in Syria referred by the UN Security Council to the International Criminal Court.  We have taken a leading role within the EU in arguing for such referral.  I am pleased to note that virtually all EU member States are signatories of the letter which the Swiss Mission to the UN forwarded to the President of UN Security Council earlier this week and which called for referral to the ICC and reminded all sides in Syria of the obligation to fully respect international law.  I was also pleased in recent days to join with Ministerial colleagues from Austria, Denmark and Slovenia in issuing a strong public statement in support of referral to the ICC.     </p><p>  We also need to encourage the political opposition in Syria, now led by the Syrian National Coalition, to work actively with Special Representative Brahimi in search of a ceasefire and a political breakthrough.  This was much one of the principal messages delivered by the Foreign Affairs Council when it discussed Syria last month.  I was pleased to meet the President of the National Coalition, Dr Al Khatib, on that occasion.  Dr. Al-Khatib also met with the Minister of State for Trade and Development, Joe Costello TD, on the margins of the Friends of Syria meeting  in Morocco last month.  I have now formally invited President Al Khatib and his officials to come to Dublin to discuss the Coalition&rsquo;s plans for a post-Assad, democratic Syria.</p><p>  Ireland and the EU will also remain actively engaged in addressing the seriously deteriorating humanitarian situation arising from the crisis.   Some 2 million Syrians have been internally displaced, a further 2 million are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance and more than 600,000 refugees have fled the violence to neighbouring countries.  Ireland has contributed a total of &euro;2,450,000 in emergency assistance to date in response while total assistance from the EU so far stands at &euro;321 million.  The UN has now convened a high-level donor pledging conference for Syria in Kuwait on 30 January at which Ireland will be represented by Minister of State Costello.</p></reply>

It also fully supports the sanctions imposed on Iran with a view to securing diplomatic engagement.  Progressive sanctions have been reluctantly imposed by the EU, particularly in the last two years, after many years in which Iran simply refused to negotiate on this issue.  During 2012, sanctions were extended to include oil and gas imports and increased restrictions on financial transactions and investment.  We believe that these sanctions have been successful in bringing Iran to the negotiating table.   However, the Iranians have as yet shown no evidence that they are ready to engage seriously with this process.</p><p>  President Obama has recently signed into law a further tightening of US sanctions which was approved by Congress at the end of last year.   This may lead to renewed pressure within the EU for a further tightening of bilateral EU sanctions against Iran.  However, it will be difficult to go much further in this direction without reaching what amounts to a de facto trade embargo on Iran.  Any further proposals for EU sanctions would have to be considered carefully by all member States, and in the context of Iran&rsquo;s engagement with the ongoing negotiations. </p><p>  It is important to recall that the sole purpose of the sanctions is to help bring about a peaceful diplomatic resolution to the nuclear issue and so to avoid the resort to military force by any power.  Our view is that military action, which would have a devastating impact on the Iranian people as well as on the wider region, should be avoided at all costs.  </p><p>  It is also important to note that, in order to minimise the impact of sanctions on civilians, no sanctions exist at present on food, medicine or most normal commercial goods.  The recent economic turmoil in Iran, including severe depreciation of the Rial, has been generally linked to the effects of serious economic mismanagement over many years, including the diversion of massive resources to secret nuclear activities.  Pressure from sanctions may have brought forward some of these reactions but cannot be said to have directly caused them. </p><p>  Ireland will continue to work at EU level to prevent any move towards a general economic embargo of Iran.   We will also lend full support to High Representative Ashton and the dual track approach which is being pursued by the E3 + 3 on the Iranian nuclear issue.</p></reply>

A Special Event will be held at the United Nations in September to review progress on the MDGs and to begin consideration of the post-2015 development framework. A key priority for Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency will be to ensure that the EU, which collectively provides over 55% of all assistance to developing countries, adopts a strong, coherent position for this UN event and takes a lead in discussions on the future of development policy and practice.</p><p>  As Presidency, we will also work to forge stronger links in EU policy between humanitarian relief and development aid, drawing on the experience of humanitarian emergencies in recent years.  On the basis of the response to the emergency in the Horn of Africa in 2011, we plan to focus consideration on the EU&rsquo;s approach to disaster risk reduction, helping communities to prepare for and take action to avert the effects of disasters and emergencies.  </p><p>  We look forward to hosting an informal meeting of EU Development Ministers in Dublin on 11/12 February.  This will represent the first opportunity for a substantive policy discussion by Ministers of these key development issues, in preparation for Council Conclusions for consideration by the development segment of the Foreign Affairs Council, which will be held in Brussels on 28 May.</p><p>  Throughout the Presidency, I look forward to highlighting the priority which Ireland attaches to the fight against global hunger and undernutrition.  A key theme of our work nationally and as Presidency for the next six months will be to examine and build a stronger understanding of the linkages between hunger, nutrition and the impact of climate change on the poorest countries in the world.  This will be the theme of the high-level international conference to be held in Dublin in April 2013, which will bring together international policy makers and representatives of communities across the developing world.</p></reply>

The success of the European project can be in no doubt today in that regard.   However, the considerable challenges that Ireland and the EU face today are very different to those of sixty years ago.  Our values remain the same.  But the challenge of delivering to our citizens increases as our economic and social challenges grow. </p><p>   The Irish Presidency programme published last week identifies three main priorities: Stability, Jobs and Growth.  During the European Year of Citizens there is no greater result that we could deliver for our people than ensuring that our Presidency leads to renewed and sustainable economic growth and job creation, built on strong and secure foundations.  The best hope for prosperity, securing stability across the EU, is in creating an environment for job creation. Nowhere is this more important than in addressing youth unemployment, which is now reaching unsustainable dimensions. </p><p>  The Presidency will focus intensively on pushing ahead with the introduction of a Youth Employment Package, which includes a &ldquo;Youth Guarantee&rdquo;, a consultation on &ldquo;Quality Framework for Traineeships&rdquo; and a proposal for a &ldquo;European Alliance for Apprenticeships&rdquo;. We cannot afford to have a lost generation of young unemployed Europeans. We will not be found wanting as a Presidency in addressing this challenge. </p><p>  I have been greatly encouraged in my recent consultations with our partners by the extent to which the Irish Presidency&rsquo;s objectives are widely shared and supported.  The Presidents of the European Council and the European Commission whom we met in Dublin last week also expressed their strong support for Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency priorities, and we also have received broad support from the European Parliament, where the Taoiseach is presenting Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency programme this morning.  The history of European integration has demonstrated that the EU is at its most effective when Member States act together.  The Single Market is proof of this, and as Presidency, Ireland will seek to respond to the challenges that face all Member States with common actions and solutions.  In today&rsquo;s globalised market with strong links between economies, such coordinated responses are more critical than ever.  This is why the Government is attaching strong importance to reaching agreement on outstanding Single Market Act measures, to creating new opportunities for EU business, especially for SMEs, and supporting President Van Rompuy in securing agreement on the EU&rsquo;s future financing to mobilise investment in areas including agriculture and cohesion funding.</p><p>  The Irish Presidency programme published last week sets out in greater detail our priorities and also how we plan to deliver results for Europe&rsquo;s citizens.</p><p>  Future economic recovery and job creation depend on creating a stable economic environment.  This is why we will work to advance the Banking Union proposals and specifically to win agreement on a Single Supervisory Mechanism.  Effective implementation of the EU&rsquo;s economic governance measures will also promote stability and confidence for business, consumers and investors, fuelling economic recovery and job creation.</p><p>  As Presidency, Ireland will also seek to create new markets for EU exporters by making progress on trade agreements with key partners.  Expanding opportunities for EU products and services abroad will be vital to our future economic growth in Ireland and Europe. </p><p>  Europe&rsquo;s priorities are also key national priorities for Ireland in terms of resolving bank debt, stabilising the Euro, and anchoring economic recovery. Never has our agenda in Ireland been so aligned with the priorities of the Union.  As Presidency, the Government looks forward to meeting the challenges ahead and to delivering strong and tangible results for citizens in Ireland and across the Union.</p></reply>

All expenditure is now grouped under Departmental programmes which combine administrative and direct expenditure attributable to each area of activity.  The Estimates for 2013 published on 5 December last in respect of my Department show an overall reduction of some &euro;4.1 million for Vote 28 (Foreign Affairs and Trade) compared with the allocation for 2012.</p><p>  In preparing the budget, every effort was made to protect direct expenditure in areas such as Promoting Ireland&rsquo;s Economic and Trade Interests in Europe and Internationally; Consular, Passport and Irish Abroad Services and Reconciliation and Cooperation on This Island. </p><p>  The particular adjustments raised in the Deputies&rsquo; questions are the result of an updated estimate of the administrative costs attributable to each programme. The direct programme expenditure allocations remain unchanged. Changes in administrative spending allocations also take account of the additional provisions made for the exceptional once-off costs associated with the EU Presidency.</p><p>  The Revised Estimates Volume, which will be published in a few weeks, will provide more detailed information on all expenditure.That volume will take account of the 2012 out-turn and will also include a number of adjustments, often technical, that are made as part of the budgetary process.</p></reply>

I have condemned these events unreservedly. </p><p>  I have remained in contact with the Secretary of State Theresa Villiers and with the party leaders in Northern Ireland throughout.  Over the past week I have spoken with Peter Robinson, Martin McGuinness, David Ford, Mike Nesbitt and Alasdair McDonnell.  I will be travelling to Belfast tomorrow morning to meet with the Secretary of State, and the First Minister and Deputy First Minister. Officials from my Department continue to work closely with the British Government and with political representatives in Northern Ireland to identify ways to address not just the current crisis but its underlying causes. </p><p>  Security cooperation between the Gardai and the PSNI is at its most effective level ever. The PSNI are on the front line dealing with the violence of recent weeks &ndash; 99 police officers have been injured to date &ndash; and I want to reiterate my steadfast support for them in dealing with these most difficult circumstances.</p><p>  I also wish to take this opportunity to put on record the Government&rsquo;s abhorrence at the attempts on the lives of police officers. </p><p>  The vast majority of people in Northern Ireland want to see an end to street violence. The rioters are in effect wrecking their own communities. This year has the potential to be a great year for tourism to Northern Ireland. That potential must not be jeopardised by the recent terrible images from Belfast that have been beamed around the world by international media. </p><p>  The economic cost of recent events is becoming apparent. Apart from the cost of the policing operation &ndash; estimated at &pound;7 million &ndash; foreign direct investment, the retail trade and tourism are all at risk. The Confederation of British Industry Director in Northern Ireland has warned of the economic damage being inflicted on local businesses, tourism and investment. </p><p>  It is my hope that out of this setback, we will see a redoubling of efforts to achieve a genuinely reconciled society in Northern Ireland. It is a reminder to all that the peace process is exactly that &ndash; a process which still has some way to go. Political cooperation and security cooperation on this island has never been better and we can rely on these relationships of trust and on the resilience of the Good Friday Agreement to create space for progress beyond the current difficulties.</p></reply>

It is strongly focused on the poorest countries and communities in sub-Saharan Africa, prioritising investments in the areas of education, health, good governance, food security and nutrition. The programme is central to our foreign policy, has an enviable international reputation, and consistently enjoys strong political and public support.</p><p>  This Government is strongly committed to Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme. Our programme for Government contains a very clear commitment to the aid programme and the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) for Official Development Assistance (ODA). However, as I have stated on many occasions in the past, credible progress towards achieving the UN target can only be made through restoring sustainable growth in the economy. This is our absolute priority and we are making solid progress on this front.     </p><p>  Last year, the Government provided &euro;639 million to ODA.  For 2013 we have allocated an estimated &euro;623 million - a modest reduction on the 2012 level. Stabilising the ODA budget has been an important and significant achievement for this Government, particularly in light of the extraordinarily difficult economic conditions facing the country.  </p><p>  &euro;623 million remains a very significant allocation of public funds and is a clear indication of our commitment to the aid programme. It represents a genuine investment on behalf of the Irish people to assist those less fortunate than ourselves. The Government is ambitious for the aid programme and is determined to ensure the significant resources allocated continue to maximise results and deliver real and sustainable improvements in the lives of the world poorest people.</p></reply>

Ireland has always made it abundantly clear that we have no tolerance for fraud or any other form of financial irregularity in relation to our development programme. I immediately suspended &euro;16 million of Irish development assistance which was due to be channelled through the Government of Uganda systems in 2012 and I initiated an investigation into the misappropriation of funds by the Ugandan Office of the Prime Minister which was undertaken by a team from the Evaluation and Audit Unit of my Department. Their report has been made public and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p><p>  The Deputies will be aware that the Government of Uganda has accepted full responsibility for the misappropriation of Irish development funds and full restitution of the funds has now taken place. I welcome this action which was brought about after intensive dialogue with the Ugandan Government at a high level and is a sign of the strong partnership which has been built with Uganda over many years. This partnership enables very strong and frank dialogue on a wide range of issues including development, human rights and corruption.</p><p>  The initial report of the Special Investigation by the Auditor General of Uganda into the misappropriation of &euro;4 million of Irish Aid, and other donor funds intended for financing of the Peace and Recovery Development Plan (PRDP) was published in October 2012. The Auditor General will now carry out further detailed follow up assessments and audits in relation to the PRDP, the Office of the Prime Minister, the Treasury Department and on the Government&rsquo;s Financial Management System. Current expectations are that this work will be completed by mid 2013. My Department will support the Auditor General in this important work.</p><p>  I am committed to ensuring that we learn from what has occurred in Uganda to further strengthen our systems of risk identification and management as well as monitoring and audit to minimise the potential for the misuse of funds in the future. I fully accept the recommendations set out in the Report of the Evaluation and Audit team and have directed that they should be implemented.</p><p>  The Director General of Irish Aid, together with other officials, will travel to Uganda shortly to review proposals and appropriate management arrangements for a future programme. Any such programme will build on the previous valuable contribution made by Ireland towards improving the lives of some of the most vulnerable people in the world, but must provide assurance and strong accountability to the Irish taxpayer. The Evaluation and Audit Unit of my Department will also continue to follow up on the important work they have already undertaken in Uganda, with the next audit visit by this Unit to take place in the coming weeks. </p><p>  Following the exposure of the misappropriation of funds in Uganda, Ambassadors in overseas missions that manage Irish Aid bilateral programmes were asked to undertake a full review of their management and risk assessment systems to ensure that any weaknesses are dealt with. This review has been completed and the Secretary General of my Department will meet with all of the Heads of Mission in February to underline the importance of managing risk around Irish development funding.</p></reply>

This will be deployed under the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy. </p><p>  The crisis in Mali has been high on the EU&rsquo;s agenda since the attempted coup in March 2012 and the de facto secession of much of the north of the country.  At our meeting in December, EU Foreign Ministers issued a strong statement which reaffirmed the EU&rsquo;s commitment to playing a constructive role in support of stabilisation efforts and which increased the pressure on the Malian parties to adopt and implement a &ldquo;roadmap&rdquo; for a transition to democratic elections.  </p><p>  The training mission, called &ldquo;EUTM Mali&rdquo;, is being established in response to a number of recent United Nations Security Council Resolutions which call upon Member States, regional and international organizations to provide assistance, training and capacity-building support to the Malian security forces so as to help them to restore the authority of the State.  The most recent of these, UNSCR 2085, takes note of the planned deployment of a military mission by the EU with these objectives in mind.</p><p>  EUTM Mali will provide military training and advice to the Malian Armed Forces to improve their military capacity and their effectiveness in working towards the restoration of the country's territorial integrity. Training will also be provided in international humanitarian law, the protection of civilians and human rights.  The mission, which will be based in the south of Mali, will not engage in combat operations.  It will be conducted at the invitation of the Malian Government and in close coordination with the UN, the African Union, ECOWAS and other key partners. An EU Council decision on deployment of the mission is expected to be taken this month. </p><p>  No decision has yet been made with regard to the question of Irish participation in EUTM Mali. Any participation by the Defence Forces would require the approval of Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann as appropriate.</p></reply>

The relatively speedy restoration of the ceasefire was due to the active intervention of the Egyptian Government in particular, with the support of others such as Turkey and Qatar, and the recognition by both parties that a further escalation would be both inevitable and damaging if the conflict continued.  </p><p>  I issued statements on behalf of the Government on 15 and 18 November.  I discussed the situation in Gaza with my EU colleagues at the Foreign Affairs Council on 19 November, and the Council adopted Conclusions on the issue.   My concerns were also conveyed directly to the Israeli authorities, through the Ambassador in Tel Aviv and the Israeli Ambassador in Dublin. I have reported previously to the House in more detail on these matters.</p><p>  The ceasefire established on 21 November has so far held very well, despite some incidents.  As I said in November, however, so long as the underlying problems of Gaza are not adequately addressed, any ceasefire will ultimately break down again. I therefore laid particular stress on the provisions in the ceasefire for further contacts between the parties, again through the mediation of Egypt, with a view to the reaching of longer-term agreements.  The essence of these would be that the current blockade of Gaza would be significantly relaxed, allowing a return to more normal life and commercial activity while securing a more durable and lasting cessation of rocket attacks into Israel.</p><p>  I am encouraged by some small but important steps which have been taken by Israel, in the context of these discussions, to relax some of the restrictions on Gaza.  The three-mile fishing limit previously enforced has been doubled to six miles;  some commercial supplying of construction aggregates has begun;  and, perhaps most importantly, the restrictions on farmers accessing their land approaching the border fence have been significantly relaxed, with a reduction in the width of the buffer zone from 500 metres to 100 metres.  Indications so far are that these relaxations are being largely followed through in practice.</p><p>  These measures are comparatively small, and much more needs to be done.   But they are a welcome beginning.  It is important that they progress and that the contacts between the two sides continue, leading to better understanding.  It is also essential that the ceasefire remains intact and that for instance militant groups do not use the greater access to farmland to mount attacks on the border fence and the soldiers manning it, as has been done in the past. </p><p>  I have long argued at EU level and directly with the Israeli authorities, as did my predecessor Deputy Martin, that the blockade of Gaza as it has operated has been counterproductive. The collapse of Gaza&rsquo;s economy, and displacement of traffic to smuggling tunnels, has only strengthened the control and the finances of the militants while increasing the latter&rsquo;s appeal for unemployed youth.  I will continue to urge the relaxation and ultimate ending of the blockade, while accepting that the prevention of weapons entering Gaza remains an essential objective.</p><p>  Measures to address the situation on the ground in Gaza and to ease the blockade should ultimately  include working for full implementation of the 2005 Agreement on Movement and Access, as repeatedly called for by the EU and also by the UN Security Council in Resolution 1860. This should include full access by fishermen to the waters envisaged under Oslo, although bearing in mind that the security situation is significantly altered from the position when the Oslo Accords were agreed and that Gaza is not currently controlled by the Palestinian Authority which was set up under those Accords.</p></reply>

The untying of aid has been shown to improve the effectiveness of programmes aimed at reducing poverty and of better aligning donor assistance with the needs of beneficiary countries.</p><p>  Ireland is one of a minority of donor countries whose aid is 100% untied. This is one of the principal reasons that Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme is internationally recognised as being of the highest quality.</p><p>  The Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation, agreed in Busan, South Korea in 2011, set the international standard on the principles of effective aid and good development practice.

We have repeatedly called for universality of the Treaty in national as well as EU statements, and also through our participation in the New Agenda Coalition.  Ireland has also played an active role in promoting a Middle East free of all Weapons of Mass Destruction &ndash; nuclear, chemical and biological.  We would see this as a priority objective, not just in terms of promoting longer term peace and stability in the region, but also in terms of protecting the NPT, with which Ireland is closely associated.  The NPT is acknowledged as a cornerstone of the international non-proliferation regime and the essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament.  In 1995, the Treaty was extended indefinitely in a package of agreements that also included a Resolution on the Middle East which envisages a zone free of Weapons of Mass Destruction in the region.  It is important for the Treaty that the Middle East resolution is fully implemented.</p><p>  At the 2010 NPT Review Conference Ireland brokered agreement on some practical next steps towards a Middle East zone free of Weapons of Mass Destruction, including a Conference to be attended by all States of the region.  This agreement represented the first real progress towards implementing the 1995 Resolution in the fifteen years since it had been agreed, and Ireland&rsquo;s role in this has been acknowledged.</p><p>  Israel has never officially declared itself to possess nuclear weapons and maintains a policy of opacity about its nuclear capabilities.  It remains one of just three states not party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Deputy can be assured that Ireland will continue to call on it and the two other states not party to accede to the Treaty as non-nuclear weapons states without delay and to conclude a full scope safeguards agreement with the IAEA.  The Deputy can also be assured that universal adherence to, and full implementation of, the NPT will remain key foreign policy objectives for the Government as we approach the next NPT Review Conference in 2015.</p></reply>

These are Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia in sub-Saharan Africa, and Timor Leste and Vietnam in Asia. Timor Leste has now ceased to be a Programme Country. In these countries we aim to build government and institutional capacities to deliver the essential services that their populations need &ndash; mainly in the areas of health, education and food security. We also work in areas such as governance, gender equality, the environment and HIV and Aids, building systems of accountability that will ensure lasting development results.</p><p>For 2013 the Government has allocated &euro;623 million to Ireland&rsquo;s programme for Official Development Assistance (ODA). &euro;498 million will be managed under Vote 27 International Cooperation through the Development Cooperation Division of my Department &ndash; known to the public as Irish Aid. We are currently in the process of finalising the 2013 detailed budget allocations across the aid programme and anticipate that we will allocate approximately one third of the total Irish Aid 2013 budget directly to Programme Countries.</p><p>Table 1 below provides details of the final budget allocations to Programme Countries for 2011 and 2012 together with the percentage year on year change. The final allocation to Programme Countries for 2012 was reduced as a result of the decision by the T&aacute;naiste to suspend all funding through Government system in Uganda following the discovery of significant misappropriation of Irish Aid, and other donor, funding within the Prime Minister's Office. We are currently assessing the various options for future programme engagement in Uganda following the full restitution of the funds by the Government of Uganda.</p><p><b>Table 1</b></p><p><b>Programme Country Allocations </b></p><p><b>Figures in &euro; 000&rsquo;s</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Programme Country </th><th>Budget Allocation 2012</th><th>Budget Allocation 2011</th><th>% Change</th></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Ethiopia </td><td>25,770</td><td>25,990</td><td>-1%</td></tr><tr><td>Lesotho </td><td>7,440</td><td>10,440</td><td>-29%</td></tr><tr><td>Zambia </td><td>14,580</td><td>16,415</td><td>-11%</td></tr><tr><td>Malawi</td><td>12,500</td><td>11,455</td><td>9%</td></tr><tr><td>Mozambique </td><td>37,000</td><td>37,000</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Tanzania </td><td>29,728</td><td>30,700</td><td>-3%</td></tr><tr><td>Timor Leste </td><td>3,510</td><td>2,720</td><td>29%</td></tr><tr><td>Uganda </td><td>16,000</td><td>32,750</td><td>-51%</td></tr><tr><td>Vietnam</td><td>12,000</td><td>12,000</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Total Programme Countries </td><td>158,528</td><td>179,470</td><td>-12%</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Minister also met with my colleague the Minister of State for European Affairs, Lucinda Creighton T.D.  While there was no set agenda for my meeting with Minister Bağis, our discussion centred on the prospects for reinvigorating Turkey&rsquo;s stalled EU accession process. This was also the main item of discussion for Minister Bağis and Minister of State Creighton.</p><p>  EU enlargement is a priority for the Irish Presidency. We see it as a vital tool for promoting reform, democracy and stability in Europe. During our Presidency Ireland will work to facilitate and advance the process for Turkey, as we will for all other candidates and prospective candidates.</p><p>  In that regard I welcome the December 2012 European Council Conclusions on Turkey, which are constructive and balanced, and which recognise that it is in the interests of both parties that accession negotiations regain momentum soon. The Conclusions call upon Turkey to further build on its progress to date on reforms, including in the area of fundamental rights and the rule of law, and to commit itself to good neighbourly relations and to the peaceful settlement of disputes.</p><p>  Both Minister of State Creighton and I conveyed to Minister Bağis that Ireland would hope to be in a position to open a negotiation Chapter with Turkey during our Presidency. However we also conveyed to him that whether concrete progress proves possible will depend on the willingness of all parties, both the EU Member States and Turkey, to facilitate this through working together in a positive and constructive atmosphere, and, on the part of Turkey, through implementing the necessary reforms.</p><p>  We also touched upon some recent developments, notably in respect of Syria and the Kurdish issue, human rights as well as on bilateral relations.</p></reply>

Prior to the recent hostilities, Gaza was experiencing a serious humanitarian crisis due to the economic blockade and the effective isolation of the territory from the outside world. As a result, people in Gaza face high unemployment, and their situation in terms of food security, health and water/sanitation remains extremely difficult. It is estimated that around 80 per cent of Gaza households are dependent on food aid and more than 300,000 refugees in Gaza live below the abject poverty line and are unable to meet their basic food needs.</p><p>  Ireland has responded to the current crisis by providing additional funding of &euro;2.14 million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) to support their Gaza Emergency Appeal. UNRWA, the UN agency charged with responsibility for the welfare of all Palestinian refugees, helps to provide basic education, health, relief and social services for some 5 million registered Palestinian refugees. The importance of the Gaza Appeal, particularly in providing food aid for vulnerable refugee families was highlighted by UNRWA&rsquo;s Commissioner General during his visit to Ireland last October.</p><p>  This funding support is in addition to Irish Aid&rsquo;s broader programme of assistance to the Palestinian people and brings our total funding support in 2012 to &euro;11.47 million. This includes support to UNRWA&rsquo;s general fund, the Palestinian Authority and civil society organisations.</p><p>  Ireland's response underlies our continuing commitment to meeting the emergency needs of the Palestinian people as we have done for many years.</p></reply>

The sanctioned additional staff are now in situ and have been assigned as appropriate, either to front line Presidency-related activities or to back-fill positions vacated by experienced officers redeployed to Presidency roles.</p><p>  At headquarters, nine staff have been redeployed to my Department from other Government Departments and Offices, to which they are scheduled to return in summer 2013.  Ten administrative and 11 clerical staff have also been engaged on fixed-term contracts through the Public Appointments Service and 9 Interns have been recruited on the same basis directly by the Department.  Furthermore, a small number of staff have been temporarily seconded to the Department from other EU Member States and from the EU&rsquo;s External Action Service, at no cost to the Exchequer, and one retired officer has been temporarily re-engaged until July 2013.</p><p>  As regards Missions abroad, the majority of Presidency-related posts have been assigned to the Permanent Representation of Ireland to the European Union in Brussels, with smaller numbers allocated to other Missions including the Permanent Missions to the UN in New York and Geneva and that to the OSCE in Vienna.  The Presidency staffing plan for the Permanent Representation in Brussels was prepared following a carefully coordinated inter-departmental needs evaluation.  Overall, the staffing of the Permanent Representation has been temporarily increased by 80 officers in various grades, with the majority of staff assigned by other Departments and Offices at their own expense and from within their own staffing resources and some 30 administrative and clerical staff temporarily locally recruited.</p><p>  Expenditure on salaries and related costs for these additional Presidency staff amounted to &euro;1.169m in 2012.  A budget of &euro;2m has been allocated for the same salary costs for 2013. This allocation will also be used to meet overtime costs occurring in relation to Presidency events, including those taking place in Ireland.</p></reply>

While remarks such as these are clearly unhelpful and provocative, and serve merely to inflame thinking in both communities, they do not constitute official Israeli Government policy and in my view do not merit a response.

Ireland has provided annual support to Addameer since 2007, including a recent contribution of &euro;60,000 in 2012.  The organisation works to assist prisoners and their families through the provision of free legal advice and representation in Israeli military courts. Addameer also documents human rights violations and conducts regular prison visits.</p><p>  On the morning of 11 December 2012, soldiers of the Israeli Defence Forces raided the offices of three Palestinian non-governmental organisations in Ramallah:  the Union of Palestinian Women Committees, the Palestinian NGO Network and Addameer.  I understand that hardware, legal files and other material were removed from the Addameer offices during the raid.  While the hardware has already been replaced by a donation, work to replace the files and to resume normal day-to-day activities will be heavily time-consuming and costly for the organisation.</p><p>  Following the raids, the EU Delegation to the Palestinian Territory issued a strong statement expressing its concerns and that of all EU member States.  Such incursions by Israeli forces into Palestinian cities, where the Palestinian Authority under the Oslo Accords assumes the powers and responsibilities for internal security and public order, put in jeopardy the internationally recognised success of Palestinian institution-building efforts.  Ireland fully supports this statement.</p><p>  We will continue to work closely with our NGO partners in Palestine, including Addameer, to ensure that they can carry out their work safely and effectively to protect human rights in Palestine.</p></reply>

The tender was advertised through the e-tenders portal as an EU-wide procurement.  The winning tender was from Terminal4 in collaboration with iQContent, and a contract was agreed in October 2011.</p><p>  In line with the communications strategy for the Presidency, the Department decided to exercise the option for a Presidency website and Terminal4 were asked to submit proposals.  After further negotiations, a programme of work was agreed and a supplementary contract was signed in December 2011.  In planning the Presidency it was agreed that responsibility for the website development project sat best with the Department of the Taoiseach, and in line with provisions in the contract, the project was formally assigned to that Department in February 2012.</p><p>  The website is available both for desktops and in a mobile form, and in four languages (English, Irish, French and German).  It is the portal for all media and official accreditation, streams major events live, and is also used to showcase Ireland to international audiences. It is the key communications tool for the Irish Presidency of the EU.</p><p>  With over 2,500 pages on the site, eu2013.ie is the primary source of information for all of the high-level meetings held in Ireland and Brussels and for breaking news during our Presidency.   It was launched on 17 December 2012 and in its first four weeks it received around 80000 visits, while the associated Presidency Twitter account already had 3870 followers.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union represents an enormous opportunity for our country to take a leadership role in Europe and the Government is determined to conduct an efficient and cost-effective Presidency. The Presidency also offers a great chance both to promote Ireland (we will welcome over 15,000 official visitors to nearly 180 events over six months), and to explain the work of the EU, and of the Presidency, to a domestic audience. The website is at the heart of all these efforts.</p></reply>

Notable growth was achieved in merchandise exports to Great Britain (11%), Germany (24%) and the Netherlands (7%). Exports to Canada increased by 24% in the ten month period, albeit from a lower base. Similarly, exports to Japan and Switzerland increased by 20% and 26% respectively. Total merchandise exports to the BRICS group were up by approximately 1% for the period, due mainly to strong growth in exports to Russia (+18%) and India (+12%). Services exports to non-EU markets for the first three quarters of 2012 increased by 23% and to EU markets by 3% when compared to the same period in 2011.</p><p>  While the majority of Irish services and merchandise exports go to Europe and the US and we must continue to cultivate these markets, the Government is strongly focused on the further development of trade ties with Latin America, Africa and Asia. Eight of the 27 priority markets identified under the Government Trade Strategy are in Latin America, Africa and Asia (Brazil, South Africa, China, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Republic of Korea). For the first 10 months of 2012, total merchandise trade with each of these countries was as follows; Brazil, &euro;706 million; South Africa, &euro;355 million; China, &euro;4.3 billion; India, &euro;513 million; Japan, &euro;2.4 billion; Malaysia, &euro;391 million; Singapore, &euro;678 million and the Republic of Korea, &euro;576 million.</p><p>  Under the oversight of the Export Trade Council which I chair, we will continue in 2013 to boost bilateral trade with these countries, as well as other key markets in Latin America, Asia and Africa. In relation to Africa, my Department&rsquo;s targeted Strategy is aimed at exploring new sectors and markets in that continent that have particular potential for Irish companies and we are working closely with the state agencies and Irish companies on its ongoing implementation.</p></reply>

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains a roster of observers for election monitoring missions. We aim to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level in international observation missions for both elections and constitutional referendums. Irish observers participate primarily in missions organised by the European Union  and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  However, they have also been involved in missions organised by the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the Carter Centre.</p><p>  The electoral observation roster is now being reviewed with a view to the establishment of a new roster of individuals with the right mix of skills and experience to ensure that Ireland can consistently nominate the best qualified people for missions.  We will shortly be issuing a call for applicants.  Applications will be short-listed against published criteria and shortlisted candidates will be invited to interview. I expect that these interviews will take place by the end of April 2013.</p></reply>

The relevant actions and progress on their implementation are as follows:</p><p><b>  3.12:</b> Roll out a schedule of sector specific Trade Missions and market evaluation Missions that reflect the priority markets identified in the Trade Strategy as well as firms&#8217; interest and stage of development, aiming for at least 15 Ministerial&#8211;led Missions (<i>DJEI / DFAT / Enterprise Ireland / DTTS / Tourism Ireland).</i></p><p>  Minister Bruton and I approved an ambitious programme of 18 Ministerial led Trade Missions and other overseas events in 2012 focusing on key priority markets identified under the Government Trade Strategy. These Missions were led by Government Ministers and Ministers of State and a total of 15 countries were visited; China, U.S., Finland, Sweden, Turkey, U.K., Russia, France, Brazil, Italy, Japan, Canada, South Africa, U.A.E. and India. I visited the UK and my colleague, the Minister of State for Trade and Development, Joe Costello T.D. led Trade Missions to Turkey, Russia, Brazil, Italy and South Africa. Feedback from the Enterprise Ireland client companies who participated in all of the Trade Missions and targeted events has been extremely positive and each Mission delivered significant progress for indigenous Irish companies in the export sector. I am currently working with Minister Burton to finalise the programme of Ministerial-led Trade Missions and events for 2013.</p><p><b>  3.16</b>: Develop and implement local market plans as provided for in the Strategy for Trade, Tourism and Investment for key high&#8211;growth regions and through the Export Trade Council work to optimise the resources of embassies and agencies to deliver ambitious targets (<i>D/FAT / DJEI / DAFM / Enterprise Agencies / DTTS / Tourism Ireland</i> )</p><p>  Under the Government Trade Strategy, 27 priority markets have been identified for the integrated promotion of trade, tourism and investment. In each of these markets, Ireland&#8217;s Ambassador chairs the Local Market Team, which consists of Embassy staff and representatives of the relevant state agencies present in the market. These market teams submit detailed annual Local Market Plans outlining how they will grow trade, investment and tourism between Ireland and the market in question to the Export Trade Council (ETC), which I chair. The ETC is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Trade Strategy as a whole. I am currently reviewing the Local Market Plans from all 27 priority markets from 2013 and will be presenting them to the ETC this February.</p><p><b>4.4: </b>Work collectively to communicate Ireland&#8217;s strength as a location for starting a business, and support the development of a campaign by the Irish Diaspora to encourage entrepreneurial start&#8211;ups in Ireland (<i>DJEI / Enterprise Ireland / IDA Ireland / DFAT / Global Irish Economic Forum</i>)</p><p>  The entrepreneurial start&#8211;ups programme is currently being coordinated by The Ireland Funds, one of the largest philanthropic Irish diaspora organisations in the world, who are working closely with Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to communicate Ireland&#8217;s strength as a location for starting a business. In a wider context, my Department continues to coordinate reputation-building efforts across Government, including regularly updating key messages on Ireland&#8217;s economic recovery and using our Embassy Network overseas to promote positive economic messages.</p><p><b>5.9:</b> Utilise Global Irish Network as official advocates of new and expanded FDI investment in Ireland including introductory meetings, briefings and establishing a restricted website access portal on IDA Ireland website to provide communication and information to relevant Diaspora (<i>D/FAT / IDA Ireland</i>)</p><p>  My Department made significant progress on increasing the span and scope of the Global Irish Network during 2012; growing it to 350 senior Irish business figures located across 40 countries. In 2013, the Network will continue to provide: high level access for the Government and agencies within key sectors and markets; mentoring and assistance for Irish companies through the Global Irish Contacts Programme; support for sector specific initiatives (such as The Gathering and Connect Ireland) and for Trade Missions. Regional meetings of the Network are expected to be held in 2013 in California and London and a third Global Irish Economic Forum may take place in October.</p></reply>

Renewed growth and employment creation require strong and stable economic foundations.  This is why the Irish Presidency is attaching such strong importance to the Banking Union proposals, and in particular advancing agreement with the European Parliament on the Single Supervisory Mechanism to restore confidence and to strengthen credit flows to SMEs to get Europe&rsquo;s economy growing again.  At the December General Affairs Council, Ireland presented its roadmap for implementing the European Semester, the new system for coordinating economic and budgetary policy within the European Union.  Effective implementation of the Semester process is critical to restoring health to public finances across the Union.  Stimulating sustainable economic growth to create employment is a key priority for the Presidency.  In the run-up to the Presidency the Government reviewed work agendas across all Council formations to highlight proposals that have the potential to deliver jobs and growth. The Irish Presidency will place a particular emphasis on tackling youth unemployment which remains far too high in many Member States, including Ireland.  As Presidency, Ireland will push for a comprehensive EU approach to tackling this challenge, starting with the Youth Employment Package. In particular, we aim to achieve consensus on the principles of the Youth Guarantee.  The objective is to ensure that young people, who are not working or studying, receive an offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or traineeship.  Identifying ways of tackling youth unemployment will also be the main focus of the Informal meeting of Employment and Social Affairs Ministers which is taking place in Dublin in February.</p><p>  The Presidency has identified other areas to promote growth and jobs.  These include an emphasis on securing agreement on draft legislation to improve the operation of the Single Market.</p><p>  The Presidency will also work to secure agreement on a number of proposals and programmes aimed at supporting the next generation of research and innovation in Europe.  It will also seek to advance proposals that support the growth of the digital economy and the broader digital agenda, including areas such as cyber security, e-signatures, data protection, web accessibility and high-speed broadband rollout.  Progress in this area will deliver benefits for European consumers and business alike.</p><p>  The EU&rsquo;s external trade agenda is one area where we see significant potential for a greater contribution to growth and to jobs, particularly for Europe&rsquo;s SME sector.  90 percent of future global growth is set to be generated outside Europe.  That is why economic relations with key strategic partners, including the US, Canada, Japan and China, feature strongly in our Presidency programme.</p><p>  With the benefit of Ireland&rsquo;s close links with the US, we will work hard to agree the opening of Free Trade Agreement negotiations with the US.  Ireland will be the first country to hold an informal meeting of Trade Ministers during its Presidency which signals the priority given by Ireland to this issue.</p><p>  These are just some of the key priorities that Ireland has identified as central elements of its Presidency programme which was published last week.  The programme was discussed with the President of the European Council, the President of the European Commission and the Commission College who visited last week.  The Taoiseach formally presented the programme to the European Parliament on 16 January.  I am very encouraged by the response that the Government has received from the institutional partners and our partner states in support of the Irish Presidency&rsquo;s objectives.</p></reply>

Contributing to the search for a lasting settlement of the Middle East conflict and of the Syrian crisis are major priorities for me at present and will remain so over the coming months.  Supporting the work which the EU&rsquo;s High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy is doing on these issues, we will do everything possible to bring about an end to violence and repression and to violations of human rights and the rule of law in the region.  We will make a strong national contribution to efforts to promote the &ldquo;two-State solution&rdquo; to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and to bring into being a new, democratic Syria.  Deputies will, of course, be aware that, under the Lisbon Treaty, issues such as these which form part of the EU&rsquo;s Common Foreign and Security Policy have been placed under the coordination and direction of the High Representative and the External Action Service.  There is no longer any direct role to be played by the rotating Presidency.  We will, however, use the influence which Ireland has on these issues to support and promote the EU&rsquo;s vital efforts, working closely with our Council colleagues and with the relevant official structures.</p></reply>

In all aspects of the administrative planning, which my Department leads on, we have aimed to ensure that we are equipped to fulfil our responsibilities, meet reasonable expectations of a Presidency and do so in as cost-effective a fashion as possible.  The Book of Estimates published on 5 December included an allocation of approx &euro;36m for Presidency costs in 2013 for all Departments. The allocation for my Department amounts to &euro;9.5m. In addition to covering costs for our own Presidency staff and programme of events it includes funding for a number of goods and services which we are managing on behalf of Departments including high-level interpretation, VIP transport and catering at state-owned venues. This centralised approach is being taken to achieve better value for money by using the combined purchasing power of all Departments/Offices.</p><p>  A number of cost-saving measures have been introduced. This includes the use of Dublin Castle and other State venues for the vast majority of meetings that will be hosted by Ireland during the Presidency. At the Permanent Representation in Brussels, all additional staff are being accommodated in the existing office premises thus saving the additional rental cost that separate office accommodation would entail.</p><p>  In addition the volume of goods and services supplied to the Presidency has been critically reviewed and restrictions are in place in relation to matters such as local transport.  Where possible, procurement has been aggregated in order to benefit from greater buying power.</p><p>  In addition, my Department is overseeing offers of sponsorship in respect of some core services and also in some sectoral areas.  The total estimated value of this sponsorship is &euro;1.4 million.</p></reply>

We have seen attacks on the Police Service of Northern Ireland including the attempted murder of police officers and widespread attempts to intimidate public representatives and their families.  I have condemned these events unreservedly.  I have remained in contact with the Secretary of State Theresa Villiers and with the party leaders in Northern Ireland throughout.  Over the past week I have spoken with Peter Robinson, Martin McGuinness, David Ford, Mike Nesbitt and Alasdair McDonnell.  I will be travelling to Belfast tomorrow morning to meet with the Secretary of State, and the First Minister and Deputy First Minister. Officials from my Department continue to work closely with the British Government and with political representatives in Northern Ireland to identify ways to address not just the current crisis but its underlying causes.</p><p>  Security cooperation between the Garda&iacute; and the PSNI is at its most effective level ever. The PSNI are on the front line dealing with the violence of recent weeks &ndash; 99 police officers have been injured to date &ndash; and I want to reiterate my steadfast support for them in dealing with these most difficult circumstances.</p><p>  I also wish to take this opportunity to put on record the Government&rsquo;s abhorrence at the attempts on the lives of police officers.</p><p>  The vast majority of people in Northern Ireland want to see an end to street violence. The rioters are in effect wrecking their own communities. This year has the potential to be a great year for tourism to Northern. That potential must not be jeopardised by the recent terrible images from Belfast that have been beamed around the world by international media.</p><p>  The economic cost of recent events is becoming apparent. Apart from the cost of the policing operation &ndash; estimated at &pound;7 million &ndash; foreign direct investment, the retail trade and tourism are all at risk. The Confederation of British Industry Director in Northern Ireland has warned of the economic damage being inflicted on local businesses, tourism and investment.</p><p>  It is my hope that out of this setback, we will see a redoubling of efforts to achieve a genuinely reconciled society in Northern Ireland. It is a reminder to all that the peace process is exactly that &ndash; a process which still has some way to go. Political cooperation and security cooperation on this island has never been better and we can rely on these relationships of trust and on the resilience of the Good Friday Agreement to create space for progress beyond the current difficulties.</p></reply>

All those involved in transforming policing and in changing attitudes around policing can be very proud of the changed service they have built and the new culture of policing.  An important feature of the new dispensation is the presence of the Policing Board as an independent oversight mechanism for policing alongside an array of bodies guaranteeing public confidence in the new arrangements.</p><p>  I believe that the right to peaceful assembly and to protest within the law is an important civil right in any democracy.  However, I would hope that any such expression of protest against the actions of the PSNI would not be such as to undermine the progress that has been achieved on policing in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

This broadly provides that a person must be an Irish citizen and that his/her identity is known to the Minister for Foreign Affairs before a passport can issue to that person.     Section 6(2)(a) and (b) of the Act provides that:</p><p>  &#8220;(2) An application for the issue of a passport to a person shall be &#8211;<blockquote>  made in such form as may be specified by the Minister for that type of passport,<br /><br /><br />  accompanied by such information and documents in relation to the person as the Minister may require under section 7, &#8230;.&#8221;  </blockquote>  This legal provision underpins the information contained in the Application Form Notes that accompanies each application form.  It is long-standing passport policy to require original long- form civil birth certificates in respect of passport applications for first-time applicants. These documents confirm the details of a person&#8217;s birth name, date and place of birth, all of which are critical components of a person&#8217;s identity.  These also demonstrate a person&#8217;s entitlement to Irish citizenship and in the case of children, information regarding the names of their legal guardians.  The latter is important because under the Act, the consent of a child&#8217;s guardians is required before a passport can issue to any child.</p><p>  In this child&#8217;s case, applications for a passport were made on her behalf by her mother in February, 2008 to the Irish Embassy in London and in May, 2009 to the Passport Office in Balbriggan.  On both occasions, the applications could not be finalised because the child&#8217;s long form civil birth certificate had not been submitted.  The absence of this document meant that the Department could not establish for the purposes of the Act that she was a citizen.  Moreover, her identity could not be verified or whether proper guardian consent had been obtained.</p><p>  Among the documents, submitted in the previous applications, were</p><p>  (i) a certificate from a doctor at the hospital where the child was born.  This could not be accepted as it provided no details in regard to the child&#8217;s name or her father.  Moreover, its legal status in terms of Spanish civil registration law has not been established by the child&#8217;s mother.</p><p>  (ii) a temporary Irish travel document, which was issued to this child by the Honorary Consul of Ireland in Bilbao in September 2005.  In this case the temporary document issued on the basis that it was probable that the child was an Irish citizen and to allow sufficient time for all the necessary documents be provided to allow the issue of a permanent passport.</p><p>  There is a legal obligation that any future passport for this child must be compliant with the Act. This means that the child&#8217;s mother needs to obtain a certificate from the Spanish authorities of the registered details of her daughter&#8217;s birth.  The applicant&#8217;s mother has been previously advised of this requirement by officials of the Passport Service.  To this end, I understand that the applicant&#8217;s mother has been in contact with the Honorary Consul of Ireland in Alicante and the Spanish Embassy in Dublin to help her obtain a birth certificate for her daughter.  These efforts are ongoing.  Once a birth certificate is received, the Department should be in a position to issue a passport on receipt of a fully complete application.</p><p>  From this process, the status of the father as a possible guardian of the child can be determined. Heretofore, the child&#8217;s mother has claimed to be the child&#8217;s sole guardian. </p><p>  The issue of a passport is the culmination of an important and legally-binding process.  The series of checks and balances within that process embraces the standard principles, provided for in the Passports Act, of ensuring that the identity of the applicant is known and that the person in question is an Irish citizen.  The receipt of civil documents, which can be verified, is an important aspect of this system, which helps to maintain the worldwide good reputation and integrity of the Irish passport, which in turn ensures the safe travel and wellbeing of Irish citizens, as they travel abroad.</p></reply>

The administration of the Development Education Advisory Committee is serviced by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade from the Department&#8217;s overall budget. The Group does not have any whole time equivalent staff. The committee is made up of nine members and a Chairperson.</p><p>  The Development Education Advisory Committee was identified as a candidate body for critical review as part of the Government&#8217;s Agency Rationalisation Programme under the Public Sector Reform Plan. The role of DEAC was reviewed in the context of the recent Review of the White Paper on Irish Aid. A decision on the Development Education Advisory Committee will be made when the outcome of the Review, a new policy on global development, is submitted for Government approval in the near future.</p><p>  The<b> Emigrant Services Advisory Committee (ESAC)</b> advises the T&aacute;naiste on the allocation of grants to Irish community organisations in Britain under the Emigrant Support Programme. The Committee consists of thirteen members, including two officers from our Embassy in London who act as Chair and Secretary to the Committee. Appointed Committee members serve in a voluntary capacity.  Travel expenses associated with the Committee members amounted to &#8364;585.16 in 2011 and &#8364;635.47 in 2012.</p><p>  A key message taken from participants at the 2011 Global Irish Economic Forum was the desire for members to be involved in coordinating the work and future direction of the Network.  In response to this, the <b>Advisory Group for the Global Irish Network</b> was established.  The Group is charged with overseeing the implementation, where appropriate, of the initiatives which emerged from the Forum and coordinating the overall work programme for the Global Irish Network  The 19 members appointed to the Group represent the main geographic areas represented at 2011 Forum in Dublin Castle.  It is serviced by the Irish Abroad Unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in close cooperation with other Departments and State Agencies who also attend the meetings.  The external members act in a voluntary capacity but travel expenses are refundable.  The inaugural meeting of the Group took place in July 2012 and the second meeting will take place on 11 February.  Travel and accommodation costs paid to date amounted to &#8364;8,610.</p></reply>

Following the attack on Malala Yousufzai in October last year, I asked our Embassy to maintain direct contact with representatives of the EU and its Member States in Islamabad. The Deputy will be aware that following this incident last October, there was widespread condemnation of the attack at both EU and UN level.  The High Representative / Vice President of the European Commission Catherine Ashton, and the Secretary General of the United National Ban Ki Moon issued statements condemning this attack &ndash; condemnations which I shared at the time, and continue to share.  Like many others, I admire Malala Yousufzai&rsquo;s courageous efforts to promote the fundamental right to education and her efforts to achieve education for women and girls in Pakistan and other regions worldwide.</p><p>  At the UN level, Ireland attaches great importance to the fundamental human rights of freedom of expression and opinion.

The same holds true for all the Member States of the European Union.  The EU has made protection of the rights of women and protection against gender-based violence a key feature of the EU's Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy.  The EU has also sought to clear the way for greater cooperation between the EU and the UN on this agenda.  Rape and sexual assault cannot be tolerated, regardless of the gender, status or circumstance of the victim, or whether the assault occurred in Ireland or abroad.  I condemn unreservedly the recent attacks which have taken place in India and I am aware that there have been reported widespread expressions of outrage there too.  I note that the Indian prosecutorial system has brought a number of men before the courts to be charged and tried in relation to these two recent, specific incidents which have been reported worldwide in the media.</p><p>  The next meeting of the EU-India Human Rights Dialogue is scheduled to take place this month and the issue of women&rsquo;s rights will be discussed.

It will remain a key major priority during the period of our EU Presidency.    Ireland will lend full support to High Representative Ashton in the efforts she is making on behalf of the EU to achieve an end to the violence and to promote a political resolution.  In particular, Ireland and its EU partners are fully supportive of the work of UN/Arab League Joint Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, who is endeavouring to get some form of political process underway.. Special Representative Brahimi is working closely with the US, Russia, the Arab League and others in the international community to revive the Geneva Communiqu&eacute; of last June which foresees the establishment of a transitional Government responsible for mapping a way towards transition and the ending of all repression and violence in Syria.   Ireland and the EU will also cooperate closely with other international partners as we work to address the dire humanitarian situation in Syria and to mitigate the plight of thousands of refugees and millions of ordinary Syrian people in need of assistance.  In this regard, I am acutely aware of the particular risks taken daily by aid workers operating inside Syria.   This has been graphically witnessed over the recent months with the increased targeting of humanitarian actors including attacks on civilians, medical personnel and facilities, aid convoys and humanitarian workers. Such attacks on humanitarian personnel and operations are completely unacceptable.  More must be done to break this vicious cycle of violence which is in absolute breach of international humanitarian law.</p><p>  During our Presidency of the EU, we will continue to emphasise the need for all parties to the conflict to facilitate humanitarian access and aid delivery to people in need, to ensure the neutrality of humanitarian aid and to abide by international humanitarian law, as outlined in the Good Humanitarian Donorship initiative and the European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid.</p></reply>

Across the world, courageous humanitarian workers struggle every day to reach civilians in armed conflicts as well as those affected by the numerous natural disasters that occur each year. In many of these desperate situations the provision of life-saving relief by UN agencies, the Red Cross movement and NGOs such as M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF) and others is often the only tangible expression of support for those who require the help and solidarity of the international community.</p><p>  The Government firmly believes that more must be done to break the vicious cycle in which humanitarians are attacked and their vital work undermined in breach of international humanitarian law. In too many instances the work of humanitarians is undermined by those who control access to those in need through harassment or violence.</p><p>  Ireland remains firmly attached to the humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence and our own humanitarian relief policy remains predicated on a strong commitment to provide principled, flexible and timely funding to organisations which deliver effective humanitarian assistance in response to clear and identified needs on the ground.  We very much recognise the importance of protecting the so-called &ldquo;humanitarian space&rdquo;, and know from experience that those agencies which are perceived as impartial to a conflict are invariably best placed to deliver aid to those who need it most.</p><p>  Against this backdrop, both the Good Humanitarian Donorship (GHD) initiative and the European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid provide donors such as Ireland with a robust set of humanitarian commitments that are intended to ensure an appropriate, principled and effective aid response.  From a national perspective, Ireland is strongly attached to the Consensus (and to the Action Plan which serves as a practical complement to it) and looks forward to championing the principles involved during our Presidency of the EU during the first half of this year.</p><p>  Of course, Irish-based aid agencies have not been immune to the difficulties and challenges referred to by the Deputy, operating as they do in some of the most volatile and insecure environments in the world. Indeed, each day, countless numbers of courageous Irish, international and local staff members from these organisations struggle to reach civilians affected by conflict or natural disaster right across the globe. Given the political complexity of many of the world&rsquo;s most serious ongoing humanitarian crises &ndash; such as in Mali, Syria, the DRC, Somalia and Afghanistan.  &ndash; it is unfortunately unlikely that the difficult situation faced by humanitarian organisations will be substantially improved in the coming year.</p><p>  The Government strongly supports and promotes the efforts taken by many of these organisations to develop solid security management plans and to employ dedicated security professionals to help train for and respond to security incidents.  We are also continuing to work with the members and observers of the D&oacute;chas Humanitarian Aid Working Group to develop a series of overarching professional standards for Irish aid organisations with respect to safety and security issues.</p><p>  Finally, I would like to pay tribute to the many thousands of aid workers around the globe who are striving to save lives and to deliver humanitarian help to those who need it most, often under the most exceptional of circumstances.  Their work, often overlooked and taken at great personal risk, is simply heroic.</p></reply>

I do not think that we are lacking fora where the parties can express their grievances; rather, the opposite is the case. There are already permanent representatives and staffs operating in the field on behalf of the EU, the US, the UN and the Quartet.  The problem is not, perhaps, one of a lack of structures but rather of a lack of political will to use what is already there.</p></reply>

They are evaluated and audited by independent experts as well as by Irish Aid&rsquo;s Evaluation and Audit Unit. The Unit&rsquo;s work is regularly reviewed by the independent Audit Committee of my Department. </p><p>  In partner countries benefiting from Irish Aid support, we provide assistance to national Government oversight institutions, such as the Auditor General&rsquo;s Office and the Public Accounts Committees of National Parliaments, to ensure Governments are held to account for the effective expenditure of public funds.</p><p>  We have zero tolerance for any misuse or misappropriation of Irish Aid funding.

We do this in direct contact with other countries or multilaterally through our involvement in these global and regional organisations. </p><p>  Meetings of the EU Foreign Affairs Council provide regular opportunities at which to consider such issues and the responses of the EU and the wider international community to them.  The EU has adopted Common Positions on certain countries, which attach priority to promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law. I should point out however, that there is no recognised &ldquo;top ten&rdquo; list in regard to the violations outlined by the Deputy. The Council is also the body which takes decisions in relation to the EU&rsquo;s crisis management actions, such as the launching of new EU missions or significant changes to the 14 existing Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions - 11 of which are civilian operations.</p><p>  Human rights concerns are central to Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy.  Together with our EU partners, Ireland closely monitors the human rights situations in many countries, including post-conflict countries.   We do this on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources, including both official channels and non-governmental/civil society organisations.  Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question.  </p><p>  Ireland supports the use of the full UN human rights machinery in responding to human rights abuses.   This includes support for the role of UN Human Rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies, Special Procedures Mandate Holders and for the convening, where appropriate, of Special Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council.   At the UN, the EU regularly makes statements on the human rights situations in individual countries and Ireland is, of course, fully associated with these statements.</p><p>  The establishment of a number of international courts and tribunals in recent years to deal with situations where the most serious crimes of concern to the international community have been committed represents a recognition on the part of the international community that such courts and tribunals are an essential means of ending a culture of impunity and of ensuring respect for international law, in particular international humanitarian law and human rights law.  Among the various courts and tribunals which have been set up are the ad hoc criminal tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the Special Court for Sierra Leone, the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon.  The first permanent international court established to deal with crimes of this nature is the International Criminal Court.  It was established in 2002 with the entry into force of the Rome Statute.  By its very existence, the Court promotes and upholds not only the rule of law but also provides a means to bring to account the perpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community and in this way contributes in a most fundamental way to the cause of international peace and justice.  Ireland ad its EU partners are strong and consistent supporters of the International Criminal Court. </p><p>  The Government is committed to the promotion of full observance of universal human rights standards.   Active participation in multilateral organisations including the EU, UN and the Council of Europe provides us with an opportunity to voice our concerns regarding human rights abuses.  Through these organisations, international pressure can be brought to bear on those responsible for violation of human rights.  Ireland will continue to use these mechanisms as a means of highlighting violations of human rights and furthering their protection. </p><p>  The delivery of aid and support to people in such cases is becoming increasingly challenging, particularly in situations of protracted and recurring conflict.  We are witnessing increasing incidences of humanitarian action coming under attack, with those who control territory, funding, or access to weaponry being able to harass, politicise, militarise and undermine the work of humanitarian agencies.  The Government is firmly committed to breaking this cycle of violence in which humanitarians are attacked and their vital work undermined in breach of international humanitarian law.</p><p>  For this reason, Ireland is firmly attached to the humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence and we very much recognise the importance of protecting the so-called &lsquo;humanitarian space&rsquo;.   Ireland is also a strong advocate of the Good Humanitarian Donorship initiative and the European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid;   both involve solid commitments to ensure an appropriate, principled and effective aid response.  During our Presidency of the EU, we will champion these principles and emphasise the need for all parties to a conflict to facilitate humanitarian access and aid delivery to people in need, to ensure the neutrality of humanitarian aid and to abide by international humanitarian law.</p><p>  For our part, Ireland ensures that our aid is delivered in a targeted manner through a process of prioritisation that assesses needs in the humanitarian crises across the globe. This is informed by Commission analysis, UN and other indicators, most recent situation reports and up-to-date feedback from the field.  This helps us to allocate our emergency funding to the most vulnerable populations in a principled, transparent and effective manner.  In 2013, Afghanistan, Chad, the Central African Republic (CAR), Mali, Niger, Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan and Yemen are among those countries ranked as priorities.  It is also expected that the deepening humanitarian crisis in Syria and the region will be an important focus in 2013.</p></reply>

I refer the Deputy to my previous reply on 12 October 2012 on this matter. Since then, parliamentary elections were held in Ukraine on 28 October.  It is a matter of deep regret that Ms. Tymoshenko was prevented from participating despite the fact that she remains the leader of a political party which gained significant representation in the elections.   The EU has made it clear to Ukraine on a number of occasions that advancing its relations with the EU would require it to address, among other issues, the question of politically motivated convictions. On 10 December 2012, the Foreign Affairs Council, while repeating this message, also commended the efforts undertaken by the European Parliament&rsquo;s monitoring mission headed by former Presidents Cox and Kwasniewski on this issue. I understand that the two former Presidents will report to the European Parliament on their work shortly. </p><p>  At the December Foreign Affairs Council Ministers also restated that progress towards signature and ratification of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement would not be made until &lsquo;determined action and tangible progress&rsquo; were demonstrated in three areas, including that of selective justice and preventing its recurrence.</p></reply>

The extent of our commitment to Africa is underlined by the fact that some 80% of Ireland&rsquo;s official development assistance is channelled to the continent.   </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme is focused on some of the poorest countries and communities in sub-Saharan Africa.  Seven of the priority countries for the aid programme are in Africa, where we have a commitment to long term strategic assistance.  These are Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. In addition to this support, we provide development assistance to these and many other countries in Africa, through our partnerships with the United Nations and development NGOs such as Concern, Goal and Tr&oacute;caire.  </p><p>  Through Irish Aid&rsquo;s emergency humanitarian budget, we maintain the capacity to respond quickly and effectively to humanitarian emergencies in Africa as a result of conflict, natural disasters and food insecurity.  In the coming period, it is clear that ongoing humanitarian assistance will be required in response to the severe food crisis and instability in Mali and the Sahel region of West Africa.  Ireland has already provided over &euro;9 million in response to the situation there to date. Other areas requiring emergency support this year will include Sudan, South Sudan and the Horn of Africa, where the situation remains fragile.</p><p>  Development and humanitarian assistance are producing results in Africa.   I am heartened to note that many of the countries in which we work have already made significant progress with regard to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  This includes important progress in the fight against extreme poverty, work to improve primary school enrolment and child health, and activities aimed at expanding access to HIV and AIDS prevention and treatment. Indeed, many countries previously mired in poverty are now experiencing strong economic growth, generating resources to finance their own development.  Building on this progress, we are now implementing the new Africa Strategy of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We are strengthening our overall engagement in the continent and taking a fresh look at ways in which we and our African partners can benefit from the economic opportunities involved. I believe that by ensuring a more coherent approach to Ireland&rsquo;s relations with Africa &ndash; development, economic and political &ndash; we can make an important contribution to the lives and security of the people of the continent and open up new, more mature, relations for the future. </p></reply>

The advice of Ireland&rsquo;s friends and contacts within the US Administration and Congress has long been that comprehensive reform of the US immigration system and procedures is likely to be the only manner by which such a resolution can be achieved.  The prospects for such reform would appear to have advanced in the wake of President Obama&rsquo;s re-election.  Through our Embassy in Washington and in close liaison with Irish-American community representatives, our contacts with the US Administration and Congress will intensify with a view to ensuring that the interests and concerns of undocumented Irish immigrants are captured in any future legislative deal in this area that emerges.  In this regard, I raised the issue with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during our bilateral meeting on 6 December last and recalled our strong support for comprehensive immigration legislation and the passage of E3 visas for Irish citizens.   It is likely that any E3 visa arrangement would encompass an element of reciprocity for US citizens wishing to work in Ireland.</p><p>  Much further debate and discussion is likely to be required within the US political system as to what any future legislative deal might comprise. It is therefore not possible at this stage to specify its contents or identify an exact timescale in which these may become clear but the area will continue to receive the Government&rsquo;s close attention over the period ahead.</p></reply>

Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question.  We do this bilaterally, through the EU or via the positions we take at the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council.  We support the use of the full UN human rights machinery in responding to human rights abuses.  This includes support for the role of UN Human Rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies, Special Procedures and Mandate Holders and for the convening, where appropriate, of Special Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council. The EU regularly makes statements at these bodies on the human rights situations in individual countries and Ireland is fully associated with these statements.  The EU also introduces or supports resolutions dealing with specific countries.</p><p>  Since March 2006, when the UN Human Rights Council was formed, Ireland has engaged proactively with the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism initiated by the Council.  The UPR mechanism allows for the review of the domestic human rights records of all 192 UN Member States every four years, based on human rights obligations under UN human rights and other instruments. Any UN Member State can take part in the interactive dialogue (i.e. the actual examination of the State under review) and submit written questions in advance.  Ireland was itself examined under the UPR process on 6 October 2011.  The process enables UN Member States to raise issues, some of which would have been identified by members of the public and civil society, and to make recommendations about the protection and promotion of human rights in the State concerned.   Ireland has engaged fully with the UPR process and welcomes the open and constructive dialogue associated with it.   We have also made numerous interventions during the UPR examination of other states, raising issues of concern such as gender-based violence, freedom of expression, religious freedom, freedom of assembly and the protection of human rights defenders within the State under review.</p><p>  The EU has adopted Common Positions on certain countries, which attach priority to promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law.  In addition, the EU conducts human rights dialogues with a number of countries and also raises human rights concerns as part of political dialogue meetings.  In June 2012 the EU adopted a Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy.</p><p>  Ireland and its EU partners have been strong and consistent supporters of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means of combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law.  The Court&rsquo;s Prosecutor has opened investigations into a number of country situations and we will continue to monitor this work closely.</p><p>  Ireland has also consistently taken the lead in negotiating resolutions at the United Nations General Assembly and in the Human Rights Council on the promotion and protection of human rights defenders, as well as on the implementation of EU Guidelines in relation to human rights defenders in third countries, the aim being to ensure that the latter can operate in an environment free from hindrance and insecurity.</p><p>  Mindful that the risk of human rights violations is greater where political, economic and administrative systems are weak, the Government&rsquo;s development cooperation programme, Irish Aid, supports concrete actions designed to promote human rights, including strengthening government systems and in-country human rights institutions (in particular through legal training). Legal aid programmes targeted at victims of human rights abuses are also supported.  Irish Aid has a specific focus on governance in several programme countries.</p><p>  The Government will continue to avail of all the above-mentioned mechanisms and instruments with a view to highlighting violations of human rights and furthering their protection.</p></reply>

This was also the view of the 2009 Commission on Taxation.</p><p>  The Thornhill Group saw some merit in having an occupier-focused system in that it may be more consistent with the objective of broadening the tax base as every household in the country, as distinct from every owner, would contribute.  It would also incentivise efficient use of vacant property in that property owners, on whom liability for the tax in respect of any vacant property would otherwise fall, would have a greater incentive to let the property. </p><p>  However, some rental properties have high tenant turnover which would present significant difficulties in determining liabilities and collecting taxes. Occupier liability may also give rise to perceptions of unfairness if the occupier on the liability date is no longer the occupier at the time when the tax is payable. Furthermore, the rental value of a property to an owner will be related to its taxable value and, depending on market conditions, tenants will end up bearing some of the cost of the tax by way of increased rent.  The Government agreed with the Thornhill Group recommendation that the owner rather than the occupier should be the liable person for LPT.</p><p>  The Thornhill Group recommended an exception from the general rule that the owner is the liable person in situations where other persons have substantial interests in a property, such as in the case of persons with leases that exceed 20 years or who have a life interest in a property.  In such cases, the occupier would be the liable person.  This exception is also provided for in the property tax legislation.</p><p>  The Thornhill Group also recommended that the Local Property Tax paid in respect of a rented property should be deductible for income tax or corporation tax purposes, in a similar manner to commercial rates.  This is not provided for in the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 but it is the intention of the Government to introduce such a provision on a phased basis.</p></reply>

However, I have received a number of submissions from, and on behalf of, private coach operators seeking to have this relief extended to them. I will consider these proposals and the level of the rebate in the context of the Finance Bill.  It is worth noting that one of key arguments for introducing a rebate for the haulage industry is the fact that a large quantity of fuel purchased by this industry is purchased abroad thus generating no tax revenue for the State.  A rebate should encourage hauliers to start purchasing their fuel in Ireland thus offsetting some of the costs involved.

In this context I provided assurances to the tourist industry that the 9 per cent rate will continue throughout 2013, as currently legislated for.</p></reply>

I will consider these proposals and the level of the rebate in the context of the Finance Bill.  It is worth noting that one of key arguments for introducing a rebate for the haulage industry is the fact that a large quantity of fuel purchased by this industry is purchased abroad thus generating no tax revenue for the State.  A rebate should encourage hauliers to start purchasing their fuel in Ireland thus offsetting some of the costs involved such an argument does not exist for the most part for the coach industry or for other unlicensed hauliers.</p><p>  The fuel rebate scheme proposed is governed by the terms of Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 which limits its application to auto diesel used in defined categories of road vehicles.

The LPT legislation sets out in detail how the tax is to be administered and provides how a residential property is to be valued for LPT purposes including where there is a change in ownership of the property.  The Act also provides for a number of specific exemptions from the charge as well as the possibility of deferring the charge in certain cases of hardship.  </p><p>  The LPT is a self-assessment tax so in the first instance it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the chargeable value of the property.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they will not be valuing properties for LPT purposes.  They are, however, actively preparing valuation guidance and developing tools to assist liable persons in assessing the value of their property.  Where these guidelines are used honestly, the property valuation will not be challenged by Revenue in accordance with its normal Customer Service Charter.</p><p>  For 2013, the charge to LPT is based on the market value of the property on 1 May 2013.  In addition, in order to provide necessary certainty, this initial valuation of the property on 1 May 2013 will be the value of the property for the purposes of calculating the LPT charge for all years up to and including 2016.  This value will hold regardless of improvements, extensions etc. to the property in question.  Likewise, where a property is sold during this period, and the value of the property has increased substantially, there is no additional liability to LPT.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the original valuation provided by the original owner, provided it has been made honestly and fairly, can continue to be used by the new owner to calculate their payment of LPT on the property in question for all years to 2016.  Any unpaid LPT should be discharged as part of the conveyance process, and the new owner, as with all property owners, will be required to provide an updated value for the property on the next valuation date of 1 November 2016.</p><p>  Part 12 of the Act sets out provisions for deferral of the LPT.  The deferral of the charge is granted under specific conditions.  Where the residential property is the sole or main residence of a liable person and her, his or their estimated gross income from all sources does not exceed &euro;15,000 for a single person or &euro;25,000 for a couple during the year covered by the return, she/he/they will be eligible to apply for full deferral of the LPT charge.  </p><p>  In addition, for income stressed owner-occupiers who have an outstanding mortgage, an adjusted gross income limit will apply.  In these cases, the income thresholds of &euro;15,000 or &euro;25,000 may be increased by 80% of the annual mortgage interest payments.  This type of deferral is available until the end of 2017.</p><p>  Moreover, owner-occupiers may be eligible to apply for partial deferral where the gross income from all sources is less than &euro;25,000 in the case of a single person and &euro;35,000 in the case of a couple.  For income stressed owner-occupiers who have an outstanding mortgage, these thresholds may also be increased by 80% of the annual mortgage interest payments.  In these cases the owner-occupier will qualify for deferrals of 50% of the LPT liability and the balance of 50% of the tax must be paid.</p><p>  Section 7 of the Act provides an exemption for residential properties that are used to accommodate people with special housing needs where the properties in question are owned by a charity or a public body.  To qualify for charitable status, a charity must have been granted an exemption for tax purposes by Revenue to avail of the LPT exemption.  Accordingly, regarding Deputy Penrose&rsquo;s question about a property held in trust for two children with special needs who live with their parents, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the property would not be exempt from the charge to LPT. </p><p>  Beginning in March 2013, Revenue will be issuing property owners an LPT tax return, an information booklet and a Revenue Estimate of LPT. Having established the market value of their property, the property owner is obliged to complete the LPT return in which they calculate the amount of tax they owe and state how they will pay the LPT due from a range of options.  For 2013, the LPT return, if completed in paper form must be submitted to Revenue by 7 May 2013, whereas, if they complete the form online, it must be submitted by 28 May 2013.</p><p>  Where a property owner fails to submit their LPT return by the relevant due date, the legislation provides that Revenue can enforce collection of an estimated amount of LPT.  The Revenue Commissioners advise that this Revenue Estimate of LPT is not a valuation of their property nor should it be regarded as an accurate calculation of the amount of LPT that they should pay.  Once the property owner meets their obligations by valuing their property, submitting their return and advising Revenue of their payment preference within the relevant time limits, the Revenue Estimate of LPT notified to them is no longer relevant.  </p><p>  In relation to the resources required for the administration of LPT, additional funding of &euro;25.9m plus &euro;9m in start up funding has been provided to Revenue in 2013 as set out in Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Expenditure Report 2013.  Putting additional staff in place takes time and accordingly, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that in order to meet the significant challenge involved in establishing the new tax, they have decided to reconfigure their structure in the South West and to base the LPT operations in Ennis.  I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners will deliver on the challenge and provide a stable source of funds in the form of LPT receipts.</p></reply>

To the extent that such groups are charities and are engaged in the provision of special needs housing, they should be eligible for the exemption for such housing which is provided for in the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012.  I understand that most of the various bodies that comprise the voluntary and co-operative sector in respect of the provision of social housing would have been approved for charitable status by the Revenue Commissioners.  Indeed, such bodies must have such charitable status before they can be approved by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government for funding to be used in the provision of social housing.  However, such groups also provide general needs housing in the same way as a local authority provides such housing.  Depending on the level of local authority funding provided, some voluntary bodies may have flexibility to provide housing for those not eligible for local authority housing.  To provide for a blanket exemption for such bodies would obviously be inequitable vis-&agrave;-vis local authority tenants.  For this reason the Government decided not to accept the recommendation of the inter-Departmental Group chaired by Dr Don Thornhill on the design of a property tax (the &ldquo;Thornhill Group&rdquo;) that all charitable bodies should be exempt but to restrict the exemption to those properties that are used to provide accommodation to persons who, for reasons of old age, physical or mental disability or other cause need special accommodation and support to enable them to live in the community. </p><p>  Nonetheless, I acknowledge that government policy places significant emphasis on the approved housing body sector as an important part of social housing supply in the future.  The Government will actively engage with Approved Housing Bodies to ensure that the Local Property Tax does not impact on their ability to deliver housing units.</p></reply>

The implementation of a jobs and growth strategy is a key priority of the Government. The moneys raised from the pension fund levy are being used to pay for the Government&#8217;s <i>Jobs Initiative</i> introduced in May 2011. The <i>Jobs Initiative</i>   contains a range of measures aimed at assisting in employment generation &#8211; providing opportunities for those who are out of work, to restore public morale and confidence in the economy and encourage spending by consumers. </p><p>  Employment data are presented in net terms and information on gross flows into and out of employment is not available, making it difficult to assess the number of jobs created by any policy initiative.  </p><p>  Notwithstanding that quantifying the impact is difficult, I am confident that the measures introduced by the Government in May 2011, such as reducing the rate of VAT in the high value added tourism sector, are playing an important role in both creating and sustaining employment. Encouragingly, there are signs of stabilisation in labour market conditions. For instance, unemployment fell on an annual basis in the third quarter of 2012, the first such fall in a number of years while, according to the Budget Day forecasts, the unemployment rate is projected to have peaked in 2012.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-16a.276.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013011600070#WRE01200"><p>I assume from the details supplied that the Deputy is referring to small self-administered pension schemes (SSASs).</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that SSASs are a particular type of occupational pension scheme in respect of which special requirements apply in relation to their approval, operation and supervision. The reason for these requirements is to ensure that such schemes are &ldquo;bona fide&rdquo; established for the purposes of providing retirement benefits. The concern in this regard reflects the fact that, as such schemes are generally one member schemes &ndash; that member typically being a proprietary director &ndash; there is potential for a conflict of interest to arise. This is because the individual is not only the sole member of the scheme but is also normally the owner of the company sponsoring the scheme and a trustee of the scheme.  </p><p>  In order to achieve and maintain tax-exempt approved status under tax law and Revenue rules such schemes must, for example, appoint an independent professional pensioneer trustee who cannot be removed without prior Revenue approval and who must be a co-signatory on all financial transactions of the scheme. In addition, the scheme must submit annual accounts and regular actuarial reports to Revenue. Revenue rules also place strict limitations on the investment options open to such schemes. These include a prohibition on loans to the scheme member and on self-investment in, for example, the employer&rsquo;s assets and restrictions on property investment.  </p><p>  As regards property investment, while such investments are permitted, the vendor must in all cases be at arm&rsquo;s length from both the scheme and the employer including its directors and associated companies. Property disposals by a scheme must equally be on an arm&rsquo;s length basis. </p><p>  The proposal being put forward by the Deputy is that these property related restrictions should be relaxed so that a member of a small self-administered pension scheme could sell an investment property to his or her scheme with a view to divesting him or herself of distressed property assets, with the property then becoming part of their long term pension investment. </p><p>  While I can appreciate the reasoning behind this proposal, I think it is important not to lose sight of the purpose of supplementary pension saving and the generous tax incentives that the State continues to provide to encourage it. The sole purpose of pension savings is to provide relevant benefits to the scheme member at the point of retirement or indeed earlier in the event of retirement on ill-health grounds. The activity envisaged under the proposal might not represent a prudent investment in many cases and could put the availability of those benefits when needed at undue risk. The regulatory and tax regimes governing the activities of supplementary pension provision are designed to encourage an individual to save for a pension and also to protect and secure those savings until they are needed in retirement. Those savings are not available for any other secondary purpose such as resolving financial difficulties of the scheme member, however unfortunate and difficult those situations can be. </p><p>  I also appreciate that the proposal is well intentioned. However, it would be difficult, if the rules governing investment by SSASs were relaxed in the manner suggested, to resist calls for a broader relaxation to allow, for example, equally distressed assets such as family or holiday homes to be acquired by a pension scheme or to permit investment in the employing company to stave off short term cash flow difficulties. In other words, it could be a first step towards a dismantling of the very rules that are in place to protect an individual&rsquo;s pension savings.  For all these reasons I would not be in favour of this proposal.</p></reply>

The marginal rate for each of these levies was 6% and 5%, respectively, or 11% in total.  The marginal rate for the USC was 7%.  Taken in isolation the introduction of the USC, therefore, would have had the effect of reducing by 4 percentage points the top marginal tax rates for both PAYE and self-employed income earners paying at those rates.  At the same time, the PRSI ceiling for PAYE taxpayers, which then stood at &euro;75,036, was abolished which had the result of increasing by 4 percentage points the top marginal tax rate for PAYE taxpayers.  So the two changes &ndash; the introduction of the USC and the abolition of the PRSI ceiling-taken together meant that the marginal tax rate for PAYE taxpayers remained unchanged.</p><p>  In the case of the self-employed, there was no PRSI ceiling as the PRSI income ceiling for the self-employed had been abolished in Budget 2001.  Therefore, without further change, the introduction of the USC would have reduced the top marginal rate for these taxpayers by 4 percentage points and would have had the unintended effect of benefiting high earning self-employed income earners, resulting in some high earning self-employed income earners actually making a gain from Budget 2011 in comparison to all other taxpayers.    </p><p>  To avoid the situation in which the top marginal rate for PAYE taxpayers remained unchanged while self-employed taxpayers benefited from a reduction of that rate by 4 percentage points, two further changes were made. A higher rate of USC of 10% was introduced for the self-employed in respect of income in excess of &euro;100,000 and an additional 1 percentage point was added to the self-employed PRSI rate.  This restored the self-employed top marginal tax rate to 55%, (41% income tax, 7% USC, an additional 3% USC on income over &euro;100,000 and 4% PRSI), which is where they were in 2010 and ensured that high earning self-employed income earners did not actually make a gain from Budget 2011 in comparison to all other taxpayers.  </p><p>  Note (i): the &lsquo;marginal&rsquo; rate of tax equates to the top rate of tax which an individual is paying.</p><p>  Note (ii): the 10% rate of USC only applies to income over &euro;100,000.  The standard rates of Universal Social Charge apply to income under &euro;100,000 and are:</p><p> - 2% on the first &euro;10,036</p><p> - 4% on the next &euro;5,980</p><p> - 7% on the balance. </p><p>  An individual whose total income for a year does not exceed &euro;10,036 is exempt from USC.</p><p>  Note (iii): Self-employed individuals with income of less than &euro;100,000 and PAYE employees pay tax, USC and PRSI at the same marginal rate of 52%.</p></reply>

It is chargeable in respect of a building, or a part of a building that is in use as, or that is suitable for use as, a residence.  However, it is not chargeable on the part of a building in respect of which commercial rates are payable. </p><p>  If the residential part of the hotel is not included for the purpose of commercial rates, the amount of local property tax will be based on the &ldquo;chargeable value&rdquo; of that part. This is essentially the price that the unencumbered fee simple of a residential property, or the residential part of a property, might be expected to fetch on a sale on the open market were that property to be sold on the valuation date of 1 May 2013,  in a manner that would secure the best possible price for the property. Such an open market sale would also require the retention of the benefit of any access to the property that would have existed prior to the sale.</p><p>  In this case, the owner of the hotel will be required to establish the chargeable value of the residential part of the hotel.  If the value is less than &euro;1m, the local property tax liability will then depend on the chargeable band into which this chargeable value falls and tax will be charged at 0.18% on the midpoint of the relevant band.  If the value is over &euro;1 m, the tax will be charged at 0.18% on the first &euro;1 m in value and 0.25% on any balance over &euro;1m.</p></reply>

The report on this study was published by my colleague, Ms Joan Burton TD, the Minister for Social Protection in late October last. On its publication, Minister Burton highlighted the technical and complex nature of the report. She has given interested bodies and individuals a period of time to consider the report and its recommendations and to respond to her by the end of this month. She will then propose to Government on further policy or regulatory action necessary.</p><p>  On the matter of the pension fund levy, I have held the view since the introduction of the levy that the companies who manage and administer the assets of the pension funds and schemes should generally be in a position to absorb the impact of the levy by reducing the charges and fees which they apply. I have pursued this issue with the representative bodies of these companies but the response has not been positive. I have been told that it would be a matter for individual companies to decide on the question of absorbing the cost of the levy into their existing fees and charges but that the scope for companies to do so is very limited. There have been calls to force the companies through legislation to absorb the levy but I do not consider that this approach, which would ignore the circumstances from case to case, would be appropriate. </p><p>  As regards the companies specifically mentioned in the details supplied, the relationship between the State and those companies is that the Boards and management teams retain responsibility for determining strategy and commercial policies and conducting day-to-day operations. I will not intervene in the operational management decisions of the companies concerned.</p><p>  Finally, I confirmed in my Budget 2013 speech that the pension fund levy will not be renewed after 2014 the final year of its four year duration.</p></reply>

The most recent increase on beer was in 1994. Excise on cider was increased in Budget 2002 to bring it into line with the rate for beer.  Excise on spirits was increased the following year, and this increase was also applied to spirits-based alcopops.  Excise on wine, with pro-rata increases for certain fermented and intermediate products, was increased in Budget 2009. There was a general decrease in rates for all alcohol products, of around 20% (inclusive of VAT), in Budget 2010.  There was no change in Budgets 2011 and 2012.  The Deputy should note that a 10 cent increase on beer still leaves the excise duty on beer below the 2010 level. The expected yield from these increases is approximately &#8364;180 million, a significant part of the overall increased revenue requirement for 2013. </p><p>  The report of the National Substance Misuse Strategy Steering Group is a roadmap for the future direction of policy to deal with the misuse of alcohol.  Real and tangible proposals are currently being finalised on foot of the report&#8217;s recommendations.  My colleague, the Minister for Health intends to submit these proposals to the Government for consideration and approval as soon as possible.</p><p>  It is emphasised that these proposals cover all of the areas mentioned in the report such as:</p><p>-Legislation on minimum unit pricing which is about setting a statutory floor price per gram of alcohol;</p><p>-access and availability of alcohol - including of course structural separation in retail units where alcohol is sold; and</p><p>-advertising and sponsorship.</p><p>  As part of the process of developing these proposals, the Department of Health is in continuing discussions with various Departments.  These include the Departments of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht; Transport, Tourism &amp; Sport; Justice &amp; Equality; and Communications, Energy &amp; Natural Resources.</p><p>  In the meantime, work on developing a framework for the necessary Department of Health legislation, governing among others, minimum unit pricing, is continuing.  For example, in conjunction with Northern Ireland, a health impact assessment is being commissioned as part of the process of developing a legislative basis for minimum unit pricing.  The health impact assessment will study the impact of different minimum prices on a range of areas such as health, crime and likely economic impact.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are liaising with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on the mechanisms by which local authorities will pay the tax due.  Local authority owned properties have not been exempted from the LPT and they may increase rents to ensure that tenants of such housing units make a contribution to LPT, and to avoid anomalies that may otherwise have arisen.  For example, in instances where local authorities owned and rented out a property in an otherwise privately owned housing estate, the tenant in such a property would not have been subject to the local property tax, while residents in other properties would have been subject to it, whether directly as owners or indirectly as occupiers of private rental properties.  Such a situation would have clearly been unfair, and it is to avoid such issues that local authorities are liable to pay the LPT. </p><p>  It is clear that local authorities require sufficient funding to ensure that they can operate effectively across their range of functions and responsibilities, and the introduction of the Local Property Tax is designed to achieve this goal.  Income from the LPT will accrue to the local authorities to fund local services.  It will be the responsibility of each individual local authority to manage its budget appropriately, taking into account the income and liabilities that may arise from the LPT.</p></reply>

The Act implements over 60 of the recommendations of the Final Report of the Commission on Credit Unions, which was agreed over a nine-month period by all Commission members, including credit union stakeholders.  <font color="#0000FF"> </font></p><p>  The Act was passed by both Houses following a positive and constructive debate, in the course of which I took on board a number of amendments to reflect issues raised by credit union representatives where these did not compromise important principles in the legislation.</p><p>  Among the amendments were the following:</p><p>- Term limits were increased from 9 years out of 15 years to 12 years out of 15 years;</p><p>- A number changes to exclusions from board membership;</p><p>- The definition of financial services legislation was amended so that it is now clear that it refers to that legislation as it applies to credit unions; and</p><p>- the list of classes of investment that a credit union may invest in under Central Bank regulations now specifically refers to public investment projects. </p><p>  I have also made it clear that regulatory directions to credit unions under the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill will be made appealable to IFSAT.</p><p>  The Government has made its position clear regarding its support for shared services and there is nothing in the Act to prevent this.  However, on the issue of shared branching, I have commissioned a report from the Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) which is to be submitted to me by the end of Q2 this year.</p><p>  I would like to point out that there is no statutory obstacle to a credit union providing electronic payment accounts and many already do so; therefore, no change to the Act was required in respect of that issue.  </p><p>  The Question also refers to the development of a Memorandum of Understanding between the Central Bank and credit unions. The Central Bank has recently developed a consultation protocol for its engagement with the credit union movement.  This protocol has been developed following consultation between the Central Bank, the Minister, credit union representative bodies and the Credit Union Advisory Committee. The protocol sets out how the Central Bank proposes to engage with credit unions in any formal consultation process prior to the introduction of new regulations and states that the Bank is committed to having clear, open and transparent engagement with stakeholders in fulfilling its financial regulation and supervisory objectives.  In the course of the debate on the Act, I made it clear that I do not favour a statutory MoU and nor was one recommended by the Commission.  We should be careful not to undermine the independence of the Central Bank must which must be able to act within its powers when required. </p><p>  The Commission Report recommends that in order to ensure that the role and responsibilities of the board and management do not overlap and that board members have governance rather than executive responsibilities, the role of treasurer should be removed. In line with this, the Act removes the role of treasurer and assigns the relevant executive responsibilities to the management of the credit union.  However, the Act was amended so that the Board takes on the role of presenting the accounts to a credit union&#8217;s members.</p><p>  In relation to the tiered regulatory approach, the Act provides that requirements are to be set according to the &#8220;nature, scale and complexity&#8221; of credit unions or categories of credit unions so that tiering will not be limited to considerations of size alone.</p></reply>

This means, for example, that a business which engages in online bookmaking and which accepts bets from people in this country will be liable for betting duty on those bets, irrespective of where that business is based. The existing betting duty (1%) will be applied to such bets. The Finance Act also provides for the taxation of Betting Exchanges under the new arrangements; however the calculation of the tax will take account of their particular business model, in other words a 15% tax on the commission charged. In addition, excise duties are being applied to the granting and renewal of remote bookmakers&rsquo; and remote betting intermediaries&rsquo; licences. </p><p>  The Betting (Amendment) Bill, published in July 2012, will establish the regulatory framework for these licences. The tax changes provided for in the Finance Act can only be implemented once the Betting (Amendment) Bill is enacted. It is hoped that the Betting (Amendment) Bill will be put on the D&aacute;il schedule early this year.</p></reply>

Prior to Budget 2013 there were no increases on Beer since 1994. Excise on cider was increased in Budget 2002 to bring it into line with the rate for beer.  Excise on spirits was increased the following year, and this increase was also applied to spirits-based alcopops.  Excise on wine, with pro-rata increases for certain fermented and intermediate products, was increased in Budget 2009. There was a general decrease in rates for all alcohol products, of around 20% (inclusive of VAT), in Budget 2010.  There was no change in Budgets 2011 and 2012.  The Deputy should note that a 10 cent increase on beer still leaves the excise duty on beer below the 2010 level. </p><p>  The expected yield from these increases in alcohol products tax is approximately &euro;180 million, a significant part of the overall increased revenue requirement for 2013.  Accordingly, I have no plans to amend the excise duty on alcohol in the context of the Finance Bill.</p></reply>

They reaffirmed the commitment from June 29th to task the Eurogroup to examine the situation of the Irish financial sector with a view to further improving the sustainability of the well performing adjustment programme.

However, I can confirm the following in relation to the Universal Social Charge (USC) liabilities of the person. Prior to 2013, the maximum rate of USC payable by individuals aged 70 years or over was 4%, irrespective of the level of their income, unless they had self-employment income in excess of &#8364;100,000 for a tax year, in which case the maximum rate was increased to 7% on the amount of income in excess of &#8364;100,000.  The 2013 Budget amended the rates for USC from 2013 onwards. The position is that the standard rates of USC will now apply to those aged 70 and over who have aggregate income in excess of &#8364;60,000 per annum, which are as follows:   <blockquote>  2% on the first &#8364;10,036<br /><br /><br />  4% on next &#8364;5,980<br /><br /><br />  7% on the balance.</blockquote>  The most recent information available to Revenue indicates that the aggregate income of the person in question exceeds &#8364;60,000 each year. This is exclusive of any income from the Department of Social Protection. The Tax Credit Certificate for 2013, which issued on 19 December 2012, correctly instructs the person&#8217;s pension providers that USC is to be charged at the above rates.</p><p>  If the person&#8217;s aggregate income for 2013, exclusive of income from the Department of Social Protection, will be &#8364;60,000 or less he should contact Revenue, Fingal Tax District at ph: 01-8277042, to clarify the situation.</p></reply>

The responsibility of public interest directors under company law is to the institution on whose board they serve.    </p><p>  The legal position is that any director appointed to the board of the covered institutions whether under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008 or otherwise is subject to the requirements of company law in relation to the discharge of their responsibilities as a company director. As such, the director is legally bound to act in what he or she believes are the interests of the separate legal entity that is the institution itself. These are the directors so called fiduciary responsibilities. To address the scope for actual and perceived conflicts between the fiduciary duties of the directors of financial institutions under company law and the wider public interest in circumstances where those institutions have received huge financial support from the State, legal clarity, not just to the role of the public interest director but to that of the entire boards of those institutions, was provided under Section 48 of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010. It provides that the overriding duty of directors of the covered institutions relates to the public interest as set out in the Act. </p><p>  Accordingly, public interest directors do not have a formal reporting relationship to the Minister or to the Department of Finance.  As Minister for Finance, I am strongly committed to ensuring that the boards of the covered institutions act at all times in a manner fully consistent with key public interest objectives for the banking sector.</p><p>  The public interest directors serve at my request and it is the prerogative of the Government to request them to step down or be replaced. </p><p>  The public interest directors at Bank of Ireland do not have a specified time in office as stated in response to PQ 49476/12. The same situation applies to the public interest directors at AIB. In PTSB, as stated in PQ 49482/12 the public interest directors were appointed until 30 September 2010 but have remained since that date as a replacement Government guarantee scheme has remained in place since then. The Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Permanent TSB require each director to retire every third year but in practice each public interest director has been subject to re-election by shareholders at each AGM since their appointment. </p><p>  Subsequent to the recent meeting of the Oireachtas Finance Committee I await with interest their deliberations. However, the Deputy should also be aware that officials from my Department meet with representatives of the various banks on a regular basis &ndash; including a monthly management meeting with each covered institution at which the CEO would usually attend.</p></reply>

This increase is an international phenomenon. Fuel prices are driven by a number of factors including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs. The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflected additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty in Northern Africa and the Middle East with potential supply disruptions. Tax rates were not the main driver with increasing fuel prices. However, fuels prices have receded in recent times from highs experienced last year.</p><p>  The Exchequer yield from excise, as excise is set at a nominal amount, does not increase as the price of fuels increase. On the other hand, the yield from VAT per litre of fuel, as VAT is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase. </p><p>  Contractors using machinery in the course of farming work are entitled to use Marked Gas Oil (MGO). The current excise duty including the carbon charge on MGO is 10.23 cents per litre, this compares to 47.9 cents per litre in respect of auto-diesel. In terms of VAT, the reduced VAT rate of 13.5% applies to MGO and the standard VAT rate of 23% applies to auto-diesel. MGO is therefore taxed more favourably compared to auto-diesel. I will not be introducing a tax rebate for users of MGO.</p></reply>

This table shows a projected General Government Deficit of &euro;8.9 billion for 2014. This deficit will be funded by the activities of the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA).</p><p>  As per NTMA&rsquo;s press release on the 9th of January 2013, the NTMA intends to step up its re-engagement process with the market during 2013 so that Ireland is positioned to successfully exit the EU/IMF programme, having already eliminated the funding cliff presented by a &euro;11.9 billion bond repayment due in mid January 2014.</p></reply>

The baseline scenario is one in which real GDP grows by 1.5 per cent this year.  However, there is considerable uncertainty attached to the outlook at present, given the somewhat fragile situation in many of our main export markets. There is also uncertainty attached to the outlook for domestic demand in Ireland this year &#8211; for instance it is unclear how the household savings rate will evolve in the short term.</p><p>  In this context, the MTFS outlines the impact of a number of scenarios based on the ESRI&#8217;s macroeconomic model (HERMES).  For instance, it is estimated that a 1 per cent reduction in world growth relative to the assumptions upon which the Department&#8217;s forecasts are based, would lower the real level of Ireland&#8217;s GDP relative to the baseline projection by 1.4 per cent in 2013 and add around 0.5 percentage points to the general government deficit.  These HERMES results are broadly symmetric - similar but opposite results could be expected in the event of stronger-than-assumed world growth.</p><p>  In addition, a one percentage point fall in the household savings rate relative to the assumptions would boost GDP growth by around 0.4 per cent this year relative to the baseline and improve the deficit by around 0.2 per cent.  Again, these results are broadly symmetric.</p></reply>

Such facilities of course involve additional conditionality.</p><p>  On our successful exit from our programme I fully expect that Ireland will be able to fund itself through the international financial markets. In that context, the availability of the ESM to Ireland, as to all other Euro Area member states, provides a safety net, or insurance policy, that gives reassurance to financial markets on the availability of a funding source. The availability to Ireland of a credible funding backup as provided by the ESM Treaty will be very important in terms of market re-entry and leaving the EU / IMF Programme of Support.

The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned. This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors, including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution&#8217;s overall funding.</p><p>  However, as part of the Central Bank&#8217;s work on mortgage arrears, lenders were asked to consider all avenues to help customers in arrears, including interest rate reductions.  This is particularly relevant to the sub-prime lenders who historically charge higher rates on higher risk loans.  Currently, several lenders do consider a temporary interest rate reduction but this is on a case by case basis.</p><p>  Lending institutions are independent commercial entities and, as such, it is a commercial decision for each lender to decide what loans they will provide or agree to have switched to them.</p></reply>

For this purpose, two panels of loan sale advisors have been approved for loan sales in the US and in Ireland/Britain/Europe. NAMA advises that, to date, it has chosen in a number of cases to sell loans through loan sale brokers in the US and in some continental European jurisdictions where the sale of loans is a widely practiced method of realising the value of the secured property.  In Ireland and Britain the sale of loans has mainly been in response to approaches to NAMA by third parties.  NAMA advises that, after receiving such approaches, loan sale brokers have been appointed to market the loans and to deal with offers from the original bidder and other interested parties.   </p><p>  NAMA advises also that in certain cases a loan sale may follow the open marketing of the related property. NAMA points out that in a limited number of cases where properties or portfolios of properties have been openly marketed, the preferred bidder has ultimately suggested acquiring the related loans rather than the properties, with the value of the loans fully reflecting the successful bid for the underlying property.  </p><p>  NAMA advises that in situations where an offer of full par value is received for a loan, there is no merit in further marketing the loan if NAMA has no entitlement beyond the full repayment of the loan.  In such cases, a loan may be sold without open marketing.</p></reply>

The activities of the company are required to constitute a qualifying new venture.

Defibrillators, other than implantable defibrillators, are liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23%.  As you are aware, there is no provision in the EU VAT Directive that would make it possible to exempt from VAT or apply a zero rate to the supply of such products.     Under the VAT (Refund of Tax) (No.15) Order, 1981 it is possible for individuals to obtain repayment of VAT expended on certain goods and appliances which assist persons with a disability to overcome that disability.  In this context, a defibrillator purchased by or on behalf of an individual may qualify for a VAT refund.

In particular, the sulphur content of coal that may be sold in the State, which is not more than 0.7% sulphur by weight, is lower than that in Northern Ireland and therefore coal supplied to Northern Ireland standards for sale on that market may not be sold in the State. Compliance with the Regulations will be enforced by the Local Authorities.     The Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of carbon tax on solid fuels, also advise me that on commencement of the carbon tax provisions under the Finance Act 2010, any Northern Ireland-based wholesaler of solid fuels selling into the market in Ireland will be obliged to register as a supplier and comply with the same regulatory requirements as wholesalers based in the State.

The transaction followed an initial approach by a number of investment banks to the Department late last year which indicated that there was sizeable investor interest in the State&rsquo;s CCN instruments and particularly the holding in Bank of Ireland. The Sale was managed by officials in the Department&rsquo;s Shareholder Management Unit, with many years&rsquo; experience working in financial markets and was not only timed to take advantage of the improving sentiment towards Ireland and its banks but the huge rally seen in international debt markets which has continued into 2013.</p><p>  The transaction when announced saw the State presented with the opportunity to dispose of a minimum of &euro;500 million of its position at a price of par. This stemmed from an underwrite provided by the consortium of banks &ndash; UBS, Deutsche Bank and Davy &ndash; having done a preliminary assessment of market appetite for the notes. In the end the book build process generated significant excess demand to enable the State to dispose of its entire holding in the bonds at a price of 101% of their par value plus accrued interest. This generated a profit for the State of &euro;10 million. Taking account of the coupon paid to the State last year, the taxpayer has earned a total return of over 15% in the space of 18 months.</p><p>  My officials had full visibility during the book build and pricing phases and were also provided with some valuation advice from NCB Stockbrokers which helped inform their judgement. The transaction was well received in the market and indeed the bond traded a few points higher in the after-market during its first few days of trading. This reflects a market recognition of a very successful transaction for Ireland, one in which we have exited this element of support to our banks with a profit. It points to a recognition that Ireland is successfully working to correct the very deep failings that have affected us in the past number of years. In recognising this, however, we must also acknowledge that this after market price is for a very small volume of stock compared with the &euro;1bn size of the transaction.</p><p>  The transaction settled on Tuesday the 15th of January and the State was paid proceeds of just over &euro;1,056 million, comprising principal of &euro;1,000 million, interest accrued of over &euro;46 million covering the period 29th July 2012 to date, and a profit of &euro;10 million. As we will use the proceeds of this sale to reduce the State&rsquo;s indebtedness, it will reduce the critically important debt/GDP ratio by 0.6 per cent. </p><p>  The 2013 Exchequer&rsquo;s position is improved by the full &euro;1,056 million received plus an estimated additional &euro;38 million debt service saving because of the reduction in the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement giving a gross improvement of &euro;1,094 million.  However, this will be offset by the loss of &euro;100m interest that had been due in July 2013.  This reduction in anticipated Exchequer receipts means that the net improvement in the Exchequer&rsquo;s position in 2013 will be just under &euro;1 billion.  In 2014, when there will be no further capital receipts or interest income in relation to this coco, the Exchequer effect is estimated to be a reduction of &euro;47m, which is the interest differential on &euro;956 million of borrowings between the Exchequer borrowing rate and the Bank of Ireland interest rate.</p><p>  The State&rsquo;s  investment in these instruments dates back to the 2011 PCAR exercise, and the successful exit from a large portion of this position  represents another step along the road to normalising the State&rsquo;s relationship with the banking sector. It is government policy to separate the State from its&rsquo; banks, a policy which I believe has shared support in this house. This policy will see the State this year remove the guarantee of bank deposits and liabilities which dates back to September 2008 and it also requires us to exit our bank investments over time and when conditions allow. It is true that as the CCN investments were earning the State a generous 10% return per annum, the exchequer will have to forgo this income but will also reduce its risk exposure to the banking sector. The State made this investment only out of necessity and it is pleasing that we have been able to exit this portion of our investment early and profitably. </p><p>  I can further confirm that I was not lobbied nor received requests from other investors urging a disposal of the CCN&rsquo;s while Bank of Ireland have informed me that as one would expect with a transaction of this nature, it was discussed and considered at appropriate levels in Bank of Ireland including at the Board. However the Bank does not provide further disclosure on such deliberations. </p></reply>

In the same answer, to illustrate the debate on the topic, I referred to an estimate from a report produced by the World Bank and PriceWaterhouseCoopers which put the effective rate in Ireland at 11.9% (<i>Paying Taxes, 2013</i>).  This comparative report looked at 183 countries and calculated the effective rate based on the tax obligations of a standardised company operating in each country, using standard assumptions regarding exemptions, deductions and allowances.  I also referred to a study by the European Commission (<i>Taxation Trends in the EU 2011</i>  ), which indicates Ireland has an effective corporate tax rate which is close to or indeed higher than the statutory 12.5% rate (this is likely because of the 25% rate that applies generally to non-trading income).</p><p>  I have been clear that my Department does not take ownership of these reports, but rather have quoted them to give the Deputy an example of the differences that exist in comparative studies on effective tax rates, depending on how the rate is calculated or who carries out the calculation.</p><p>  Regarding the figures that the Deputy is referring to in the question above, I should clarify that the figures given in response to Parliamentary Questions 189 and 190 related to 2010 and not 2012.  </p><p>Such data is contained in the Statistical Reports which are published annually by the Revenue Commissioners on their website &#8211; <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>  .  The Deputy should be made aware that manufacturing and trading profits quoted in the question are the amounts of trading profits before certain trade-related deductions and charges are deducted to arrive at taxable profits, the figure on which the charge to tax is initially assessed on a gross before credits basis.  The amount of taxable profits on which gross corporation tax was assessed for the year 2010 was &#8364;41,215.6 million and gross tax was &#8364;5,422 million.  </p><p>  Furthermore, it should be noted that certain credits are deducted after the calculation of gross corporation tax. Some of the main credits applicable in the tax year 2010 and deducted after the calculation of gross tax were double taxation relief, manufacturing relief, credit for withholding tax on fees and research and development tax credit.  The total net corporation tax which emerged after discounting for all credits was &#8364;4,246 million.</p><p>  I would refer the Deputy to the tables contained in the response to Parliamentary Question 1739, which will shortly be published in the 2011 report on the website of the Revenue Commissioners and which set out the corporation tax figures for 2010 in full.</p></reply>

In September 2012 the European Commission presented legislative proposals for a single supervisory mechanism (SSM) conferring powers on the ECB for the supervision of all banks in the euro area, with a mechanism for non-euro countries to join on a voluntary basis. The SSM is a key element of the Banking Union along with a common resolution framework and national deposit guarantee schemes built on common standards set out in the Capital Requirements Directive and by the European Banking Authority. The Banking Union package is a priority of the Irish Presidency of the EU Council.</p><p>  The European Council discussed the SSM at its October meeting in the context of a report from President Van Rompuy on work being carried out on the Future of Economic and Monetary Union. The timetable set in the October Council conclusions envisaged agreement being reached on &quot;the legislative framework&quot; for SSM by end of the year. Agreement was duly reached in December 2012 by Ecofin Ministers to establish a Single Supervisor Mechanism under the ECB covering the euro area and open to all Member States. The overall objective is to enforce prudential rules in a strict and impartial manner and perform effective oversight of cross border banking markets. </p><p>  As regards Mr Elderfield&rsquo;s speech I note this was delivered in a personal capacity on 26th November 2012 well before the Ecofin agreement was reached in December. Many of the concerns raised in the speech are addressed in the Council December agreement notably in relation to ensuring a balance between rights and obligations for all Member States participating in the new supervisory arrangements and in the voting modalities of the EBA to preserve the integrity of the single market.</p><p>  The question of placing a maximum ceiling on bankers&rsquo; bonuses across the EU is under discussion in the context of deliberations on the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV) and the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR).</p><p>  Having recently assumed the Presidency of the EU Council Ireland is currently engaged in trilogue and tripartite discussions with the European Parliament and the Commission on both Capital Requirements Dossiers and on the Single Supervisor Mechanism dossier.

The Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority (the Financial Regulator) ceased to exist on 1 October 2010 with the commencement of the relevant provisions of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010, which created a single structure within the Central Bank controlled and managed by the Central Bank Commission. The Central Bank Reform Act gave effect to significant structural changes in the operation of financial regulation in Ireland.    The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill responds to the regulatory failures of the financial crisis.  The Bill strengthens the ability of the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely prudential interventions. It also provides the Central Bank with greater access to information and analysis and will underpin the credible enforcement of Irish financial services legislation in line with international best practice. The Bill builds on the new structures provided for in the 2010 Act and will introduce new and revised powers of supervision and enforcement for the Central Bank. The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill is expected to commence committee stage in the D&aacute;il shortly.</p><p>  In recent years the Central Bank&rsquo;s level of regulatory activity has intensified with increases in staff numbers and skill levels at the Central Bank.  On-site inspections and review meetings have more than doubled. The Central Bank has also taken a number of measures under its &ldquo;new approach&rdquo; to banking supervision including reorganizing its banking supervision structures, investing heavily in training all supervisory staff and introducing a new risk assessment regime known as PRISM.</p><p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s Annual Regulatory Performance Statement sets out details of regulatory performance. The most recent Statement for 2011/2012 showed the following developments;</p><p>  &middot;	The Bank made further progress in meeting the targets for the stabilisation and restructuring of the banking sector under the EU-IMF Financial Assistance Programme. It also published the Financial Measures Programme which provided a thorough assessment of the capital and liquidity conditions and needs of the domestic banks.  </p><p>  &middot;	The new Probability Risk and Impact System (PRISM) was introduced in 2011 which enhances the Bank&rsquo;s supervisory approach with a risk based framework making it easier for supervisors to challenge the financial firms that they regulate. </p><p>  &middot;	In terms of consumer protection, addressing mortgage arrears has been a key focus of the Bank&rsquo;s work in 2011 and 2012. The revised Consumer Code on Mortgage Arrears came into effect on 1 January 2011 which set out the framework which lenders must adapt when dealing with people experiencing difficulties with mortgage arrears.</p><p>  &middot;	Significant work was carried out on fitness and probity standards during 2011 and 2012 which included a fitness and probity review of the directors of the Covered Institutions. </p><p>  A key element of the Bank&rsquo;s overall enhanced approach to a more rigorous enforcement regime is the Bank&rsquo;s new Enforcement Strategy 2011/2012 which sets out the newly established Enforcement Directorate&rsquo;s risk based regulatory framework. This strategy document sets out the Bank&rsquo;s statutory objectives, strategies and high level goals for supervisory and enforcement interventions. </p></reply>

It has never been the custom to  link borrowing to specific projects as to do so would limit flexibility of the Government in managing the State&rsquo;s finances.   The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) offers a range of savings products to personal savers under the brand name State Savings. NTMA State Savings products have been an important and dependable component of Government borrowing for many years and make a valuable contribution to the national finances. While the funding raised from State Savings is not ring-fenced for expenditure on a specific project, it does provide an additional source of funding for the Government.</p><p>  The suite of State Savings products includes Savings Certificates, Savings Bonds, Prize Bonds, the National Solidarity Bond, Instalment Savings and Deposit Accounts such as the Ordinary Deposit Account and the Deposit Account Plus.</p><p>  The ten-year National Solidarity Bond was introduced in 2010 specifically to allow citizens an opportunity to invest and provide money to the State to stimulate economic recovery and to assist in the maintenance and creation of employment. A four-year National Solidarity Bond was introduced in 2011. The four-year National Solidarity Bond offers a fixed return of 12%, while the ten-year Solidarity Bond offers a return of 45%. Some 47,000 savers have invested a total of over &euro;1 billion in the National Solidarity Bond to date.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-16a.508.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013011600071#WRK00800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 194 to 197, inclusive, together.</p><p>As part of the Jobs Initiative and in an effort to support job creation in the tourism industry, the Government introduced a temporary reduced rate of VAT of 9 per cent. The measure took effect at the start of the third quarter of 2011 and applied mainly to labour-intensive services provided by restaurants and hotels, as well as various entertainment services.</p><p>While I am in no doubt that the measures introduced as part of the Jobs Initiative have contributed in no small part to the employment gains we have seen in the accommodation and food sector since the second quarter of 2011, it is not possible to put a precise figure on the level of job creation which is directly attributable to these measures. Clearly factors other than the VAT reduction will impact on employment numbers.</p><p>However, research carried out by the Department and published in the Medium-Term Fiscal Statement (November 2012), showed that employment gains in the accommodation and food sector - the most relevant sector in terms of the available data published by the Central Statistics Office - since the rate reduction were contrasted with declines in both economy-wide employment and the wider service sector employment over the same period, suggesting that the measures did have a positive impact on employment growth. In this context I provided assurance to the tourist industry that the 9 per cent rate will continue throughout 2013, as currently legislated for.</p><p>While several sectors are likely to be affected by the measure, the impact is likely to have been greatest in the <i>accommodation and food services activities </i>  sector. The broad employment figures, as well as those at the sector level, following the reduction in the VAT rate as part of the Jobs Initiative are outlined below. It should be noted that the CSO does not provide a breakdown between full and part-time employment at a sectoral level.</p><p><table><tr><th>Seasonally Adjusted (&#8216;000)</th><th><div>2011 Q2</div></th><th><div>2011 Q3<br /><br /><br /><br /></div><br /></th><th><div>2011 Q4</div></th><th><div>2012 Q1</div></th><th><div>2012 Q2</div></th><th><div>2012 Q3</div></th></tr><tr><td>Total Employment</td><td><div>1,857.6</div></td><td><div>1,831.6</div></td><td><div>1,850.0</div></td><td><div>1,840.7</div></td><td><div>1,832.7</div></td><td><div>1,826.9</div></td></tr><tr><td>Full-time</td><td><div>1,420.1</div></td><td><div>1,404.3</div></td><td><div>1,411.8</div></td><td><div>1,404.4</div></td><td><div>1,393.4</div></td><td><div>1,389.2</div></td></tr><tr><td>Part-time</td><td><div>438.3</div></td><td><div>434.7</div></td><td><div>434.7</div></td><td><div>430.5</div></td><td><div>441.0</div></td><td><div>446.6</div></td></tr><tr><td>Accommodation and Food Services</td><td><div>114.9</div></td><td><div>117.4</div></td><td><div>121.6</div></td><td><div>119.2</div></td><td><div>120.5</div></td><td><div>119.3</div></td></tr></table></p><p>In relation to rates of pay, unfortunately the CSO does not provide such granular data as to allow analysis of this nature on an individual level.

In addition there were 20 cases where either more work was needed by the bank and borrower or the review was withdrawn.  </p><p>  These figures show that the CRO can make a genuine difference in relation to refused applications for credit. The report shows that almost &euro;10 million in credit was provided on foot of reviews which protected over 800 jobs. </p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, I recently published an assessment of the Credit Review Office carried out by Grant Thornton and engaged in a public consultation process in order to see what more the Credit Review Office can do to ensure SMEs are getting the support on bank lending they require. My officials are currently looking at how to implement the appropriate changes to the CRO regime. As a first step, I sanctioned an increase in the numbers on the Credit Review Panel in order to facilitate faster processing of decisions, thereby implementing one of the recommendations in the assessment. </p><p>  The CRO report shows that businesses who are refused credit have a realistic prospect of a successful outcome in CRO reviews and I would strongly urge viable SMEs to appeal any refusals of credit to the CRO.</p></reply>

As I indicated in my reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s Questions Nos. 55 and 56 of 21 November 2012, the Revenue Commissioners attach a high priority to combating criminal activities of these kinds, and are committed to continuing the extensive enforcement work that they undertake to detect and seize illicit products and to prosecute those engaged in illegal activities. They are conscious also of the need for this ongoing activity to be complemented by the development of innovative ways for dealing with this criminality, and are, for example, engaged at present, in cooperation with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs, on work to obtain a new oil marker.   Details of the quantities of oil and tobacco products seized in each of the years from 2009 to 2012, broken down by reference to the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; Regions, are given in Table 1 below.

It is government policy to separate the State from its&#8217; banks, a policy which I believe has shared support in this house. This policy will see the State this year remove the guarantee of bank deposits and liabilities which dates back to September 2008 and it also requires us to exit our bank investments over time and when conditions allow. Information on the holdings of these instruments in each of the covered banks is provided in the following paragraphs.   </p><p><b>  AIB</b></p><p>  The State holds &#8364;1.6 billion of contingent convertible capital notes in AIB which were issued on 26 July 2011. The interest payable on these securities is &#8364;160 million per annum. The maturity date of this instrument is 28 July 2016. Further information on the terms of these notes can be found in Note 45 of the Annual Financial Report 2011 (Page 340). </p><p>  The State holds &#8364;3.5 billion of preference shares in AIB. These were acquired on 13 May 2009. The interest payable on these securities is &#8364;280 million per annum and is payable in cash or ordinary shares in the event of non-payment in cash. AIB issued ordinary shares to the State in lieu of the dividend due on the preference shares in May 2010, May 2011 and May 2012. The principal steps up in 2014 by 25% if not redeemed. Further information on this can be found in Note 46 of the Annual Financial Report 2011 (Page 344). </p><p><b>Permanent TSB</b></p><p>  The State holds &#8364;0.4 billion of contingent convertible capital notes in Permanent TSB which were issued on 27 July 2011. The interest payable on these securities is &#8364;40 million per annum. The maturity date of this instrument is 28 July 2016. Further information on the terms of these notes can be found in Note 32 to the Irish Life and Permanent Group Holdings plc 2011 Annual Report (Page 153). </p><p><b>Bank of Ireland </b></p><p>  The State holds &#8364;1.8 billion of preference shares in BOI. These were initially acquired on 31 March 2009. The interest payable on these securities is &#8364;188 million per annum which is payable in cash or ordinary shares in the event of non-payment in cash. Bank of Ireland issued ordinary shares in lieu of the dividend due on the preference shares to the State in February 2010. The principal steps up in 2014 by 25% if not redeemed. Further information on this can be found in Notes 48 and 50 of the Annual Financial Report 2011 (Pages 273 and 280). </p><p>  As announced by my Department last week the State has been successful in disposing of its entire &#8364;1 billion holding of Contingent Capital Notes (CCN&#8217;s) in Bank of Ireland. In the end the book build process generated significant excess demand to enable the State to dispose of its entire holding in the bonds at a price of 101% of their par value plus accrued interest. The transaction settled on Tuesday the 15th of January and the State was paid proceeds of just over &#8364;1,056 million, comprising principal of &#8364;1,000 million, interest accrued of over &#8364;46 million covering the period 29th July 2012 to date, and a profit of &#8364;10 million.</p></reply>

In the light of the introduction of euro coin from 1 January 2002, and to bring the position into line with general practice in other EU Member States, legislation was passed in March 2002 (Section 137 of the Finance Act 2002) to permit the proceeds from the issue of coin to be transferred directly to the Exchequer every year. </p><p>  Section 14(A) of the Economic and Monetary Union Act 1998 requires that, should the proceeds of the issue of coin be less than the cost of producing it, the Minister for Finance must make up the deficit to the Bank from the Exchequer.</p><p>  Section 14(4) holds that if the currency reserve account is at any time unable to meet outstanding debits &ldquo;then the Minister shall advance to the general fund of the Central Bank of Ireland from the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof an amount at least equal to the amount which stands to be defrayed from the general fund of the Central Bank of Ireland less the amount standing to the credit of the currency reserve in respect of the accrued public moneys arising from the issue of coin and the Central Bank of Ireland shall credit the currency reserve by this amount&rdquo;.</p><p>  The payment of &euro;26,709,000 to the Central Bank in December 2012 addressed the deficit from the issue of coin in 2012 which was due to a significant return of coin to the Central Bank from the commercial banks. </p><p>  Payments to the Central Bank from the Exchequer to make up the deficits arising from the production of coin were made in 2009 (&euro;30 million) and 2010 (&euro;8.5 million). </p><p>  Receipts from the Central Bank to the Exchequer as a result of the production of coin were made in 2003 (&euro;78.2 million), 2004 (&euro;42.7 million), 2005 (&euro;45.4 million), 2006 (&euro;39.5 million), 2007 (&euro;59.1 million), 2008 (&euro;30 million) and 2011 (&euro;20.7 million).</p></reply>

These comprise &lsquo;traditional own resources&rsquo; &ndash; principally customs duties collected on behalf of the EU, with 75% of the amount collected paid over to the EU and the balance retained by the member state to fund the costs of collection and administration; a VAT-related payment under which an agreed percentage is levied on a harmonised VAT base for each member state and finally a payment based on a percentage of each member state&rsquo;s Gross National Income (GNI).  Corrections or rebates to a number of member states are also factored into the calculation of contributions.</p><p>The annual level of Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the EU Budget, made up of the three elements mentioned above, is determined by the outcome of the annual EU Budget negotiation between Council and the European Parliament.

The legislation specifies that, where a person satisfies the Revenue Commissioners that s/he is a Disabled Driver who complies with all the conditions of the Disabled Drivers Scheme, that person shall be entitled to relief in respect of a vehicle with an engine capacity of up to but not greater than 2,000 c.c. </p><p>  The legislation also specifies that relief will be granted in respect of Value Added Tax (VAT), Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) or residual VRT borne in respect of a vehicle, or in respect of the adaptation of a vehicle, subject to the limit specified in Regulation 9 (Driver) or Regulation 11 (Passenger).  There is no restriction on the extent of the adaptations but relief is subject to the specified limits. The specified limit in respect of a disabled driver is &euro; 9,525 and in respect of disabled passenger is &euro;15,875.</p><p>  Disabled drivers purchasing second-hand vehicles may participate in this scheme provided they comply with all the conditions of the Disabled Drivers Scheme as outlined. Regarding VRT, the legislation specifies that the claimant must have borne the residual vehicle registration tax. In the case of the purchase of a second-hand vehicle, if there is no vehicle registration tax on the second-hand vehicle because it was either remitted or repaid when purchased as new, then there is no residual vehicle registration tax to be borne by anyone on a subsequent purchase and hence there is no amount available for refund.</p><p>  An individual who qualifies under the scheme has to retain the vehicle for 2 years before it can be replaced under the Scheme.</p><p>  The legislation does not provide for any exceptions and the provisions of SI 353/1994 must be fully adhered to.  I have no plans to increase the relief available.</p><p>  Some 13,000 people benefited under the scheme in 2011 at an overall estimated cost of &euro;51 million. Given the scale and scope of the scheme, any possible changes can only be made after careful consideration and with regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme and the available resources.</p></reply>

In addition Revenue continues to take robust and effective enforcement action against fuel launderers and others involved in this illegal trade. This action involves close cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, HMRC and other law enforcement agencies.   Measures taken to date include the introduction of a stronger licensing regime for the auto-fuel sector in 2011 and, following legislation in the Finance Act 2012, the introduction of a new licensing regime for marked fuel traders in October 2012. From January 2013 new reporting requirements will also take effect, which require all licensed fuel traders to report their transactions to Revenue on a monthly basis. This supply chain data will enable Revenue to identify suspicious or anomalous activity for investigation.</p><p>  The measures taken to date by Revenue have already provided the basis for a very effective response; in the past two years approximately two million litres of fuel have been seized, 20 oil laundries have been detected and over 70 filling stations have been closed.  In addition, Revenue and HMRC signed a Memorandum of Understanding in May 2012 on a joint approach to seeking a new marker for rebated fuel and issued a joint &lsquo;Invitation to Make Submissions&rsquo; (IMS) in June 2012 for this purpose. There was a very good response to the IMS and submissions are now being evaluated. It is planned that this process will be completed by mid-2013. 	</p></reply>

Revenue&rsquo;s tax and duty compliance programmes are under constant review to ensure that they are focussed on the areas of greatest risk, including risks from the shadow economy.   </p><p>  Revenue tackles the problem of the shadow economy through a range of compliance and audit interventions including targeted special projects.  A variety of methodologies are used by Revenue to identify those who are operating in the shadow economy including covert surveillance, cold calls to businesses and venues as well as pre-arranged aspect queries on specific items.  In addition, joint operations are conducted with the Department of Social Protection using Joint Investigation Units and there is a strong focus on cash businesses, given its potential high-risk nature.</p><p>  I am confident that the Revenue Commissioners are pursuing a programme that is dealing in a very determined way with tax evasion in all its forms:</p><p>- In 2012, Revenue carried out more than 537,000 compliance interventions, yielding more than &euro;492 million. </p><p>- For the period January to August 2012, specific Shadow Economy Projects carried out by Revenue show that in the cash business, white-collar cash, construction and rental sectors, a total of 1,963 audits were undertaken, with a yield in excess of &euro;62 million.</p><p>  Considerable success has been achieved in combating the illegal trade in tobacco products.  In 2012, Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service seized a total of 95.6 million cigarettes from 8,105 seizures. A further 19,676 kilograms of other tobacco products were taken in 2012 from 1,397 seizures.</p><p>  In addition to the ongoing enforcement action against the illegal fuel trade, steps are being taken to ensure enhanced control and supervision at all stages of the fuel supply chain.</p><p>  Key actions include a strengthening of the licensing arrangements for businesses selling auto-fuel, and of the enforcement of licensing requirements. As well as these important licensing changes, a requirement operates from 1 January 2013 for all fuel traders to make electronic monthly returns to Revenue on their fuel transactions. This will facilitate Revenue in detecting unusual or anomalous patterns of activity.</p><p>  Given the links of organised criminality with the illegal fuel trade, Revenue works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating it. Searches undertaken as part of intelligence-led operations have resulted in a considerable number of seizures of diesel and the closure of laundering plants, particularly in border counties.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners advise that in 2012, 11 oil laundries were detected and shut down and 199,000 litres of oil were seized along with 28 vehicles and 5 trailers. There were 10 arrests in the course of these operations.  In the period January to November 2012, 56 premises were closed.</p><p>  Finally, I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they hold regular meetings with trade and representative bodies through The Hidden Economy Monitoring Group where the risks posed by shadow economy activities are discussed.  The Deputy should also note that changes are frequently made in tax legislation aimed at counteracting shadow economy activity.  Two examples from 2012 include the introduction of the electronic Relevant Contracts Tax regime and an enhanced penalty regime for employers who fail to operate PAYE regulations fully.</p></reply>

NewERA has a centralised shareholder advisory role from a financial and commercial perspective in respect of corporate governance matters for five commercial semi-state companies: ESB, Bord G&aacute;is Eireann, EirGrid, Bord na Mona and Coillte. This role, based on the Shareholder Executive model already established in a number of developed economies, involves advising on activities such as capital expenditure plans, corporate strategy, acquisitions and disposals. NewERA is already working closely with the relevant Government Departments and companies in this regard. The Shareholder Executive approach is designed to provide the Government with a portfolio view of investment returns from the sector and with a means of assessing the likely impact of commercial developments in the sector on long-term Government investment plans. </p><p>  NewERA is also charged with assisting the development and implementation of Government plans for investment in<b></b>energy, water and next-generation<b></b>  telecommunications with the long-term objective of employment creation and has commenced work with the relevant Government Departments in these areas. NewERA is an important element in the Government&#8217;s strategy to promote economic growth and create jobs.</p><p>  Officials of my Department are liaising with the National Treasury Management Agency in preparing proposals for legislation to put NewERA on a statutory footing and I expect to bring forward those proposals as soon as possible once that work is completed.</p></reply>

Other factors that were taken into account in scheduling the projects over the duration of the plan included the stage of progression reached by individual projects in the architectural design process, the availability of sites where appropriate and the technical readiness of projects to proceed to tender and construction.  My Department in its examination of the project in the case of the school referred to by the Deputy took into account the fact that as the temporary site of the school had become available as the permanent site, the school's long term accommodation needs could be met through the refurbishment and extension of the current school.</p><p>  The project is currently being progressed through the architectural planning process and is intended to proceed to construction in 2015/16.  My Department met with the school's Board of Management in December in relation to addressing issues with the school project.  Proposals with regard to the major project will be progressed by the design team in conjunction with the schools Board of Management and Department officials as the main building project is advanced.</p></reply>

This has been achieved by bringing forward to this year 1.5% of the 2% reduction in overall capitation funding originally scheduled for 2013.</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that Circular 40/2009 clarifies issues relating to the allocation of funding for primary schools. The circular states that capitation funding provided for general running costs and funding provided for caretaking and secretarial services may be regarded as a common grant from which the Board of Management can allocate according to its own priorities.</p><p>  I understand that there were 217 pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September 2012. Subject to final verification, capitation funding will be paid on the basis of this enrolment.  I am unable to provide any further capitation funding to the school in 2013.</p></reply>

This information is updated when any relevant changes occur.</p><p>  For the Deputy's information, no agency under the aegis of my Department has been abolished since March 2011.</p><p>  With regard to the rationalisation of state agencies the Deputy may wish to note the following:</p><p>-  On 7th November, 2012 the Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), replaced the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI), the Further Education and Training Awards Council of Ireland (FETAC), and the Higher Education Training and Awards Council (HETAC).</p><p>  Major savings had already been achieved through the administrative preparations for amalgamation through non-replacement of staff retiring or leaving, the consolidation of the CEO role and streamlining of operations across the existing bodies. The 2012 current allocation for the bodies was &euro;7.7 million, compared to an outturn of over &euro;13 million in 2008. Staffing in NQAI, HETAC and FETAC has reduced from 110 to 80 over the same period. </p><p>  As well as the more general savings arising from organisational efficiencies, specific savings relating to accommodation and staffing arise from the amalgamation. The amalgamating agencies were located in 4 separate locations and this has been reduced to 2. This has realised annual rent savings of approximately &euro;400,000 in a full year. In addition, the reduction in the number of CEOs has resulted in savings of approximately &euro;250,000 per year from 2011 onwards.</p><p>  It is estimated that the costs arising from the amalgamation in 2012 will be approximately &euro;1.8 million, split evenly between accommodation costs and the integration of ICT infrastructure. However, it should be noted that this has been managed in the context of reduced Exchequer allocations since 2008.</p><p>-  The Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology and Irish Research Council for Humanities and Social Sciences were merged into a single entity in March, 2012 - the Irish Research Council (IRC).</p><p>-  In June 2011, the functions of the National Educational Welfare Board transferred to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p><p>-   Since September 2011, the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE) is within the remit of Dublin West Education Centre alongside the Department's largest support service, the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST).</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that there are a number of major structural reform projects and other initiatives being progressed in the Education sector (of which some are included in the Public Sector Reform Plan). These include:</p><p>-  The amalgamation of the 33 Vocational Education Committees (VECs) / establishment of 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs). The ETBs will take over the work of VECs and will have an expanded role in the delivery of further education and training across the country.</p><p>  It is expected that the Education and Training Boards will be established in early 2013. Consequently, there are no direct savings for 2012. Depending on the date of establishment in 2013, full year savings are estimated at &euro;2.1m. The Education and Training Boards Bill 2012 is currently at Committee Stage. </p><p>-  A single awarding authority for student grants. City of Dublin VEC will operate as the new single student grant awarding authority to replace the existing 66 grant awarding bodies. Implementation of the new arrangements are being phased in from the 2012/13 academic year.</p><p>-  The consolidation of Higher Education provision under the Strategy for Higher Education to 2030.</p><p>-  Following the enactment of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Act 2012, the necessary steps are being taken to establish the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board. This body will be funded from the contributions of the religious congregations offered in response to the request for additional contributions, following the publication of the Ryan Report. The legislation also provides for the dissolution of the Education Finance Board, which has almost exhausted the &euro;12.7 million available to it, and the transfer of any remaining functions of the Education Finance Board to the new Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board.</p><p>-  As part of the reorganisation of FAS and the creation of the National Employment and Entitlements Service (Intreo) by the Department of Social Protection, FAS Employment and Community Services (approximately 800 staff) was transferred to the Department of Social Protection in January 2012.</p><p>  The passing of primary legislation is required for the establishment of SOLAS. The Heads of a Bill for the establishment of SOLAS were approved by Government. The Bill will, among other things, provide for the establishment of SOLAS, the dissolution of FAS and the transfer of the F&Aacute;S training division to the newly formed Education and Training Boards.  It is anticipated that this legislation will be published in the current D&aacute;il session.</p></reply>

The purpose of the report, which I requested, was to identify new possible structures to improve initial teacher education in Ireland so that it is comparable with the best in the world.</p><p>  The international panel of education experts recommended that teacher education be provided in six &quot;centres for teacher education&quot;. This will mean that a smaller number of centres for ITE exist, but that they offer education across multiple sectors from early childhood to primary, to post primary to adult education. These centres will also possess a critical mass in terms of research capacity which is not always possible in smaller institutions. The panel suggested that Church of Ireland College of Education would be suitably positioned to join a number of the proposed new configurations.</p><p>  I am not in a position to provide an update on the current status of negotiations between the various institutions involved. However, I have asked the HEA to prepare an implementation report, which I expect to receive shortly.</p></reply>

The continuum of assessment allows for the identification of pupils with special educational needs, their nature and severity by harnessing the experience of class teachers and support teachers, in consultation with parents, and with the support of the psychologist.  It also provides for the development of immediate responses and interventions designed to ameliorate the particular needs identified at the appropriate level, either in the classroom or with the assistance of the support teacher. This allows for a response to be put in place at the earliest possible juncture for students before their difficulties can become intractable.  Assessment of needs at this stage of the continuum involves information gathering, testing and observation by the various school personnel involved and support from the NEPS psychologist, as required.</p><p>  Where the pupil does not make adequate progress following the interventions, or where the nature of the child's special educational needs are significant, severe and complex, the school may agree with the psychologist that a psycho-educational assessment be conducted to identify the specific nature of the needs and the appropriate response necessary.  Students, so identified, are scheduled for assessment within that school year.</p><p>  I can inform the Deputy that the student in question was not raised by school authorities with the assigned NEPS psychologist for any form of direct intervention. However contact was made with the school immediately before Christmas and a meeting took place on Friday, 11 January last at which, inter alia, his situation was discussed.  I am informed that the school is now putting in place the appropriate arrangements which will lead to a meeting between the NEPS psychologist and the student in the near future.</p></reply>

Two of these universities, Trinity College Dublin and National University Ireland Galway have improved their relative ranking positions in the last year. While UCD's relative ranking has fallen, their overall point score is higher than last year.</p><p>  There are a multitude of ranking systems each of which has their own particular methodology and bias and it is important not to place too much reliance on these systems as an indicator of system quality.  While some higher education systems have invested heavily in elite institutions and adopted a policy of differentiated support for different tiers of institutions, in Ireland our focus is on advancing performance across an accessible and diverse system of institutions. This policy is paying dividends for Ireland's growing competitiveness and we are now ranked 1st Globally by the IMD World Competitiveness survey for availability of skilled labour due to our impressive ranking of first in EU and fourth in OECD for higher education attainment rates of our 25-34 year olds.</p></reply>

The data provided is at a point in time on 15 January, 2013. It gives the position for student grant applications for attendance at both further and higher education. This data has been provided to my Department by SUSI.</p><p>SUSI is continuing to make payments on a weekly basis to ensure students can get paid their grant as expeditiously as possible, once they have been awarded a grant. Those awarded a grant must supply bank account details and confirmation of registration must be received from the institution in order for the first instalment to be paid.</p><p>Following initial submission of a grant application, students progressing to the next stage of the assessment process are issued with a checklist of documentary evidence which they need to provide in order to complete their application. This checklist is tailored from the specific information provided on the student's application. The checklist outlines the supporting documentation required and where this documentation can be sourced.</p><p>SUSI may, on receipt of this documentation, require further additional documents to determine eligibility. This arises for a variety of reasons. It may emerge, as a result of the documentation provided, that something was omitted from the student's initial on-line application or that further clarification on information provided is needed. In a small number of cases it may emerge that a document that is needed in support of the application was not requested at provisional assessment stage. The Deputy will appreciate that in the context of SUSI having received in excess of 67,000 applications that some errors may inevitably arise when handling a high volume of applications within a relatively short timeframe.</p><p>An external review of SUSI's business processes will be put in place in the coming weeks to inform improvements in the system for the 2013/14 academic year.</p><p>SUSI - Applications - Processing Position by County</p><p><table><tr><th><b>County</b></th><th><div><b>Total applications received</b></div></th><th><div><b>Incomplete

In relation to the specific merger of Co. Carlow VEC and Co. Kilkenny VEC as you know I have decided that the headquarters of the Education and Training Board will be in Carlow. Consultations with all of the stakeholders are underway in relation to the implementation of this Government decision. Redeployment of staff from Kilkenny to Carlow is possible under the terms of the Croke Park Agreement. However, I expect that the office in Kilkenny will remain open for some time and that the approach to redeployment will be measured and considered.</p><p>  It will be a matter for the CEO of the new Education and Training Board to work through and judge what the best approach is to ensure the optimum approach to service delivery. The establishment of SOLAS is also likely to have a bearing on the precise arrangements to be made.</p><p>  I want to make clear that my Department will not be forcing any one size fits all approach to staff deployment and office accommodation by the new Education and Training Boards. We will be receptive to any reasonable and sensible arrangements that are the best fit for the needs of the areas served by the new board.</p><p>  Finally, I would like to inform the Deputy that at the present time there are no schemes for early retirement or voluntary redundancy open to VEC staff other than the Cost Neutral Early Retirement Scheme which was introduced in early 2005. The introduction of such schemes for the public service is a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the first instance.</p></reply>

This checklist is tailored from the specific information provided on the student's application.  The checklist outlines the supporting documentation required and where this documentation can be sourced.</p><p>  On receipt of complete supporting documentation Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) can determine if the applicant satisfies the eligibility conditions for a student grant, which include nationality, residence, academic progression and means.  The documentary evidence is necessary to verify the information provided by the student on their on-line grant application.</p><p>  A full list of the documentary evidence that may be required is outlined in Schedule 5 of the Student Grant Scheme 2012 (S.I. No. 189 of 2012 refers).</p><p>  SUSI may on receipt of this documentation require further additional documents to determine eligibility.  This arises for a variety of reasons.  It may emerge, as a result of the documentation provided, that something was omitted from the student's initial on-line application or that further clarification on information provided is needed. In a small number of cases it may emerge that a document that is needed in support of the application was not requested at provisional assessment stage.  The Deputy will appreciate that in the context of SUSI having received in excess of 67,000 applications that some errors may inevitably arise when handling a high volume of applications within a relatively short timeframe.</p><p>  Some 12,632 students have to date been asked to provide further additional documents to determine their eligibility for a student grant. This data has been provided to my Department by SUSI. It is understood that of these, some 6,775 students have returned the required documentation while some 5,857 have yet to provide the additional documentation requested. The additional types of documentation that are being requested in these instances, are critical to establishing a student's eligibility to a grant, and can relate to any aspect of the Scheme, such as residency, nationality/immigration status, previous academic attainment but, predominantly, relates to means.</p></reply>

Specifically, the following sections have been commenced - 1, 2, 14(1)(a), 14(1)(c), 14(2) to 14(4), 19 to 37, 40 to 53. The remaining sections of the Act have yet to be commenced.</p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) made recommendations which suggested that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act. My Department's opinion is that the level of investment required would be greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report.</p><p>  In the light of the very difficult economic situation, and these significant costs, the previous Government deferred the full implementation of EPSEN.</p><p>  Given the costs involved and current fiscal constraints, addressing this issue will be very challenging. I will be considering how we can develop a plan to implement the objectives of the EPSEN Act so as to deliver improved educational outcomes for students with special needs.</p><p>  The NCSE have been asked to provide comprehensive policy advice on how the education system can best support children with special educational needs. This advice will guide the preparation of a plan on how aspects of EPSEN can be implemented, including the prioritising of access to children with special needs to an individual education plan.</p></reply>

The Government decided to raise the PLC PTR to the same level as that which applies in all free second-level schools.</p><p>  While it would be preferable not to have to make any changes, it is hard to justify providing a more generous PTR in PLC - which is mainly geared to school leavers and adults returning to education - than second-level schools - which cater for teenagers.  This decision is being made at a time when the Government has succeeded in protecting class sizes in primary and free second-level schools for the coming year, ensuring that our limited resources are rightly focussed on the children in our education system.</p><p>  The change will take effect in September 2013 and will reduce the number of PLC teaching posts by 200.  It may lead to some reduction in subject choices for students but the sector has expanded rapidly over the past few decades, developing many innovative programmes for its students. In the meantime VECs will have an opportunity to plan for the reduced allocation across the schools/colleges under their remit and to work with their Principals and staff to ensure they can continue to deliver programmes which closely meet the needs of both students and employers.</p></reply>

However, students studying in an EU Member  State may be eligible for a maintenance grant provided they meet the terms and condition of the student grant scheme.</p><p>  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries.

However, the change must be seen in the context of the major challenges we have as a Government in trying to shelter public services to the greatest extent that we can in these exceptional times. The net impact on overall teacher numbers in our schools has been minimised to the greatest extent possible. Teacher allocations to schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. In accordance with these rules each school management authority is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. In accordance with existing arrangements, where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support i.e., curricular concessions.</p><p>  The deployment of teaching staff in the school, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance a matter for the school management authorities. Accordingly the type of information requested by the Deputy is dealt with at individual school level rather than centrally within my Department.</p></reply>

These include subject specifications with clear learning outcomes; a comprehensive professional development programme for teachers, principals and deputy principals in educational assessment, including processes of moderation; and the introduction of standardised tests for all schools and students in English reading, Mathematics and Science and in Irish reading for Irish-medium schools; the development of an assessment and moderation toolkit.</p><p>  In the new scenario, assessment for learning will have a key role and will enhance learning throughout the 3 years of Junior Cycle.  It will be complemented by the 2 components of assessment of learning, which will happen towards the end of the Junior Cycle, and be reflected in the School Certificate of Learning.  Subjects with their new modes of assessment are being introduced on a phased basis so that capacity in the system can be built up incrementally.</p><p>  Additional quality assurance measures in relation to assessment of learning at end of junior cycle include the following:-  The State Examinations Commission (SEC) will provide final assessment papers and marking schemes for subjects until the new school-based system of assessment is fully established</p><p>-  For English, Irish and Mathematics, the SEC will initially mark these papers. This arrangement will continue until standardised testing becomes established in junior cycle</p><p>-  The results awarded on every School Certificate of Learning will be sent to the Department. The Department will monitor the national and school patterns along with the results in the standardised testing of reading, Mathematics and Science. This monitoring will provide further quality assurance and identify any local or national anomalies. A report on overall trends will be published regularly. In the event of an unusual pattern of achievement, the Inspectorate of the Department will be advised, and support and evaluation measures will be provided for the school.</p><p>  In addition, national monitoring of standards will be complemented by continued participation in national and international assessments.</p></reply>

Under the Act, it is a function of the Minister for Education and Science (Skills) to ensure, subject to the provisions of the Act, that there is made available to each person resident in the State, including a person with a disability or who has other special educational needs, support services and a level and quality of education appropriate to meeting the needs and abilities of that person. This includes provision for students learning through ISL.</p><p>  A number of initiatives which seek to promote, develop and implement ISL in order that it will achieve greater recognition and use in the education system are currently in place. These include:</p><p>-	the special schools for the deaf/hearing impaired have been encouraged in relation to the use of sign language in class.</p><p>-	funding for an ISL weekly home tuition service whereby deaf tutors visit the 	homes of deaf pre-school children and deaf school-going pupils to provide training in ISL for the deaf children, pupils, their siblings and parents.</p><p>-	funding is also made available through the Special Education Support Service (SESS) to enable individual teachers and whole school staff to undertake courses in Irish Sign Language which are available throughout the country through a variety of providers.</p><p>  In addition, the Visiting Teacher Service for Children and Young People with a Hearing Impairment is provided by my Department from the time of referral through to third level education. The Visiting Teacher service provides advice and support to ensure that the needs of children and young people with hearing impairment are met. This service is available at pre-school, primary and post-primary levels. Specifically, the service works in partnership with parents of pre-school children with hearing impairment, visiting their homes and/or meeting them in groups to inform, advise and offer guidance in matters pertaining to their education and overall development and in helping their children to derive maximum benefit from the educational opportunities available. </p><p>  My Department, through the Higher Education Authority (HEA), has established and funds a Centre for Deaf Studies in Trinity College, Dublin which provides diploma courses for ISL/English interpreters, deaf tutors and in deaf studies. The course modules deal with issues such as sign linguistics, bilingualism and sociolinguistics of sign language. The course is delivered in seminar sessions/group work and the award of the diploma is based on continued assessment and a project and course design. The HEA has allocated &euro;365,000 in core funding to the Centre in the current academic year.</p><p>  Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) recently published its Policy Advice on the Education of Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children in Ireland, which makes a number of recommendations for the improvement of educational provision for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children, including recommendations relating to ISL provision. This policy advice is available on the NCSE's website www.ncse.ie. My Department has established a working group which will consider and implement the recommendations of this report in accordance with available resources.</p></reply>

The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for pre-school children with autism.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for the provision of a range of educational services at local and national level for students with special educational needs. In particular, its network of Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) co-ordinates special needs education provision at local level and arranges for the delivery of special educational services. The SENOs act as single points of contact for parents of students with special educational needs. A specific function of the SENO is to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs. SENOs are a valuable source of support to parents who are actively sourcing a placement for their children.</p><p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents can contact SENOs directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  An application for home tuition on behalf of the child referred to by the Deputy was refused as he does not meet the eligibility criteria.  The NCSE confirmed to my Department that there is a placement available for him in a special class for children with autism.</p></reply>

The criteria upon which contracting authorities may exclude applicants from the award procedure of public contracts are set out in Regulation 53 of SI 329 of 2006 <i>European Communities (Award of Public Contracts) Regulations 2006</i> and Article 45 and Recitals (34) and (43) of 2004/18/EC, the EU Directive<i> on the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts</i>.   Where a contracting authority is aware of a judgement by the Labour Court against an applicant in a public procurement process they may exclude that applicant.  However before that applicant is excluded, the applicant may make a case and provide supporting evidence as to why it should not be excluded.  The contracting authority must consider this evidence before deciding whether to exclude or include an applicant.</p><p>  In qualifying for inclusion in tender competitions for public contracts, applicants must submit signed declarations stating that none of the circumstances outlined in Regulation 53 of SI 329 or Article 45 of 2004/18/EC apply.</p></reply>

In view of the commercial role, mandate and responsibilities of the body referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question it is proposed to continue to apply this principle in this specific instance. </p><p>  As I discussed with the Committee, the principle reflects a serious concern that an uneven competitive playing field that would be created in circumstances that commercial state bodies were subject to Freedom of Information but their privately-owned market competitors would not.  In such circumstances there is a clear potential for FOI requests to be used to access information to disadvantage and erode the competitive position of the commercial State body in the marketplace.  This would have an adverse impact on the commercial position of the State body in question which would not be in the public interest or consistent with the need to safeguard the State&rsquo;s economic and financial interests.</p><p>  It is important to draw attention to the point which I made to the Committee that notwithstanding that commercial state bodies are not subject to FOI, it continues to be a priority to ensure that effective mechanisms are in place to ensure that there is appropriate public oversight and accountability in relation to the conduct and activities of these bodies.  In addition to the corporate governance requirements to which such bodies are subject, records relating to those bodies held by their parent Government Department and or public bodies are subject to the Freedom of Information legislation.  Moreover, commercial State bodies are accountable to the Oireachtas through Parliamentary Questions put down for the responsible Minister and through meetings with relevant Oireachtas Committees.  Furthermore, as the Deputy will be aware, legislation is at an advanced point of development to strengthen the powers of the Oireachtas to conduct inquiries into matters of significant public interest which could include matters relating to the activities of a commercial state body.  The legislation will also strengthen the powers of Oireachtas committees in carrying out their normal functions other than when an inquiry is taking place. </p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that in my meeting with the Oireachtas Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform Committee I made clear that in the context of the pre-legislative scrutiny process being carried out on the FOI reform legislation I was open to any case that may be made relating to any matter encompassed by the proposed legislation.  If it is the case that the Deputy wishes to make a submission to me on the rationale for setting aside the principle I have summarised above in the case of the commercial State body referred to in his question, I would of course consider his views in the context of the finalisation of the legislative proposals on FOI.</p></reply>

These national arrangements have benefits that include: cash savings; administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; greater purchasing expertise; improved consistency; and enhanced service levels. In order to increase the usage of the NPS arrangements and thereby secure best value for money, the Government decided that it should be mandatory for public service bodies to use specified national procurement arrangements.  The categories subject to national procurement arrangements include: electricity; natural gas; stationery and office supplies; paper; ICT consumables; managed print services; print media advertising; and, motor vehicles.  These national arrangements will secure best value for money and facilitate contracting authorities to maintain the delivery of services in the context of tighter budgetary constraints.</p><p>  While the key reasons for reforming public purchasing is to enable the State to do more with less by aggregating procurement to secure better value for money, it is worth noting that such aggregation arrangements can be implemented in a manner that achieves value for money with a minimal negative impact, or indeed a positive impact, on SMEs.  While a number of the categories of goods and services mandated national arrangements are suited to single supplier it should not be taken that single supplier frameworks are to be accepted as the norm.  The greater use where appropriate of multi-supplier frameworks &ndash; for example the supply of managed print services- can address local supplier issues while also ensuring ongoing cost competitiveness of the framework itself.  Such multi-supplier frameworks can also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions. </p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the NPS over the past 3 years has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.  In 2012 the NPS, working with InterTradeIreland, for the first time brought together a number of the lead Government agencies to create a programme of major events for the Island of Ireland.  Attendees could also avail of educational seminars on a variety of topics ranging from the technicalities of public service procurement to procedures around consortia-building for SMEs.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 3,000 SMEs nationwide.  Surveys conducted at these events have indicated a high degree of satisfaction among suppliers.

Establishing the appropriate suitability criteria that are relevant and appropriate to a particular contract is, of course, a matter for the contracting authority concerned.  This is because the contracting authority is in the best position to gauge the appropriate levels of financial capacity that are appropriate to the needs of that specific contract.  My Department has developed specific national guidelines for contracting authorities in relation to minimum standards for suitability criteria for construction contractors interested in tendering for public works projects, published as part of the Capital Works Management Framework, which is available at <i><font color="#0000FF">www.constructionprocurement.gov.ie</font></i>.  In this regard, it is important to point out that there are no centrally imposed requirements for a minimum turnover.  Such requirements would logically be developed on a case by case basis with reference to the specific needs of the contract.</p><p>  The Government recognises that the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector is very important to the economy and that public procurement can be a source of business for SMEs.  In this regard, my Department has issued public procurement guidelines (Circular 10/10) to public bodies which are aimed at facilitating greater participation of SMEs in public procurement opportunities.  In relation to suitability criteria, the guidelines stress that public bodies must ensure that any criteria/turnover levels set by them must be both justifiable and proportionate to the needs of the contract.</p></reply>

From the outset I have maintained that the real benefit from the rationalisation of State agencies will be a less crowded administrative landscape resulting in greater democratic accountability, less duplication of effort and clearer lines of responsibility.  As this measure was completed on an administrative basis on 1 October 2010, any potential savings from the measure would have been taken into account in the overall consideration of the 2012 Revised Estimates for the CPSA and the Office of the Ombudsman and was reflected in their respective allocations. </p><p>  Regarding the further rationalisation measures resulting from the critical review process and which are to be implemented in 2013, I refer the Deputy to PQ 51433/12 answered on Wednesday 21st November.</p></reply>

FPAs are designed to complement the broader range of evaluation tools available within the public service, including Value-for-Money &amp; Policy Reviews, and will assist in maintaining the analytical momentum that was developed during the course of the 2011 Comprehensive Review of Expenditure.  Part of the rationale for FPAs is to stimulate, and to a degree to challenge, thinking within the broader system of public administration about current issues in public policy, and as such the findings of FPAs are not intended to reflect necessarily my views as Minister or the position of Department of Public Expenditure &amp; Reform more generally.  Final decisions in particular policy areas will be made by Ministers, weighing all of the various inputs to the decision-making process.</p><p>  As set out in the recent Expenditure Report 2013, a range of FPAs are currently underway within my Department, and one of these relates to the Rural Social Scheme.  This FPA is being carried out by the Central Expenditure Evaluation Unit of my Department and I understand that it will be finalised over the coming weeks.</p><p>  This particular FPA is examining a number of core policy evaluation criteria, namely the rationale underpinning the Scheme, the continuing relevance of the objectives of the Scheme, and to a lesser extent, the effectiveness of the Scheme.  The methodology consists of review of programme documentation and previous evaluations, analysis of wider developments in related policy spheres and quantitative data analysis.</p></reply>

The programme entitled <i>Optimising Power @ Work</i> has achieved average energy savings of over 19% in 270 participating buildings/complexes.  As part of this campaign there are a number of different types of energy audits carried out in each building. </p><p>  The first audit is a preliminary energy audit.  The purpose of this is to identify any areas of energy wastage in the building which can quickly be eliminated without significant investment e.g. checking that heating system time schedules are suitable for actual building occupancy, identifying unoccupied areas where artificial lighting is left on, etc.  Some of the remedies can be implemented immediately by changing control settings, while others require low-cost capital investment e.g. installing automatic controls on lighting.  A priority list of recommendations is prepared for each building and these are implemented in order of fastest payback.  Typically a preliminary energy audit is carried out every 2 years in each building.</p><p>  A &#8220;Night-time Energy Audit&#8221; is also carried out in each building.  This is a detailed survey which identifies each component of the night-time energy consumption that is running unnecessarily, when the building is unoccupied e.g. office equipment, lighting, air conditioning, etc.  The results of these audits are presented to staff from the dedicated energy team that has been established in each building.  Staff are encouraged to &#8220;switch-off&#8221; all unnecessary equipment.  The results are monitored by analysing the corresponding reduction in the night-time energy consumption.  The savings are maintained by continually monitoring the consumption to ensure that it does not begin to return towards pre-audit levels.</p><p>  A &#8220;Building Management System (BMS) Audit&#8221; is also carried out (typically on an annual basis) in each building.  The BMS is the system that controls the heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems in the larger buildings.  Each BMS is checked to ensure that the time-schedules, set points and other control settings are correct and appropriate for the occupancy profile in each building.  Where anomalies are identified, these are brought to the attention of the energy team and alterations are made.</p><p>  Comprehensive Energy Audits are carried out on targeted buildings.  These buildings are selected on the basis of unsatisfactory annual energy performance when compared to similar buildings.  Typically there are 25 buildings identified for &#8220;Intensive Intervention&#8221; at any one time in the campaign. As energy performance improves the list is revised and buildings are added/removed.  In addition to the &#8220;intensive intervention&#8221; list, some larger more unusual complexes have also benefited from comprehensive energy audits.  Recently these have been carried out in the Museum buildings for example Collins Barracks, Kildare St. and Turlough Park.  These buildings have very specific requirements to maintain the environmental conditions necessary to preserve the collections.  An in-depth energy audit to ensure that they were being operated in the most efficient manner possible was carried out.  The audits identified areas for savings and these are currently being implemented.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-16a.1027.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013011600071#WRR03400"><p>The original pension terms in respect of membership of the Houses of the Oireachtas are derived from the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Act 1938.  While the terms were amended over the years, the most notable amendments took place in 1992 and these form the basis of the pension provisions - known generally as the "New Scheme" - applicable to the majority of current Oireachtas Members.  Further amendments to the terms were made for certain 'new entrant' Members as defined under the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004.  More recently, the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012 introduced a new Single Public Service Pension Scheme which applies to new Public Servants taking up appointment on or after 1 January 2013, including Members of the Oireachtas.</p><p>  The pension terms of the &quot;New Scheme&quot; provide that a former Member who has at least 2 years&rsquo; reckonable service is entitled to a pension and lump sum from age 50 at the earliest (with an option to take a reduced pension from an earlier age), except for those who are 'new entrants' under the 2004 Act to whom pension and lump sum are not payable until age 65 (i.e. those who are newly elected since 1 April 2004).  Under the scheme, a contribution rate of 6% of salary applies and maximum superannuation benefits accrue after 7,300 days' (20 years') service.  A person who accrues the maximum 20 years' service is entitled to a once-off lump of 1.5 times annual salary and to a pension of one half of annual salary.</p><p>  As mentioned above, the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012 introduced a new Single Public Service Pension Scheme which commenced on 1 January of this year.  The Single Scheme provides that new Public Servants appointed on or after that date, including Members of the Oireachtas, will be members of the Scheme and will have their pension benefits based on career average earnings as opposed to the current final salary basis.  The Scheme also provides for a new minimum pension age of 66, rising to age 67 in 2021 and age 68 in 2028 in line with changes to the age at which the State Pension (Contributory) will become payable.  A contribution rate of 13% of salary will apply to Members of the Oireachtas who are members of the Single Scheme.</p><p>  When considering the application of the Single Scheme to Members of the Oireachtas, the Government decided to legislate on the basis that the Scheme should apply only to future first-time Members.  In adopting this position, the Government took account in particular of the fact that, unlike most Public Servants, Oireachtas Members do not have security of tenure but are subject to the will of the electorate, and recognised that this requirement to be re-elected from time to time differentiates Members of the Oireachtas from the general body of Public Servants.  In this context, it was decided that a Member who was first elected or appointed to the Oireachtas before the commencement date of the Single Scheme (1 January 2013) will not be a member of that scheme in respect of any future service as an Oireachtas Member; whereas Members who are elected for the first time after 1 January 2013 will be members of the Single Scheme and subject to its terms.</p><p>  This approach is considered reasonable as those who, in future, consider putting themselves forward for election to the Oireachtas for the first time will be fully aware of the new Single Scheme terms and can take this into account when making their decision.</p></reply>

The General Scheme of the Workplace Relations Bill outlines proposals which will deliver a root-and-branch reform of the State's existing employment rights and industrial relations structures.  The current complex structure involving five bodies will be replaced with a rationalised two-tier system compromising two bodies (the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court), supported by a single shared-services administration.</td></tr><tr><td>Directive 2011/7/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 on combating late payment in commercial transactions (Recast).  </td><td>This RIA was prepared by DJEI in August, 2012.  The purpose of the Recast Directive is to combat late payment in commercial transactions, in order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, thereby fostering the competitiveness of undertakings and, in particular, of SMEs. <br />Previously the rules on late payments were under Directive 2000/35 and this new legislation repeals and modernises these old rules.<br />This Directive lays down the specific deadlines for the payment of invoices and establishes a right to compensation in the event of late payment in all commercial transactions, whether they relate to transactions between private or public undertakings, or between undertakings and public authorities.<br />This Directive came into force on 15 March 2011. Member States must transpose this Directive by 16 March 2013.</td></tr><tr><td>Microenterprise Loan Fund Bill 2012.  </td><td>This RIA was prepared by DJEI in April, 2012.  The objective of this legislation is to establish a Microenterprise Loan Fund and to provide for Social Finance Foundation to manage and control the Microenterprise Loan Fund on behalf of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. It empowers the Minister to pay monies provided by the Oireachtas into the fund and to accept gifts of moneys for allocation to the Fund. <br />The objective of the fund is to provide loans to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises, thereby facilitating job creation and retention across the economy in all<br />microenterprises with commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional<br />risk criteria applied by banks.<br />The Microenterprise Loan Fund is not intended to replace any current bank.</td></tr><tr><td>Credit Guarantee Bill 2012</td><td>This RIA was carried out in October, 2011.  The ultimate objective of this regulatory proposal is to empower the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to establish a targeted Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme.<br />The legislation will empower the Minister to give a loan guarantee, designate a lending institution as a participating lending institution, set eligibility criteria for borrowers in such lending institutions, set loan conditions, set out requirements in respect of liability of the Minister regarding payment of<br />guarantees, to require adequate monitoring arrangements and evaluation, to review and revoke the scheme and to assign a contractor to oversee the operation of the Scheme.<br /><br />The objective of the Scheme is to provide a Government guarantee to the lender of 75 per cent<br />on eligible individual loans to viable businesses, which is paid to the lender on the unrecovered outstanding balance on a loan in the event of an SME defaulting on the loan repayments. The purpose of the scheme is to encourage additional lending to SMEs, not to substitute for conventional lending. It is not a grant, nor is it support for ailing businesses. The Scheme is intended to address specific market failures that prevent bank lending to some commercially viable businesses by providing a level of guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to job-creating firms. All decision making at the level of the individual loan will be fully devolved to the participating lenders.</td></tr><tr><td>Review of the Patents Act 1992</td><td>The aim of this RIA is to examine the current legislative framework for patents in Ireland, in order to establish the key issues for deliberation, with a view to bringing proposals for legislative changes to Government for approval in due course. This RIA was published in March 2012.</td></tr><tr><td>Review of the research exemption provision in Section 42(g) of the Patents Act 1992 </td><td>The aim of this RIA is to consider whether Ireland should broaden the scope of the &#8220;Bolar&#8221; type exemption provision as set down in Section 42 (g) of the Patents Act 1992.  The &#8220;Bolar&#8221; type exemption was implemented into Irish law by means of the European Communities (Limitation of Effect of Patent) Regulations 2006 (Statutory Instrument No. 50 of 2006) which inserted a new Section 42(g) into the Patents Act 1992, on foot of an exemption provision in Article 6 of EU Directive 2004/27/EC. The RIA was completed in December 2012, and is awaiting publication.</td></tr><tr><td>Draft Industrial Development (Micro Enterprise and Small Business) Bill </td><td>The RIA was undertaken to consider options on how best to implement the Government Decision of 16 April 2012 regarding the restructuring of the existing micro enterprise support structures with a view to creating an enhanced national micro enterprise support model to be delivered through Local Enterprise Offices.<br />The RIA concluded that the proposed Bill is the appropriate way to give legal certainty to the Government Decision.</td></tr><tr><td>Companies Bill 2012</td><td>A RIA was published with the Company Law Review Group's General Scheme of the Companies Consolidation and Reform Bill in 2007.  An updated version of that RIA was published on the Department's website following publication of the Companies Bill 2012.</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Leading global corporations require a significant population, a pool of qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services. Against this backdrop, IDA Ireland has informed me that it prioritises the marketing of Gateway locations within each Region as the areas of critical mass.  In this region, IDA concentrates on the linked gateway of Athlone/Tullamore/ Mullingar.  At present there are 44 IDA client companies employing over 5,000 people in the Midlands Region. IDA Ireland has formed strong relationships with these companies, working closely with them in order to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development, broadening of their mandate and continuing re-investment in their sites. With the improved infrastructure that is now in place, a project win in one Midlands location has a positive impact on the other surrounding areas due to the close proximity of all main locations. </p><p>  In 2012 Enterprise Ireland paid &euro;1.3m to its client companies in Longford for job creation and retention and business development purposes.

The bodies under the remit of my Department that are scheduled to be rationalised, merged or abolished are set out under the Government&rsquo;s Agency Rationalisation Programme. The first three reforms listed below are on the A list of the legislation programme for this term as follows:</p><p>- Merge the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority into one single entity</p><p>- Dissolve the 35 CEB&rsquo;s and restructure small business supports through collaboration with EI and the local authorities</p><p>- Consolidate the five workplace relations bodies into   two.</p><p>Plans are at an advanced stage to:</p><p>- Transfer relevant enterprise functions from Shannon Development to IDA, EI and Bord F&aacute;ilte and merge Shannon Development with Shannon Airport Authority</p><p>- Integrate Forf&aacute;s into the Department</p><p>- Absorb the Secretariat to the National Competitiveness Council into the Department.</p><p><table><tr><th>Name of Body</th><th><div>Current Status and Future Plans</div></th><th>Staff reductions and Savings realised since changes made/March 2011</th></tr><tr><td>County and City Enterprise Boards (35)</td><td>The Government has approved the restructuring of the enterprise support model for the micro and small business sectors. This restructuring will include the dissolution of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs), the transfer of their functions, assets and liabilities to Enterprise Ireland (EI) and the development of a new Small and Micro Business Division within Enterprise Ireland (EI) as a centre of excellence in the provision of supports to the small and micro enterprise sectors, and the establishment of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) to provide a &#8220;first-stop-shop&#8221; for small businesses within Local Authorities.  The Government approved the drafting of the legislation necessary to dissolve the CEBs and transfer their functions to Enterprise Ireland and it is expected that enabling legislation will be passed before the summer recess.</td><td>It is to be expected that over time there will be savings resulting from the removal of costs associated with the individual company status of each CEB, use of shared services, reduced rental costs associated with the relocation of some offices etc. However initial direct savings will be modest as it could take some years to realise these savings due to existing leasing arrangements etc.</td></tr><tr><td>Competition Authority <br /><br />and<div></div>National Consumer Agency</td><td>The legislation to give effect to the merger of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency is currently on the A list of the Government's legislative programme. It is hoped that the legislation will be published in Q1 2013.</td><td>Initial set-up costs will be incurred.<br /><br />No savings in whole-time equivalent (WTE) numbers</td></tr><tr><td>Labour Court<br /><br />National Employment Rights Authority<br /><br />Labour Relations Commission<br /><br />Employment Appeals Tribunal<br /><br />Equality Tribunal</td><td>The process of establishing a new two-tier workplace relations structure has commenced.  A significant amount of work has been completed on the preparation of the Workplace Relations Bill which will give statutory effect to the reform proposals. The General Scheme of the Workplace Relations Bill has been approved by Government for priority drafting.  Engagement is on-going with the Attorney General&#8217;s Office and publication is expected at an early stage this year. This would enable the proposed new structures to be put in place by early 2013 with the result that two statutorily independent bodies will replace the current five. There will be a new single body of first instance to be called the Workplace Relations Commission and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court.<br />Significant progress has been made to date.  In the last year two public consultation processes were completed, two policy documents were published, a new single contact portal has replaced the five separate entry points; there are now no backlogs for Rights Commissioner hearings; a Single Complaint Form has replaced the 30 forms previously in use; a new workplace relations interim website is in place, a pilot Early Resolution Service is now seeking to resolve disputes at an early stage without the need for adjudication; responsibility for the Equality Tribunal (but not including the policy functions of the Minister for Justice and Equality concerning equality) was transferred from the Minister for Justice and Equality to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with effect from 1 January, 2013 as part of the on-going reform of the State's employment rights and industrial relations structures.  Pending the enactment of the legislation, the reforms will be progressed with further enhancements for users of the services on an administrative basis in the coming months.</td><td>The annual cost of the Workplace Relations Services amounted to some &#8364;20m in 2010. It is expected that significant savings, in terms of both reductions in staff numbers and increased efficiency and productivity, will be generated by the end of 2013 by which time the majority of the Workplace Relations Reform Programme will have been implemented. Work has commenced on identifying and capturing on-going pay and non-pay savings.</td></tr><tr><td>Forf&aacute;s</td><td>An Implementation Group, comprising senior management from the Department, Forf&aacute;s, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, is overseeing the integration project and meets on a regular basis.  An Executive style Board has also been put in place in Forf&aacute;s to oversee the transfer of the agency&#8217;s functions and responsibilities.<br /><br />Good progress is being made in identifying and resolving issues that need to be addressed.  Completion of the project will require the enactment of legislation to transfer Forf&aacute;s&#8217;s functions. </td><td>The integration of Forf&aacute;s into the Department will improve efficiencies/<br />synergies between the Department and Forf&aacute;s.<br /><br />It is envisaged that savings will arise when the integration process is complete, especially in the Corporate Services Area.</td></tr><tr><td>Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN).<br />EGFSN Members are appointed by the Minister for Education and Skills in consultation with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</td><td>A Service Level Agreement will be drawn up between DES and DJEI to agree a schedule of work to meet DES requirements.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>National Competitiveness Council (NCC)</td><td>The NCC is to be maintained, with a refreshed mandate and some changes in membership.<br /><br />Secretariat services will continue to be provided by Forf&aacute;s/Departmental staff following the integration of Forf&aacute;s into DJEI.  </td><td>There is no direct funding allocated to NCC.  The Secretariat to the NCC is currently provided by Forf&aacute;s, and will be absorbed into the Department as part of the integration of Forf&aacute;s.</td></tr><tr><td>Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser (CSA) to the Government</td><td>The Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser was included in the bodies due for critical review under the Public Sector Reform initiative. Following a Government decision on 11 October 2012 to abolish the separate Office of the CSA, the Director General of Science Foundation Ireland has taken on the role of Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government in addition to his existing role.  </td><td>The 2012 budget allocation for the Office of the CSA was &#8364;95k (this reflects 8/12 of the annual allocation as the CSA contract ceased in August 2012). </td></tr><tr><td>Advisory Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (ACSTI)</td><td>ACSTI is to be maintained, with a refreshed mandate and some changes in membership.  Secretariat services will continue to be provided by Forf&aacute;s/Departmental staff following the integration of Forf&aacute;s into DJEI.</td><td>The Secretariat to the ACSTI is currently provided by Forf&aacute;s, and will be absorbed into the Department as part of the integration of Forf&aacute;s.</td></tr><tr><td>Shannon Development</td><td>On 27 November 2012, the Government confirmed its decision in principle of 8 May 2012 to separate Shannon Airport (SA) from the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) and bring it together with Shannon Development to form a new entity with a commercial mandate in public ownership.  In accordance with the Government decision, Shannon Development&#8217;s enterprise functions are to transfer to Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland in 2013 while its tourism functions will transfer to F&aacute;ilte Ireland. The Steering Group, which had been established in 2012 to oversee full implementation of the Government&#8217;s decision in relation to the establishment of the new entity, has been reconstituted.</td><td>This is a restructuring and merger of Shannon Development and Shannon Airport.  As Shannon Development is self-financing there will be no cost saving in 2013. There will be, however, an elimination of duplication of roles between Shannon Development, Enterprise Agencies and F&aacute;ilte Ireland in the region.</td></tr><tr><td>Companies Registration Office<br /><br />and<br /><br />Office of the Registrar of Friendly Societies</td><td>These offices are &#8216;de facto&#8217; merged, operating under a common budget and with the same individual designated as Registrar of Companies and Registrar of Friendly Societies.  There are no plans to pursue a legislative amendment at this point in time.</td><td>No new savings since March 2011.  Savings prior to this date were realised due to the common administrative base.</td></tr></table></p></reply>

For employees whose work is subject to seasonality or a foreseeable surge in activity, or where employees are directly involved in ensuring continuity of service or production, the averaging period is 6 months.  The averaging period can be extended to up to 12 months for employees who have entered into a collective agreement providing for such a reference period, and provided the collective agreement is approved by the Labour Court.</p><p>  The intention of a derogation is to retain the principles set out in a directive, while allowing flexibility in their application.  The Working Time Directive provides for three<b></b>derogations from the 48-hour average working week. </p><p>  The 48-hour working week came into effect, generally, on 1 March 1998.  However, in order to provide time for adjustment for those who had been working longer hours prior to that, the Fifth Schedule to the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 provided for a transitional arrangement (which expired in February 2000) in relation to average weekly working hours for the two years following the commencement of the Act.  This arrangement provided that, in the first year following commencement of the Act, an employee could work up to an average of 60 hours a week, and in the second year an employee could work up to an average of 55 hours a week.  Certain conditions were attached to this transitional arrangement which provided that the written consent of the employee was required to agree to work these transitional hours.   Also, any such agreement had to be approved by the Labour Court.  This transitional arrangement derived from a limited application of Article 18(1)(b)(i) of the original Working Time Directive (now Article 22(1) of the consolidated Directive, i.e. Directive 2003/88/EC) which provided that an employee could voluntarily work longer than 48 hours per week.  Unlike national law, the Directive did not set an expiry date for this derogation.   </p><p>  The Directive also provides for other limited circumstances where the maximum average weekly working time of 48 hours may be derogated from.  These circumstances include where an individual controls their own working hours or where an individual is a family employee working on a farm or in a private house.  These provisions were transposed by Section 3(2)(b) and Section 3(2)(c) of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  There is no expiry provision for these particular derogations.</p><p>  Also, with regard to Doctors-in-training, amendments to the original Working Time Directive provided for a derogation which would phase-in the maximum 48-hour average working week over a transitional period of five years from 1 August 2004.  This provision was transposed into Irish legislation by Regulations promulgated by the Minister for Health by way of Statutory Instrument No. 494 of 2004 - the European Communities (Organisation of Working Time) (Activities of Doctors in Training) Regulations 2004<b></b>  (as amended).  These Regulations implemented a phased reduction from an average of 58 weekly working hours during the period 1 August 2004 to 31 July 2007, to 56 hours during the period 1 August 2007 to 31 July 2009, and to an average of 48 hours from 1 August 2009 onwards.</p></reply>

The aim of the Action Plan for Jobs is to support the creation of 100,000 net new jobs by 2016, while the objective of Pathways to Work is to ensure that as many of those jobs as possible go to those who are currently unemployed.  The Plan is a whole of Government plan with a national focus across all regions.</p><p>  The Enterprise Development agencies are at the forefront of implementing the Action Plan for Jobs across all regions and continue to ensure that enterprises can maximise their contribution to economic recovery and jobs growth.  In this regard, significant interactions by these Agencies, with companies in Co. Kerry, are being maintained on an ongoing basis.  </p><p>  Despite a very difficult domestic and external economic environment, we are beginning to see the positive impact of the Government&rsquo;s policies.  2012 saw significant net job creation by EI and IDA-supported companies, building on the positive results of 2011 and following successive years of significant net job losses.  </p><p>  Under the Programme for Government and the Action Plan for Jobs, my Department has successfully delivered on national actions, such as the establishment of the Microfinance Loan Fund and the Credit Guarantee Scheme, both of which will increase access to finance for enterprises and entrepreneurs throughout the country, including those in Co. Kerry.</p><p>  Ensuring that more micro and small businesses can start up, expand and export is a key pillar of the Government&rsquo;s plans for jobs and growth.  On 21 November 2012, I announced that primary legislation will be drafted to dissolve the existing County and City Enterprise Boards and create an enhanced national micro-enterprise support model, delivered through Local Enterprise Offices to be established in each Local Authority area. Pending the introduction of these arrangements, Kerry County Enterprise Board (CEB) continues to engage and work with existing and potential businesses on an ongoing basis.  Already in 2013, local businesses are availing of the CEB Programmes on offer. </p><p>  I am currently preparing the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government, and in that context, am exploring further measures which can be taken to transform our economy and support job creation.</p></reply>

These funds are specifically targeted at further leveraging the investments of business angels into SMEs. The EIF launched a pilot of this Scheme in Germany and has recently launched an initiative in Spain. Enterprise Ireland and the Department of Finance have met with the relevant EIF executives in November to specifically discuss this initiative and my officials and Enterprise Ireland are in the process of assessing the feasibility of working with the EIF to leverage the European Angels Fund in the Irish market. </p><p>  Enterprise Ireland and IntertradeIreland fund the HALO business angel partnership programme that is mandated to match business angels to appropriate projects which they would be interested in. HALO also works to develop business angel syndicates. Considerable effort has been put into addressing the seed and early stage funding gap indirectly through commitments to venture capital funds and directly through Enterprise Ireland's investment in 150 early stage Competitive Start Fund and High Potential Start-Up companies in 2012. A similar level of activity is forecast for 2013.  </p></reply>

The latest official figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) show that an estimated 87,100 people of all nationalities left the country in the year to April 2012.  Irish nationals accounted for 53 per cent of the total, or 46,500 people.  However, the CSO statistics also indicate that 52,700 came to Ireland in the same period, including 20,600 Irish people returning to the country.  </p><p>  The Government inherited a situation where over 300,000 jobs had been lost in the three years prior to March 2011, our banking system had all but collapsed, and we were in the middle of a world-wide economic downturn.  Previous Governments had become too dependent on a small number of sectors to support economic performance &ndash; an approach that was neither wise nor sustainable. </p><p>  This Government has set about transforming the economy, firstly by making fiscal consolidation more job friendly, including through tax changes, asset sales and the creation of a stimulus package.  Also by setting clear targets for SME lending by the Banks as well as the introduction of a Microfinance Fund and a state backed Loan Guarantee Scheme.  We have introduced the annual Action Plan for Jobs process to support employment creation by the enterprise sector, based on innovation, entrepreneurship and exporting.  We have also developed the Pathways to Work initiative to transform our engagement with those who are unemployed, including young unemployed people.</p><p>  Despite a very difficult domestic and external economic environment, we are beginning to see the positive impact of the Government&rsquo;s policies.  2012 saw significant net job creation by EI and IDA-supported companies, building on the positive results of 2011 and following successive years of significant net job losses.</p><p>  Even with continued job losses in more traditional sectors such as Construction, and Financial, Insurance and Administrative activities, we have seen an increase in employment in sectors targeted by the Action Plan for Jobs, for example Tourism Agri-food, ICT and Digital Gaming. These developments demonstrate the transformation which is taking place in the economy which had become too dependent on the Construction sector and domestic demand to support economic growth. </p><p>  By continuing the process of transforming our economy step by step through the Action Plan for Jobs, we aim to provide opportunities for those who wish to continue to live and work in Ireland. </p></reply>

The 270 actions are further broken down into Quarterly milestones.  My Department and the Enterprise Development Agencies under my remit are responsible for the delivery of approximately 2/3 of the individual milestones. Progress Reports on the delivery of all of the milestones are published at the end of each Quarter.  Details of all actions delivered to the end of the third Quarter of the year are available in these Progress Reports on my Department&#8217;s website   .</p><p>  The third Progress Report on the Action Plan for Jobs was published on 17th October 2012.  It indicated that 218 (96%) of the 227 milestones to be achieved in the first three Quarters of 2012 have been delivered to date, with nine actions outstanding.  Three of these directly involve my Department.  They relate to legislative measures covering:</p><p>-the extension of SFI&#8217;s remit to allow the agency to fund applied research, </p><p>-the proposed new structure for the employment rights institutions, and </p><p>-the publication of the Consolidated Companies Bill.     </p><p>  These pieces of legislation have been delayed for a number of reasons, including the detailed and complex nature of the legislation in question, the demand on resources in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, and the availability of time for legislative business in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I have, however, published the Consolidated Companies Bill on 21st December last, and every effort is being made to ensure that the remaining legislation is progressed as quickly as possible.</p><p>  The fourth Progress Report on the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 is due to be published shortly. </p><p>  Some significant objectives have been realised, including the establishment of a Microfinance Fund for small business, the introduction of a Partial Credit Guarantee scheme, new supports for first time exporters, the launch of a new Women-In-Business programme, the simplification and extension of the Employer&#8217;s PRSI Exemption scheme, the launch of a National Broadband Plan, the piloting of a Health Innovation Hub, and work being undertaken to develop sectors such as Cloud Computing, Digital Games, Manufacturing, and the Green Economy.</p><p>  In spite of a very difficult domestic and external economic environment, we are beginning to see the positive impact of the Government&#8217;s policies.  2012 saw significant net job creation by EI and IDA-supported companies, building on the positive results of 2011 and following successive years of significant net job losses.</p><p>  The full impact of the measures being taken under the Action Plan for Jobs will become apparent over time, but we are already seeing encouraging progress.  I am currently coordinating the preparation of the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government.  The 2013 Plan will build on the progress made last year and will set out a number of new initiatives to support job creation.  The 2013 Action Plan will be published in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The initiatives taken by the Government to restructure and re-capitalise the banking system are the principal response to making credit available, as banks will continue to be the primary and dominant supplier of finance for SMEs.</p><p>  I have taken action to address some specific market failures which will add value to the actions that Minister Noonan has taken.  I recently introduced two targeted schemes to support an additional flow of credit into the economy, namely the Microenterprise Loan Fund and the Credit Guarantee Scheme.  These new Schemes form key components in the suite of initiatives aimed at ensuring the flow of credit to SMEs to sustain employment and create new jobs.  </p><p>  In addition to these initiatives, the Innovation Fund Ireland (IFI) and Development Capital Schemes are helping Irish companies access credit in the current difficult environment.</p><p>  As part of the Action Plan for Jobs, a range of financial and non-financial supports currently available from Government Departments, Offices and Agencies were identified and formed the basis for the compilation of a new webpage and circulation leaflet.  This information was widely distributed to key stakeholders, including employers and their representative organisations.  This includes such schemes as: Revenue Job Assist, the Employers' Job PRSI Incentive Scheme, the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance and the Job Expansion Fund.  These supports provide incentives and tax relief to employers for job creation across a variety of sectors.  Updates on these, and all other commitments in the Action Plan for Jobs, are detailed in the Quarterly Progress Reports on the Plan which are available on my Department&#8217;s website, . Maintaining cost competitiveness, particularly in relation to staff costs will be a key element in maintaining economic competitiveness for the foreseeable future. The Action Plan for Jobs 2013, which will be published shortly, will continue to address this key issue.</p></reply>

The telephone number for Dublin City Enterprise Board is (01) 635 1144 and further information about Dublin City Enterprise Board can be found on . Information and contact details on all the CEBS can be found on   .  CEBs provide both financial and/or non-financial assistance to business.</p><p>  In October 2012, I established the Microfinance Loan Fund to improve access to credit for entrepreneurs and micro-enterprises and to facilitate the growth and expansion of viable businesses from all industry sectors which have been refused access to credit by banks. The Fund has a significant entrepreneurship focus. It will add value to other Government schemes of support for entrepreneurs and unemployed persons, such as the Back to Work Allowance or the Seed Capital Scheme. </p><p>  The Fund will provide support in the form of loans of up to &#8364;25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people, with viable business propositions, that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks. The potential viability of the business proposal will be the dominant factor in all credit decisions. Applications should be channelled through the City and County Enterprise Boards, which in this case would be the Dublin City Enterprise Board. </p><p>  Further supports could include the Seed Capital Scheme (SCS), in conjunction with its associated scheme, the Employment and Investment Incentive Scheme (EIIS), which are tax relief incentive schemes. The EIIS provides tax relief for investment in certain corporate trades, while the SCS provides for a refund of tax already<i></i>  paid by an individual, when that individual sets up, and takes employment in, a new qualifying business.   An employee, an unemployed person or person made redundant recently, interested in starting their own business, may be entitled to avail of the tax refund available under the Seed Capital Scheme. Further information can be obtained from the Revenue Commissioners website www.revenue.ie</p><p>  Finally in respect of supports for new businesses Enterprise Ireland operates a Seed and Venture Capital Scheme to assist business grow and develop. The Seed and Venture Capital Scheme 2013-2017 was announced as part of the recent Budget. This will enable Enterprise Ireland to make commitments totalling &#8364;175 million to business during the operation of the scheme. This is expected to leverage a further &#8364;525 million in private sector funding. The scheme is currently being finalised and a further announcement of the details is expected shortly. In addition, Enterprise Ireland and IntertradeIreland fund the HALO business angel partnership programme that is mandated to match business angels to appropriate projects which they would be interested in. HALO also works to develop business angel syndicates.</p></reply>

Leading global corporations require a significant population, a pool of qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services. Against this backdrop, IDA Ireland has informed me that it prioritises the marketing of Gateway locations within each Region as the areas of critical mass.  Longford is marketed as part of the Midland Region together with Laois, Offaly Westmeath and Roscommon.  In this region, IDA concentrates on the linked gateway of Athlone/Tullamore/ Mullingar.  The Agency also promotes the towns of Longford, Portlaoise and Roscommon as part of its wider marketing efforts and in response to specific client requirements.  </p><p>  At present there are 44 IDA client companies employing over 5,000 people in the Midlands Region. IDA Ireland has formed strong relationships with these companies, working closely with them in order to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development, broadening of their mandate and continuing re-investment in their sites. With the improved infrastructure that is now in place, a project win in one Midlands location has a positive impact on the other surrounding areas due to the close proximity of all main locations. </p><p>  In 2012 Enterprise Ireland paid &euro;1.3m to its client companies in Longford for job creation and retention and business development purposes.  On 31 October last my colleague, Mr John Perry, T.D, Minister for Small Business, launched the new Enterprise Ireland &euro;200,000 Competitive Feasibility Fund aimed at stimulating start ups and creating jobs and growth in the Midlands Region (Counties Laois, Longford, Offaly and Westmeath).  This fund, which provides up to &euro;25,000 per project, was open until 20th   November 2012. 31 companies/individuals applied for the Competitive Feasibility Fund, 28 were eligible and 9 were approved for funding, of which 2 were from County Longford.  </p><p>  Both IDA and Enterprise Ireland are represented on the Longford County Development Board. </p></reply>

Receivers, examiners, liquidators and company creditors may make these applications to the Court where a company is in examinership or is being wound up. </p><p>  Reluctance on the part of persons to cooperate with investigations in relation to certain offences was addressed as part of the Criminal Justice Act 2011. Pursuant to section 15 of that Act and for the purposes of the investigation of a relevant offence, a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may apply to a judge of the District Court for an order requiring, the making available by a person of any particular documents or the provision by a person of particular information by answering questions or making a statement containing the information or both. Failure to comply with such an order is an offence. </p><p>  More generally the Companies Bill 2012, which has recently been published, contains a number of measures to strengthen company law compliance, including:</p><p>- The classification of the majority of offences according to a four-tier scheme. The maximum penalty under this scheme in relation to a prosecution on indictment is a fine of not more than &euro;500,000 or up to 10 years in prison or both.</p><p>- A directors&rsquo; compliance statement which will apply to all PLCs (except investment companies) and to all other large limited companies with a balance sheet total exceeding &euro;12,500,000 and a turnover exceeding &euro;25,000,000. Directors of such companies will be obliged to make an annual statement in their Directors&rsquo; Report, acknowledging that they are responsible for securing the company&rsquo;s compliance with its &ldquo;relevant obligations&rdquo; and confirming that certain things have been done or, if they have not been done, explaining why they have not been done. &ldquo;Relevant obligations&rdquo; means an obligation under tax law, or where failure to comply would constitute certain offences under the Bill, or certain Market Abuse or Prospectus offences. The failure to include a compliance statement in the Directors&rsquo; Report of an affected company is an offence under the Bill.</p></reply>

The key elements of this package are to add an additional 2,500 places to JobBridge; 2,000 places on community employment; 2,500 to T&uacute;s &ndash; the community work placement initiative - and the development of a new initiative with local authorities to provide 3,000 opportunities in 2013.  This is in line with the commitments set out in the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work.  </p><p>  The design of the local authority initiative and the nature of work to be undertaken will require consultation with a range of stakeholders, including those bodies responsible for the delivery of other schemes funded by the Department of Social Protection.

All debts currently owing to the Department, as a result of benefits received in excess of entitlement, are repayable in full.  The Department does not apply interest or penalties on the amounts owing.  Debt holders should be aware that a Departmental debt will remain on their records until fully recovered.  This may result in a reduction of future entitlements up to and including State Pension.  Furthermore, following the death of a customer who owns a debt, the Department has a claim on any estate remaining. </p><p>  There is no maximum limit to the amount that can be recovered from a person&rsquo;s weekly social welfare payment with their consent.   However, in accordance with provisions contained in the Social Welfare Act 2012, up to 15% of the weekly personal rate payable may be deducted in respect of an overpayment without the customer&rsquo;s consent.  This provision will be commenced in the next few weeks.</p><p>  In general, the rate a debt is recovered at differs from case to case and when determining the rate of recovery consideration is given to the following issues:</p><p>  -	getting repayment of the debt as soon as possible;  </p><p>  -	not causing undue hardship to the person; and  </p><p>  -	any case made by the person regarding the circumstances giving rise to the debt.</p></reply>

These comments related to a particular case which was dealt with locally.  </p><p>  There are no specific exemptions to qualification for rent supplement for persons with disabilities, with all customers being treated equally. Entitlement to rent supplement is subject to a number of qualifying conditions, one of which is that, at the time of application for a rent supplement, a claimant must:<blockquote>-  have been residing in private rented accommodation, accommodation for homeless persons or in an institution for 6 months within the preceding 12 months of the date of claim, or <br /><br />-  have had an assessment of housing need carried out within the 12 months preceding the date of claim and have been deemed by a housing authority to be eligible for and in need of social housing support.</blockquote>  Rent supplement is payable where a person has left institutional care and satisfies the conditions of the scheme. If the person concerned requires specialised housing due to the nature of their condition, Department officials are empowered to pay rent supplement in excess of the prescribed rent limits, thereby fully supporting independent living. </p><p>  The most appropriate means for meeting the long-term accommodation needs of customers is through the provision of services by housing authorities.  In March 2012, the Government approved in principle to transfer responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long-term housing need from this Department, currently provided through rent supplement, to housing authorities using a new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). A multi-agency steering group has been established to develop proposals to give effect to this transfer. It is planned that pilot testing of HAP arrangements will commence during the second half of 2013 with general roll-out and commencement of transfers from January 2014.</p></reply>

This means-tested payment is similar to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme, on which it is based.

Increasing the amount of means from self-employment, which is assessed against the claimant from 85% to 100%; and</p><p>  b.

In general terms, the task of financing increased pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the population as demographic projections indicate the ratio of working age to pensioners will decrease from 5.3/1 at present to 2.1/1 by 2060.  Life expectancy in Ireland is increasing &ndash; in the mid 1990s, life expectancy for males was 73 and for females 78.5.  In 2041, it will be 86.5 and 88.3 respectively.  Whilst increasing life expectancy is a very welcome development, it also presents very real and obvious public policy challenges. </p><p>  Most recent figures indicate that approximately half of workers aged between 20 and 69 years have a private pension and this figure may have decreased as a result of the difficult economic environment.  The fact that private pension coverage continues to be relatively low is of major concern to the Government.  </p><p>  The overall objective of the pension system in Ireland is to provide an adequate and sustainable basic standard of living through direct State supports and to encourage people (through generous tax reliefs) to make supplementary pension provision so that they may have an adequate income replacement rates when they retire from work.</p><p>  The State already provides a funding mechanism to secure a basic income for all contributors through the PRSI system and the payment of the State pension.  The State pension will continue to be the bedrock of our pension system and we have introduced a number of reforms in order to increase the sustainability of the system into the future so that we can continue to maintain the value of the State pension.   </p><p>  While the State pension is expected to provide sufficient retirement income for the lowest paid workers, many people retiring from work will have a significant income gap if they do not have supplementary private pension provision.    Therefore, increasing supplementary pension coverage, particular amongst the lower paid and those with gaps in their employment, is a priority for the Government.  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to reforming the pension system to progressively achieve universal coverage, with particular focus on lower-paid workers.  A soft-mandatory approach such as that envisaged by an auto-enrolment scheme, using scale to achieve greater cost efficiencies for the member, is a very proactive way in which we can increase supplementary pension coverage, though it is recognised that introduction of such an initiative would be best supported by a more favourable economic environment than is currently the case.</p><p>  In relation to Ireland&rsquo;s pensions system, recent discussions on pension policy identified the need for a short and focussed examination on the direction of long term policy to ensure a modern, sustainable, and adequate pension system taking into account the impact of the economic downturn.  In this regard, the OECD was commissioned by the Department of Social Protection to review long term pension policy in Ireland and this will include consideration of an auto enrolment system.  I am expecting the final report from the OECD in the first quarter of this year and I will be bringing this to Government for decision.</p></reply>

From Monday 3 September 2012, one team concentrates on dealing with new claim intake and processes these without delay and the other team is working on the backlog which is ring-fenced with a clear and targeted plan for its elimination.

The OECD, who I have commissioned to carry out a review of pensions policy in Ireland, has not yet submitted a report to me. Work on the OECD report is ongoing and I expect to receive the report in the near future.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  My Department recently published the third actuarial review (Review) of the Social Insurance Fund (Fund) which informs both short to medium term and long term policy development in relation to the social insurance system generally. The main social insurance benefits paid by the Fund relate to retirement, illness, incapacity, unemployment, maternity and bereavement.  It is funded by PRSI contributions from employees, employers and the self-employed, with a subvention from the Exchequer where there is a gap between income and expenditure.  </font><font color="#2F2F2F">The Review covers a 55 year period from 2011&#8211;2066.</font></p><p>  With regard to pensions, the Review indicates that taking recent and planned changes to pension eligibility into consideration, 14% of claimants will not receive a contributory pension.  Recent changes introduced include future changes to State pension age, a minimum total paid contributions requirement and adjustments to pension rate bands.  The 14% figure also applies in 2020, when a total contributions approach, rather than an averaging approach will be taken to calculating State contributory pension entitlement. Those who do not qualify and who have an income need may qualify for a means-tested non-contributory pension.</p><p>  The recent changes to pension eligibility are reform measures to ensure the sustainability of the pension system.   Attachment to the workforce is a key issue for the sustainability of pensions.  Those who pay more into the Fund will be awarded a higher pension in retirement. </p><p>  The Review confirms that benefits offer excellent value for money for those on the lower part of the income distribution, those with shorter contribution histories, and the self-employed.  The social solidarity principle which underlies the Fund is reflected in the fact that, for those at the higher end of the income distribution, the Fund is redistributive and they generally get back less than they pay in. Those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories will continue to obtain the best value for money from the Fund.  This is because the negative impact of these changes continues to be outweighed by the lower contributions paid into the Fund in respect of these workers.    The Review also looked at the value for money provided by the Fund on a range of individual scenarios and found that:</p><p>- Those on lower incomes fare considerably better than those on higher incomes.</p><p>- Those with dependants achieve better value for money (when assessing value for money on an individual rather than on a per household basis).</p><p>- Those with short contribution histories have the potential to fare better than those with full contribution histories, which is particularly helpful for women who take time out of the workforce for caring purposes.</p><p>-The Fund provides better value to female than to male contributors.</p><p>-The self-employed achieve very good value for money compared with the employed &#8211; when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.</p><p>-For those at the higher end of the income distribution, the Fund is redistributive and these individuals generally get back less than they pay in. </p><p>-Higher value for money is achieved where benefits in addition to the State pension (contributory) are accessed.</p></reply>

To date 7,305 people have completed or are currently on work placements.  This figure includes supervisory/team leader positions.  As a relatively new initiative, T&uacute;s continues to be monitored and developed and to date has proven to be effective in meeting its objectives.  As part of the 2013 budget package for my Department, the number of placements available on T&uacute;s is being extended by a further 2,400 placements during the coming year with associated provision for supervision.</p><p>  A person cannot apply to participate on T&uacute;s.  All selection is undertaken by random processes conducted at local level by the Department of Social Protection.  The selection is focused on those on the live register for a year or more and in receipt of a jobseekers&rsquo; payment.  I consider the current selection process effective and I have no proposals to alter these arrangements.

This new one-stop shop service integrates employment and income supports and provides for a streamlined and personalized service to clients in accessing job opportunities and availing of supports to enable them to get back to work at the earliest possible opportunity.</p><p>  An Taoiseach, Enda Kenny formally launched the new service in Sligo on the 15<sup>th</sup> of October 2012.  At the same time the service was also made available in three other trial locations: Kings Inn/Parnell Street, Tallaght and Arklow and since then the model has been rolled out to six other locations. Work will continue throughout 2013 on the roll out of Intreo services to c 20 other locations and the full Intreo service will be available in all of the Department&#8217;s offices nationwide by the end of 2014.</p><p>  The Intreo service provides for more regular and ongoing engagement, and greater targeting of activation places and opportunities for jobseekers.  By 31<sup>st</sup>   October 2012, c130,000 initial guidance interviews  and over 118,000 follow up meetings were conducted.</p><p>  Through the Department&#8217;s new profiling model each new<font color="#FF0000"> </font>  client&#8217;s job readiness and probability of exit (PEX) from the live register is assessed. Clients who are most likely to become long-term unemployed are given targeted support and are placed on appropriate training and personal development programmes and work experiences. The profiling system enables us to identify these clients at the earliest possible opportunity, as soon as they engage with the service, and to provide immediate targeted interventions.  Over 41,000 profiles had been conducted by the end of October 2012, and services are then provided in line with the client&#8217;s needs and progression plan.</p><p>  As a measure of the Government&#8217;s commitment to providing supports for those who are unemployed, an allocation of an additional &#8364;11 million was announced in the recent budget for employment programmes representing an additional 10,000 places.</p><p>  In parallel with the development of an integrated service for jobseekers, the Department is increasing its engagement with employers.  A dedicated Employer Engagement Unit has been established and an Employer Engagement Manager is available in each region to support and advise employers at each stage of the employment process including the advertisement of opportunities and sourcing potential candidates from the Live Register. During Autumn 2012, a series employer briefings were held to provide employers with practical advice and assistance on the full range of employment and financial supports available from the Department.  </p><p>  Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, a key objective of labour market policy is to keep those on the Live Register close to the Labour Market.  The new Intreo service is designed to fulfil this objective.  It is aimed at ensuring that the individual needs of each client are assessed and provided for. Each client receives appropriate supports related to their individual needs and the needs of industry, thus enabling them to remain job ready and motivated to take up employment as soon as the opportunity arises.  </p></reply>

Participants are engaged for 19&frac12; hours per week to provide certain services of benefit to rural communities.  The scheme currently provides work opportunities for around 2,600 participants and 130 supervisory staff.  The funds allocated for 2013 amount to &euro;45m.  This level of funding will allow the scheme to continue along the same lines as in previous years but does not allow for the recruitment above the numbers stated above.  </p><p>  The Department of Social Protection has just published A Review of Social Employment Schemes. The Review seeks to assess the effectiveness of a range of schemes, including the rural social scheme in supporting the Department&rsquo;s activation role. The review questions the effectiveness of the rural social scheme in terms of labour market activation and raises the prospect of its transfer to another Department.</p><p>  Whilst I have no immediate proposals to alter the scheme I can advise that the recommendations made in the Review will be discussed at a stake-holders conference in February and that the feedback from that conference will be considered when the scheme is reviewed. In overall terms all schemes are being considered in the context of labour market activation and community support in order to determine their primary objective and to ensure that schemes are aligned, merged or replaced as appropriate.</p></reply>

However, their participation is a matter for those bodies themselves.</p><p>  The interim evaluation of JobBridge by Indecon International Economic Consultants (published on 5<sup>th</sup> October, 2012) states that 52.3% of JobBridge finishers progressed into employment with either their host organisation or another employer since finishing their internship.  These progression rates compare favourably with European averages in this area. Given that, in the past, some labour market programmes have been seen as having insignificant or even negative impacts on employment probabilities, this suggests JobBridge is an appropriate labour market intervention.</p><p>  Further information on outcomes will be ascertained as a result of the ongoing formal evaluation of JobBridge. It is anticipated that the final Report will be available in the coming weeks. This evaluation will assess the design, delivery and impact of the JobBridge Scheme, it will provide details of the nature of the work experience of the participants; a measurement of the relevance of that experience to the labour market, analysis of age categories and further findings concerning progression into employment. It will also present recommendations on how the Scheme might be improved.  It is at this stage that further consideration will be given to amending the terms and conditions of the Scheme.

However, special arrangements do apply where a parent is working here and the children are resident in another EU Member State. </p><p>  The social security rights of people living and working in the EU are governed by EU regulations which co-ordinate social security systems and are designed to ensure that people are not disadvantaged by moving within the EU to take up work.</p><p>  For the purposes of the EU regulations, Irish child benefit is classified as a family benefit and there are specific rules governing the payment of these benefits. EU nationals who come to work in Ireland but whose families reside in another EU Member State may have an entitlement to family benefits in Ireland under the EU regulations. As a Member State of the European Union, Ireland is bound to apply these regulations in accordance with the objective of the EC Treaty regarding free movement of persons.</p><p>  Before payment is made in respect of children resident in other EU countries it is necessary to contact the authorities in the country of residence of the children to confirm details and establish what, if any, family benefits are payable in the home country as this will impact on any entitlement under the Irish system. Once payment has commenced, as part of the Department&rsquo;s on-going control programme, these customers are required to confirm periodically their continued entitlement to benefit.  Where questions arise in relation to entitlement, or there is a delay in responding to enquiries from the Department, payment is suspended pending investigation.</p><p>  Changes to EU legislation to modify child benefit entitlements in respect of non-resident children requires the agreement of the EU Commission as any proposals for amendments must be tabled by it. I have raised the issue with the Commission and with relevant Ministers from other EU countries. The Commission stressed the importance attached to the system of coordinating social security for the role it plays in encouraging and facilitating free movement of people across the Union and indicated extreme reluctance to introduce changes along the lines that have been discussed in this country because they would discriminate against migrant workers and would not be in line with judgements of the Court of Justice of the European Union in this area.</p><p>  In 2012 the total cost of paying child benefit in respect of children resident in other EU countries was approximately &euro;13 million, down some 36% on 2008 when such costs peaked.</p></reply>

These include the on-going need to address the deficit in the social insurance fund from which illness benefit, amongst other insurance-based benefits and pensions, is paid.  There is also an imperative to limit progression from short-term illness to long-term illness or disability as well as to incentivise the active management of absenteeism and to contribute more broadly to the enhancement of the health of workforce.   </p><p>  I am pleased to say that the Government has already taken some actions to address these policy issues. </p><p>  Insofar as the social insurance fund is concerned, I introduced measures in Budget 2013 which are designed to increase the income to the Fund.  From January 2013, the Employee's PRSI-Free Allowance of &euro;127 per week (for those paying PRSI Class A, E and H) and &euro;26 per week (for those paying PRSI Class B, C and D) has been abolished. Employees who earn &euro;352 or less per week continue to have no liability to make a PRSI contribution and are not affected by the abolition of the weekly PRSI-Free Allowance.</p><p>  In addition, the exemption from PRSI in respect of self-employed earned income (from a profession or trade) and any other unearned income e.g. rental income available to employees who pay PRSI at Classes B, C and D (a minority of the civil and public sector) is being abolished and all such income will now become liable to PRSI at the rate of 4%. The minimum annual PRSI contribution for people with annual self-employed income over &euro;5,000 is being increased from &euro;253 per annum to &euro;500 per annum.</p><p>  More widely, the Deputy will be aware of the reforms to the sick-pay arrangements which have been introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and which will have a positive effect on absenteeism rates in the public sector.</p><p>  On a general note, I can assure the Deputy that ongoing reforms of the social welfare system will continue to be introduced in ways which are sensitive to the pressures facing employees and employers and against the wider economic background which requires that overall spending on social welfare programmes is reduced while ensuring that the most vulnerable sectors of society are protected.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-16a.1277.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013011600071#WRV02100"><p>I am aware that the reduction in the respite care grant is very difficult for carers.  However, in order to allow us to protect the core weekly payments which people receive such as pensions, disability and carer&rsquo;s allowance, the Government had to look very carefully at other additional payments, such as the respite care grant. I have no plans to introduce additional financial aid in respect of respite costs.   </p><p>  Carers receive significant income supports from the Department, among the highest rates of income support in Europe. Carers receive additional support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care), and the annual respite care grant in respect of each person for whom they care.  If a person is getting certain qualifying social welfare payments and also providing full time care and attention to another person, they can keep their main social welfare payment and get the half-rate carer's allowance as well. They can also receive an extra half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance if they care for more than one person.  </p><p>  The income disregard and means test for carers is the most generous within the social welfare system.  A couple under 66 with two children, earning a joint annual income of up to &euro;35,400 can qualify for maximum payment carer&rsquo;s allowance which such a couple earning &euro;59,300 will still qualify for the minimum rate.  </p><p>  Expenditure on carers has increased significantly in recent years.  The estimated expenditure on carers in 2012 was over &euro;771 million:  &euro;509 million on carer&rsquo;s allowance, &euro;24 million on carer&rsquo;s benefit, &euro;135 million on the respite care grant and &euro;103 on domiciliary care allowance. This represents an increase of almost &euro;20 million on expenditure in 2011. There are almost 52,000 people in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance. Of these, over 23,000 are getting half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance in addition to another social welfare payment at an annual cost of some &euro;90 million. There are over 1,600 people in receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit.  The numbers in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s allowance payment from the Department have increased by more than 150% in the last 10 years from 20,000 in 2001 to 52,000 in 2012. Expenditure on the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme has increased by almost 220% in the same period.</p><p>  The respite care grant is paid to approximately 70,000 people each year, with some 5,000 people in receipt of more than one grant as they care for more than one person.  This includes people who are in receipt of the carer&rsquo;s allowance, the domiciliary care allowance (DCA) and carer&rsquo;s benefit.  Persons who are in receipt of both DCA and carer&rsquo;s allowance receive one respite payment.  In addition, some 5,000 carers not in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s payment receive the grant.  </p><p>  The rate of the respite care grant has also increased significantly in the last ten years from &euro;635 in 2002 to &euro;1,700 in 2012. Expenditure on the grant has increased by 290% since 2005 from &euro;34.3 million to &euro;135 million in 2012.</p><p>  While the respite care grant is an important income support for carers, respite services are provided by the HSE, not through income supports provided by the Department of Social Protection.  A survey carried out in 2006 indicated that the respite care grant, in the majority of cases, is not used for respite care.</p><p>  If a person getting a social welfare payment has a once-off exceptional expense which they cannot reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income, they may apply for an exceptional needs payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</p></reply>

The scheme was introduced in and took effect from 1994.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.</p><p>  The homemaker disregard will not, of itself, qualify a person for a pension.  The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied. </p><p>  The conditions for this scheme are provided for in secondary legislation each year by way of regulation.  This regulation allows for the extension of the time limit for applications. In this regard,  Statutory Instrument No. 567 of 2012 was signed by me on 21 December 2012 to extend the registration deadline for applications from people who commenced homemaking duties between 6 April 1994 and 31 December 2012  to 31 December 2013.  Therefore, the question regarding the consideration of allowing further registration of retrospective claims and the numbers of applications received before the deadline does not arise.  </p><p>  I have no plans to backdate the homemaker scheme. While my Department will keep this scheme under review, any improvements which could result in further costs for the Exchequer could only be considered in a budgetary context.</p></reply>

The Scheme provides for a maximum of two internships per individual over a combined period of 9 months (39 weeks).  This is subject to all other eligibility criteria being met.</p><p>  JobBridge is a targeted labour market activation intervention intended to <font color="#2F2F2F">assist jobseekers to break the cycle where they are unable to get a job without experience, </font>to provide those seeking employment with the opportunity to gain work experience, maintain close links with the labour market and to enhance their skills and competencies through an internship opportunity, thereby improving their prospects of securing employment in the future<font color="#2F2F2F">. The scheme gives individuals a real opportunity to gain valuable experience to bridge the gap between study and the beginning of their working lives. </font>It is has been launched in this  targeted way to ensure that it does not replace or displace the normal operation of the labour market, which is an essential element of Ireland&#8217;s economic recovery.</p><p>  The JobBridge Scheme has made very significant progress in achieving those objectives since it came into operation on the 1<sup>st</sup> July 2011. By 27<sup>th</sup> December, 2012, 13,232 internships had commenced, with 5,612 participants on an internship and 2,083 opportunities advertised on <font color="#5291EF"> </font>  as of that date.</p><p>  The interim evaluation of JobBridge by Indecon International Economic Consultants (published on 5<sup>th</sup>   October, 2012) states that 52.3% of JobBridge finishers progressed into employment with either their host organisation or another employer since finishing their internship. These progression rates compare favourably with European averages in this area. Given that, in the past, some labour market programmes have been seen as having insignificant or even negative impacts on employment probabilities, this suggests JobBridge is an appropriate labour market intervention.</p><p>  Further information on outcomes will be ascertained as a result of the ongoing formal evaluation of JobBridge. It is anticipated that the final Report will be available in the coming weeks. This evaluation will assess the design, delivery and impact of the JobBridge Scheme, it will provide details of the nature of the work experience of the participants; a measurement of the relevance of that experience to the labour market, analysis of age categories and further findings concerning progression into employment. It will also present recommendations on how the Scheme might be improved.  It is at this stage that further consideration will be given to amending the terms and conditions of the Scheme. Any such amendments to the scheme will be notified <i>via</i> the website.</p></reply>

The payment is designed to preserve the financial incentive to take-up or remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might be marginally better off in employment than on social welfare payments.</p><p>  To qualify for payment of FIS, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week. A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria. The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them or is supported by them. Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.</p><p>  The &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; eligibility criteria has been reduced significantly since the introduction of the scheme in 1984. The requirement was initially set at 30 hours per week but was progressively reduced to 19 hours per week in 1996.</p><p>  I have no immediate plans to make any significant changes to the qualifying criteria for FIS. Further reducing the &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; requirement could only be decided on in a budgetary context. More generally, I recognise that creating jobs and tackling poverty are two of the key challenges that we face. It is essential that our tax and social protection systems play their part in addressing these issues and ensure that work is worthwhile. To this end, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare with the aim of harnessing expert opinion and experience in order to address a number of specific issues. These include making cost-effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes, particularly child poverty outcomes. In this regard the Group is currently examining the issue of working age supports, which includes consideration of in-work supports such as FIS.</p></reply>

Government policy supports this aspiration through generous tax reliefs.  At present, people are generally only permitted to access their pension savings at the retirement age defined in their pension schemes.  Schemes may also have early retirement provisions from age 50 and when retirement is caused by ill-health, benefits may be paid regardless of age.  In the case of Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) and Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs), benefits may be taken at any time after age 60 and from any age in the case of ill-health.  As the purpose of pensions is to promote a secure and adequate income in retirement, there is no provision to facilitate early access to core pension savings for the purposes of providing loan security.</p><p>  The Minister for Finance announced, as part of Budget 2013, that access to 30% of Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVC&rsquo;s) on pensions will be allowed subject to a marginal tax rate of 41%.  This option to withdraw will be available for 3 years from the passing of Finance Bill 2013.  The introduction of this measure is designed to allow people, who have provided for a good retirement through a core pension but who have an immediate financial need, to access a portion of their pension pot before they retire.  There are no plans to extend this limited access option further.</p><p>  There are a number of reasons why early withdrawals of pension savings are generally not permitted, the principal one being that funds, and the associated tax relief on contributions, are designed to support people in later life to ensure they have an adequate income.  This requires that pensions must be long term vehicles based on the principle that savings will be &ldquo;locked away&rdquo; until retirement.  The issue of early access has been considered in detail by an inter-departmental ad-hoc group, chaired by the Department of Social Protection.  The group concluded that the principle of pension savings being &ldquo;locked away&rdquo; until pension age should be maintained.  The Interdepartmental Group on Mortgage Arrears also examined the issue of early access to pensions and did not recommend such an approach.</p><p>  Younger people in pension schemes are unlikely to have significant pension savings and where their pension scheme has incurred losses, as many have over the past number of years, early withdrawal of funds would mean very poor value for money.  There is no guarantee the funds could be repaid or that people could make up these losses.  Where people are close to retirement, an early withdrawal of funds could significantly diminish the pension they receive as they may not have time before retirement age to fill the gap left by such a withdrawal.  The Deputy will be aware that the Government has engaged the OECD to conduct an independent review of long term pension policy in Ireland.  I have asked the OECD to consider the issue of early access to pension savings as part of its review.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-16a.1330.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013011600071#WRW01400"><p>There were a number of targets set for the Department of Social Protection in the Jobs Action Plan.  The targets and their update are listed: </p><p>Target:- Simplify and extend the Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme, which exempts employers from liability to pay their share of PRSI for certain employees.  The scheme will be extended to cover the first 18 months of employment.</p><p>  Action:- The Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive was simplified and extended again to the end of 2012.  The exemption was increased from 12 to 18 months for eligible employers who create jobs from 1 January 2012; </p><p>Target:- Eligibility criteria for the scheme will be amended to: Allow time spent on the Work Placement Programme and JobBridge count as the qualifying period for the scheme; Allow persons on eligible payments undertake short SOLAS courses without impacting on their eligibility; Allow time spent in casual unemployment count towards the qualifying period for the scheme, where a person is progressing to a new full‐time job offered by a different employer; Allow linking periods for illness payments provided on qualifying payment immediately prior to commencement of employment.  </p><p>Action:- Eligibility criteria for the scheme were broadened in 2012 to allow time spent on Job Bridge, Work Placement Programme, Community Employment, Rural Social Scheme, T&uacute;s, Back to Education Allowance And  short F&Aacute;S training courses to count towards the qualifying period for the scheme.  </p><p>  Now, eligible persons on JobBridge and Work Placement Programmes may be employed directly from those schemes once the required 6 month qualifying period has been satisfied.  In addition, jobseekers payments paid in conjunction with periods of casual employment may count towards satisfying the 6 month qualifying period, as will breaks in jobseekers payments as a result of periods of illness during which illness benefit is paid Stats.  </p><p>  In 2012, 780 employers were awarded exemptions in respect of 1030 employees.</p><p>Target:- increased take‐up of support schemes available to employers who take on additional workers, such as Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme, by increasing employers&rsquo; awareness of the schemes through relevant Departments, agencies and business and employer representatives; we will actively monitor the take‐up of the schemes and remove any identified obstacles to increased take‐up. (Joint target with Revenue, DJEI, Enterprise agencies, employer representatives).  </p><p>Action:- As part of the launch of Intreo, the Department produced promotional material on the schemes in question.  The Minister also hosted seven employer road-shows around the country highlighting the availability and benefits of the schemes.  These events included information booths from the Department and the Revenue Commissioners and also involved employers providing personal testimonials as to the benefits of the schemes.  Around 2,000 attended these events.  The Department will continue to engage with employers and related representative bodies/groups and provide information and guidance on the full range of employment services and supports available and how these can be accessed.  </p><p>  Issue to persons who are over one year unemployed a certificate to present to employers of eligibility for Revenue Job Assist.  </p><p>Action:- Work is being undertaken by senior officials in a number of Departments to finalise a revised employer incentive initiative, to encourage employers to hire individuals that are long-term unemployed.  The proposal to issue a certificate is currently on hold pending decisions on this new initiative; </p><p>Target:- Examine the availability of affordable childcare for people on lower incomes to determine whether existing schemes could be expanded to support people to take up employment. (Joint target with D/Children &amp; Youth Affairs).  </p><p>Action: &euro;14 million from DSP savings will be allocated to DCYA to provide 6,000 school-age childcare places (i.e. part-time childcare places) on a phased basis during 2013.  The scheme will commence with a pilot in early 2013; </p><p>Target:- Ensure that labour activation programmes continue to be aimed at enhancing the employability of the unemployed, reskilling, upskilling and keeping redundant workers/unemployed persons close to the labour market and are tailored specifically to the needs of this cohort of unemployed. (Joint target with Department of Education and Skills).  </p><p>Action: MOMENTUM, a scheme for education and training interventions, is part of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs initiative and is currently being rolled out by the Department of Education.  MOMENTUM will support the provision of free education and training projects to allow 6,500 jobseekers (who are unemployed for 12 months or more) to gain skills and to access work opportunities in identified growing sectors.  MOMENTUM will provide eligible jobseekers with access to a range of quality education and training projects; Links to identified job vacancies and employers; Work placement and support; Relevant industry and NFQ (National Framework of Qualifications) Certification.  </p><p>Under the scheme, LMETF (Labour Market Education and Training Fund) funding is being utilised to provide education and training solutions nationwide to the needs of both unemployed individuals and employers within the context of four themes.  The first three themes are based on 'clusters of occupations'.  These have been chosen because there is evidence available which shows that these skills are associated with relatively good employment opportunities.  Theme 4 is dedicated to under 25s and will provide a solid foundation for them to gain employment and/or continue in further education and training that will progress them into employment.</p><p>In addition, the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) scheme run by the Department of Social Protection provides income maintenance, along with a contribution to education costs, for unemployed people returning to further or higher education, which provides a pathway to employment.  Almost 26,000 people are participating in the BTEA in the current academic year.  </p><p>Furthermore, those participating in part-time third-level programmes under the Springboard programme are also entitled retain any existing entitlement to Jobseekers Benefit/Allowance.  Provision has been made for 6,000 places in 36 institutes of technology, universities and privately-run higher education colleges.  In total, participant can choose from 220 Springboard courses.  These courses are in the expanding enterprise areas of ICT, medical devices, the green economy, pharmaceuticals, food and beverages, and international financial services.  Programmes are available in cutting edge cross-enterprise skills such as Six Sigma, lean and quality systems, international selling, languages, business start-up and entrepreneurship skills.  Courses are free, part-time, and are at certificate, degree and postgraduate level.</p><p>  With respect to job/work placement opportunities, there are a number of schemes/programmes available that are focussed on work experience, most notably JobBridge (the National Internship Scheme).  Since its launch in July 2011, the Government&rsquo;s JobBridge initiative has had over 13,000 commencements.  Those participating on this traineeship scheme retain their unemployment payment and are also paid an extra &euro;50 a week.  An interim evaluation of the scheme suggests that the scheme has been very positive for both participants and employers.</p><p>  The Department supports unemployed people who create jobs through self-employment.  Currently, about 12,000 people are being supported under the Back to Work Allowance scheme and the Short-term Enterprise Allowance scheme.  </p><p> The Department also manages a number of schemes providing temporary employment on works and services of value to the community.  There are currently 26,000 people participating on Community Employment and T&uacute;s.  As part of Budget 2013, the Government approved 10,000 new places across CE, T&Uacute;S, JobBridge and a new social employment scheme with the Local Authorities.</p></reply>

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 4.25%).</p><p>  In 2011 I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare to meet the commitment made in the Programme for Government.  The Advisory Group will, inter alia, examine and report on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.  The Advisory Group&rsquo;s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the Terms of Reference.  Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support.  The Group has been considering the issue of social insurance coverage for the self-employed and will submit its report once its examination of the various questions has been completed.</p><p>  The third Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, as at 31 December 2010, was completed by consultants KPMG in June 2012 and laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 24 August 2012.  The Review covers a 55 year period from 2011&ndash;2066 and builds on the findings of the 2000 and 2005 Actuarial Reviews of the Fund.  One of the issues examined in the 2010 Review was the long-term cost implications to the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and the break-even contributions rates required to provide invalidity pensions to the self-employed and to provide jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for self-employed workers.  The report found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), which is the benefit currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  An incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in addition to core State pension (contributory) is provided.  The average contribution rate required for the core State pension (contributory) plus jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the invalidity pension is estimated to be in the region of 17.3%.</p><p>  Any proposals to revise the social insurance system for self-employed persons by extending social insurance entitlements will have to be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of the finding of the Actuarial Review that the self-employed achieve very good value for money compared with the employed &ndash; when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.</p><p>  Self-employed workers may access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p></reply>

To this end, and in line with commitments contained in the Programme for Government, I established in June 2011 the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, with the aim of harnessing expert opinion and experience to examine a number of specific issues.  This includes making cost effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes, particularly child poverty outcomes.  The Group&#8217;s Terms of Reference and the current membership of the Group are set out in the following.</p><p>  The Group&#8217;s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the Terms of Reference.  The Group commenced its work programme by prioritising the area of family and child income supports and submitted its report to me on 28 March 2012.  Since then I have been considering the Group&#8217;s findings and have held discussions with colleagues in Government on the issues raised in the report.  I intend to formally bring this report to Cabinet later this month and thereafter publish it subject to agreement.</p><p><b>Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare - Terms of Reference</b></p><p>  1. The Government agreed the following terms of reference for the Advisory Group: </p><p>  a. To constitute a forum to which the Minister for Social Protection may refer specific issues around the income supports and tax systems so that they provide good incentives to take up work and to contribute to the reduction of poverty and child poverty in particular. In particular, the Advisory Group will examine the following specific issues and make recommendations on: i. Child and family income supports (in particular child benefit, increases for qualified children and the family income supplement); ii. Working age income supports (including unemployment payments and similar payments made by other agencies, one parent family payment, one parent family tax credit, back to work tax credit, increases for adult dependants as well as secondary benefits such as medical cards and rent and mortgage supplementary payments); iii. The appropriate unit of assessment in both the tax and social welfare codes; iv. How to address identified anomalies in the interaction of tax and social welfare codes.</p><p>  b. To examine and report on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable;</p><p>  c. To examine and report upon how to improve interaction between the tax, social welfare systems and other supports so as to improve the operation of both in a cost-effective way and in the delivery of positive social and economic outcomes; </p><p>  d. To examine and report upon any other issue that may be referred to the Group by the Minister for Social Protection following consultation with the Ministers of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and the agreement of the Minister for Finance on taxation matters.</p><p>  It is intended that the Advisory Group should consider any proposals for change to existing arrangements in a cost-neutral or cost-reducing context<i>.</i>  2. Following Budget 2012, the Minister for Social Protection, Joan Burton T.D. refers the following additional terms of reference to the Advisory Group: a. To examine and report on the policy objectives underpinning the Budget 2012 proposals regarding: i. Changes in the eligibility criteria and rates of payment for Disability Allowance (DA); ii. The increase in the age threshold for payment of Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA); b. To assess the effectiveness of the Budget 2012 proposals in delivering on the policy objectives taking account, inter alia, the ease of implementation and the timing/phasing of implementation; and c. To consider alternative ways as to how the policy objectives might be achieved.</p><p><b>Current Membership of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare </b></p><p>  Ita Mangan, Chairman of the Advisory Group</p><p>  John Bohan, Department of Social Protection</p><p>  Miche&aacute;l Collins, Nevin Economic Research Institute</p><p>  John Conlon, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform</p><p>  Gerry Harrahill, Office of the Revenue Commissioners</p><p>  Catherine Hazlett, Department of Children and Youth Affairs</p><p>  Paul Kealy, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</p><p>  Pat Mahon, Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC)</p><p>  Geralyn McGarry, Citizens Information Board</p><p>  Aebhric McGibney, Dublin Chamber of Commerce</p><p>  Brenda McVeigh, Department of Finance</p><p>  Mary P.

I am happy that the actions they are taking will achieve this.</p><p>  The number of applications awaiting decision for carer's allowance at the end of December 2012 was approx. 8,550.  The number of applications which were awaiting decision in mid-June 2012 was 11,600.  Following the completion of a major service delivery modernisation project, an in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project was completed for the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme.  This project focused on optimising output and customer service and the reduction of backlogs.  The outcome of the review is the division of work into two streams.  From Monday 3 September 2012, one team concentrates on dealing with new claim intake and processes these without delay and the other team is working on the backlog which is ring-fenced with a clear and targeted plan for its elimination.  Additional resources have been  allocation to this task and the claim clearance plan is continually monitored in order that the backlog is eliminated in the shortest possible timeframe.</p><p>  With regard to family income supplement claims (FIS), at the end of December 2012 there were 7,360 new FIS applications and 3,391 renewal applications awaiting approval. FIS claims, both new and renewal, received on or after the 5th November 2012 are currently being processed without delay.  An in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project has recently been completed for the FIS scheme.  The outcome of this review is a detailed plan outlining the process required to manage both the continuous weekly intake and backlog claims clearance.  This plan sees the current weekly new claim and renewal intake processed by one team, while the backlog is ring-fenced and a focused team assigned to this work with a clear plan for its elimination by end of Q1.  Claims which are approved by the backlog team will be backdated to the date of claim or the date of expiry of the previous claim, as appropriate, and all arrears due will be paid.</p><p>  The issue of publishing all appeal decisions was the subject of recent High Court case Ikraam Jama v Minister for Social Protection 11 October 2011 seeking that the Social Welfare Appeals Office would publish decisions, suitably anonymised, for the purpose of assisting appellants and their representatives in making an appeal.  The Judge in that case found that there was no duty on the SWAO to maintain a database for public access.</p><p>  In the course of that challenge, comparisons were drawn with the Social Security Commissioners in Northern Ireland, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and the Equality Tribunal who do publish their decisions.  In 2010, the Social Security Commissioners in Northern Ireland finalised 141 decisions, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal finalised 2,783 and the Equality Tribunal finalised 322 whereas the Social Welfare Appeals Office finalised 28,166 decisions in the same period.  It is this very issue of scale that would make the provision of such a database a vast undertaking requiring the allocation of significant resources.  The Chief Appeals Officer publishes a number of case studies in her annual report which serve to clarify the process by which appeals are determined.</p></reply>

The medical evidence provided by the claimant in support of his claim was examined by a medical assessor who was of the opinion, based on the evidence provided, that the person concerned is not eligible for invalidity pension as he does not satisfy the medical criteria.  The application for invalidity pension was disallowed by a deciding officer.

The principal conditions for receipt of the allowance are that full-time care and attention is required and being provided, that the means test which applies is satisfied and that the applicant is habitually resident in the State.</p><p>  The application form for carer&rsquo;s allowance includes a section concerning the requirement of the care recipient for full time care and attention, this part must be certified by the care recipient&rsquo;s treating physician, normally their G.P.  The application form also requests information from the applicant in respect of all of the other conditions.  If any information is omitted or is unclear, a deciding officer may request supplementary information from the applicant or may forward the file to a social welfare inspector for further investigation.  Once the supplementary information is provided or the inspector returns a report and on completion of all the necessary investigation, a deciding officer will make an overall decision on the applicant&rsquo;s eligibility for carer&rsquo;s allowance.</p><p>  For the carers allowance scheme, a programme of control reviews is carried out annually to ensure on-going entitlement.  Customers are selected for review according to the risk of their circumstances changing, either in terms of medical eligibility, changes in their means or other changes of circumstances that may affect their entitlement.  In addition, reviews are also undertaken arising from various data matching exercises carried out where the Department&rsquo;s data is compared to relevant data held by, for example, Revenue, the Private Rental Tenancies Board and the General Registrar&rsquo;s Office.  Control reviews are also carried out, as appropriate, in response to anonymous reports received from the public.  In 2012, over 19,000 reviews were carried out on carer&rsquo;s allowance cases.</p></reply>

However consideration of what issues might need to be addressed around the taxation of social protection benefits do arise from time of time.  For example, general issues arising for the social protection system around taxation of benefits were considered by my Department as part of its submission to the Commission on Taxation.  Furthermore, issues arising from any decision to tax child benefit are considered by my Department such as in its policy and value for money review of child income support payments, published in 2010, and as part of its support to the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, whose report in this area is currently under consideration.  It is not possible to quantify Departmental resources used in this way.</p><p>  If the Government decided in principle to tax child benefit, there is a number of policy, legislative and administrative issues that would have to be addressed.  While the nature of these issues would depend on the precise nature of any proposals to tax payments, these issues could include for instance the appropriate calculation of family income, the treatment of married and co-habiting couples and the potential for disincentive effects for income earners as it would add to reduce the return from higher earnings.  In the absence of a more specific decision to progress on these lines, my Department has not addressed these specific issues in detail.</p><p>  The Department has effective ICT systems in place to support inter-system communications with the Revenue Commissioners and has been exchanging data with Revenue for over 30 years in order to deliver welfare services and support tax collection.  There may be some small amendments required to facilitate an additional data type being exchanged, but costs, if any would be minimum.</p></reply>

To qualify for payment of FIS a person must be engaged in full time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria.  The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them or is part of a family supported by them.  Furthermore the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.</p><p>  Section 247(7) the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005, provides for the withdrawal of FIS after 6 weeks where a person is in receipt of illness benefit or injury benefit.  Accordingly a person receiving FIS who is temporarily off work through illness can claim illness or injury benefit in addition to their FIS payment for a period of 6 weeks.  After 6 weeks continuous absence payment of FIS is suspended until the person returns to work and ceases claiming illness or injury benefit.</p><p>  The short term income support payments available to people absent from work due to illness or injury are illness benefit or injury benefit.  People absent from work for longer periods due to illness or injury and who satisfy the qualifying conditions can avail of income support through the invalidity pension or disability allowance schemes.  Increases for qualified adults and qualified children can be claimed with all of these payments as appropriate to the person&rsquo;s circumstances.</p></reply>

They are intended as an income support for the carer and not to supplement the cost of care.  In many cases the care recipient will be in receipt of an income support payment in their own right, for example disability allowance or a State pension.</p><p>  Home help supports, respite and other services are provided by the HSE.  The individual need for these supports will vary depending on the condition of the care recipient.  The fact that a carer is in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit does not preclude the person being cared for from receiving supports from the HSE.</p><p>  A person who is caring for someone on a full-time basis with a serious illness or severe mental or physical disability may not be in a position to provide for all the care needs of this person on a round the clock basis.  They may need additional support by way of a home help sometimes for just a few hours a week to do their weekly shopping for example or attend personal appointments, including providing for their own medical welfare.  In addition, a person in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance may work for up to fifteen hours per week outside the home.  I would be concerned at any suggestion that a person be automatically disbarred from receiving home help support purely on the basis that a carer was in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Officials in my Department have regular consultation with their colleagues in the Department of Health and the HSE on matters of concern for carers and the full range of supports for carers from the two Departments.</p></reply>

Both carer&rsquo;s allowance and invalidity pension scheme areas report that no significant delays are occurring in this work at present and that the matter is kept under close review.  In the disability allowance scheme area, the time taken to put successful appeals into payment has increased recently.  Measures are being taken to ensure that this is addresses.</p><p>  Regarding your question concerning the time lapse between an opinion being received from a medical assessor regarding the medical eligibility of a claim and a claim being approved, this is directly related to claim processing times generally within the scheme areas.</p><p>  The Department is undergoing a major service delivery modernisation programme to improve the way it delivers it service to customers and to help it to deal with the significant increase in the number of applications for schemes being received in recent years.  The years 2011 and 2012 saw the roll-out of new service delivery systems in the long-term illness schemes i.e. invalidity pension (IP), carer&rsquo;s allowance (CA) and disability allowance (DA).  Following the deployment of the new system, an in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project was initiated in each of the schemes, aimed at providing capacity to deal with weekly intake of applications, eliminate backlogs and ensure that the optimum efficiencies were realised from the new system.</p><p>  The BPI programme commenced in invalidity pension (IP) section in May 2012.  At that time, there were approx. 7,300 new IP claims awaiting a decision.  As of now, all new IP claims are dealt with upon receipt,  all  backlogged claims are actions and the number of claims awaiting  further information to allowed a decision be made has reduced very significantly to approx. 3,450. </p><p>  While the time taken at present to process some carer&rsquo;s allowance claims is not satisfactory, good inroads have been made over the last number of months by my Department to clear the current backlog and a plan is in place to process the remaining backlogged claims by the end of Q1 2013. I am happy that the actions they are taking will achieve this.</p><p>  Since September 2012, a system has been put in place in carer&rsquo;s allowance (CA) to deal promptly with new applications being received and to eliminate the backlog of applications awaiting decision.  At present, there are approx. 8,380 new CA applications awaiting decision; this compares to approx. 11,600 applications which were awaiting decision in mid-June 2012.  It is expected that the remainder of backlogged CA claims will be actioned  by the end of March 2013.</p><p>  The service delivery modernisation project was fully deployed for disability allowance (DA) in mid-November 2012.  A business process improvement project is underway there at present with a view to putting together a plan, similar to those successfully implemented for IP and CA, for the prompt processing of weekly intake and the elimination of the current backlog.  At present there are approximately 7,900 new DA applications awaiting decision.  While the plan has not yet been finalised and rolled-out, it is anticipated that the backlog of DA applications will be eliminated by the end of Quarter 2 2013.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-16a.1467.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013011600071#WRY01800"><p>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  Currently, there are approximately 88,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;403 million for 2013. </p><p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant.  The Department does not engage directly with landlords to advise them of their legal obligations to register with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB). </p><p>  Registration with the PRTB is not a condition for payment of rent supplement. Landlords are legally obliged to register tenancies with the PRTB within one month from the start date of the tenancy or at a later date on payment of an increased fee.  For this reason, it is not practicable for the Department to insist that a tenancy be registered with the PRTB before payment of rent supplement can be made.  There are also instances where a rent supplement tenancy need not be registered with the PRTB, for example, in the case of renting a room in a house or where a property is owner-occupied. </p><p>  The Department works closely with the PRTB to help ensure that rent supplement tenancies comply with the statutory system of tenancy regulation and safeguards.  It advises the PRTB of all new rent supplement tenancies to assist them in implementing tenancy regulations and cooperates in any initiatives taken by the PRTB to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act.</p></reply>

It is targeted at individuals who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments (Jobseekers Allowance/Jobseekers Benefit/One Parent Family Payment/Disability Allowance) or are signing on for credits for at least 3 of the last 6 months (78 Days).  </p><p>  The JobBridge Scheme has made significant progress to-date since it came into operation on 1<sup></sup>July, 2011.  A total of13,558 internships had commenced by 10 January, 2013, with 5,526 participants on an internship and 1,841 opportunities advertised on <i></i>on that date. </p><p>  If they otherwise comply with the requirements of the Scheme, the intern is not penalised in terms of applications for future internships merely on account of the Host Organisation having been removed from the Scheme on account of non-compliance with the requirements of the Scheme.  In this regard, individuals may avail of up to two JobBridge internships to a maximum cumulative time period of 9 months (39 weeks). </p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that the feedback to-date has been very positive.  In particular, the interim evaluation of JobBridge conducted by Indecon International Economic Consultants (published on 5 October, 2012) states that 52.3% of JobBridge finishers progressed into employment with either their host organisation or another employer since finishing their internship.  These progression rates compare favourably with European averages in this area.  Given that, in the past, some labour market programmes have been seen as having insignificant or even negative impacts on employment probabilities, this suggests JobBridge is an appropriate labour market intervention. </p><p>  Further information on outcomes will be ascertained as a result of the ongoing formal evaluation of JobBridge. It is anticipated that the final evaluation report will be available in the coming weeks.  This evaluation will assess the design, delivery and impact of the JobBridge Scheme, it will provide details of the nature of the work experience of the participants; a measurement of the relevance of that experience to the labour market, analysis of age categories and further findings concerning progression into employment.  It will also present recommendations on how the Scheme might be improved.  It is at this stage that further consideration will be given to amending the terms and conditions of the Scheme.  Any such amendments to the scheme will be notified via the website.</p></reply>

This preserves the incentive for them to remain in employment in circumstances where they might only be marginally better off than if they were claiming other social welfare payments.  </p><p>  FIS is calculated on the basis of 60% of the difference between the income limit for the family size and the net income of the person(s) raising the child(ren).  Net income for FIS purposes comprises total family income less income tax, employee PRSI, universal social charge (USC) and pension contributions (including superannuation and additional voluntary contributions AVCs).  </p><p>  For FIS purposes, weekly family income is defined in Section 227 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005, as the amount of income received in a week by a family less, <i>inter alia</i>, any allowable contributions referred to in Regulations 41 and 42 of the Income Tax (Employments) (Consolidated) Regulations 2001.  Accordingly, any pension contribution is excluded from the definition of weekly family income for the purposes of determining entitlement to FIS.   </p><p>  FIS applicants are required to provide a P60 or recent payslips in support of their applications.  If there is doubt about the applicant&#8217;s tax credit entitlement the customer may be contacted regarding this issue and requested to contact Revenue and/or to furnish a recent tax credits certificate.  However it should be noted that each individual&#8217;s entitlement to tax credits and reliefs is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>  There is no provision in Social Welfare legislation to allow for the exclusion of the local property tax from weekly family income for FIS purposes.  Accordingly the local property tax will not be deductible from gross income when calculating net weekly family income.</p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, last year, a new process was introduced to determine the location of the 2013 National Famine Commemoration and future commemorations.  The purpose of the new selection process is threefold:<blockquote>-   To generate public awareness and interest in the annual National Famine Commemoration;<br /><br />-   To increase the number of potential sites available to choose from each year; and <br /><br />-   To ensure that the selection process is as transparent and open as possible.</blockquote>  The selection process has now concluded and the National Famine Commemoration Committee has agreed that this year's National Famine Commemoration will take place in Kilrush, County Clare.

An Environmental Impact Assessment entails consideration of the potential impacts of a project on population, fauna, flora, soil, water, air, climatic factors, material assets, including the architectural and archaeological heritage, landscape and the inter-relationship between the above factors.  Under the EIA Directive, it is not possible to permit a project unless it can be determined following assessment that it would not have an unacceptable environmental or social impact.</p><p>  In this context, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has commenced a process to issue a public call in early 2013 inviting interested parties to tender for the offer of funding from both the EPA Strive Programme and my Department to conduct detailed research on the use of Unconventional Gas Exploration and Extraction in Ireland, in particular with regard to the use of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) technology.  The study follows on from the preliminary research into the environmental aspects of shale gas extraction, conducted by the University of Aberdeen, which was published by the EPA in May 2012.</p><p>  The proposed terms of reference for this study have been developed and are currently the subject of a Public Consultation Process which was launched on 11 January 2013.  Interested parties have been invited to submit written comments by 8 March 2013.  Further details are available from the EPA website (www.epa.ie).</p><p>  The offer of funding will be available to support research under three main areas:</p><p>  -	baseline characterisation (geological impacts)</p><p>  -	seismic impacts</p><p>  -	regulatory framework for environmental protection.</p><p>  In regard to the research on seismic impacts, it is proposed that the research will include a review of historical and modern records of natural seismicity in Ireland, an assessment of the nature and magnitude of induced seismicity associated with hydraulic fracturing operations, with reference to North America and UK and a review of seismic risk control regimes.  Recommendations for systems applicable to Ireland, with particular reference to case study areas, will also be made.</p><p>I wish to confirm that no applications have been made to my Department to date proposing the use of hydraulic fracturing in exploration drilling.  Furthermore, until there has been time to consider this further research, the use of this technology in Ireland will not be authorised.  </p></reply>

No company has opted to offer, on a commercial basis, a feed-in-tariff for microgeneration of solar PV to the commercial and industrial sectors.</p><p>  Previously, a joint ESB/Electric Ireland microgeneration support scheme for the domestic sector offering a total of 19c/kwh (comprising &euro;10c/kwh from ESB Networks combined with the 9c/kwh from ESB Customer Supply (now Electric Ireland)) ran for 3 years (February 2009-February 2012) and had a take up of between 500 and 600 installations.</p><p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has been asked to provide my Department with analysis of other means through which the microgeneration sector could be supported, apart from through a feed-in-tariff funded from the Public Service Obligation.</p><p>  In 2009, the SEAI initiated a pilot microgeneration programme.  This involved 42 installations of various microgeneration technologies.  A final monitoring report on the performance of the installations and learning from the programme is awaited from SEAI.  This will inform future policy development. </p><p>  In view of falling technology costs, the Department has also asked SEAI to update analysis on the costs of varying levels of support for microgeneration technologies, with a view to considering how the sector could be supported in the future.</p></reply>

My Department has reviewed the rationalisation proposals for agencies under its aegis as set out in the Public Service Reform Plan.  The outcome of this review, which was recently published by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, is that the Digital Hub Development Agency (DHDA) will be merged (initially on an administrative basis) with Dublin City Council (DCC), pending enactment of legislation.  This merger is expected to yield short term savings of approximately &euro;400k, which amounts to over 20% of the Exchequer current subvention.  The most significant benefits to be gained from a merger of the DHDA with DCC are the synergies created from a closer relationship between the DHDA and the range of disciplines and skills available within the DCC.</p><p>  In addition, the Government also announced further proposed mergers, which include provision for the Ordnance Survey of Ireland, which is under the aegis of my Department, to merge with the Valuation Office and Property Registration Authority.  The merger potentially provides an opportunity for more efficient and cost-effective delivery of land and property administration services.  Medium term savings are likely to be achievable in the areas of common back office functions such as HR, conventional (non-specialised) IT systems, Financial Management and Corporate Services.  There may also be potential savings in the areas of accommodation and software licences.  In the longer term, more efficiencies/synergies in delivery of the merged organisation&rsquo;s services may lead to further savings in operational areas.  Additional commercial revenues which would reduce the burden on the State may also be achievable in the medium to long term.  The lead Department in relation to this rationalisation is the Department of Justice and Equality.</p><p>  There is also provision for the back-office administrative functions of the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) to be merged with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI).  I would advise the Deputy that neither BAI nor ComReg is Exchequer funded and as a result any savings achieved would not accrue to the Exchequer.  Future tangible back office savings derive mainly from the merging of the support systems and pooling of outsourced functions and external consultancies in the short to medium term.</p><p>  More generally, I would point out that total staff numbers at Non Commercial Agencies under the aegis of my Department was 777 at end 2010 and 686 at end 2012.  </p></reply>

Developing renewable sources of energy, including energy from biomass, will help Ireland reduce its dependence on these imports.  In addition, because sustainable biomass is considered carbon neutral, it will also assist Ireland meet its Climate Change commitments under the Kyoto Protocol and the 2020 European Union targets.</p><p>  Energy from biomass offers a number of advantages for meeting Ireland&rsquo;s energy needs.  It can address energy needs across all the energy sectors, it can be sourced indigenously and can enhance competitiveness through the provision of cleaner, and ultimately cheaper energy.</p><p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has modelled in its &lsquo;Energy Forecasts for Ireland for 2020&rsquo; that energy from biomass in 2020 will account for approximately 5% of our electricity requirements, approximately 10% of our heat requirements and, in the form of biofuels, will contribute around 9% of the energy required in the transport sector.  </p></reply>

Any failure by the universal service provider, currently eircom, to meet reasonable requests for fixed line phone services should be notified to the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), the independent market regulator.</p><p>  The provision of universal access to phone services is limited to the provision of such services at fixed locations using fixed line or equivalent technologies.</p><p>  The provision of mobile phone networks and services is undertaken by telecommunications service providers operating in a fully liberalised market under licences provided by ComReg.</p><p>  I am advised by ComReg that one of the requirements of these licences is that Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) must provide a minimum level of national population coverage.  I understand that operators tend to exceed their minimum coverage requirements for commercial reasons.  Subject to any other statutory consent requirements including planning consents requirements, the design of each mobile network is a matter entirely for each network operator.</p><p>  Given that mobile telephone services are a radio based technology, services can be affected by several factors including; topography (the surroundings, trees, terrain, buildings etc.) and the capacity of the network (the amount of subscribers on the same base station at a given time) and more generally the quality of access which customers have to mobile telephone antennas.  Industry has signalled that the recently concluded multi-band spectrum auction, which released additional radio spectrum previously unavailable for mobile operators, should result in enhanced services being rolled out.</p><p>  I am also advised by ComReg that following previous parliamentary questions regarding the quality of mobile phone services in Kerry it contacted the licensed operators. ComReg advises me that in responses one MNO outlined difficulties in locating new infrastructure in County Kerry including difficulties in securing consent to construct masts.  It was indicated to ComReg that this difficulty arises in part from a provision in Kerry County Council&rsquo;s Development Plan, which states that; &ldquo;It is the policy of the Planning Authority that telecommunication masts shall not be located within 1 kilometre of residential properties, schools, hospitals or any structures where there is human occupancy for residential or daily work purposes&rdquo;, which limits service providers ability to locate masts and antennas adjacent to market demand.</p></reply>

This Scheme was aimed at making a basic broadband service available to un-served premises in rural areas, not already covered by the National Broadband Scheme.</p><p>  An evaluation of the Scheme concluded that commercial service providers have been in a position to offer services to almost all applicants under the Scheme who agreed to engage with them.</p><p>  The Application Phase of the RBS closed in July and approximately 3,700 applications qualified under the terms of the Scheme.  The details of these applicants were passed to participating Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and they responded to DCENR indicating where they may be able to offer services.  A total of 29 companies participated in this part of the Scheme and a total of 2011 applicants gave their consent to receive written offers of service from these ISPs.</p><p>  The participating ISPs wrote to these 2011 applicants in April 2012 with offers of service and 509 applicants availed of these offers.</p><p>  The ISPs participating in the Scheme were not required to provide information regarding the technology used to serve applicants and accordingly it is not possible to provide a breakdown of delivery platform for applicants served through the Scheme.</p><p>  The data returned by the participating ISPs indicates that in the case of a total of 6 applicants, it was not possible to provide a service from any of the service providers who made offers.

In terms of telecommunications policy, my Department plays a key role in providing a supportive legislative and regulatory environment within which competition can flourish and private sector investment can take place.</p><p>  The provision of electronic communications services is, in the first instance, a matter for private sector service providers operating in Ireland&rsquo;s fully liberalised telecommunications market, regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  Broadband services are provided by a number of private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.  As such, business decisions including those relating   to the upgrading of an exchange are a matter for the operator concerned and not one in which I have a function.</p><p>  The Government can intervene in the case of clear market failure.  It has, in the past, undertaken, following EU State aid clearance, a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where operators have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.  State investment in the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) and the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) are examples of such interventions.</p><p>  With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>  During the preparation of the National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.

The plan, which contains over 270 actions in total, sets out to improve supports for job-creating businesses and remove barriers to employment-creation across the economy.</p><p>  While the Annual Report on the Action Plan has not yet been published by the Department of the Taoiseach, I can confirm that my Department has completed the actions set out for it in the Plan for 2012.  In the Telecommunications area, these include publication of a National Broadband Plan, the delivery of Phase I of the 100Mbps to second level schools programme, and ongoing support for the digital sector through the Digital Hub Development Agency and the National Digital Research Centre (NDRC).  In the Energy area, these include continuation of the Better Energy efficiency programmes while work continues on the development of a Pay As You Save Scheme (PAYS).  Phase 2 of the National Smart Meter Programme has commenced and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) continue to expand the range of energy support services to SMEs and large energy users. Energy research programmes support the International Energy Research Centre in Cork and development of the Maritime and Energy Research Centre at UCC.</p><p>  My Department continues to play an important role in supporting economic growth and job creation.  Ongoing investment in energy programmes delivered by the SEAI are sustaining up to 3,000 construction-related jobs and energy research programmes are aimed at stimulating investment in new energy technologies and new enterprise opportunities.  In the communications area, the National Broadband Plan which was published in 2012, aims to deliver a minimum of 30Mbps broadband connectivity to all parts of Ireland and to support industry in delivering significantly higher speeds in some areas, thereby underpinning economic growth and job opportunities.  Ongoing support for the Digital Hub Development Agency and the NDRC also aims to foster innovation and the development of indigenous digital enterprises. </p><p>  The national rollout of the 100Mbps to all post-primary schools project is continuing and all schools will be connected by the end of 2014.  This is a key investment in the future workforce as the use of high speed broadband in schools can facilitate better learning outcomes and sharing of critical resources.  The Department also continues to fund the Digital Hub and the NDRC.  In 2012, 78% of the companies based at the Digital Hub expanded their business operations, with 44% hiring additional staff and two-thirds planning to expand their workforce in 2013.  Over 70% of the companies at the Hub export their products and services.   In addition to enterprise development at the Digital Hub, NDRC start-ups and companies have created 155 full-time jobs and 66 part-time jobs by the end of 2012 as a direct result of the projects NDRC has supported.  </p><p>  I am also very conscious of the impact of Energy and Telecommunications infrastructure on competitiveness.  This is primarily a function of the quality of the infrastructure and the price of the services.  The Department engages intensively in an ongoing way on these issues and works with the Energy and Communications regulators in this regard.  The main policy objectives are to promote investment, quality service and competition.  There have been significant improvements in both quality of service and competition in both Energy and Telecommunications in recent years.</p><p>  In the case of Energy, the major investment by the State Companies in the key electricity and gas networks has delivered a modern and reliable infrastructure.   This has been complemented by significant private sector involvement especially in electricity generation and supply which has transformed the competitive landscape from the State monopoly situation of previous years.  As a result, and notwithstanding the small size of the Irish market, there are now seven suppliers in the electricity market and eight in the gas market. These developments have led to the growth of a very competitive market.  This is evidenced by the very high degree of switching of supplier in both the domestic and business sectors.  This competition is crucial given Ireland&rsquo;s dependence on fossil fuels for electricity generation, by far the major contributor to the price of electricity, and a factor over which we have no control. </p></reply>

The current scheme is known as REFIT (Renewable Energy Feed-in-Tariff) and the previous scheme was AER (Alternative Energy Requirement).  The manner in which REFIT works is that it provides a guaranteed floor price for renewable generation exported to the electricity grid over a 15-year period.  By doing so, it provides sufficient certainty to developers to finance windfarms.</p><p>  Generators who have applied for acceptance into the REFIT Scheme and who fulfil the Terms and Conditions receive a REFIT Letter of Offer.  On the basis of this, they enter into a privately negotiated Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with a licensed supplier. The supplier is entitled to compensation according to the REFIT Terms and Conditions and compensates the generator according to the terms of the PPA they negotiated.  The generators in REFIT are commercial entities.  There is no clause in the REFIT scheme preventing the sale of windfarms or requiring &ldquo;claw-back&rdquo;.  In the event of a sale, generators would notify relevant parties, and the sale should be done in accordance with any conditions relating to the sale that are contained in the PPA the original owner had entered into.</p></reply>

There have been no commercial discoveries of oil to date.  The three Kinsale area gas fields are nearing depletion and currently provide approximately 5% of Ireland&rsquo;s annual gas requirements.  The Corrib field gas is under development and first gas is not anticipated until early 2015.</p><p>In terms of the direct financial contribution to the State, profits from the Kinsale area gas fields are taxed at a rate of 25%.  In addition royalties from the Kinsale and Ballycotton fields are payable to the State at a rate of 12.5% of the fair market value of the gas at the well head.  While the amount paid in tax is a matter between the operators of the gas fields and the Revenue Commissioners, I can advise that the amount received in royalties since 2007 amounted to just under &euro;27 million.  Full details are set out in the table.</p><p>Royalties are not payable on production from the Seven Heads gas field as Ireland moved away from a royalty based payments system to a tax based system in 1987.  Profits from future production from the Corrib gas field will be taxed at a rate of 25%.  A comprehensive review of Ireland&rsquo;s licensing terms was carried out in 2007 by independent economic consultants, following which both the fiscal and non-fiscal licensing terms were revised.  The revised terms apply to all exploration licences issued since 1 January 2007 and provide for a new profit resource rent tax of up to 15% in addition to the 25% corporate tax rate already applying.  The revised terms ensure that the return to the State would be up to 40% in the case of very profitable fields.</p><p>Details of all petroleum authorisations are contained in the quarterly acreage report published on the Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.dcenr.gov.ie</i>   and in the six-monthly report on petroleum licensing laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</p><p><b>Royalty Payments for the period 1</b><b>st</b><b> January 2007 to 31</b><b>st</b>  <b> December 2012</b></p><p><table><tr><th><div>Year</div></th><th><div>Company</div></th><th><div>Royalties received</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>2007</div></td><td><div>PSE Kinsale Energy Limited</div></td><td><div>&#8364;6,247,633</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2008</div></td><td><div>PSE Kinsale Energy Limited.</div></td><td><div>&#8364;8,153,045</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2009</div></td><td><div>PSE Kinsale Energy Limited</div></td><td><div>&#8364;2,114,020</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2010</div></td><td><div>PSE Kinsale Energy Limited.</div></td><td><div>&#8364;2,571,624</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>PSE Kinsale Energy Limited.</div></td><td><div>&#8364;3,904,321</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>PSE Kinsale Energy Limited.</div></td><td><div>&#8364;3,955,353</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Total</div></td><td></td><td><div>&#8364;26,945,996</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Government endorses this major investment underway in the high voltage electricity transmission system.  Grid25 is the most important investment in Ireland&rsquo;s transmission system for several generations and will position our energy system for decades to come.</p><p>  The Government, in its &lsquo;Policy Statement on the Strategic Importance of Transmission and Other Energy Infrastructure&rsquo; (published in July 2012) underlined the need and urgency for new energy infrastructure in the national interest and from a European perspective.  In addition to the interests of individual consumers, the Policy Statement was equally conscious that public acceptability of such infrastructure is a major challenge.  Social acceptance and understanding of the need for new infrastructure is critical.  Public acceptability requires public confidence that projects and programmes adhere to the highest international standards of safety, health and environmental and visual impact, and technology choice. </p><p>  The Government affirmed that EirGrid and ESB Networks and Bord G&aacute;is are obliged to adhere to all relevant guidelines and standards and they act in the national interest, and on behalf of all electricity consumers.  The Government has confidence that the forward process from the national planning framework of the National Spatial Strategy, to Regional Planning Guidelines and local development planning and the Strategic Infrastructure Act, provides the necessary framework for ensuring that all necessary standards are met and that extensive statutory and non-statutory consultation are key to creating public confidence to this effect.</p><p>  Grid 25 and other essential energy infrastructure will have positive impacts for all local communities in underpinning regional and economic development and jobs.  Specifically with regard to the North Midlands, EirGrid has recently secured planning permission for a new 110 kV line between Kinnegad and Mullingar.  This will help secure supplies of electricity to these areas and facilitate inward investment projects being attracted to the area.

The overarching objective of the role of Digital Champion is to promote more digital adoption.  This is likely to entail working with and inspiring key stakeholders communicating the benefits and possibilities of digital more widely &#8211; so that people whether at home, in business or in education will achieve more and benefit more from what digital has to offer.  This initiative is in line with similar developments in other EU Member States and is a key aspect of a new National Digital Strategy (NDS) which will be published shortly.</p><p>  It is envisaged that the role of the Digital Champion will evolve over time and I intend to work closely with David Puttnam to define the role further in light of the forthcoming National Digital Strategy, and other emerging National and EU priorities.  His priorities will be highlighted along with those of other digital champions on the Digital Champions website at:</p><p>.</p><p>  David Puttnam has agreed to undertake his current role as Digital Champion on a pro-bono basis.  His time, expertise and the widely acknowledged talent he brings to this role is being contributed free.  The only costs incurred will be reimbursement of expenses incurred in his official role as Digital Champion for Ireland.  These will be handled in accordance with the normal travel and subsistence arrangements operating in the Civil Service.  By agreement, his term of appointment is currently open-ended and as such it can be concluded by mutual agreement.  Support for the role of Digital Champion is currently being provided by officials in my Department as part of their normal duties in assisting with the promotion of digital engagement.</p></reply>

In line with this commitment, my Department is involved in the ongoing analyses and policy development work that is necessary in advance of the implementation of any changes that may be required.</p><p>  Although subject to a degree of evasion, the existing TV licence fee system has provided a stable funding base for our public service broadcasters.  The rationale for providing State funding for public service broadcasting is to provide an independent and reliable income flow that allows these corporations to attain their public service objects while ensuring they can maintain editorial independence.  This is especially important in the context of news and current affairs.  The overall aim of Public Service Broadcasting is to provide services and content which cater for all interests in society, while ensuring that the varied elements of Irish culture and its intrinsic values are protected.  Through the obligations placed on the Public Service Broadcasters, which are established in legislation passed by the Oireachtas, and the criteria set for the funding of content through the Sound &amp; Vision Scheme, the production of quality indigenous programming and the production of minority interest programming is strongly promoted.</p><p>  Whatever the system of funding, the rationale for providing funding will continue to apply and any changes that may be implemented must continue to provide a secure funding base for public service broadcasting and content.  It is also important, of course, that any changes to the system of funding should take account of the reality of new mechanisms to access such content and services and the pervasiveness of such content in today&rsquo;s society.</p><p>  Publicly-funded public service broadcasting and content are now available to everyone on an ever-increasing range of platforms and devices (radio, television, smart phone, pc, laptop and many other devices) and, in fact, access is not dependent on the ownership of a device.  In short, everyone benefits from the availability of these services, regardless of how content is accessed or relayed to the public, and, therefore, it is my view that the cost should be borne by society as a whole.</p><p>  The principle underlying the proposal for the introduction of a Public Broadcasting Charge on eligible households and applicable businesses is that publicly-funded public service broadcasting is a public good and, as such, is of benefit to society in general.  The replacement of the existing funding system based on the collection of television licence fees with one based on the imposition of device-independent charge on eligible households and businesses is a complex process and much of the detail has yet to be worked out.  This includes identifying the most appropriate method for collecting the charge and the manner in which issues such as exemptions and enforcement should be dealt with. In this regard, my Department is currently carrying out a Value for Money Policy Review conducted by an independently chaired group on the proposed policy.  I would expect to receive a copy of the group&rsquo;s recommendations and report for my consideration by the end of quarter 1 2013.</p><p>  At this point, however, I can state that the charge, which will be device independent, will replace the current licence fee and all households and businesses will be subject to the charge, except for those that are specifically exempted.  In regard to the issue of exemptions under any new system, this will have to be given detailed consideration when the type of model to be developed is agreed.  That said, it is my expectation that the current exemptions in relation to pensioners and those entitled to the Household Benefit Package will continue to apply.  The specific questions raised by the Deputy on the proposal are being considered as part of the above review.</p></reply>

In 2011, evasion was estimated to be over 15%.  My Department is currently examining the 2012 figures with a view to providing a revised estimate of evasion.  While this work has yet to be completed, it is my understanding, however, that it is unlikely to show any decrease in what is already an unacceptably high level of TV licence evasion.</p><p>In tackling evasion, every effort is made by An Post to bring evaders into the licensed pool and a considerable amount of its time and resources are spent in dealing with evasion.  As a first step, An Post concentrate their efforts on getting people to buy the licence when due.  A series of reminder notices are sent out urging people to pay their TV Licence.  Payment has been made easier with the introduction over the last couple of years of a dedicated website (www.tvlicence.ie), 24 hour automated call centre (1890-228528) and the option to pay by direct debit instalments.  In addition, the older traditional methods of payment at the counter in a post office and with the TV licence stamps remain available.</p><p>Every effort is taken to identify unlicensed premises, from people whose licence has lapsed to people who have moved premises, through additional reminders, inspector visits and eventually by court summons. Prosecutions are only pursued after allowing people the appropriate time to purchase a TV licence.  The Deputy may wish to note that figures in the table below relating to the number of persons prosecuted are provided by the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office and are not yet available for 2012.</p><p><table><tr><th></th><th><div>2010</div></th><th><div>2011</div></th><th><div>2012</div></th></tr><tr><td>Licence Fee Receipts (Gross)</td><td><div>&#8364;222.38m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;217.77m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;215.03m</div></td></tr><tr><td>Numbers Prosecuted</td><td><div>9,556</div></td><td><div>10,593</div></td><td>Figures not yet available*</td></tr></table></p><p>In relation to the total cost to the State of producing advertisements for the television licence fee, the total average annual spend by An Post is in the region of &euro;120,000.

The MoU specifies that "all new mobile phone models and new chargers models on the market produced by the signatories shall offer this common charging capability one year after the related standards have become available".  The MoU also permits compliance to be achieved by making a suitable adaptor available to customers.</p><p>  The European Standard was agreed at the end 2010 and the provision became applicable one year thereafter at the end of 2011.  The EU Commission estimates that the universal charger should therefore be dominant in the market at the end of this year having regard to the rate at which the majority of mobile phones are replaced, every two years, in a market, which now favours data enabled phones.  The MoU is nevertheless a voluntary code.  The EU Commission has recently presented a proposal to the Council and the European Parliament for a &ldquo;Directive on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to the making available on the market of radio equipment&rdquo;, which includes a proposal on the harmonisation of chargers.  The Commission&rsquo;s proposal if adopted will provide a legal basis to require that all mobile phone chargers for data enabled phones placed on the market within the EU meet a harmonised standard. </p></reply>

Broadband services are provided by a number of private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.  Details of broadband services available on a county-by-county basis can be found on ComReg&#8217;s website at .</p><p>  The State only becomes involved in the provision of services in instances of clear market failure, such as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  My Department entered into a contract in late 2008 with Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd (&#8220;3&#8221;) for the delivery of the NBS.  The Scheme offers a basic broadband service, in line with EU State aid clearance, to fixed residences and businesses located within certain designated rural areas.  The area of Portmagee was excluded from the NBS as it was deemed, at the time of the comprehensive mapping exercise carried out prior to the launch of the Scheme, to be already served by at least one private operator.  The NBS is prohibited, under EU State Aids rules, from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.</p><p>  You refer to the provision of broadband services in Portmagee and the surrounding area by &#8220;3 mobile&#8221;.  Since this service provision is by &#8220;3&#8221;, in its private operator capacity, I do not have a role in relation to the level of service provided to its customers.  However, should customers be experiencing service performance problems, they are advised, in the first instance, to contact their service provider to seek resolution.  In cases where customers have exhausted the service provider&#8217;s complaint handling procedures, they can contact ComReg, by phone at 1890 229 668, online at  or by email , for further assistance and guidance.</p><p>  With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government&#8217;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&#8217;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  During the preparation of the National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.</p><p>  One of the first steps in delivering on the commitments in the National Broadband Plan will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&#8217; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  Until that process is complete, the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention will not be known. I would reiterate however, that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including areas such as Portmagee, in County Kerry, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.</p></reply>

The activities of companies operating with an IPPC licence are monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to ensure that the terms of their licences are respected, including in relation to emissions.  Under the EPA Acts 1992 to 2011, I am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance by the EPA of its licensing functions in specific cases.   </p><p>  In addition to the requirements of IPPC, Ireland developed a national emissions reduction plan (NERP) under Article 4 (6) of the Large Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD) 2001/80/EC to further reduce emissions from power plants. The NERP is a mechanism that allows &ldquo;existing plant&rdquo;, as defined in the Directive, to achieve the environmental objectives of the Directive in a cost-effective manner through the installation of abatement measures at selected qualifying plants.  The NERP option was chosen because it provided both an environmentally ambitious and a cost-effective compliance route for Ireland. The ESB and other national operators made a commitment to achieve emission limits for SO2 and NOx from existing plants that were significantly more ambitious than the minimum requirements of the LCPD: in the period from 2008 to 2016, emission reductions are 27% more ambitious for SO2 and 46% more ambitious for NOx   emissions.</p><p>  The EEA study referenced in the question did not assess whether the emissions of a given installation are consistent with its legal requirements. Monitoring undertaken by the EPA has shown that total emissions from IPPC licenced installations are consistently below the levels prescribed to ensure adequate protection of human health and the environment.</p></reply>

Under current legislation the person liable for payment of rates is the person in occupation of a rateable property at the date of the making of the rate. The owner rather than the occupier may be liable for commercial rates if the property in question is unoccupied on the date of the making of the rate. Should a person&rsquo;s occupancy commence after the date of the making of the rate then that person is not primarily liable for rates for that year. </p><p>  Under the provisions of the Local Government (Rates) Act 1970, a rating authority may make and carry out a scheme providing for the waiver by the authority of all or a portion of commercial rates due by ratepayers in respect of a specified class or classes of property. The making of such a scheme is subject to my consent as Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. No rate waiver schemes have been consented to in respect of commercial property. hile matters relating to rates are kept under regular consideration in my Department, I have no immediate plans to bring forward legislative amendment in this area.</p></reply>

The Charge is set at &euro;200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties. It is a matter for an owner, whether resident in Ireland or elsewhere, to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge.   A residential property not in use by an owner as his or her sole or main residence is liable for the Charge. This may not necessarily be a second home; a person may have vacated a property and be living in rented accommodation elsewhere for work or other reasons and in such a case, the property that the owner is no longer living in is liable for the Charge, even if it is the only residential property that person owns.</p></reply>

The regulations I introduced in early 2012 under the Dog Breeding Establishments Act, 2010 stipulate that all dogs held in such establishments be microchipped once they reach 8 weeks of age or when a dog is moved from the establishment. This initiative will result in more and more dogs being microchipped over time. In addition, many dogs that are seized by dog wardens are microchipped prior to being returned to their owners, or given to new owners.</p><p>  To be properly effective, the compulsory microchipping of dogs should be supported by the development of a central registration system for all dogs. It would also be necessary to have the co-operation of the dog-owning public in updating of a central registration system where the ownership of a dog changes. These are large projects which would involve a significant investment in terms of time and funding, but they are under consideration by local authorities and my Department.  Mandatory microchipping of all dogs will not necessarily eliminate the problem of sheep worrying. The key to tackling this issue is responsible dog ownership. Dog owners must recognise the issues involved and their responsibilities in ensuring that their dogs are controlled at all times, especially at night time and, most especially, before and during the lambing season. My Department has been in contact with farming representatives regarding the promotion of such behaviour by dog owners and I expect that these discussions will be useful and fruitful.</p></reply>

In this regard, I published <i>A Resource Opportunity - Waste Management Policy in Ireland</i> in July, 2012 setting out a range of measures which will significantly revise the current regulatory regime to ensure, <i>inter alia</i>, that waste collected is managed in accordance with the waste hierarchy as set out in the Waste Framework Directive, whereby prevention, reuse, recycling, recovery are favoured over the disposal of waste.  The policy specifically provides that household waste collection permits issued under the revised permitting system will require waste collectors to operate pricing structures designed to incentivise environmentally sustainable behaviours by households in terms of waste reduction and segregation.  The policy further provides that strengthened enforcement of permit conditions relating to segregated collections will be initiated, with appropriate financial penalties being specified for breaches of such conditions, and possible withdrawal of permits in cases of serious breaches.</p><p>  The work of developing new regulatory structures to give effect to the measures set out in the waste policy is underway and my Department is engaging with a range of key stakeholders in relation to the detailed design of the new system.  It is my intention that the improved regulatory regime will deliver both enhanced environmental performance and ensure a quality service for consumers.</p><p>  In relation to the provision of waste collection waivers, another of the measures included in the Government&#8217;s waste policy is the establishment of an interdepartmental working group to report to Government with options to minimise the impact of waste charges on low income households. The working group, which comprises representatives of my Department and the Departments of Social Protection; Public Expenditure and Reform; Finance; and the T&aacute;naiste's Office, submitted its first report to Government on 11 December 2012.  Government considered the report and the working group is to continue to examine the design and implementation of measures to address the issue and will provide a further report to Government by 31 March 2013.</p></reply>

This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body who in turn rent it to the original owners.</p><p>  Householders seeking to avail of the mortgage to rent scheme must:</p><p> - have been involved in the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) with their lender and agree that they can no longer afford to pay their mort gage loan now or in the future;</p><p> - own the property they live in, with a current market value of less than &euro;220,000 in the Dublin area or less than &euro;180 ,000 in the rest of the country;</p><p> - have their property in good condition, in a suitable location and which must suit their current needs;</p><p> - not own any other property or have assets in excess of &euro;20,000;</p><p> - have household income not exceeding &euro;25,000, &euro;30,000 or &euro;35,000 a year, depending on what part of the country they live in (household income in this context is net of taxes and social insurance (PRSI));</p><p> - the borrower must have a long-term right to remain in Ireland.</p><p>  The current market value of &euro;220,000 applies chiefly to the greater Dublin area, but also to adjoining areas with commensurate property value levels. The lower current market value of &euro;180,000 applies to all other areas. The greater Drogheda area is deemed to fall into the latter category.</p></reply>

This report indicated that 59 people were sleeping rough in the Dublin Region on Census night, 10 April 2011. The report identified that a further 2,316 people in the Dublin Region were housed in accommodation defined as emergency, transitional or long-term. Outside of Dublin the Census report indicated that 6 individuals were sleeping rough while a further 1,427 individuals were housed in accommodation defined as emergency, transitional or long-term.  Of the total of 3,808 individuals included in the report, almost 60% were in long-term or transitional housing arrangements rather than in emergency facilities or sleeping rough.  In December 2012, Dublin City Council reported that over 100 persons were sleeping rough on the night of the most recent count held in November 2012.</p><p>  While the Dublin Region&#8217;s Outreach team works on an on-going basis to engage with all individuals sleeping rough with the specific goal of moving people into accommodation, the stubbornly high number of rough sleepers reflects the gravity of the challenge facing the Government, the voluntary sector and other agencies in tackling the homelessness problem. The problem of rough sleeping is limited outside of Dublin, with Cork, Waterford, Limerick, and Galway City Councils reporting sufficient bed capacity on a nightly basis and that there is no one sleeping rough on an involuntary basis.  I intend to issue a policy statement on homelessness very shortly. In this statement I will be indicating what I expect from housing authorities and other stakeholders in accelerating progress towards realising the ambition of eliminating involuntary long-term homelessness.</p></reply>

Paragraph (2) of the Regulation clarifies that paragraph (1) does not operate to exclude from eligibility for social housing support an applicant who owns accommodation that is occupied by his or her spouse, from whom he or she is formally separated or divorced. Under the enactment, a deed of separation is sufficient to set aside this ineligibility ground and it is not necessary to await judicial separation or divorce to get a decision on social housing support in these cases.  This provision is reasonable in most cases.  I acknowledge, however, that situations relating to household members who have separated may exceptionally arise that may not easily be dealt with under the current Regulations. My Department is keeping the social housing assessment provisions under review and will consider what wider discretion might be given to housing authorities by way of Regulations to address the individually difficult and complex cases which may present to them.</p></reply>

The Council is also the designated Housing Authority under the Housing Acts. I am aware of the significant efforts that have been made by the Council to provide for the needs of residents to date and I understand that the Council will continue to work proactively on behalf of the residents towards achieving the much needed resolution of the issues at Priory Hall.  The resolution process, which I understand is on-going, arose in the context of legal proceedings which were adjourned to afford relevant parties the opportunity to work together, under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Finnegan (retired President of the High Court), to identify a way forward in relation to the complex problems at Priory Hall.  Given that the matter is before the courts, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further other than to continue to urge all concerned to afford Mr. Justice Finnegan the opportunity to complete the task which he is undertaking.</p></reply>

My Department supports fire authorities through the setting of general policy and guidance, and the provision of capital funding, including the recoupment (within the overall funding available) of costs incurred by fire authorities in relation to the approved purchase of fire appliances and specialist emergency and communications equipment as well as construction and upgrading of fire stations.</p><p>  Under the 2008 fire service capital programme, a proposal by Kilkenny County Council to build a new two bay fire station in Grauigenamanagh was approved in principle.  The Council was subsequently approved to prepare detailed design and tender documents in relation to the project. These have been received in my Department for consideration.  In keeping with other reductions, it has been necessary to reduce the fire service capital allocation. Given the ongoing constraints on public finances, funding is not available from the programme at present for the building of a new fire station in Graiguenamanagh.  Priority has been given to supporting the national fire appliance fleet and, in this regard, Kilkenny Fire and Rescue Service has received an allocation for a new appliance which is currently under construction.</p></reply>

Details of the number of processed registrations for each County and City Council by 14 January 2013 are set out in the table.</p><p>The Water Services Acts 2007 and 2012 Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems (Registration) Regulations 2012 prescribe the date for registration of domestic wastewater treatment systems as 1 February 2013. There has been an extensive public information campaign, involving local and national media as well as the distribution of an information booklet to households in unsewered areas, to familiarise owners of domestic waste water treatment systems with the requirement to register and the registration options available to them. Registration facilities have been available since 26 June 2012 and I consider that ample time has been afforded for people to register their on-site waste water treatment systems. I have no plans to extend the registration period.</p><p>Following the European Court of Justice judgment against Ireland in October 2009, my Department commenced the preparation of legislation to ensure compliance with the Court&rsquo;s ruling; this included extensive stakeholder consultations between October and November 2010. On taking office in March, 2011, I prioritised the finalisation of the legislation and this culminated with the publication of the Water Services (Amendment) Bill 2011 on 3 November 2011 and its enactment on 2 February 2012.</p><p>I recently announced my intention to introduce a grant scheme to provide financial assistance to households whose septic tanks and other domestic wastewater treatment systems require remediation or upgrading following inspection under the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012. I am making provision for the scheme in my Department&rsquo;s Vote for 2013. The scheme will apply to treatment systems which have been registered by the due date of 1 February 2013 and which are deemed to require remediation having failed an inspection carried out under the 2012 Act.  The grant payable will depend on the cost of the work necessary and the income of the household concerned, and the scheme will provide a higher level of support to households on lower incomes.  Full details of the scheme will be defined in regulations which I will make in advance of inspections commencing this year.</p><p>It will be a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency to determine the level of inspections required. At this stage it is not possible to indicate how many systems will require remediation.  However, the remedial action required on foot of an inspection of a septic tank will, in many cases, only involve householders having to de-sludge their tanks more frequently.  The experience in County Cavan, where inspections have been carried out under the bye-laws in operation in that county since 2004, indicates that, where remediation was required, the average remediation cost was &euro;2,500 and the failure rate was approximately 15% of systems inspected.</p><p>Registrations processed as of 14 January 2013.</p><p><table><tr><th><b><font

The funding involved was considered on a year to year basis, having regard to the performance of the facility and availability of funds.  In recent years, the Environment Fund has come under significant additional expenditure pressures, while at the same time the Fund&rsquo;s income base has been affected by the very welcome successes of the landfill levy in diverting waste from landfill and the plastic bag levy in reducing plastic bag usage.</p><p>  This has required significant reductions in a range of expenditure areas financed from the Fund and, in that context, and taking account of value for money considerations, it is not possible to continue with the subvention sought in respect of the Dungarvan facility.  However, it should be noted that my Department continues to make a significant general purpose grant allocation to Waterford County Council to contribute towards meeting the cost of providing a reasonable level of services to customers. In this regard, I have approved &euro;18,176,169 in general purpose funding to the Council for 2013, an increase of 1.61% on the 2012 allocation.</p></reply>

The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants in the private rented residential sector.</p><p>  My Department conducted a review of the Act in 2009 with a specific emphasis on whether the Act best supports the PRTB&#8217;s key functions and on whether legislative amendments would support either the achievement of additional operational efficiencies by the PRTB in the delivery of those functions or the broader good working of the private rented sector. The outcomes of the review were announced in April 2010 and the drafting of the General Scheme of a Bill to give effect to the recommendations of the review was approved by Government in July 2011. The Residential Tenancies (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill 2012 was published on 19 July 2012 and is currently at Second Stage <font color="#222222">in the </font>D&aacute;il.</p><p>  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill 2012 builds on what has been achieved by the Residential Tenancies Act and the PRTB, and provides for the further development of the rental sector into the future.  Among the main issues addressed by the amending legislation are &#8211;</p><p> - the extension of the remit of the Residential Tenancies Act to Approved Housing Body tenancies;</p><p> - the Board of the PRTB to be reduced from 15 to 12 members;</p><p> - the separation of the governance and quasi-judicial functions of the Board;</p><p> - the merger of the PRTB and the Rent Tribunal;</p><p> - the simplification and streamlining of the mediation process.   </p><p>  While the Bill addresses a wide range of issues, there are some other aspects still under development which I hope to bring forward for consideration during the Bill&#8217;s passage through the Oireachtas. In particular, I am keen to progress a number of key on-going concerns within the private rented sector such as the illegal retention of tenants&#8217; deposits by landlords and the over holding of rented property by tenants. </p></reply>

The imposition of the levies will require legislation and in that context I will set out the detail regarding the application of the levies, their collection and subsequent administration. I am committed to having the legislation published and enacted in the shortest timeframe possible.</p><p>  The decision to impose a levy on the quarrying industry will in effect see it applied to the construction industry more generally given its application is to a raw material used in certain manufactured products, which is also in line with the recommendations of the Pyrite Panel.  While I understand that some suppliers, who were not involved in the supply of aggregate materials containing reactive pyrite, may feel concerned that the levy is being generally applied it is reasonable, and in line with precedent, that this sectoral approach be taken. For example, the Motor Insurance Bureau, which is funded by companies writing motor insurance in Ireland, provides assistance and compensation to the innocent victims of accidents caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles. Similar arrangements apply to the travel trade.</p></reply>

Under Section 10 of the Fire Services Act 1981, a fire authority is required to make provision for the delivery of fire services in its functional area, including the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of premises.  Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each county and city manager is responsible for the staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authority for which he or she is responsible.  In addition, it is a reserved function of fire authorities to adopt fire and emergency operations plans indicating the provision made in respect of organisation, appliances, equipment, fire stations, training and operational procedures for the provision of a comprehensive fire service to the community.  My Department supports fire authorities through setting of general policy, training support and issue of guidance on operational and other related matters, and the provision of capital funding.   </p><p>  My Department's National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management has developed a policy document, Keeping Communities Safe (KCS) , which is intended to set the future direction of fire services in Ireland.  It sets out a system of national processes and standards for fire service delivery in Ireland based on a risk management approach to fire safety which combines the important elements of fire prevention, protection and response.  The national standards that are proposed in KCS are in keeping with international good practice and are crucial to a consistent approach across fire services in Ireland.  It is intended that the national norms and standards established by KCS will be integrated into future service planning within each local authority's fire service.  The draft KCS document is available on my Department's web site at , and I intend to publish it as national policy in the near future. </p><p>  Furthermore, a number of health and safety related initiatives have been introduced in fire authorities following the introduction of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.  These include an Ancillary Safety Statement Template for Fire Services, a National Incident Command System and Standard Operating Guidelines covering all aspects of fire service operations.  These measures assist the officer-in-charge in the assessment and decision-making relating to any emergency while ensuring a safe working environment for fire-fighters.</p></reply>

My Department supports fire authorities through the setting of general policy and guidance, and the provision of capital funding, including the recoupment (within the overall funding available) of costs incurred by fire authorities in relation to the approved purchase of fire appliances and specialist emergency and communications equipment as well as construction and upgrading of fire stations.   </p><p>  In keeping with other reductions, it has been necessary to reduce the fire service capital allocation.  Priority has been given to supporting the national fire appliance fleet and, in this regard, Galway  Fire and Rescue Service has received an allocation for a new appliance which is currently under construction.  My Department understands that a review of fire services in Galway is currently being undertaken by Galway County Council.  This review, including the south Connemara region, is being informed by an integrated risk management analysis.  The output from the analysis is intended to inform local decision-making on the effective deployment and use of resources, with a view to ensuring an appropriate balance between prevention, protection and response measures.  I understand that this review is at an advanced stage, and will have regard to my Department's national policy document, Keeping Communities Safe (KCS), which will be published in the near future.</p></reply>

The total value of the exemptions was &euro;110m.  While in some cases such declarations of non-use will be genuine, it is suspected that there is widespread abuse and it is estimated that the abolition of such abuse would generate income of some &euro;55m annually.  The Government approved the drafting of a Bill on 22 May 2012 to replace the current retrospective system of making declarations of non-use with a system whereby declarations must be made in advance of the vehicle being taken off the road.  The Bill is at an advanced stage of drafting in the Office of the Attorney General and is expected to be published shortly.</p><p>  I have no plans to make changes to the current payment options for motor tax.  The current half-yearly and quarterly payment options incorporate a surcharge to cover the higher administrative costs involved in processing such applications.  The estimated annual income from the increased charges for half-year and quarterly vehicle licences is in the region of &euro;20m.  Were a monthly pro-rata system to be introduced, the loss in income would have to be compensated for elsewhere in the motor tax system, or through the taxation system generally.  It would also have a negative transitional impact on the flow of income to the Local Government Fund and consequently on grant allocations to local authorities from the Fund.   </p><p>  In considering options for a monthly payment option, regard would also have to be had to the set-up costs in the motor tax system, and increased ongoing administrative and financial costs and controls.</p></reply>

Among the measures included in the policy is the establishment of an interdepartmental working group to report to Government with options to minimise the impact of waste charges on low income households.  The working group, which comprises representatives of my Department and the Departments of Social Protection; Public Expenditure and Reform; Finance; and the T&aacute;naiste's Office, submitted its first report to Government on 11 December 2012.  Government considered the report and the working group is to continue to examine the design and implementation of measures to address the issue and will provide a further report to Government by 31 March 2013.   </p><p>  Another measure of the Government's waste policy is the revision of the current regulatory regime, to ensure, inter alia, that waste collection providers have Customer Charters in place.  The Customer Charters will be required clearly to set out information for customers in relation to issues such as charging structures, procedures for dealing with customers who may fall into arrears, and arrangements for switching from one waste collector to another.  I wrote to the waste management industry in September and October, 2012 in relation to the development of such charters and I understand that a number of waste collection providers have already put in place a Customer Charter ahead of the development of the new regulatory regime.  I further understand that a number of waste collection operators have notified former local authority customers of the offers and discounts available to those previously in receipt of a local authority waste collection waiver.</p></reply>

The charge is set at &euro;200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.  It is a matter for an owner , whether resident in Ireland or elsewhere, to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the charge.   </p><p>  The provision of information to potential liable owners is regarded as an important element of the introduction of the Non Principal Private Residence Charge, given the payment levels in 2009 and in subsequent years.  The associated communication campaign, including media advertisements funded by my Department, information made available by local authorities, and website hosted information, in circumstances in which the legal onus is on the liable owner to declare liability and make payment, was cost effective and, in general, achieved its goals in terms of raising awareness and encouraging liable owners to make payment.  Much of this information, such as information available online, was available to liable persons living abroad.  On its introduction in 2009 the Charge was estimated to apply to some 200,000 properties and was expected to raise approximately &euro;40 million annually.  As of 14 January 2013 , the charge had been paid for 2012 in respect of 340, 552 properties, raising &euro;69, 641,680 for that year.   </p><p>  Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect non-principal private residence charges and late payment fees due to it, and all charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned.  In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.  Guidelines have also been issued to local authorities in relation to the operation of the &quot;care and management&quot; provisions of the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 and local authorities are expected to implement these guidelines appropriately. </p><p>The NPPR charge has been in operation for more than 4 years and has been the subject of much public discussion and commentary prior to, and following, its introduction.  Failure to declare a liability in respect of, or to fail to pay, the charge on non-principal private residences, are offences.  I urge all liable parties who have not paid the charge on non-principal private residences to contact their local authority as a matter of urgency.  Property owners who are unsure of their liability should also contact their local authority.</p></reply>

The Valuation Office is responsible for calculating the rateable valuation of premises and the type, size and location of the premises would be a factor in arriving at the rateable valuation.  The Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV), which is set by the local authority, is then applied to that rateable valuation.

Furthermore the Rural Development Programme (LEADER), delivered under my Department, aims to improve the quality of life and support the diversification of economic activity in rural areas.  The Rural Development Programme (RDP) supports a broad range of activities including the creation and development of micro-enterprises in rural areas.  The RDP for Ireland 2007- 2013 has a substantial budget of over &euro;300m, which represents a significant lever to stimulate economic development in rural areas.  Since it commenced in 2009 the RDP has supported over 3, 000 rural enterprise initiatives with the creation of over 1, 200 jobs.</p><p>Over the next three years, it is projected that the LEADER Programme will assist in the creation of up to 7 ,000 new jobs.  In addition my Department's Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP), which commenced in January 2010, aims to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between Government and its agencies and people in disadvantaged communities.  The Programme is underpinned by four high level goals, one of which, while not directly creating new jobs, is aimed at increasing peoples' work readiness and employment prospects.  In this regard, the following table outlines the number of individuals supported into employment and into self-employment in 2011 and the target for 2012.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>LCDP</div></th><th colspan="2"><div>2012 Targets</div></th><th colspan="2"><div>2011 Outputs </div></th></tr><tr><td>Individuals supported into employment </td><td><div>966 </div></td><td><div>5,613 </div></td><td><div>1,121 </div></td><td><div>6,163 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Individuals supported into self-employment </td><td><div>4,647 </div></td><td></td><td><div>5,042  </div></td><td></td></tr></table></p><p>Local authorities also have an important role in providing much of the physical and regulatory infrastructure essential to support enterprise and promote employment.  They deliver essential services to business and are geared to respond to the needs of local communities, employers and entrepreneurs speedily and efficiently.  Local authorities are very active in promoting the commercial and enterprise interests of their areas, working with other State agencies and local business across all areas that can benefit their local communities and the enterprise sector.  Local authorities are acutely aware of the need to assist in the response to the jobs crisis at the local level, and assist and network with other agencies in the delivery of their responses to the crisis at the local level.  It is in that context that achievement of measures in the Action Plan for Jobs will assist in creating a pro-enterprise supportive environment to generate new jobs and sustain existing ones.</p></reply>

The Wicklow Way is one of over 40 National Waymarked Ways that are the backbone of the walking product in Ireland.</p><p>  Wicklow is one of the first counties to develop an integrated representative trail management structure, &quot;The Wicklow Way Partnership&quot;, whose members are:</p><p>- Coillte </p><p>- Wicklow County Council   </p><p>- Mountain Meitheal (A Volunteer Trail Conservation Group).   </p><p>- National Parks and Wildlife Service   </p><p>- The Dublin Mountains Partnership (managing the Wicklow Way in County Dublin)   </p><p>- County Wicklow Partnership (managing the trail on private lands)   </p><p>Its aims include developing a multiyear plan for the strategic development of the Wicklow Way by agreement and pooling of resources to bring the Wicklow Way to top international standard and recognition.</p><p>  In that regard, it is accepted that, where possible, walking routes offer the user safe, secure and stimulating surroundings.  To achieve that, it is important that routes are off road where possible with the agreement of the landowners concerned.  However, all land in Ireland is in private or state ownership.  Participants in recreation activities should be aware that there is no legal right of access to the Irish countryside.  Those who enter onto private land, for the purpose of recreation, do so on the basis of the goodwill and permission of landowners. </p><p>  Following consultations, the Wicklow Way Partnership have identified sections of the Wicklow Way for re-routing and upgrading; two sections in particular are regarded as high priority for rerouting.</p><p><b>Ballinastoe Re-Route Proposal</b></p><p>  A route has been identified that would enable approximately 1 km of trail to be taken off a busy and dangerous road section at Ballinastoe.  The new trail would go through lands managed by National Parks and Wildlife Service and Coillte.  It would join up with a newly constructed trail at the northern end close to Lough Tay and come out at a lay-by close to the Pier Gates at the southern end of the Coillte property that includes the Coillte Mountain Bike Trail facility.  Agreement has been reached on the re-routing of the Ballinastoe section following a commitment of &#8364;18,500 from my Department towards the completion of the project.  Work is underway and is due for completion this spring.   </p><p><b>Glencullen Re-Route Proposal</b></p><p>  Currently approximately 2 km of trail are on road on the R116 at Glencullen.  A possible re-route has been identified, some of which is on state lands owned by Coillte, which, as a key member of the Wicklow Way Partnership, is keen to facilitate the proposed re-route.  The remainder of the proposed re-route would be on private land and while discussions are on-going, no agreement has been reached to date.  However, I am hopeful of a positive outcome in due course.</p></reply>

The Rural Recreation Section within my Department oversees the implementation of the National Countryside Recreation Strategy (NCRS).  The Strategic Objectives set out in the Strategy are:-   </p><p>1.  To achieve sustainable and responsible recreation in the countryside.   </p><p>2.  To promote caring recreational use of the countryside.   </p><p>3.  To develop a national framework that promotes the rights and responsibilities of both owners and users.   </p><p>4.  To develop a suitable structure to deliver a national countryside recreation service in a strategic and co-ordinated way.   </p><p>5.  To secure a package of funding mechanisms to deliver on the objectives of the strategy.   </p><p>  The ongoing development of the activity tourism sector is of strategic importance for Ireland given the potential to leverage job creation and improve exchequer revenue from both foreign and domestic tourism.  Walking remains the most popular activity, with preliminary 2011 figures showing that over 740,000 overseas visitors claim to have gone hiking/cross-country walking in 2011.  Existing measures to address erosion include the Walks Scheme and a pilot Mountain Access Scheme currently under development.  The Walks Scheme represents an innovative response to facilitating the development and maintenance of many of Ireland's key walking trails.  The main point of the Scheme is that it brings in the landholders as key participants in the provision of high quality walking trails, by contracting them to undertake maintenance work on the trails in line with agreed work plans.  The Walks Scheme is currently operating on 40 trails supported by over 1,800 landowners and is being managed by 16 Local Development Companies around the country.  The pilot Mountain Access Scheme is currently being implemented at Mount Gable in Connemara and a more significant scheme is being developed for Carrauntuohill and the MacGillicuddy Reeks in Co. Kerry.  These pilot Mountain Access projects are being progressed with a view to developing best practice in relation to the sustainable trails and walking routes in the uplands.  A focus of these pilots will be the management and repair of erosion and other negative consequences arising from increased activity in sensitive landscapes.   </p><p>  With regard to the alleged continued illegal use of quads, dune buggies, scramblers and other motor vehicles on national trails , such activity while undesirable and damaging to the landscape is generally not illegal, as there is no overarching legislation in place to that effect.  Many of these trails cross private land and it is a matter for individual landowners to address, many of whom use quads and similar vehicles as part of their daily work practices.  Where trails cross State lands it is a matter for the individual State Agencies to manage through Byelaws and subsequent enforcement. </p><p>  However, this activity takes place off trail also, particularly in upland areas.  A proportion of upland, coastal and other areas where such activities can take place are designated as Special Areas of Conservation, Special Protection Areas or Natural Heritage Areas.  There is no general prohibition on the use of off-road vehicles in such areas.  However, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has powers under Regulation 29 of the European Communities (Birds And Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011, by ministerial Direction, to control specified activities where the Minister has reason to believe that these activities will have a significant effect on a European Site or an adverse effect on the integrity of a European Site.  Activities to which Directions apply may include the operation or use of any off-road or other vehicle.</p></reply>

The Committee includes representatives from the Irish Banking Federation, local authorities, the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, NAMA and the construction sector.  Real progress is being made with regard to the public safety works required to improve the living conditions of existing residents on some unfinished estates and the Committee is meeting on a regular basis to oversee this effort.  Site Resolution Plans (SRP's) have been identified by the NCC as a key tool in resolving issues associated with unfinished housing developments.  Such plans enable stakeholders, including developers, local authorities, financial institutions, NAMA and residents to collaborate in determining how best to pursue resolution of problematic sites.  The process also entails working with stakeholders in identifying the best long-term solution for developments in terms of their configuration, use of vacant buildings and ownership.  Such solutions also take account of the best interests of residents. </p><p>The NCC has produced a Guidance Manual on Resolving and Managing Unfinished Estates, a Key Stakeholders Code of Practice, and a Guide for Residents Living in Unfinished Housing Developments, all of which are available at www.housing.ie.  My Department launched the Public Safety Initiative in March 2011, which provided funding to address immediate public safety issues.  The types of works that have been approved to date under the PSI include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting and other works to secure sites.  Under the PSI, my Department has made allocations totalling some &euro; 3.88 million to 21 local authorities from the funding made available.  A provision of &euro;2m was made for 2012 and to date a total of &euro; 2.48 million has been drawn down by local authorities.  As outlined in the National Housing Development Survey 2012, the results of which I published last   November, real progress has been made in tackling the issues faced by the residents of unfinished housing developments, with a 37% decrease in the number of unfinished developments since 2010 and nearly 300 developments effectively resolved in the last 12 months.  I am satisfied that the work carried out through the NCC continues to tackle the problems associated with unfinished housing developments. </p><p>  Issues relating to the resolution of individual estates are matters for the relevant local authority, and my Department has no remit in this regard.  However, my Department has been in contact with Monaghan County Council and I have been advised that work has been on-going between them and the responsible parties.  The local authority has outlined a proposal whereby the occupied element of this development will have the necessary works carried out to address the needs of the residents, while the unfinished element will be partitioned and public safety concerns addressed.  It is expected that these works will be carried out during the course of the year.</p></reply>

The Building Regulations include 12 parts dealing with a range of safety and related matters and each part is accompanied by a Technical Guidance Document (TGD) outlining how the relevant legal requirement may be achieved.  Part L of the Regulations came into effect on 1 January, 2003.

In the case of the energy efficiency measure, the objective is to improve the Building Energy Rating (BER) of the dwelling to a C1 standard where possible.</p></reply>

There was no existing comprehensive database of residential properties and their owners within the State prior to the Household Charge being introduced.  The collection of the Household Charge via self-assessment declaration provides for the collation of such information in relation to residential property.  Local authorities have worked to identify undeclared properties through appropriate data sharing provisions, and significant efforts have been expended in matching self-declared information with other datasets and in refining the resulting data.   </p><p>  I understand that the addresses and names used in letters issued by Local Authorities in recent months reminding people to pay the Household Charge have been based on a data matching exercise with the Property Registration Authority.  I also understand that every effort has been made to try and ensure letters are sent to current property owners.  However there are some instances where letters are being sent to previous owners of properties, due to the fact that the more recent property owners may not have registered their property with the Authority or the transfer of the property has not been completed.  Thus in some cases the information contained within these datasets may not reflect the most recent and relevant details.  In other instances, letters have unfortunately been sent to deceased persons.  I appreciate that receipt of such a letter may cause upset to relatives of a deceased person.  However, in the absence of a comprehensive database, such instances, while regrettable, have been unavoidable in a context in which the Agency and local authorities have worked to maximise compliance with a charge which funds essential local services for communities. </p><p>  I understand that the letters issued invite recipients who are not liable, or who have previously paid the household charge, or in the event of inaccuracy or error, to contact the Household Charge Bureau to allow the Agency to update their records accordingly.</p></reply>

I have no function in relation to the specific matter in question.   </p><p>However, in relation to wind energy development generally, the Wind Energy Development Guidelines, which were published by my Department on 29 June 2006, provide advice to planning authorities on catering for wind energy through the development plan process.  The guidelines are also intended to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country in the identification of suitable locations for wind energy development and the treatment of planning applications for such developments.  This mapping of suitable locations is carried out through the development plan process which makes extensive statutory provision for public consultation.  Planning legislation provides for extensive public notification of proposed development.  For example, article 17 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 &#8211; 2010 requires an applicant to erect a site notice in order to lodge a valid application for planning permission.  Article 19 of the Regulations requires that this notice must be placed in a conspicuous position on or near the main entrance from a public road to the land or structure concerned, so as to be easily visible and legible by persons using the public road.  Alternatively, if the land or structure does not adjoin a public road, the site notice should be placed so as to be easily visible and legible by persons outside the land or structure. </p><p>The site notice must contain the date on which the site notice is erected and state that the planning application may be inspected or purchased at the offices of the planning authority and that a submission or observation in relation to the application may be made to the authority in writing, on payment of the prescribed fee, within the five weeks beginning on the date of receipt by the planning authority of the application.  The applicant must erect the site notice no sooner than<b></b>two weeks before making the application for permission in order to facilitate third party inspection of the application.  Where it appears to a planning authority that any notice does not comply with these requirements they may require the applicant to give further notice and evidence in relation to compliance with such a requirement.</p><p>Article 18 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2006 also provides that a notice be published in a newspaper approved for this purpose.  Each planning authority must decide which newspapers should be included on its approved list of newspapers in order to ensure that the newspapers used for the purpose of such notices have a sufficiently large circulation in its functional area.</p><p>In addition the planning authority must, under section 34(3) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, have regard to any observations or submissions received concerning the proposed development in accordance with the relevant regulations. </p><p>Furthermore, any person who makes a submission to the planning authority may appeal the decision of the planning authority to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The board in some instances, at its own discretion, holds oral hearings in relation to cases being considered by it, further adding to the opportunities to participate in the decision-making process.</p></reply>

All sections of the Act have been commenced and its implementation is ongoing. </p><p>  Many of the provisions are implemented on an ongoing basis, for example, Government Departments make provision for expenditure on service delivery on an annual basis.  Departments and other public bodies are also implementing the accessibility provisions of the Act including appointing access officers and provision of complaints procedures. </p><p>  In addition, a number of key initiatives have been implemented since the commencement of the Act.  In 2006 sectoral plans for relevant Government Departments were published and provided for how these Departments would serve the needs of people with disabilities and set out a programme for future development.  Codes of practice in respect of accessibility of public services, information provided by public bodies and heritage sites have been published by the National Disability Authority.  Part 5 of the Act provides for a statutory target for the recruitment and employment of people with disabilities in the public sector.  This provision is ongoing and annual monitoring reports are prepared by the National Disability Authority.  A centre of excellence in universal design was established in 2007 in the National Disability Authority and is dedicated to enabling the design of environments that can be accessed, understood and used regardless of age, size and ability.</p><p>  Section 6 provides for a review of the operation of the Act not later than five years after commencement.  This review was completed and a report was published in July 2010.</p><p>  Part 2 of the Act is the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  In 2006 a cross-sectoral team was established to provide for a joint approach by the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills to the implementation of the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Education Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004.  The team now includes a representative of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p><p>  Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 provides disabled individuals with an entitlement to an independent assessment of need and a statement of proposed services to be provided and allows them to pursue a complaint and, if necessary, make an appeal to the independent Disability Appeals Officer.  Part 2 of the Act was commenced on 1 June 2007 in respect of children under the age of five.  It had been intended to have both the Disability Act 2005 and the EPSEN Act 2004 fully implemented during 2010 for children and young people aged up to 18.  However, in 2008 the then Government decided, in light of financial circumstances, to defer further implementation of both Acts.  Notwithstanding this the cross-sectoral team continues to meet to address issues of mutual concern for children with disabilities. </p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware of the work relating to the National Disability Strategy and the intention of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, in line with commitments in the Programme for Government, to agree and publish an implementation plan for that strategy in the coming months.</p></reply>

Having said that, both the Revenue Customs Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to make significant efforts, separately and together, to disrupt the activities of those involved in this type of criminal activity. </p><p>Searches are regularly undertaken by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the request of the Revenue Customs Service as part of intelligence-led operations led by that Service.  Incidents relating to the sale or supply of counterfeit goods reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are the subject of investigation.  Members of a specialist unit within the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation are available to provide assistance and advice in respect of such investigations and regularly assist with investigations at District or Divisional level.  In addition, the sale of goods at markets is the subject of regular and ongoing monitoring by Garda&iacute; for counterfeit goods and products.  Furthermore, the Intellectual Property Crime Unit at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation works with relevant agencies, including the Revenue Customs Service, to provide a multi-agency approach to tackling this activity and to facilitate the co-ordination of investigations. </p><p>  Due to the transnational nature of counterfeiting activity, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also work with other stakeholders to monitor any new innovations in this type of criminal activity.  This includes liaising with other policing and customs agencies in neighbouring jurisdictions.  Such cross border co-operation includes, for example, cross-border task forces which have been established with the authorities in Northern Ireland to specifically target the distribution of illegal fuels and tobacco products.  These task forces comprise representatives from the Police Service of Northern Ireland, HM Revenue Customs, the Serious Organised Crime Agency (UK), Revenue Commissioners, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Criminal Assets Bureau. </p><p>  I can assure the Deputy of the continued commitment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackling such criminal activity.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-16a.1975.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013011600071#WRHH02600"><p>In the interests of clarity, what is referred to as 'an application for leave to remain' refers to the submission of written representations to the Minister for Justice and Equality against the making of a Deportation Order, pursuant to the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended).  In all such cases, before a final decision is made, consideration is given to the eleven separate headings set out in Section 3 (6) of the 1999 Act, the provisions of Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement and other relevant legal and constitutional provisions.  Such decision making is also guided by, among other things, international law and Supreme and High Court judgments.  This process is followed in asylum related cases and in the cases of illegal immigrants.  The ultimate decision will be to make a Deportation Order or to grant Leave to Remain in the State for a specified period and subject to stated conditions.</p><p> Before a third country national can apply for leave to remain, he or she must be served with a notification of intention to deport, as provided for under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended). In this connection, in the years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 (to the end of November) a total of 3,185, 5,037, 4,326, 2,471 and 1,991 notifications of intention to deport were issued by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS).  Arising from the decision-making process described in the foregoing, many of these cases have been finalised<b></b> through the granting of subsidiary protection, the granting of permission to remain under different headings (including under EU treaty rights, through marriage to an Irish national or under family reunification provisions), the making of deportation orders and the voluntary repatriation, formally and informally, of many of the persons involved.  Other cases cannot be finalised owing to the existence of judicial review proceedings while a further cohort of cases will clearly remain to be decided.  Precise figures for each of these categories are not available for each of the years in question without engaging in a very detailed exercise which would not be justified as it would divert resources from case processing which obviously is a higher priority.  </p><p>  The Deputy should note that the processing of cases at the repatriation stage is a complex one with obligations to adhere to both domestic and international laws and jurisprudence and to make decisions in accordance with the UN Convention on Human Rights.  However, I am anxious that all cases are processed as quickly as possible and, to this end, additional staff members have been deployed to this area of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service in recent years and substantial investment has been made in the development of technology required to support the processing of such cases.  Additionally, the current multi-layered approach to the processing of cases of asylum origin is clearly not resource efficient nor applicant friendly and that is why I am providing for a single-procedure-based approach in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which I plan to progress in 2013.  This proposed single-procedure will require applicants to advance, at the outset, all reasons, protection or otherwise, behind their request to remain in the State.  As a result, the days of the multi-layered approach to dealing with such cases will cease.    </p><p>  Finally, I might add that I recently approved an initiative to put in place a panel with legal expertise who will assist the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service in processing a cohort of repatriation cases, thus speeding up the overall process and reducing the time spent by persons in the direct provision system.  I would expect to see significant dividends, in terms of cases finalised, from this initiative in the coming months.</p></reply>

This new unified system will replace the separate systems still in place for betting and gaming under the Betting Act 1931 and the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956, as amended.  The regulator's responsibilities will extend to the regulation of land-based outlets, including modest-sized casinos, as well as services offered by telephone, internet, interactive TV or by any other electronic means. </p><p>  My Department has at all times maintained an open and proper relationship with the gambling sector.  It conducted a formal consultation process in 2010 and it made submissions available on its website.  It has, at their request, met several organisations and individuals in the period since the Government agreed in 2011 to prepare new legislation.  Looking ahead, I am planning to make the heads of the Bill available on my Department's website once they have been approved by the Government and my officials will be pleased to receive comments on them at that time. </p></reply>

The term &quot;quango&quot; is an acronym which stands for quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations. No non-governmental organisations fall under the remit of my Department. </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the radical streamlining of State bodies is a key deliverable of the Public Service Reform Plan, published in November 2011.  This streamlining includes the rationalisation of 48 bodies by the end of 2012, as well as the critical review of a further 46 bodies to take place by the end of June 2012.  Details of the bodies involved are set out in Appendices IIa and IIb of the Plan which can be found at: <i>.</i></p><p>  On 31 October 2012, my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, announced an update in relation to the programme of rationalisation of State bodies.  While these rationalisations will deliver savings to the taxpayer, the real benefits lie in the simplification of the administrative landscape, thereby ensuring greater accountability, less duplication of effort and more transparent lines of responsibility of public servants.  It is not possible at this time to specify anticipated savings on an individual State body basis.  However, the Public Service Reform Plan indicated that across the public service as a whole, savings of 20 million euro in enhanced service efficiencies and value-for-money are envisaged from the rationalisation programme.</p><p>  With regard to the specific details now sought I wish to inform the Deputy that the information he requested is set out below.  Unfortunately, it was not possible to include a response from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the timeframe allowed.  As soon as this information becomes available, it will be forwarded directly to the Deputy.</p><p><b>Equality Tribunal</b>: Administrative responsibility for the Equality Tribunal transferred from the Department of Justice and Equality to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with effect from 1 January 2013, as part of the wider rationalisation of the industrial relations/employee rights institutions - Labour Court, Labour Relations Commission, Employee Appeals Tribunal, National Employment Rights Authority and Equality Tribunal - into single Workplace Relations Service.  This overall rationalisation of industrial relations institutions is being led by my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  While this rationalisation will deliver savings to the taxpayer, the real benefits lie in the simplification of the administrative landscape, thereby ensuring greater accountability, less duplication of effort and more transparent lines of access to redress for people who consider their rights have been infringed.</p><p><b>Forensic Science Laboratory:</b>  The Government has decided to place the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) within the ambit of the State Laboratory as a merger is not possible at this time for reasons primarily related to the separate geographical locations of both laboratories and the lack of overlap in their functional operations.  The budget and staff resources of the FSL will not be affected by this decision as the agency will remain under the auspices of my Department due to the existing strong synergies with other facets of the criminal justice system.  However, it is intended that the Government decision will facilitate and encourage closer co-operation between the laboratories as well as the pursuit of savings in areas such as professional training and equipment purchase.</p><p><b>Independent International Commission on Decommissioning:</b>  The Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD) was responsible for overseeing the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons.  It was established by an agreement between the Irish and British Governments, signed on 26 August 1997, and by legislation enacted in the two jurisdictions.  It was dissolved on 31 March 2011.  The outturn for the Commission's last full year of operation 2010 was &#8364;594,000. </p><p><b>  Independent Monitoring Commission:</b>  The Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC) was responsible for monitoring and reporting on paramilitary activity across Ireland and also for monitoring the security normalisation measures undertaken by the British Government in the North.  It was dissolved on 31 March 2011.  The outturn for the Commission's last full year of operation 2010 was &#8364;426,000.</p><p><b>Internet Safety Advisory Council</b>: The Internet Safety Advisory Council was appointed by the Minister for Justice with effect from 1 December 2008.  It was not statutory or regulatory but it was advisory.  The mandate for the Internet Safety Advisory Council expired on 30 November 2011.  The Chair of the Internet Safety Advisory Council received remuneration of &#8364;8,978 per year.  The Internet Safety Advisory Committee succeeded the previous Internet Safety Advisory Council and it held its first meeting on 12 April 2012.  The Chair does not receive any remuneration.   <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p><b>Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission:</b> Preparations to establish the new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, which will replace the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority, are at a very advanced stage and I hope to be in a position to make a further announcement in relation to the appointment of the new Commission soon.  While there will be administrative efficiencies and savings from the merger, the two existing bodies have suffered disproportionate cuts in the past and as I have already indicated, the cash savings will remain with the new Commission to support its core work.  In relation to staffing, the new Commission will as a priority be invited to undertake a staffing review and submit a business case for any additional resources it considers necessary to fulfil its mandate.</p><p><b>National Disability Strategy Implementation Group: </b>On 30 November, 2011 the National Disability Strategy Implementation Group (NDSIG) was established and is chaired by Minister of State Deputy, Kathleen Lynch.  This group replaces the former National Disability Strategy Stakeholder Monitoring Group (NDSSMG).  Its function is to provide a forum under the leadership of the Minister within which Government officials and disability stakeholders can work together, to guide the development of a National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan and to collaborate on its implementation including advising on the resolution of implementation difficulties. </p><p><b>Prisons Authority Interim Board:</b>  The Prisons Authority Interim Board was abolished on 26 July, 2011.  The amount saved is in excess of  &#8364;100,000 per annum.<b></b></p><p><b>Prison Visiting Committees:</b>The Government has approved the drafting of a General Scheme of an Inspection of Places of Detention Bill, which will include provisions to make visiting committees more effective, while they continue their role of visiting prisons, meeting with prisoners and liaising on their behalf with prison authorities.  A link will be established between the visiting committees and the Inspector of Prisons.  As part of these plans, it is intended to expand the role of the Inspector of Prisons. Under the proposed arrangements, it is my intention that visiting committees would be able to report any urgent or major matter to the Inspector at any time.  Subject to competing legislative priorities, it is expected that the General Scheme will be published by the end of the year.  When work on preparation of the General Scheme has been completed, I will be seeking Government approval for its publication to facilitate a consultation process in advance of drafting and publication of the Bill. </p><p><b>  Property Registration Authority:</b>  A proposal has been made to merge the Valuation Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Property Registration Authority.  Following the Government approval of the recommendation of the Critical Review on this proposal, work is underway to advance this merger.</p><p><b>Reception and Integration Agency, Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and Refugee Appeals Tribunal:</b> Consolidation of refugee structures will be addressed through the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.  The Bill will provide for the Office of the Refugee Applications Commission (ORAC) to be subsumed into INIS - the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.  The Bill will also provide for the replacement of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal with the new Protection Review Tribunal.</p></reply>

It is a statutory requirement that,<i> inter alia</i>, applicants for naturalisation be of good character.

To the extent that all prosecutions are disclosed under existing arrangements, a prosecution resulting in an order dismissing the charges or discharging the offender conditionally under the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 would be disclosed. </p><p>  However, this will no longer be the case following the enactment and commencement of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012.  Under that Act, &quot;criminal records&quot; which will be subject to automatic disclosure are defined (in Section 2) as &quot;(a) a record of the person's convictions, whether within or outside the State, for any criminal offences, together with any ancillary or consequential orders made pursuant to the convictions concerned, or  (b) a record of any prosecutions pending against the person, whether within or outside the State, for any criminal offence, or both;&quot;.</p><p>  As automatic disclosures will be limited to convictions or pending prosecutions, an order dismissing the charge under the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 will not be automatically disclosed on foot of an application for a vetting disclosure following the commencement of the new vetting legislation.  However, it may be information which could be disclosed under the category of 'specified information'.  Under the Act, this is information, other than criminal records, which concerns a finding or allegation of harm to another person which is of such a nature as to reasonably give rise to a <i>bona fide</i> concern that the person may harm a child or vulnerable person.  However, the disclosure of such information is subject to the prior notice of the vetting subject and requires a pre-disclosure assessment as to the relevance of the information concerned to the type of work or activity to which the application for vetting relates.  There is also provision for the vetting subject to appeal a decision to disclose such information.    </p><p>  The National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act passed all stages on 19 December, 2012 and was signed by the President on 26 December, 2012. </p><p>  A response has been issued to the correspondence in question. </p></reply>

Our migrant population have made a valuable contribution to the economic, cultural and social life of Ireland and will continue to do so. However, I believe that it is not unreasonable to ask those who benefit from the immigration system to make a reasonable contribution to the cost of services and particularly so in a time when we are seeking to reduce public expenditure.  It is common practice throughout Europe to charge a fee for immigration services; in some instances these may be set at a level above the estimated direct administrative cost of the service based on the value of the service.  By comparison with many jurisdictions the current registration fee represents very good value.</p><p>  The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department is undertaking a number of projects with the aim of developing and improving immigration services.  These include the introduction of a new common format EU Residence Permit for non-nationals which will replace the current registration certificate. It will provide the user with a more secure immigration document including individual biometrics indicators protected by a sophisticated encryption system and showing the holders&rsquo; immigration status in the State.   This high quality secure document will be easily recognisable for employers and Government agencies. </p><p>  Furthermore, INIS as part of its reform of in-country aspects of immigration services, is developing a range of measures including online application and appointment systems for certain services. Such a service is badly needed, but it does cost money to implement. The nature of immigration requirements such as registration necessitates, to a very great extent, the personal attendance of the applicant. At certain times of the year this can give rise to long queues and significant delays. A self-selecting online system will help to greatly alleviate these difficulties and the increased registration fee income will be used to meet a portion of the cost involved in this and other developments undertaken. </p><p>  The fee was first introduced in 2006 and was then set at &euro;100. It was increased to &euro;150 in 2008 and remained at that level until the latest increase came into effect on 19 November, 2012. While I have no immediate plans for further changes to the fee for the issue of a registration certificate, it is the practice to keep all fees under review.</p><p>  I should point out that in recognition of the circumstances of certain categories of person, there are specific exemptions from paying the registration fee set out in the regulations; these are the following: </p><p>- UN Convention Refugees; </p><p>- Family members of such refugees who have been admitted to the State in accordance with section  18 of the Refugee Act 1996;</p><p>- Persons who are under 18 years of age at the time of registration;</p><p>- Spouses, civil partners, widows and widowers of Irish citizens;</p><p>- Spouses and Dependants of EU nationals who receive a residence permit under EU Directive 38/04;</p><p>- Programme Refugees, as defined by section 24 of the Refugee Act, 1996;</p><p>- Persons subject to arrangements for victims of human trafficking.</p><p>  The above categories of non-nationals exempted from the fee payment are almost 24.4% of the total numbers registering. In 2012, this amounted to 22,781 persons and &euro;3.78 million in fees waived.  </p></reply>

The fee, along with ordinary visa fees, is classed as a diplomatic and consular fee and is, therefore, set by my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade under S.I. No. 82/2004 - Diplomatic and Consular Fees (Amendment) Regulations 2004. No increase in fees has been applied since 2004.</p><p>   The Irish visa system is intended to be self-financing and the revenue generated through the re-entry visa system is significant in ensuring this is the case. This is particularly important given the current economic climate. I consider this a reasonable fee in the circumstances and it has been found to compare favourably with the equivalent fee applied internationally.</p><p>  Some exemptions exist for re-entry visa fees including:</p><p>- Visa fee exemptions for certain family members of EU nationals, under the provisions of the EU Free Movement Directive.</p><p>- Exemptions to certain family members of Irish citizens. It is estimated that over 1 in 8 re-entry visa applications during 2012 were fee-exempt.</p><p>  It is important to note that in fact most people apply for and are issued multi-entry re-entry visas (the fee in this case being &euro;100), allowing them, usually for the duration of their registration, to travel out of and back to Ireland freely. </p><p>  I also wish to point out to the Deputy that the annual re-entry visa application total has fallen from over 64,000 in 2010 to 53,500 in 2011. Preliminary numbers for 2012 indicate approximately 44,000 re-entry visas were issued. This fall most probably reflects the significant  increase in the number of citizenship applications granted since I entered office, which has in turn reduced the number of visa-required non-EEA nationals requiring re-entry visas.</p><p>  I would also like to advise the Deputy that, in the absence of exit controls, re-entry visas have a role to play in the area of immigration control and security, providing greater visibility on movements out of and back into the country, notably the movements of children under 16; certain abuses in this area have come to light as a result of the issuing of re-entry visas.</p></reply>

The Act will be commenced in due course as the necessary preparations for administration of its provisions are finalised.</p><p>  The Act provides for the introduction of three new debt resolution processes, which though requiring approval by the court, are essentially non-judicial in nature:</p><p>- The Debt Relief Notice (DRN) will allow for the write-off of qualifying unsecured debt up to &euro;20,000, subject to a three year supervision period. </p><p>- The Debt Settlement Arrangement (DSA) provides for the agreed settlement of unsecured debt, with no limit involved, normally over five years. </p><p>- The Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) will enable the agreed settlement of secured debt up to &euro;3 million, although this cap may be increased with the consent of all secured creditors, and unsecured debt without limit, normally over six years.</p><p>  The Act also continues the reform of the Bankruptcy Act 1988, begun in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 and will include, critically, the introduction of automatic discharge from bankruptcy, subject to certain conditions, after 3 years in place of the current 12 years.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that we have to see how the new legislation works, for some months at least. It is not for me to speculate as to the future conduct of any of the participants in an insolvency process. However, I am of the view that new personal insolvency laws, including the bankruptcy law reform, should provide a significant incentive for financial institutions to develop and implement realistic agreements to manage or settle debt with their customers. Such agreements should in time become the norm as the most sensible and cost-effective arrangements, particularly where the issue is one of dealing with repayment difficulties for a single major debt, secured or otherwise. These agreements could include measures to address mortgage arrears.</p><p>  However, let there be no doubt that financial institutions must constructively engage under this legislation in the public interest, the interest of those in financial difficulties and the interest of their own institutions and credibility. If I find within a short period during the operation of this legislation that all or some of the financial institutions are intent on not engaging constructively with the personal insolvency arrangement provisions for whatever reason, I will not be slow to bring proposals to Government to amend the legislation. </p><p>  The Government has engaged with the financial institutions in the lead-in to the enactment of this legislation. They understand exactly where the Government is coming from, what our concerns are and what they should do in the context of operating the legislation constructively and sensibly, engaging with personal insolvency practitioners and the circumstances of their customers and ensuring appropriate and sensible arrangements are made.</p></reply>

In preparing that plan, the Commissioner reviewed all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the operation of Garda stations, both in terms of opening hours and possible closures. In addition, all Divisional Officers were asked to assess the level of activity in each Garda Station in their area.</p><p>  The Commissioner has concluded that the communities covered by the areas in question could be better served by having Garda&iacute; patrolling the areas rather than being confined to a specific premises. The Commissioner has also indicated that wherever possible and subject to operational requirements, Garda&iacute; attached to a station which is scheduled for closure will be assigned within the local District.</p><p>  Specifically in relation to the station referred to by the Deputy, Stepaside is in the Blackrock District in the Dublin Metropolitan Eastern Division and it is approximately 8 kilometres from the District Headquarters at Blackrock Garda Station and  6 kilometres from Dundrum Garda Station.  There are 34 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na assigned to the Stepaside. The Commissioner has indicated that these members will, insofar as possible, remain in the Blackrock District and will be transferred to Dundrum Garda Station.   The freeing up of Garda&iacute; from desk duties in Stepaside Garda Station will increase the number of Garda&iacute; available for frontline policing to the benefit of the community in Stepaside.</p><p>  The implementation of the reduction in the number of Garda stations and Districts will take place in full consultation with the local communities and staffing interests. Local Garda management will engage with these communities through the Joint Policing Committees and other fora to advise them of the revised policing arrangements for the localities in question. The objective will be to ensure that the best possible policing service will be provided to the public at all times.</p></reply>

In addition, specific members of the Force are tasked with their execution. While genuine difficulties can arise where it does not prove possible to enforce a warrant, it is obviously important that systems are in place to ensure that warrants are enforced as quickly as possible.   In this regard, I have been assured by the Garda Commissioner that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na give priority to the execution of warrants in respect of serious crime and will continue to do so.</p><p>Of its nature, the figure for outstanding warrants recorded by PULSE at any given time reflects an accumulation of old warrants which has arisen over the years. Warrants will continue to show on PULSE until such time as they are recorded as being finally disposed of and, as some of the warrants in question are outstanding for many years, I am concerned that the total figure for outstanding warrants as shown on PULSE may not be a reliable indicator of the number of 'live' warrants which are enforceable which are on hand.</p><p>I have asked the Garda Commissioner to consider whether there may be a better way of maintaining statistics which gives a more realistic indication in relation to any backlog of warrants and to report to me on measures being taken to improve the execution of warrants generally. In this regard I am also advised that there is a warrants working group in place which facilitates liaison between the various stakeholders, including the Court Service and the Prison Service and which works to identify, address and prevent difficulties in the warrants process. The work of the group is ongoing and relevant recommendations for the improvement of systems are being implemented on an ongoing basis.</p><p>I am in ongoing contact with the Commissioner on this matter and I have indicated to him that if he has any recommendations in relation to legislative or administrative action which is open to me as Minister, then I will, of course, consider them very carefully. The Garda Commissioner has assured me that both he and his senior management team are closely monitoring the situation with a view to ensuring that warrants are executed as expeditiously as possible. I expect to receive a further report from the Garda authorities in relation to this matter in the coming months.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-16a.2068.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013011600071#WRKK02100"><p>The Deputy will recall that following extensive consideration of this matter, the Government announced in December 2011 that it had decided not to proceed with such legislation.  There was a substantial concern that any legislative scheme involving interference in the contractual relationships of private parties would find it extremely difficult to survive a Constitutional challenge.  In addition, the Government was advised that any model proposed would require the payment of compensation to landlords whose rights were infringed in order to ensure that the proposal would be compatible with the Constitution and with the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Government was strongly of the view that payment of compensation to landlords in such circumstances could not be justified in the current economic climate.</p><p>  Although legislative intervention may not be feasible, NAMA is playing a role in dealing with problems caused by upward only rent reviews applying to NAMA properties.  I have been advised that, by the end of 2012, the Agency had granted 212 applications for rent abatement with an aggregate annual value of &euro;13.5 million. A further 56 applications are currently under review. Of the 276 eligible applications received to date only 8 have been refused representing a 97% approval rate by NAMA.</p><p>  I would also mention that the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 provides for the establishment and maintenance of a Commercial Leases Database by the Property Services Regulatory Authority.  This Database will assist in providing readily accessible, accurate information in order to determine the market rent payable in respect of comparable commercial properties.  Work is underway to ensure that the Database will be operational at an early date.</p><p>Finally, I wish to highlight the existence of a rent review arbitration code which was drawn up by a group of experts whose membership was drawn from all stakeholders in the commercial property arena.  The code, which can be found on www.justice.ie, provides a mechanism to deal with the resolution of rent review disputes in the commercial property sector.</p></reply>

Under the Act, the grant of legal aid entitles the applicant to the services of a solicitor and, in certain circumstances, up to two counsel, in the preparation and conduct of their defence or appeal.

Those reforms must ensure that children in lesbian or gay family units are able to form a legal connection with their non-biological parent and that kindred relationships flow from such legal connection.

Unlike at the general law centres there is a significant amount of preparatory work done while a person is waiting for an appointment. The real driver here is the statute of limitations - any court proceedings must be initiated within two years and because of the almost invariable complexity attaching to medical negligence there is a large amount of work to be done before it can be established if there is merit in a case or not. Thus while some persons may wait six months to see a solicitor, others will be seen more quickly if the expiry of the statute of limitations is looming. </i></p><p>The table gives a breakdown of the waiting times for persons seeking legal services in each of the Board&rsquo;s law centres on the 1st   January 2013. The Board does not, at the moment, record as a statistic the number of applications that relate to family law matters and the number that relate to other matters. In or about 76% of cases dealt with are in the area of family law and it can be assumed that the number of applications is similar as a percentage. The Board continues to prioritise certain categories of cases and these cases will receive an immediate or near immediate service. The main categories of case types that are prioritised are public law child care cases, child abduction cases and domestic violence cases.</p><p>By way of explanation of the table, the Board has been piloting a &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach to service delivery and this approach is operative in a number of law centres. The pilot is in response to lengthening waiting times. The aim of the &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach is that every applicant gets to see a solicitor within a period of one month for the purpose of getting legal advice (consultations are broadly limited to 45 minutes). If the applicant requires further services they remain on the &lsquo;waiting list&rsquo;. Those centres in which the pilot was operative in 2012 show a waiting time for a &lsquo;triage&rsquo; appointment and a waiting time for a second consultation. The second consultation waiting time is calculated from the date of application and not from the date of the triage appointment.  In law centres where the triage is not in operation, the general waiting time is shown in months from the date of application. There is or has been a &lsquo;backlog&rsquo; of applicants to be seen for triage purposes hence it is taking time to reduce the waiting time for such an appointment to one month.</p><p>The Board is taking other steps in an effort to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery including:&middot;introducing a new case management system in its law centres;integrating its mediation and legal services; integrating its Refugee Legal Service into the general law centre service delivery model; and maintaining a high level of usage of private solicitors for family law cases in the District Court.</p><p>The reality is however that the Board must live within its budget and it is subject to the public service recruitment moratorium (there is a very limited derogation). Demand for the Board&rsquo;s services has increased significantly since the down-turn in the economy. There was a 10% drop in demand at the general law centres in 2012 compared to 2011 however demand in 2011 was 93% greater than it was in 2006.</p><p>The capacity to provide a meaningful service is a priority for the Board and the Board will in 2013 be examining other options in an effort to enable legal services to be provided promptly to those most in need of them.</p></reply>

However, it is of course the case that the gross expenditure budget for the Vote Group in the current year will be over &euro;2.26 billion and this demonstrates the Government's very strong on-going commitment to the Justice Sector.  </p><p>  With regard specifically to the Garda Policing Plan for 2013, the position is that the Plan is based on a number of strategic goals and at its heart is the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's primary objective of combating crime as well as ensuring that people are safe in their communities and on the roads.  Copies of the Plan were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 5 December 2012. </p><p>  One of the key elements of the 2013 Plan is that it sets out proposals for continuing the process of restructuring the way in which Garda services are organised and delivered, with the objective of enhancing the efficiency of the Force at a time of financial constraint.  This copperfastens the commitment of the Commissioner, who is responsible for operational Garda matters, to smart policing, using available resources effectively and ensuring that the maximum number of Garda personnel are available for front-line policing.  </p><p>  In that overall context I believe that the objectives set out in the Garda Policing Plan for 2013 will be achieved and that, despite the pressure on the public finances, it will be possible for the Force to operate to the optimum benefit of our communities in a manner that will facilitate the presence of operational Garda&iacute; on patrol preventing and detecting crime.  </p></reply>

I also share the widespread outrage at the recent incidents of aggravated burglary referred to by the Deputy and am fully confident that the Garda&iacute; are doing everything in their power to bring the perpetrators of these appalling crimes to justice.</p><p>  The latest official crime statistics from the Central Statistics Office show that most types of crime are in fact falling, including crimes against the person, and this reflects well on the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>  I remain concerned, however, as does the Garda Commissioner, about the incidence of burglary and therefore welcome the progress being made as part of Operation Fiacla. The Operation is the subject of regular monitoring and review by senior Garda management and is focused on identifying and targeting gangs involved in burglaries around the country so as to disrupt their activities and bring them before the Courts.</p><p>  Operation Fiacla is intelligence driven, and specific burglary initiatives have been implemented in each Garda Region to target suspect offenders. These initiatives optimise the use of existing structures and local Garda management ensure that all personnel are fully briefed on the initiative, with Divisional Crime Management Teams playing a key coordination and implementation role.  </p><p>  I am further informed that, as of 31 December 2012, 3,538 persons have been arrested and 1,924 persons have been charged as part of the Operation, showing that the Garda Commissioner is effectively deploying the substantial resources available to him in a targeted approach to confront those engaged in this form of criminality. The latest quarterly figures for burglary suggest that Operation Fiacla is having an impact, when compared with the quarterly figures prior to its introduction.</p><p>  In addition to this specific operation, the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime and is directed and supported each year by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Annual Policing Plan.   Each Garda District and Divisional Officer also configures their policing response to local conditions to ensure that an appropriate policing service is delivered to rural areas. The Garda&iacute; continue to work closely with communities to enhance community safety in a wide range of local fora, including the Joint Policing Committees, and through programmes such as Community Alert which operates in cooperation with the programme partners, Muintir na T&iacute;re, and has led to the establishment of 1,345 Community Alert groups countrywide.  </p><p>  The Garda National Policing Plan for 2013, which I laid before the House, outlines the Garda Commissioner's proposals for the continued reorganisation and consolidation of the Garda station and district network. Until recently, the Garda station network was essentially the same as the RIC network which obtained in 1922. Such a large-scale static deployment of resources is no longer appropriate, particularly as the transport and communications infrastructure has been transformed. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a class-leading police computer system, a state-of-the-art digital radio system and a transport fleet which is currently receiving significant investment. The centralisation of Garda services will facilitate the introduction of an enhanced grid patrolling system that will be operational and intelligence led.  This patrol system will ensure that a high visibility and community oriented policing service continues to be delivered throughout the country. Furthermore, the new Garda rostering arrangements which were implemented last year provide a better match between Garda availability and policing demand. </p><p>  It is the Government's intention to ensure that frontline services are maintained at the highest level possible through the most efficient use of resources.  The Commissioner enjoys my full support and that of the Government in continuing to confront crime in all its forms.  I have every confidence that he and everyone in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to deliver an effective police service in rural as in all other areas.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

Arising from the refusal of her asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 30th May, 2008, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the then Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her. She was also notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.  </p><p>  The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</p><p>  In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  At that point, all representations submitted, including the information included with the Deputy's Question, will be considered before a final decision is made. Once a decision has been made, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned. </p><p>  The Deputy might wish to note also that a representative of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service wrote to the person concerned on 9th January, 2013 requesting specific information relating to her personal and domestic circumstances. Upon receipt of the requested information, the position in the State of the person concerned can be considered further.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-16a.2181.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013011600071#WRMM01300"><p>I wish to inform the Deputy that the provision of legal aid falls within two separate categories, i.e civil legal aid and criminal legal aid.  Details in respect of each category are as follows:</p><p><bu>Civil Legal Aid</bu></p><p>In respect of civil legal aid, state funding of &euro;32.922 million was allocated to the Legal Aid Board in 2012 and this level of funding has been maintained for this year. This covers funding for civil legal aid and advice, including legal services for asylum seekers, and also funding for the provision of the Family Mediation Service, for which the Board assumed responsibility in late 2011. There has been a significant increase in demand for civil legal aid services in recent years, with a greater number of people financially eligible as a result of the economic downturn. Final year figures for the number of cases handled in 2012 are not available but the outturn is likely to be similar to 2011, when there were, in total, over 23,650 legal aid and advice cases handled.</p><p>In view of the substantial demand for civil legal aid and the waiting times to access services, the Legal Aid Board is focusing on maximising the effectiveness of the resources available to it to deliver a meaningful service. Amongst the measures taken recently to this end are initiatives to increase the use of mediation to resolve family disputes, which leads to reduced legal costs, and the introduction of a 'triage' service to ensure that clients receive initial legal advice within one month of making an application for legal services. The Board is also striving to make its law centre network as effective and efficient as possible and the recent introduction of a new legal case management system will help in this regard. I should also point out that the Board introduced new conditions for retaining barristers in August 2012 which will result in lower fees paid to barristers in cases where they are instructed by Legal Aid Board solicitors.</p><p><bu>Criminal Legal Aid </bu></p><p>Expenditure on criminal legal aid for each of the past three years is set out in the table along with data as provided by the Courts Service on the number of legal aid certificates granted in the District Court.  It should be noted the number of certificates does not equate to the number of persons granted criminal legal aid as more than one certificate could be granted to any one person.  The number of legal aid certificates granted by the District Court in December 2012 is not yet available.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Year</div></th><th><div>Number of Certificates Granted </div></th><th><div>Expenditure(&#8364; million)</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>2010</div></td><td><div>55,412</div></td><td><div>56.544</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>54,092</div></td><td><div>56.116</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>46,293 (to end of November)</div></td><td><div>  50.534 (to end Dec)</div></td></tr></table></p><p>Under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, the Courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of criminal legal aid.  An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his/her means are insufficient to enable him/her to pay for legal representation him/herself.  The Court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the gravity of the charge or exceptional circumstances, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.</p><p>The nature of the Scheme is that it is demand-led, driven by the incidence of crime, detection rates and prosecutions of cases through the courts systems.  This renders it difficult to anticipate and control costs.  Since taking office I have introduced a number of adjustments to the fees available under the Scheme.  These included regulations which were introduced in 2011 which imposed a reduction of 10% in the fees payable in the District Court.  Fees payable in the Circuit and higher courts were also decreased by 10% following the reduction in the fees payable by the Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecution practitioners.  A reduction of 50% was applied to payments in respect of travel and subsistence.  As the Deputy will see from the table above, following these and other measures introduced in the course of 2011, a 10% reduction in expenditure was recorded in 2012 compared with 2011.  This is the first substantial reduction ever recorded under this scheme.</p><p>Parallel with the cuts in fees in 2011, the Task Force on Cost Reductions on Criminal Legal Aid highlighted areas of change related to the structures and systems of the courts which could contribute to cost reductions, not just for legal aid but across the system in general.  Following that process, the Chief Justice and I established a Working Group towards the end of 2011 to monitor implementation of these efficiency measures in the Circuit and District Courts and to identify further measures which could be adopted.   This Group, whose work is on-going,  is pursuing initiatives which can contribute to achieving efficiencies and cost reductions in the system such as, for example, introducing a pilot programme centralising custody cases in four court Districts and the introduction of the pre-trial procedure on a pilot basis in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court and the Midland Circuit Criminal Court.</p><p>Finally, a new Legal Aid Bill is planned to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  I hope it will be possible to publish the Bill during the course of this year.</p></reply>

I understand that no court venue has been singled out for or indeed exempted from the review and that both Birr and Edenderry District Courts have been identified as venues to be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case.  </p><p>  In this context the Courts Service has established a general framework within which such venues are being assessed taking into account a range of criteria such as caseload, proximity to an alternative venue, physical condition of the building, availability of cells etc.  The likely impact on other Justice agencies, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service, is also taken into account.  The review identified a range of venues nationwide which, based on the criteria applied, could be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case in respect of each identified venue which has now commenced.  </p><p>  However, the Courts Service has assured me that no decision in relation to the future of Birr and Edenderry District Courts will be taken without prior consultation with local interested parties and court users.

The review identified a range of venues nationwide which, based on the criteria applied, could be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case in respect of each identified venue.  </p><p>  However, the Courts Service has assured me that no decision in relation to the future of Killorglin, Dingle, Caherciveen and Kenmare courthouses will be taken without prior consultation with local interested parties and court users.

A contract was signed in October, 2010 with Babcock Marine in the United Kingdom for the provision of two new Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPV&rsquo;s). The acquisition of these modern new vessels, combined with a continuous process of refurbishment and repair on the other vessels in the fleet, will ensure that the operational capability of the Naval Service is maintained at a satisfactory level and that the most up to date equipment is available to Naval Service personnel. The cost of the provision of the two new ships is &euro;108m, exclusive of VAT. In addition, the cost of providing a weapons system for the ships, similar to the systems on LE Roisin and LE Niamh, is &euro;7.8m, exclusive of VAT.   Preparations for the construction of the ships have commenced in Appledore, UK. The build of the first ship is well advanced and the build of the second ship will commence in the near future. The first ship is scheduled for delivery in early 2014. The second ship will follow one year later.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the equipment issued to the Naval Service is in keeping with the most modern requirements and the highest international standards.

As the Deputy will be aware, this report  set value growth targets in primary production, exports and value- added products.  These targets will be achieved through a combination of increased production levels as well as enhanced efficiency and competitiveness measures.  I chair the Food Harvest Implementation Committee (HLIC) and through this HLIC, which involves the senior executives of the agri-food sector&#8217;s state agencies, my focus is to achieve increased productivity at farm level. </p><p>FH2020 contained over 100 recommendations specifically directed at improving farm level efficiency.  These involve a range of issues including knowledge transfer, genomics, competitiveness, animal welfare and restructuring which are progressed on a continuous basis by the HLIC.  The latest Food Harvest progress report <i>&#8216;Milestones for Success 2012&#8217; (page 3)</i> gives an update on each of these recommendations as well as a good overview on progress achieved to date;  see the following link  </p><p>  Within that context, I would highlight two areas of specific relevance to your question.  To meet the ambitious targets for the agriculture and food industry, Teagasc has developed nine road maps, covering dairy, suckler beef, pigs, sheep, tillage, forestry, horticulture, food and the environment.  These set out the technical performance required at farm level to meet the FH2020 targets and also take account of environmental and land-use implications of changes. Having explored the research and advisory actions required, the necessary actions are included in  annual Business Plans and communicated to farmers.</p><p>  Improved knowledge transfer is key area for increasing productivity and my Department has allocated additional funding to encourage efficiency gains at farm level  Following on from the very successful dairy efficiency programme, farmer discussion groups, funded by this Department, were extended to the beef, sheep and cereal sectors.  Currently over 11,000 farmers are involved in these groups which are improving competitiveness and efficiency at farm level through adoption of best practice in grassland management, breeding and financial management. </p><p>  These and other similar efficiency measures are the steps being taken to increase production levels and attain the targets set in Food Harvest 2020. </p></reply>

In this regard, a total of &euro;1,205million in Single Farm Payments was made by the end of 2012, the completion of a cycle of payments that commenced on 1st October with an advance payment agreed as a means of mitigating against the worst effects of the weather crisis.  In addition, some &euro;200million was discharged in DAS payments as well as &euro;253 million for both REPS and AEOS by year end.</p><p>  Teagasc and the Agriculture Consultants Association have been very active in providing advice and assistance for farmers affected by the bad weather.

In accordance with this Strategy, when lice levels above the treatment trigger level are recorded at an offshore salmon farm a notice to treat is issued to the operator by the Marine Institute.  If the initial treatment is not successful in reducing lice infestations to the required level a second notice to treat is issued, if the subsequent treatment does not result in reduction of lice infestation to the desired level the management cell process is invoked.</p><p>  In relation to the site identified by the Deputy, the first management cell was held on the 30th  of May 2012.  While significant reductions in lice levels had been observed following treatments in late April levels in May were above the treatment trigger levels.  The management cell, in consultation with the veterinary surgeon responsible for fish health at the site, recommended the use of new equipment to enhance the efficiency &amp; efficacy of treatments and a follow up inspection to assess the outcome.  While levels in June were below treatment trigger levels, by July lice levels at the site were again above treatment trigger levels.  A second management cell was convened on 29 August.</p><p>  The management cell on 29 August concluded that all reasonable efforts to control lice levels at the site were being taken.  It further concluded that having regard to the prevailing high water temperatures, the health status of the fish, the age and size of the stock and the time of year relative to the migration season of wild stocks that the most appropriate option was to carry out an accelerated harvest of all stock to ensure that the site would be fallow by the end of December 2012. </p><p>  The stocks were harvested and the site was fallow by 19 December 2012. </p><p>  My Department&rsquo;s policy on sea lice controls in relation to farmed salmon is strictly evidence based.  The control protocols as illustrated above are operated by the Marine Institute on behalf of the State and are more advanced that those operated in other jurisdictions for the following reasons:</p><p>  - the inspection regime is totally independent of the industry</p><p>  - data obtained as a result of inspections is published</p><p>  - treatment trigger levels are set at a low level</p><p>  These controls are regarded as representing best practice internationally.</p></reply>

Over one third of the annual forest harvest in the form of wood chips, wood pellets and firewood, or close on one million tonnes, is now used for energy generation.  Forest road grants, provided by my Department to enable first thinning of plantations, and the broadleaf thinning grant, are important measures in supporting the delivery of forest-based biomass for energy use. Grant-aid under the Bioenergy Scheme also supports the establishment of the energy crops willow and miscanthus.

My primary aim from the outset was to achieve an outcome that protected the overall interests of the Irish fishing industry while respecting the most up-to-date scientific advice for stocks of critical importance to our fleets.  I am pleased that we have secured a good deal for Irish fishermen at the EU Fisheries Council that will support our fishing industry over the coming year and which is sustainable in terms of the fish stocks on which we are dependant.</p><p>  During the negotiations an additional 6,400 tonnes of whitefish quotas were secured for Ireland over those proposed in the Commission proposal.  At the end of the negotiations which set fish quotas for 2013, I was satisfied to have secured some 36,538 tonnes of whitefish and 180,000 of pelagic (mackerel, herring etc) quotas.  The direct value of the total package for the Irish fishing fleet will be &euro;213 million for 2013.  The value to the overall Irish economy will be significantly higher when the added value in onshore processing is included.</p><p>  The quotas finally agreed by Council were very significantly increased from those originally proposed by the European Commission for the 2013 fishing year and despite the difficult initial starting position, where I was facing large cuts in over 30 stocks of interest to Ireland, the result achieved is a good deal for the Irish fishing industry.  We have secured increases from last year for key stocks including increased prawn quota in all areas totalling 8,733 tonnes and an increased whiting quota in the Celtic Sea amounting to 6,812 tonnes.</p><p>  The package of quotas secured will support the economies of those coastal communities which are dependent on the resulting employment created both at sea and in onshore related industries.</p></reply>

There are no plans to reconvene these consultations and the EU and Norway as the recognised largest shareholders will set overall fishing limits based on the current scientific advice</p><p>  This dispute has been ongoing since 2009 when Iceland who previously had little or no landings of mackerel embarked on an unapproved and irresponsible course of setting unilateral TACS culminating with a 150,000t in 2012. The Faroe Islands, who had previously participated with Norway and the EU in management arrangements then opted out of these arrangements and  embarked on a similar exercise to Iceland, declaring a 150,000t TAC for themselves in 2012.</p><p>  While accepting that the migratory pattern of mackerel has changed in recent years, and that a modest increase in shares of this stock for both Iceland and the Faroes is warranted, there is no scientific or historical justification why these two fishing nations should be fishing over 40% of this stock. Indeed their actions are now directly threatening the state of the stock and the current level of overfishing will result in cuts year on year in the TAC and quota.  Indeed, the scientific advice for the stock involves a cut of 15% on last year&rsquo;s recommended TAC, which I accept is necessary.   </p><p>  Despite numerous meetings convened since 2009 Iceland and the Faroe islands continue with their unjustifiable demands for shares of 15% while at the same time fishing 23% of the stock each. They have brought no realistic or fair proposals to the table, and at the conclusion of last October&rsquo;s talks there was little evidence that this position would change in the short term.  </p><p>  A healthy mackerel stock is essential for the Irish pelagic fleet, pelagic processing industry and for employment in the wider coastal communities. The present situation is therefore of major concern to me and I have been consistently active in trying to find a way to bring about a fair and appropriate solution.</p><p>  At the European Council of Fisheries Ministers, I will continue to take every opportunity to influence and convince all parties to resolve the issue not least because there is a real possibility of a stock collapse if catches are not reduced significantly.</p><p>  In this context Ireland are currently hosting the EU/ Norway negotiations at the National Seafood Centre in Clonakilty this week, where it is expected that decisions on the TAC and quota will be made.  However, only the EU and Norway will respect the TAC set.   In these EU/ Norway negotiations,  Ireland will be seeking joint measures from the EU and Norway including the possibility of trade sanctions to pressurise Iceland and the Faroe islands to stop their unsustainable fishing actions and come to the table with realistic and fair demands for sharing and management arrangements.</p></reply>

Firstly Canada, which has the same OIE &#8216;controlled BSE&#8217; status  as many EU countries,  refuses to accept these OIE international standards and  allow  market access for EU beef into Canada,  while at the same time it expects that the EU will grant large beef quotas into the EU. (The OIE is the international body charged with setting epidemiological standards in the meat sector.)  Second, I have major concerns with the size and composition of the quotas sought by Canada, which could undermine the high value cuts segment of the EU where Ireland competes and which provides the greatest return to our producers. </p><p>  I have made my position very clear to the Commission. Last April, Ireland submitted a position paper on these negotiations to the Trade Policy Committee, highlighting our concerns over the non recognition by Canada of the OIE international standards on beef. I personally wrote to both the EU Agriculture and Trade Commissioners in November, highlighting the political sensitivities for Ireland regarding beef market access. This followed contact the previous month by the Secretary General of my Department with the Director Generals of the Agriculture and Trade Directorates in the Commission.  </p><p>In his response, the Agriculture Commissioner  stated that  he has highlighted the  sensitivity of beef market access in these trade negotiations with his Canadian Ministerial counterpart and agrees that the sensitivity of beef should not only be reflected in the size of the quotas offered but also in their breakdown. He also agreed with Ireland&#8217;s position on the necessary reopening of the Canadian beef market for EU exports and that Canada must commit itself to reopening the Canadian market to EU beef before the conclusion of the CETA agreement. The Commissioner has also highlighted that dairy is the key offensive interest in the CETA negotiations and that EU negotiations are seeking a meaningful opening of Canada dairy market  <b>.  </b></p><p>  When the College of Commissioners visited Dublin on 10 January, 2013, I raised this issue at a meeting with them and highlighted the importance of Irish agriculture and the beef industry to the Irish economy in light of the current economic crisis and my concerns regarding beef market access and the size and composition of any quotas. </p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, the Commission proposal is to gradually move towards a system of uniform per hectare payments, or flat rates, by 2019, in each Member State or region of a Member State.  While I recognise that we cannot continue to base our payments on outdated historic production references, I nevertheless have major difficulties with the pace and extent of convergence contained in the Commission&rsquo;s proposal.  </p><p>  Under a national flat rate system as proposed by the Commission, the impact on Irish farmers would be significant - around 76,000 would gain an average of 86% on their current payments, while around 57,000 would lose an average of 33%. These are average percentages, and some of the gains and losses would be far larger than this. This would have undesirable consequences at a time when Ireland is trying to encourage sustainable intensification in the agri-food sector, as we strive to achieve the objectives in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy. </p><p>   I have accordingly been pressing for the maximum possible flexibility to be given to Member States to design payment models that suit their own farming conditions. I also want a more gradual, back-loaded transition process. The &lsquo;approximation&rsquo; approach, by which all payments could gradually move towards, but not fully to, the average, is one alternative that I believe should be considered in this regard. The Commission&rsquo;s &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo; proposal for redistribution between Member States is, in effect, an approximation approach and provides a useful precedent. Modelling in my Department suggests that the application of this system to the distribution of funds between farmers in Ireland would lead to much smaller gains and losses to individual farmers than a flat rate system. However the precise level of transfers depends on the details of the methodology used.</p><p>  I have been very active in seeking allies for this position and I have been making significant progress, particularly with a group of Member States with somewhat similar concerns.  It should also be understood that a number of Member States have already adopted flat rate systems or are evolving towards them and have no difficulty with the idea of flat rate payments.  However, I am confident that, following our efforts, there is recognition of the difficulties that the Commission proposal poses for some Member States, such as ourselves. </p></reply>

The introduction of parking charges at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre was originally examined in great detail in 2007 in the context of a proposed Howth Traffic and Parking Management Plan, in conjunction with Fingal County Council.  There was widespread public consultation at that time but that project did not subsequently proceed.  All of the various views expressed and submissions made at the time by local businesses and other interests are still on file and I am well aware of their concerns.  </p><p>  More recently, I have received correspondence from a variety of interested parties.  My officials have had discussions with Fingal Council and with an G&aacute;rda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the introduction of pay parking and other related matters at the Fishery Harbour Centre, and my Department&rsquo;s engineers have met some of the Harbour&rsquo;s business tenants individually in relation to their specific concerns about new traffic management and road markings etc.</p><p>  As I have said previously, Howth is one of 6 Fishery Harbour Centres operated by the State each of whose primary purpose is to provide facilities and services for the fishing industry and fisheries-related activities.</p><p>  In parallel with fishing-related enhancements, there have been a number of developments at the Fishery Harbours in recent years that underpin their expanding use for leisure and marine tourism, as well as other maritime enterprises.  </p><p>  In the current economic climate, it is essential that all of the State&rsquo;s enterprises pay their way, and the State must necessarily be fully committed to maximising the return on its investment. </p><p>  At the same time, all income generated by the Fishery Harbour Centres goes back into a ring-fenced Fishery Harbour Centres Fund which is used exclusively for the operating and management costs of the Fishery Harbours.  </p><p>  The additional revenues to be generated from pay parking at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre, which I expect will be substantial when fully operational, will be re-invested in facilities and enhancements that would not otherwise have been possible given the current financial constraints.  </p><p>  I believe these improvements can only be of benefit to the marine and leisure tourism sectors and local economies in general.</p></reply>

The necessary legislative and organisational preparations are being prioritised so that the Agency can be established as a priority. </p><p>  From its establishment the Child and Family Support Agency will have service responsibility for a range of services, including child welfare and protection services currently operated by the HSE; domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services. The functions of the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board will transfer into the Child and Family Support Agency upon its establishment. </p><p>  The Government's consideration of these matters was informed, by the content and recommendations of the Report of the Task Force on the Child and Family Support Agency which I published in July of this year.  The Task Force considered that the Agency needs to be as broadly based as possible and should include a range of prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic care interventions.  </p><p>  It is my intention that the agency will have a role in supporting families and communities. It will have the benefit in this role of the many Family Resource Centres which have been developed across the country with funding from the Family Support Agency. I can assure the Deputy that the new Agency will build on the excellent work undertaken by the Family Support Agency over the last decade, and that a community based approach will form an integral part of the new Child and Family Support Agency. </p><p>  The composition of the Board of the Child and Family Support Agency is currently under consideration. While the composition of the Board will reflect the component organisations which are being amalgamated into the Child and Family Support Agency. The criteria for Board membership will be focused on ensuring that Board members have the requisite mix of experience and competencies needed to steer such a large organisation providing a diverse range of personal services. </p><p>  The establishment of the new Agency and the wider transformation of children's services represents the largest, and most ambitious, area of public sector of reform embarked upon by this Government.</p></reply>

In these circumstances, future adoptions from Ethiopia would require a bilateral agreement between Ireland and Ethiopia. The negotiation of bilateral agreements on intercountry adoption with states who have not ratified the Hague Convention is governed by Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010 which states that &quot;the Authority, with the prior consent of the Minister, may enter into discussions with any non-contracting state concerning the possibility of the Government entering into a bilateral agreement with that State.&quot;</p><p>  The Adoption Authority delegation visit to Ethiopia in April of this year was an initial part of the Authority's deliberations on the feasability and suitability of entering into discussions with Ethiopia on a bilateral adoption agreement. The Authority forwarded a report of their visit to me in May 2012. The Authority is awaiting legal advice regarding the compatibility of  the Irish and Ethiopian adoption legislation. The Authority has also informed me that it has asked the Irish Embassy to make the appropriate contacts in the Ministry of Women's Affairs in Ethiopia with a view to verifying the stance of the Ethiopian authorities to entering into exploratory talks in relation to a bilateral agreement. I await the AAI advice in this regard</p></reply>

These are the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI); the Family Support Agency (FSA); the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) and the Ombudsman for Children's Office (OCO). </p><p>  In July 2011, the Government decided that the Family Mediation Service should transfer from the Family Support Agency to the Legal Aid Board. This is in line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to facilitate the use of mediation in family disputes in order to speed up the legal process, reduce costs and ameliorate the stress of contested court proceedings. On foot of the Government decision, the Family Support Agency established a transition project team to transfer 45 individuals, or 24.29 WTEs, in some 16 locations throughout the country and an annual allocation of almost &euro;3m to the Legal Aid Board. On 26 October 2011, the Minister for Justice and Equality signed the commencement order for Part 16 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 which gave effect to the transfer from 1 November 2011. </p><p>  I can inform the Deputy that the FSA is due to be merged with the new Child and Family Support Agency (CFSA) which will be established this year.  The National Educational Welfare Board is also due to be merged with the CFSA.  Legislation for the establishment of the CFSA is being prepared by my Department as a matter of priority.  It is anticipated that the Bill will be published and enacted in the course of this session and it is my intention that the CFSA will assume statutory responsibility for services for children and families in 2013.</p><p>  The potential benefits of merging the back office functions of the Ombudsman for Children's Office into the Ombudsman/Information Commissioner's Office are currently being examined. </p><p>  At this stage it is not possible to quantify the actual savings to date as a direct result of these developments.  </p><p>  It should be noted that following enactment of the Child Care Amendment Act 2011 the Children's Act Advisory Board was subsequently dissolved by means of the commencement by the Minister of Health of Part 6 of the Child Amendment Act 2011.</p></reply>

From this work and comparable international studies we know that child overweight and obesity are increasing in Ireland and other countries and are associated with a range of immediate and longer term health risks. </font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">This study revealed that 74% of 13-year-olds were not overweight, 20% were overweight, and 6% were obese. As was the case at 9 years, more than one in four 13-year-olds were either overweight or obese.</font><i><font color="#2F2F2F"> </font></i><font color="#2F2F2F">Girls were more likely to be classified as overweight than boys (22% compared to 18%). Girls were also slightly more likely to be obese than boys (8% compared to 5%).</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">Changes in weight status between 9 and 13 years of age, and indicates that relatively few not-overweight 9-year-olds had developed weight problems by age 13, but those with weight problems at 9 years tended to maintain them. This reinforces the importance of early intervention. Children who are a healthy weight at aged 3 or age 9 are much less likely to have weight problems as a teenager.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">It is widely accepted by researchers that there is a strong link between physical activity and overweight, and habits formed in youth tend to carry over into adulthood.  The Growing Up in Ireland Study also clearly confirms this finding. Young people who took more exercise were less likely to be overweight or obese, especially in comparison to those who never exercised.</font>As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I have responsibility for the National Play and Recreation Policies, as set out in &#8216;<font color="#2F2F2F">READY, STEADY, PLAY! A National Play Policy&#8217; and  the &#8216;National Recreation Policy for Young People&#8217;.  These </font>seek to actively promote the participation of children and young people in play and exercise, an effective way of helping to maintain a healthy weight<font color="#2F2F2F">.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  The Local Authority Play and Recreation Network</font> - was es<font color="#2F2F2F">tablished by my Department in February 2012 to facilitate a more co-ordinated interagency approach to achieving the main goals of the play and recreation policies at both national and local level.  An early achievement of the network has been the development, expansion and branding of National Play Day &amp; National Recreation Week which now take place annually in Local Authority areas across the country in July and October of each year respectively.  Targeted grants are provided to Local Authorities by my Department to encourage participation across the Local Authority network. In July 2012, National Play Day 2012 saw the largest ever participation with 26 Councils staging popular events on or around the dedicated date. National Recreation Week 2012 saw all counties in Ireland involved, for the first time ever.  As previously announced I am providing &#8364;250,000 in capital funding in 2013 for play and recreation initiatives.  Further details of this funding initiative will be announce in 2013.</font></p><p>  A representative of my Department is a member of the Special Advisory Group on Obesity, established by the Minister for Health, which has developed a number of actions, in conjunction with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).

At the time there was a recognition of the difficulties of regulation given the scale of the provision, and a strong view that, because women did not have to be regulated to look after their own children, they should not be subject to regulation if they minded a small number of additional children.</p><p>  The 2000 Expert Working Group on Childcare set out a plan for integrating the various strands of child care and education, including childminding.  It made a number of recommendations aimed at overcoming the barriers preventing childminders from moving into the formal economy, most of which were implemented.  These included the introduction of a system for voluntary notification of childminders, and the introduction of Childcare Services Relief, which allows a voluntarily-notified childminder to mind up to three children without paying tax on the earnings, and to make a PRSI contribution.</p><p>  Childminding Advisory Officer posts were created in most of the CCCs, working directly with childminders, notifying them of training opportunities, providing networking opportunities, and supporting the voluntary notification system.  The number of voluntarily-notified childminders is currently 1,250, up from 500 in 2004.  This is not a significant increase when the range of supports and the tax relief are taken into account.</p><p>  I understand that since 2011 there has been a reduction in funding for Childminding Advisory (CMA) posts by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to the City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs).  The HSE has indicated that, in light of the pressure on resources, the CMA posts are not a priority.  However, the Executive has confirmed that it will endeavour to support the CCCs wherever possible.  In addition, the childcare development staff in the CCCs continue to ensure that support and advice is available to childminders.</p><p>  My Department provides annual funding to each CCC to enable it to support and advise all childcare providers at local level.  In 2012, the total amount allocated to the CCCs was &euro;11.3m.  In addition, my Department provided &euro;220,000 for Childminding Development Grants to be allocated by the CCCs. My Department also provides annual funding, totalling &euro;2.85m in 2012, to the seven National Voluntary Childcare Organisations, including Childminding Ireland, who provide support at a local level to their members.</p><p>  Decisions on how best to regulate the childminding sector will continue to form part of the ongoing work on the Early Years Strategy.</p></reply>

A large number of declarations are currently valid and several hundred are issued by the Authority each year.  While the AAI is not in a position to influence the number of inter country adoptions, the age or needs of children in need of adoption or the length of time involved in such processes the Adoption Authority has been proactive in developing relationships with its Hague counterparts in a number of jurisdictions. The building of such relationships will help to bring greater clarity to the intercountry adoption process generally, including the timescales involved for adopting from different countries. </p><p>  The reality is that the landscape of intercountry adoption is changing and for a variety of reasons the number of referrals of adoptable children has declined and therefore fewer adoptions are finalised each year than declarations issued.  In this regard the AAI and the HSE are examining a range of issues in relation to assessments and the issuing of declarations. The relevant information on these matters will be published on the AAI website (www.aai.gov.ie).</p></reply>

The Building Competitive Advantage action related to aligning skills with enterprise needs, involving reviewing structures and funding of youth work and support services to ensure they support the development of the skills needed by enterprises. My Department is currently finalising a Children and Young People's Policy Framework and the review of youth programmes will be informed by this new Policy Framework.

Following an examination of childcare options, a decision was taken as part of Budget 2013 to introduce a new school age childcare programme which will be targeted at parents in receipt of benefits who take up employment. The Programme will commence in September 2013, and there will be a pilot phase from March 2013.</p><p>  The Government is currently preparing further plans for job creation under an Action Plan for Jobs 2013 which will be published in the coming weeks and my Department will continue to support job creation initiatives by providing specific key supports in the form of:</p><p>- youth work services which develop young people&rsquo;s skills, thereby improving their employability and helping to address the issue of youth unemployment;</p><p>- a specific Budget initiative being jointly implemented with the Department of Social Protection to provide access for parents taking up employment to school age child care places; and</p><p>- early childhood care and education programmes which target subsidised childcare places towards low-income parents in employment, education or training.</p><p>  In addition, there are other Department programmes which will indirectly generate economic activity, employment and labour market support including a construction project at the Children&rsquo;s Detention Schools in Oberstown, Co. Dublin and an Area Based Poverty initiative which, as well as providing employment in local areas selected, will address social disadvantage amongst children and families in order to improve poverty and life chances.</p></reply>

Work on the preparation of the legislation is proceeding as a priority and the intention is that the Agency will be established as a priority.  In order to inform the content of the legislation the Government has decided that upon establishment the Child and Family Support Agency will have responsibility for a range of services.  This includes the full range of child welfare and protection services currently operated by the HSE including family support and alternative care services.  Due to its particular relevance, it has also been decided to include domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services within the Agency's responsibilities.  The Government has further decided that the new Agency will assume responsibility for the functions of both the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board.  These two organisations currently operate under the aegis of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  The draft legislation will also provide for the provision of community-based psychology services to children and families by the Agency. It is envisaged that this will involve the transfer of certain psychology staff currently employed by the HSE who are operating within a community setting.  </p><p>  The Government's consideration of these matters was informed, inter alia, by the content and recommendations of the Report of the Task Force on the Child and Family Support Agency which I published in July 2012.  I share the view of the Task Force that in order to achieve genuine improvements for children and families, the Agency must have a broader focus than child protection. It is my intention that the Agency will be as broadly based as possible and that it should include those services that (i) may prevent problems arising for a family in the first instance (ii) identify problems and provide supports at an early stage and (iii) assist children and families in managing serious problems requiring specialised interventions beyond their own resources.  </p><p>  Arising from the Government's consideration and decision with regard to the functions of the new Agency, it has been agreed by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Health that an impact analysis will be jointly developed regarding the proposed future arrangements for the provision of the community psychology service as it relates to children and family services covered by the Child and Family Support Agency and to services provided by the HSE.  This work will be undertaken as a priority.</p><p>  I recently met with representatives from the Heads of the Psychology Services Ireland and with a delegation from the IMPACT trade union to discuss issues relating to the future governance and organisational arrangements for the provision of community based psychology services. Our shared objective is to ensure that the optimal national governance and service delivery framework is in place to ensure the best possible outcomes for children and families and other clients who need to avail of this key service.  The views of the profession and its representatives will receive appropriate consideration as part of the impact analysis. </p></reply>

There is a two-year transitional period from the date on which the register of the members of that profession is established, during which existing practitioners may apply for registration.</p><p>  I am conscious that these fees are a new cost to health and social care professionals who have already seen reductions in their incomes.  However, health regulators are self funding by way of annual fee income with operational costs being determined by the complexity and breadth of statutory functions specified in its legislation. The greater the registrant base the lower the annual fee charged. Given the enormous registrant base in teaching and nursing,  for example, the annual fee charged amounts to less than &euro;100 per annum. In general, health regulators are single profession regulators whereas the Council is charged with regulating twelve disparate professions, which can add significantly to operating costs. The twelve designated professions to be registered by the Council range in number from under 50 Clinical Biochemists to 5,550 Social Care Workers, amounting to about 20,000 registrants in total across all professions. This is an extremely low registrant base when compared to a registrant base of well in excess of 60,000 for nurses.</p><p>  The Council has extensive statutory functions under the 2005 Act, and considers the annual fee of &euro;295 the minimum required to enable it to operate. The fee charged by the Council, which takes account of the requirement to become self funding as soon as possible,  is on a par with that charged by other health regulators and less than some in certain cases. The State is currently part-funding the Council in its establishment phase (&euro;1.5 million in 2012) to offset the current shortfall in income from registration fees and will continue to do so for the next 3 years.</p><p>  In response to concerns about the level of fees, the Council has reviewed the regulatory structure to establish what scope exists for controlling registration fees and operational costs and has adopted the following measures:</p><p>- Where existing practitioners with the necessary experience and recognised professional qualifications, or equivalent, pay the application fee of &euro;295 and are granted registration during the transitional period, the application fee will cover them for the remainder of the transitional period and one full year of retention of registration after expiration of the two year period.  This concession will apply only to existing practitioners availing of the transitional provisions set out in the Act,</p><p>- The Council has entered into discussions with the HSE in regard to the feasibility of arrangements for deduction of the registration fee from monthly salary, thereby spreading the cost throughout the year,</p><p>- Finally, the Council has proposed significant restructuring of the way in which the designated professions will be registered and regulated to provide a more cost effective operating system and to keep costs to a minimum.  This will require the enactment of primary legislation in due course.</p></reply>

I am concerned about the level of smoking in Ireland and it remains my objective that Ireland moves towards being  a tobacco free society.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products.  They attach a high priority to tackling this trade because of the threat that it poses to society.   In 2012, over 95 million illicit cigarettes were seized and there were 132 convictions for the smuggling or selling of illicit cigarettes or other tobacco products.</p><p>  Revenue&rsquo;s &ldquo;Strategy on Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011-2013)&rdquo;, which is published on the Revenue website (www. revenue.ie), includes a range of measures designed to complement each other in targeting the supply and demand sides of the market for illicit cigarettes and other tobacco products. My Department and the HSE strongly support this Strategy.  </p><p>  One of the actions identified in the strategy is to reduce the demand for illicit products by educating the public about their negative consequences. For that reason, Revenue seeks to optimise media coverage for significant seizures and other enforcement action against the illicit tobacco trade, and for prosecutions and convictions for offences relating to illicit tobacco products. All suitable opportunities are availed of to highlight and publicise the dangers associated with the illicit trade and to encourage members of the public to provide information on the sale or supply of illicit tobacco products.</p><p>  The Report of the Tobacco Policy Review Group which will be published in the coming months will consider ways to denormalise smoking in society such as extending tobacco control legislation in particular for situations where children are present. It will also consider social marketing and educational programmes.  The Report will include a section on the illicit trade of tobacco, including the work of the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

This is essential to ensure compliance with public service pay policy.   In the case raised by the Deputy, the HSE granted an allowance in 2006 in recognition of the additional responsibilities which the individual's appointment as Project Director for the National Programme for Radiation Oncology entailed.  This allowance was incorporated into the individual's salary rate for subsequent appointments on a secondment basis as Deputy Director, and then Interim  Director, of the National Cancer Control Programme.  Following the subsuming of the National Cancer Screening Service into the HSE with effect from 1 January 2010, the salary level payable to the staff member concerned was maintained.</p><p>While the allowance granted was intended to reflect very significant extra responsibilities, and I am satisfied that these additional duties were discharged successfully over a number of years, this arrangement was put in place without the approval of the then Departments of Health and Children and Finance.  In these circumstances   my Department wrote to the HSE in November 2012, requesting that it review its procedures for the sanctioning of pay levels, including allowances.  In particular, the Executive was asked to take the necessary steps to ensure that adequate governance and oversight controls are in place at appropriate levels  to ensure that the required sanctioning procedures are strictly adhered to within the HSE.</p><p>  In addition the HSE Internal Audit function is at present undertaking a detailed review of the remuneration arrangements for senior staff in all organisations funded under section 38 of the Health Act 2004 to provide services on behalf of the HSE.  When this has been completed, a report on the matter will be considered by the Board of the HSE in the first instance.</p></reply>

This report points the way towards the achievement of optimal effectiveness and efficiency within the existing substantial resources expended on health and personal services for people with a disability.  During 2013 the HSE will commence an early examination of the VFM findings in regard to rosters, skills mix, the unit cost base and average costs across the HSE-funded agencies in the sector.  A commissioning and procurement framework will also be developed during the course of the year.

Day services for adults with disabilities provide a network of support for people who have a wide spectrum of need, ranging from those with severe and profound disabilities who are likely to need long-term specialist service provision to people with lower support needs and greater potential for community participation and inclusion.  The HSE, through its Occupational Guidance Service, works with schools, service providers, service users and families to identify the needs of young people with disabilities who are due to complete their second level education.  The aim is to address the needs of individuals in the following ways:</p><p>- Health-funded rehabilitative (life skills) training (RT);</p><p>- Health-funded day services;</p><p>- F&Aacute;S-funded vocational training;</p><p>- Approval to extend education placement for a specified time.</p><p>  The demand for services for school-leavers continues to grow.  In 2012, almost 700 school-leavers required RT places or day services and the position in 2013 is expected to be similar.  While the HSE makes every effort to provide day services or RT places to school-leavers with special needs, this has always been dependant on the availability and location of appropriate places coupled with the needs of the individual school-leaver.  The HSE is currently reviewing the outcomes for 2012 school-leavers in terms of placements achieved and scoping out the likely requirements for 2013.  I wish to acknowledge the work of the HSE and the voluntary service providers in meeting the considerable challenges placed on them last year by finding places for the vast majority of school-leavers without additional funding.  I am pleased to confirm however that, although the 2013 allocation for disability services has been reduced by 1.2%, the HSE National Service Plan includes an additional &euro;4m to provide training places and day services for school-leavers in 2013.  Both the voluntary sector and the HSE are committed to the best use of this funding in a creative and flexible manner so as to secure as many places as possible within the available resources although this will continue to be a challenge in the current environment. </p></reply>

The key lessons from the<i> Report of the Working Group on Congregated Settings (2011)</i> and <i>New Directions</i>, <i>the Report of the National Working Group for the Review of HSE-funded Adult Day Services</i> (2012), together with the <i>Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services in Ireland</i> (2012), will provide a catalyst for achieving a more effective, person centered disability service, in line with international best practice.  The implementation of these reports will be progressed though the HSE&#8217;s National Disability Governance Group and through the National Consultative Forum in 2013.  It should be borne in mind that the radical change recommended in the reports is not the sole responsibility of the Health Sector but rather, a collaborative responsibility shared between the person, their families and carers, a multiplicity of agencies, Government and society as a whole.</p><p>  The <i>Report of the Working Group on Congregated Settings</i> (July 2011), sets out a framework to guide the transfer of identified individuals from congregated settings to live in the community. A HSE-led National implementation Group is developing a national plan and change programme to progress the recommendations of the Congregated Settings Report and transfer the 3,600 people with disabilities who live in these settings into the community over the next 7 years.  In July 2012 the Department of Health and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Affairs jointly published the National Implementation Framework to support the Government's <i>National Housing Strategy for People with Disability 2011 to 2016</i> .  As part of this process &#8364;1m has been transferred from the Health Vote to the Housing Vote to provide for the social housing costs of up to 150 people leaving institutions in 2013. </p><p>  A National Implementation Working Group has also been established by the HSE to oversee the implementation of the recommendations in <i>New Directions</i>.  The report proposes that day services in the future take the form of a menu of 12 individualised, outcome-focused supports which will provide adults with disabilities with the support necessary to live a life of their choosing in accordance with their own wishes, aspirations and needs.  The guiding principle for the future is that supports will be tailored to individual need and will be flexible, responsive and person-centred.   During 2013 the HSE will manage and direct the migration towards a person-centred model of services and supports, through demonstration projects initiated by service providers as proof of concept, which will run in parallel with current services.  Their suitability for wider application will then be evaluated.</p></reply>

In 2002 the Forum on Fluoridation, which was established to review this policy, concluded that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure.  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects on health and related matters.  It advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and is the safest and most cost effective method of protecting the oral health of the population. </p><p>  The information provided by the Deputy has been forwarded to the Expert Body for consideration by its New and Emerging Issues Sub-Committee.</p></reply>

These Regulations, which came into operation on 1 January 2013, considerably strengthen the protection of animals still needed for research and safety testing.  They also play a significant role in terms of minimising the number of animals used and require that alternatives to animal testing be utilised where possible. </p><p>  The Deputy's question relates to the European Communities (Amendment of Cruelty to Animals Act 1876) Regulations 2002 which were revoked by the aforementioned 2012 Regulations. While the 2002 Regulation did not specify specific methods of killing, it did require that killing of animals be done by a humane method (defined as &quot;the killing of the animal with the minimum of physical and mental suffering, depending on the species&quot;).  In this context, account was to be taken of Commission Recommendation (2007/526/EU) on guidelines for the accommodation and care of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes.  This Recommendation set out requirements in relation to humane killing.  General requirements were outlined in relation to all species and where appropriate, more specific requirements were outlined in relation to certain species. </p><p>  The new legislation, now in force, sets out a comprehensive range of measures that must be complied with in relation to methods of killing.  It requires that where an animal (used or intended to be used in a procedure, or bred specifically so that their organs or tissues may be used for scientific purposes) is killed, the person responsible for the killing shall ensure that the method of killing with the minimum pain, suffering and distress is used, and the animal is killed by a competent person in the establishment of the breeder, supplier or user, as appropriate.  Additionally it requires that in the case of the killing of an animal covered by Annex IV to the Directive, the breeder, supplier or user, or other person responsible, shall ensure that the appropriate method of killing as set out in that Annex is used.</p></reply>

In recent years, a number of changes to the pricing and reimbursement system have been successfully introduced in Ireland.  These have resulted in reductions in the prices of thousands of medicines.</p><p>  Following intensive negotiations involving the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA), the HSE and the Department of Health, a major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded in October last.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including </p><p>- significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs, </p><p>- a lowering of the drugs bill to the State, </p><p>- timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and</p><p>- reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.</p><p>  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400m over 3 years.  &euro;210 million from the gross savings will make available new drugs to patients over 3 years. Thus, the deal will result in a net reduction in the HSE expenditure on drugs of about &euro;190m.</p><p>  The Department of Health and the HSE have also successfully finalised discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represent the generic industry, on a new agreement to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs.  It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013.</p><p>  The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nominated EU member states in which the medicine is then available.  The prices of a range of medicines were reduced on 1 January 2013 in accordance with the agreement.</p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which is currently before the House, provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing.  The Bill provides that when the HSE is setting a reference price for, or reviewing a reference price set for, a relevant group of interchangeable medicinal products it shall take into account the following criteria:</p><p>- the ability of suppliers to meet patient demand for the relevant item;</p><p>- the value for money afforded by the relevant item;</p><p>- the equivalent prices of the relevant item in all other Member States where the product is marketed;</p><p>- the prices of therapeutically similar items; and</p><p>- the resources available to the HSE.</p><p>  It is important to balance achieving best value for money for the taxpayer with assuring continuity of supply for critical medical products, particularly in a small market like Ireland. Consequently, the Bill aims to achieve value for money while avoiding disruption in the availability of medicines on the Irish market. </p></reply>

We are committed to addressing this serious issue and have prioritised the implementation of <i>Reach Out</i>  &#8211; the National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention (2005 &#8211; 2014).</p><p>  S.I. No. 494 of 2004 European Communities (Organisation of Working Time) (Activities of Doctors in Training) Regulations 2004, which transposed the EU Working Time Directive for doctors in training, provides for:</p><p>- A maximum 48 hour average working week;</p><p>- 11 hours rest every 24 hours or equivalent compensatory rest before return to work; and</p><p>- 35 hours continuous rest per week or twice a fortnight or 59 hours continuous rest per fortnight.</p><p>  There has been a significant reduction in the weekly hours worked by NCHDs in recent years.  Typically NCHDs work approximately 55 hours per week.  Further work is therefore required to achieve compliance with the requirements of the Directive.</p><p>  In January 2012, Ireland submitted to the EU Commission a detailed Plan for the achievement of compliance by NCHDs with the Working Time Directive.  The plan affirmed Ireland's commitment to achieving compliance with the Directive over a three-year time period.  It committed to implementing measures to compliance, including:</p><p>a. The implementation of new work patterns for medical staff;</p><p>b. Transfer of work undertaken by NCHDs to other grades;</p><p>c.

The assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means of the applicant and his/her dependants.  Where an applicant fails to qualify for a medical card, either as a first time applicant or under review, they are then considered for a GP visit card.  Income limits for GP visit cards are 50% higher than those applying to medical cards.</p><p>  Approximately 1.85 million people are covered by a medical card, an increase of almost 25% since the end of 2009.  The cost of the General Medical Services scheme is estimated to have been approximately &euro;1.9 billion in 2012.</p><p>  Under the Drugs Payment Scheme no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.

The standard approach to the treatment of Lyme Disease is to follow the guidance laid out in the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines on the clinical assessment, treatment and prevention of Lyme Disease. This is accepted as being the most up to date synthesis of best available evidence on the clinical management of Lyme Disease and treatment of Lyme Disease in Ireland is based upon this guidance. A consensus statement on the clinical management of Lyme Disease has been issued jointly from the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, the Infectious Diseases Society of Ireland, the Irish Society of Clinical Microbiologists, the Irish Institute of Clinical Neuroscience and the Irish College of General Practitioners, all of whom support the use of this guidance.</p><p>  The diagnosis of a case of Lyme Disease can be difficult. The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as an initial screening step. However, screening EIA's can be insufficiently specific and can give other false-positive reactions in the presence of various other infections from syphilis to glandular fever. In addition, sera from patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions can also lead to false-positive results. Samples giving reactive or equivocal results in screening tests are further investigated in a second stage immunoblot test. The use of immunoblot testing greatly increases specificity. Using this two stage approach gives a greater degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme Disease. </p><p>  A response to Tick Talk Ireland will issue shortly.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-16a.2739.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013011600071#WRWW00200"><p>I can confirm that Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes has been transposed into Irish law during December 2012 by the European Union (Protection of Animals Used for Scientific Purposes) Regulations 2012, which considerably strengthens the protection of animals still needed for research and safety testing, that came into operation on 1 January, 2013. </p><p>  Significant changes that are provided for in the transposition of this Directive include a requirement to perform detailed project evaluations prior to authorisation of projects using animals and higher standards of animal care, welfare and accommodation. The Directive plays a significant role in minimising the number of animals used and requires that alternatives to animal testing be used where possible, whilst ensuring a level playing field for EU industry and enhancing the quality of research conducted in the EU. </p><p>  The Directive also strongly promotes the principles of the three R&rsquo;s (replacement of the use of animals to the greatest extent possible with alternative testing methods, refinement of scientific procedures to improve animal welfare, and reduction in numbers of animals used). It should be noted that many of the provisions set out in Directive 2010/63/EU are mandatory. The European Environment Commissioner affirmed that the European Union will, once the Directive is transposed, have the highest standards of experimental animal welfare in the world.</p><p>  In the aforementioned Regulations, I decided not to transpose Article 42 which provides for a simplified administrative procedure for certain types of projects. My decision in this regard is based on my determination to ensure a high level of protection for all animals that still need to be used for scientific purposes. A simplified procedure along the lines of Article 42 would, in effect, have introduced a two-tiered system, one requiring full project authorisation and another which would undermine that authorisation system. As a consequence of my decision not to introduce any such simplified system all projects using animals for scientific purposes are subject to the full project approval and authorisation requirements set out in the Directive.</p><p>  The approval of projects and of key individuals involved in those projects and of the establishments where they are carried out is a matter for the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) which I have designated as the Competent Authority (CA) for the purposes of the Directive. My decision to assign CA functions to the IMB takes into account the fact that replacement and refinement of experimental studies to minimise the use of animals is a central tenet of the Directive. This requires an up-to-date knowledge of such alternative methods and tests as well as the authority to require the use of such alternatives, where possible, by those currently using animals.  This work requires the employment of persons with veterinary expertise specialising in laboratory animal welfare to evaluate scientific projects and to oversee compliance with Directive requirements. Such specialists are also expected to be able to offer detailed regulatory advice to those involved in the industry. The IMB has the relevant expertise in relation to both human and veterinary medicine to assist it in undertaking this regulatory work and in ensuring that the three R&rsquo;s remain central to this area of work in the years ahead. </p><p>  I should also point out that any project involving severe pain or suffering is automatically subject to a full retrospective assessment by the competent authority. It is also open to the IMB to retrospectively assess any other project carried out under this Directive. Significant enforcement powers have been included in the transposing statutory instrument to enable the IMB to examine any possible breaches of the legislation and the transposition also provides for significant penalties where serious infringements are identified.</p></reply>

Full year costs for all these posts will be met from HSE 2013 base allocation.</p><p>  The announcement in Budget 2013 of a further &#8364;35m for the continued development of our mental health services is additional to the &#8364;35m provided in Budget 2012.  The HSE National Service Plan, which was recently approved by the Minister for Health, commits to the further development of suicide prevention initiatives, forensics and community mental health teams for adults, children, older persons and mental health intellectual disability and to the recruitment of over 470 additional staff to implement these measures.  I have received assurances from the HSE that the recruitment process for the 2013 new posts, and any outstanding 2012 posts, will commence immediately. </p></reply>

In this regard, the HSE provides a range of services to women who continue to suffer the effects of having had this procedure. These services include the provision of medical cards, the availability of independent clinical advice and the organisation of individual pathways of care and the arrangement of appropriate follow-up.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, Professor Oonagh Walsh, independent researcher was commissioned by the Chief Medical Officer in my Department to draft a report in relation to the practice of symphysiotomy in Ireland.</p><p>  The Report was conducted in two stages. The first stage is an independent academic research report, which is based on an analysis of published medical reports and research. The draft report contains information about how frequently symphysiotomy was carried out in Ireland and compares rates with other countries. The second stage in the research process involved a consultation process on the draft report involving patient groups, health professionals and in particular the women who have undergone symphysiotomy.</p><p>  The researcher is currently finalising the report based on the consultation and it is also planned to have a peer review process. It is hoped that the report will be published early in 2013.</p></reply>

In regard to the figures for the three years prior to 2012, I am advised that outpatient data gathered prior to 1 January 2011 and the inception of the Outpatient Data Quality Programme cannot therefore be compared to the current data, while reporting of outpatient data was discontinued during 2011 to allow for the changeover. Improving access to outpatient services is a key priority for the Government. Building on the work done by the HSE, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has now taken over the reporting of outpatient waiting time data. The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format will reveal the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals. In the first instance, this will allow the Special Delivery Unit (SDU) and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to target their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.A maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment by 30 November 2013. In parallel with reducing the numbers of longest waiters, the SDU will also work with the HSE Clinical Programmes to reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time.</p></reply>

Prazepam shares the characteristics of benzodiazepines in general, including the need to use them for the shortest length of time possible and to gradually reduce the dose when discontinuing treatment to avoid withdrawal symptoms. The product information for Centrax approved by the Irish Medicines Board  includes these warnings and recommends a maximum treatment time of 4-6 weeks including the time for the tapering-off process. It also states that extensions to this time period should be based on a re-evaluation of the patient's status by specialist experts.</p><p>  According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website, Centrax has been discontinued in the US but my Department is not aware of any safety concerns regarding long-term use specific to this medicine other than the general concerns relating to benzodiazepines generally.</p><p>  Benzodiazepines are known to be associated with dependence and withdrawal symptoms and consequently are primarily recommended for short-term treatment only. My Department is reviewing the Misuse of Drugs Regulations with a view to, amongst other issues, introducing tighter controls on benzodiazepine medicines. My Department has consulted with key stakeholders in relation to the proposed amendments. It is anticipated that new legislation will be introduced early this year.</p></reply>

It is responsible for protecting the public by regulating health and social care professionals.  The Council was established in March 2007 and is working to put in place the necessary structures for registration, education and fitness to practice for the twelve health and social care professions, including social workers, designated under the Act.</p><p>  The Council's role is to oversee and coordinate the activities of registration boards and to provide administrative support to the boards and their committees.  The Council will also be responsible for enabling committees of inquiry into complaints against registrants.  The first registration board to be established, the Social Workers Registration Board, was established in August 2010, and the associated Social Workers Register opened for receipt and processing of applications on 31st May 2011. Since then, a further four registration boards have been established, three of them on November 1st last.  All twelve registration boards and their registers are expected to be established by 2015.  e role of a registration board includes the establishment and maintenance of a register of members of the relevant designated profession, the approval of qualifications to be required of persons wishing to register, monitoring the suitability of approved education and training programmes, and making recommendations to the Council with respect to disciplinary sanctions to be imposed on a registrant against whom a substantiated complaint about his/her conduct or competence has been made.</p><p>  The Health and Social Care Professionals Council is an independent statutory body responsible for setting the level of fees for registration under the Act and for retention of registration.  The Council formulates annual costed Business Plans setting out its proposed programme of work.  The Act provides for the appointment by the Council of a Chief Executive Officer to carry on, manage and control generally the administration and business of the Council and the registration boards.

The Framework Agreement for Staff Transfers has been agreed through the Public Service Agreement (PSA) and the NAS is committed to developing this agreement further, through the PSA, to ensure a consistent approach to accessing transfers within the NAS. There is a nationally coordinated approach in place to ensure no local variation occurs and all transfers are transparently undertaken in line with the Agreement.  Under this process, almost 200 staff expressed an interest in transferring to their desired location, with approximately 30% taking up the opportunity to relocate.</p><p>  Unfortunately, the number of staff who have expressed an interest in transferring to the North West far outnumbers the amount of vacancies in that area. The NAS is engaged with staff representatives to agree the criteria that determine the order in which staff gain access to any vacancies.</p></reply>

Under the Initiative, up to<b></b>1,000 graduate nurses will be recruited on two-year contracts and will be paid 80% of the first point of the Staff Nurse Scale. They will also qualify for premium payments and allowances on a pro rata basis, bringing expected average pay to approximately &#8364;25,000 per year, excluding overtime.  The Initiative will also facilitate a reduction in the use of nurse agency staffing and overtime to provide services.</p><p>  The salary payable has been set on the basis that staff appointed under this initiative will be outside the scope of the Health Sector Employment Control Framework. Given the requirement to achieve reductions in staff numbers in the health sector and to maximise savings, it is not possible at present, other than in very limited circumstances, to offer permanent staff nurse positions.  For the same reasons it is not possible for the HSE to simply to convert posts currently filled by agency staff to permanent positions.</p><p>  The Initiative will include formal professional development elements, the details of which are being finalised at present.  Participants will also have access to a variety of care settings while gaining clinical experience.</p><p>  This scheme represents an opportunity for a substantial number of recently-qualified nurses to work in Ireland for a two-year period at a time when job opportunities in the public service are, regrettably, very limited.

In the first instance, this will allow the SDU and NTPF to target their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.

The aim is to ensure that anyone with a concern about their implants will have the option of discussing those matters in the first instance with their GP or surgeon.  If the outcome of this discussion between the patient and their doctor  is that an individual requires further follow-up and treatment (up to and including removal of the implants) then this will be facilitated through public hospitals.

Under this system, most beds are either designated as public beds or private beds: there is a small number of non-designated beds, such as those in Intensive Care Units.  Under the current  framework, private in-patients who occupy public beds in public hospitals are not levied the daily maintenance charge, which ranges from &euro;586 to &euro;1,046 in most public hospitals.  The Comptroller and Auditor General reported in 2010 that 45% of in-patients treated privately by their consultants were not charged for their maintenance costs because they were not occupying designated private beds.</p><p>  As part of Budget 2013, it has been indicated that legislative proposals will be brought to Government that will provide for charges to be collected from private in-patients who are not occupying a private designated bed.  This charge will be phased in over a number of years to mitigate the impact on the private health insurance market.  It is envisaged  that new charges will be implemented in mid-2013 and will yield additional &euro;60m in 2013.  In the meantime, the maintenance charges for private in-patients in public hospitals remain unchanged.</p><p>  I am committed to keeping the cost of health insurance premia as low as possible and, to this end, my Department is working closely with the four health insurers, through the Health Insurance Consultative Forum.  The objective of the forum is to explore ways to minimise costs, while always respecting competition law.</p></reply>

The relevant actions and outcomes are set out below: -</p><p>The aim of <b>Action 1.19</b> is to &#8220;<i>Promote greater competition and reduce costs in the health sector by enacting legislation relating to general practice</i>&#8221;.  The commencement on March 12<sup>th</sup>, 2012 of the Health (Provision of General Practitioner Services) Act 2012 meets the objective of this action.</p><p><b></b> The Department of Health has been working with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation<b></b>on <b>Action 7.2.1</b> to &quot;<i>Deliver a Health Innovation Hub to drive collaboration between the health system and commercial enterprises leading to the development and commercialisation of new health care technologies, products, services and start-ups emerging from within the health system and/or firms</i>&quot;.  The steps in the table of actions were completed in 2012. The Demonstrator Project was launched last October and  is established in University College Cork. It will test the Hub model and inform the development of a national Hub.</p><p><b>  Action 7.2.2</b> sets out to &quot; <i>Enact a Health Information Bill to support a conducive environment for health research in Ireland ; this will streamline the ethics approval process for health research not governed by statutory regulation and EU law; the Bill will also provide a legal framework for the introduction of an individual patient identifier</i>&quot;.  Certain issues remain to be finalised  and it is expected that the Bill will be ready for publication later this year.</p><p><b>  Action 7.26</b> aims to &quot;<i>Prepare a detailed  implementation plan for  the development of a national biobanking structure</i>.&quot;. This implementation plan has been completed.</p><p>  Government policy on public service numbers, reflected in the HSE&#8217;s 2013 Service Plan, requires that by the end of 2013 the health service achieves a workforce of 98,955 whole time equivalents, a significant reduction from a workforce of 101,519 whole time equivalents at the end of November, 2012. However, the Plan allows for investment of an additional 1,025 whole time equivalents in a number of key prioritised areas, as well as the completion of recruitment for the additional posts authorised for mental health services in 2012.  In addition, a graduate nurse employment programme will be implemented, involving the recruitment of up to 1,000 nurses on two-year contracts.</p><p>  While our policies and programmes do not of themselves create jobs, they are, nonetheless important in terms of supporting an environment in which enterprise (SME and multinational) can do business. These include the Actions referred to above; the progression of EU legislative proposals on Clinical Trials and Medical Devices; investment in Clinical Research facilities through the Health Research Board and the development of an e-Health strategy.</p></reply>

I am committed to moving us closer towards that objective.  The Tobacco Policy Review Group (TPRG) is examining a number of areas which need to be developed or enhanced in order to reduce smoking prevalence in eland.  The TPRG is considering the possibility of extending the smoking ban to other public areas such as playgrounds, public parks and sport grounds, educational and health campuses, etc.  To ensure that this issue is progressed any recommendations in relation to this will be considered in consultation with the key stakeholders e.g. Department of the Environment and Local Authorities, Department of Education etc.  I anticipate that the report of the TPRG will be completed in the coming months and that this will be brought to Government for decision.</p></reply>

I established a Special Delivery Unit (SDU) in June 2011 as a key part of plans to radically reform the health system in Ireland.  The SDU priorities encompass waiting times for unscheduled and scheduled care and the introduction of a major upgrade in the performance capabilities of the Irish health system.  The SDU is focusing initially on emergency departments and is working to support hospitals in addressing excessive waiting times for admission to hospital.  The SDU  is working closely with key teams in the HSE and the NTPF, building on initiatives already underway including the clinical programmes and supporting hospitals to improve performance.  </p><p>  The Deputy is referring to an operational management report that was produced  following a site visit  carried out by the SDU  in relation to patient care issues at Connolly hospital in Blanchardstown.  The report, which was sent to the hospital management, was carried out in June last year and is now over 6 months old.  The report was produced for the hospital to support management in service improvement, it is not intended to publish the report.  </p><p>  Since the report was received by senior management at Connolly hospital an intensive programme of work has begun between the SDU's liaison officers, the Clinical Programmes and the hospital teams.  Regular liaison meetings are continuing and part of the agenda is to monitor improvements and implementation of the recommendations from the report.  The SDU is satisfied that there is increased engagement at all levels in the hospital in ensuring that emergency patients are seen in a timely manner, focussing on working to achieve the national targets for unscheduled care.  The hospital have implemented a number of improvements which include extended opening hours of the Acute Medicine Unit, increased availability of senior decision makers and extended availability of diagnostics.  Between May and November 2012 there has been a 12% improvement in the number of new  patients who are admitted to a ward or discharged from the emergency department within 6 hours of arrival.     </p></reply>

The HSE is continuing to address this issue.</p><p>  The HSE is also continuing to advise eligible patients who believe they have been inappropriately charged by a GP for routine phlebotomy services, to seek a refund from the GPs in question  .</p></reply>

A reduction in expenditure of &euro;323m is required against the projection in 2013. The HSE Board made a decision to introduce an additional &euro;60m in cost reductions in the community schemes in the National Service Plan. These additional savings are to be achieved through a range of efficiency measures; therefore, the total reduction required in 2013 is &euro;383m. </p><p>  The HSE's National Service Plan has just been finalised for 2013. The HSE is now working with the relevant programme directors to profile their budgets appropriately. It is not possible at this stage to provide details of how individual savings measures will be profiled across 2013, particularly in light of the fact that legislation is required for some of them.</p></reply>

Given the proportion of expenditure that goes on pay, strict control of pay budgets and staff numbers is essential.  The Graduate Employment Initiative will support the retention of recently qualified graduate nurses and midwives within the Irish health system and enable them to gain valuable work experience and development opportunities post-graduation. The Initiative will also facilitate a reduction in expenditure on nurse agency staffing and overtime.  </p><p>  The HSE may continue to recruit nurses and midwives from existing panels in exceptional circumstances where it has been established that there is an urgent service requirement and this can be accommodated within the budgetary and staff number limits in place.  Such recruitment is separate to and independent of the Graduate Employment Initiative.</p></reply>

These Counsellors will be responsible for the set up, roll out, management, monitoring and evaluation of the Model, including relationship development with GPs in their areas.  They will work within the NCS, managing the referral process, to ensure that an appropriate referral and counselling match is provided to meet the needs of individuals. </p><p>  terviews for the Counsellor Co-ordinators were held in late November 2012 and the successful candidates are currently being processed for references and Garda Clearances.  Following satisfactory completion of the process, start dates will be agreed with the candidates.  The start date for the service in each area will vary depending on the start date of the Counsellor Co-ordinator and the availability of Counsellor Therapists.</p><p>  A National Steering Group has been working continuously to develop the national guidance to ensure the consistent roll-out of the model and work is ongoing in preparing information packs for primary care teams, potential service users and GPs.  </p></reply>

One of the consultants' recommendations was that the option of a 2 centre model for rescue coordination centres should be pursued.  However, when I published the reviews last July I made it clear that I wouldn't accept or reject any of the recommendations until a full assessment of the proposals had been undertaken and actions prioritised to address the issues identified as requiring attention. </p><p>  My Department has examined the consultants' recommendation regarding the operation of the 3 coordination centres, including engaging in further discussions with Fisher Associates, to determine how greater efficiencies can be delivered in light of the resource constraints under which we must operate.  After careful consideration of the various options available, it was concluded that the three centres should remain but that changes to the operation arrangements within and between the centres would be required to achieve the necessary operating efficiencies and savings. </p><p>  In particular, through the utilisation of the most modern communications and IT infrastructure across a single national Coast Guard network the 3 centres will be more closely aligned and integrated.  My Department is currently undertaking work with the support of external consultants to establish the details of the future operational arrangements for the centres. This is an important measure in the action plan I am preparing to address the deficiencies in the maritime safety and emergency response services identified in the Value for Money reviews.</p></reply>

My Department is now proceeding to draft legislation to provide for the merger of the SAA with a restructured Shannon Development to form a new State-owned commercial entity as decided by Government in November and it is my aim to have that new entity established on a statutory basis by July of this year.</p><p>  Shannon Development and Shannon Airport Authority are both owned by the State and the State, on behalf of its citizens and taxpayers, is currently faced with these two ailing companies that are not realising their potential to make a contribution to the economy of the wider region.  The State is, therefore, restructuring its assets to make better use of them as a catalyst for the development of sectoral opportunities, particularly within the aviation sector. This restructuring involves no more than a re-ordering of assets in State ownership and on this basis is not seen as involving State Aid and hence there was no requirement to approach the European Commission.</p></reply>

Current EU legislation does not provide for a deferment of the due date for mandatory testing, and test dates are set by reference to the date of the first registration of the vehicle.</p><p>  In 2012, my officials contacted the EU Commission to enquire about the possibility of using the flexibility afforded under Article 4.2 of 2009/40 to facilitate a deferment of the testing due date on the basis that the vehicle had not been used in a public place for a period prior to the scheduled test date. The initial advice received suggests that such a scenario does not fall within the intent and comprehension of the quoted Article.

That will assist with continued co-operation during 2013.</p><p>  In addition, as recommended under Actions 21 and 25 of the Review Report, Garda powers are to be extended to allow members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to issue fixed charged notices with respect to additional SPSV fixed charge offences. It is anticipated that in 2013 regulations will be made following commencement of Section 34 of the Road Traffic Act 2010.</p><p>  The Taxi Regulation Bill 2012 will support the enforcement measures proposed in the Taxi Review Report.  The provisions of the Bill will further support measures to ensure that operators and drivers can operate under a robust regulatory framework supported by an effective enforcement regime.

The cost of running the National Transport Authority (NTA) is an operational matter for the Authority.  As previously advised, I have referred the Deputy's question to it for direct reply.  As also advised, my Department's 2012 expenditure allocation and 2011 provisional expenditure outturn are set out in the Revised Estimates Volume, Vote 31 which is published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and is available on that Department's website.  For the Deputy's information, the allocation in 2012 from the Exchequer to the NTA is &euro;376,985,000 (&euro;246,747,000 for current expenditure and &euro;130,238,000 for capital expenditure) and the provisional expenditure outturn for 2011 was &euro;376,985,000 (&euro;269,348,000 for current expenditure and &euro;211,000,000 for capital expenditure).  The NTA has assumed responsibility for a range of tasks from my Department, including national bus route licensing, rail passenger rights redress, integrated ticketing, the rural transport programme, public service contracts with the CI&Eacute; companies and the management of the State&rsquo;s infrastructure contract with Irish Rail.  To resource this remit, a number of staff posts were transferred from my Department&rsquo;s allocation to the NTA.  The associated pay allocations are adjusted to reflect the transfer of posts to the NTA.  Consequently, there are no net savings in my Department's vote as a result of the transfer of functions.  However, it should be noted that the rationale for the creation of the NTA was not to generate cost savings.  It should also be noted that much of the work done by the NTA is new work which was not previously done by my Department.</p></reply>

I am in the process of approving the regional and local roads grants for 2013.  I can confirm that the Local Improvement Scheme will be reinstated for 2013.  However, there is no separate allocation for this grant category.  Instead, local authorities may use up to 7% of their Discretionary Grant towards local improvement schemes should they wish to do so.  The local contribution for these schemes has been increased to 20% of the total cost of the project.  Apart from this amendment, the same eligibility rules apply for these schemes.  Details of the 2013 regional and local roads grants, which will include details of this, will be communicated to local authorities in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The transition in 2013 is not only from a paper to a plastic licence, but also from a system where licences are issued by the local authorities to a system in which the Road Safety Authority will be the sole driver licensing authority in the State.  This change is quite a complex operation, and will involve a transition period during part of 2013 when the local authorities will temporarily continue to perform some licensing functions on behalf of the RSA.  If people were allowed or encouraged to exchange their old licences for new ones, there could be a large volume of applications which might overwhelm the system.  It is more practical to allow licences to be renewed when they fall due, and so give the new system a chance to settle in.  The matter will be reconsidered when the new system is up and running and any transitional issues resolved.</p></reply>

This early estimate also includes an indicative cost estimate for the Castleknock to Leixlip section of &euro;8 million, which incorporates the deep cutting section between Castleknock and Porterstown.</p><p>  In the past year, the Royal Canal towpath between Clonsilla and Keenan Bridge in Porterstown was cleared of brush and a path laid for cyclists and walkers.  The Department has allocated funding to upgrade the path between Castleknock and Ashtown this year.  The 'deep sinking' section between Castleknock and Keenan Bridge is by far the most expensive and most challenging.  It is a pity that so little was done to make the towpath accessible and to upgrade the canal as an amenity during the long period of Fianna F&aacute;il-led government with the Green Party and Independents when there was so much money available.</p><p>  With regard to the section from Maynooth to Mullingar, route alignment work, followed by detailed planning and design work, could be completed by August 2013.  Subject to funding availability, delivery of this section would then be likely to take in the region of 6 to 10 months.  Robust cost estimates are not possible prior to the detailed route alignment and design work, however, based on previous project delivery it is likely that costs for Maynooth to Mullingar would be in the region of &euro;5 million.</p></reply>

The tourism agencies and I are determined to restore it to growth.   In this regard, I was pleased to welcome the recent report of the Tourism Recovery Taskforce (TRT), entitled &ldquo;GB Path to Growth&rdquo;, and its recommendations for restoring growth in visitors from Britain which has been reflected in the 2013 plans of the tourism agencies.  A copy of the &quot;GB Path to Growth&quot; strategy can be downloaded from the websites of both Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.</p><p>  Tourism Ireland is conducting an extensive promotional programme this year focusing on our main markets, including Britain.  Its campaigns will aim to boost travel to Ireland from around the globe, as well as promoting The Gathering Ireland 2013.   The Gathering Ireland 2013 will form the central focus of all tourism campaigns, with the TRT recommendations further informing marketing plans and activity in the British market.</p><p>  In terms of other specific marketing strategies for the British market, as this is an operational matter for Tourism Ireland Limited, I have also referred the Deputy's questions to Tourism Ireland for additional material.

The Order specifying the date of separation of Shannon Airport from the DAA was executed last month following its approval by both Houses of the Oireachtas and, as decided by Government, that date was 31st December 2012.  On that day, the assets and business of Shannon Airport were transferred from the DAA to the Shannon Airport Authority (SAA).</p><p>  All Irish airports should operate to a commercial mandate and I have stressed on numerous occasions that regional airports, including Ireland West Airport Knock, must work towards achieving operational viability over the near term. In this regard, apart from the consideration of restructuring the State-owned airports, I have also endeavoured to rationalise the system of State support for the regional airports not owned or controlled by the state including those in the ownership of private companies and trust  and the Government now has a settled policy in relation to those airports.</p><p>  I believe that these measures will give rise to some degree of increased competition not only between the State airports but also between them and the regional airports, including Knock and Kerry airports. The measures we are taking are focused on increasing the overall number of passengers to and from Ireland through increased efficiencies and attracting new aviation business that would otherwise not be based in Ireland which will have a beneficial national impact.</p><p>  I am confident that the measures will form the basis for sound, sustainable, airport businesses into the future that will support the growth of these sectors and help drive Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery. Furthermore, I am confident that there is a role for all remaining airports in providing scheduled air access for Ireland including IWAK, Shannon, Donegal, Waterford and Kerry. I know the Deputy will be aware of the importance of transatlantic connections and access to Heathrow through Shannon to the West of Ireland including his constituency and that he will want to see the airport's decline halted.</p></reply>

However, I have recently appointed consultants, Indecon, to undertake a strategic review of the current and future role of Rosslare Port. The consultants have been asked to assess the port&rsquo;s current commercial and operational efficiency and advise as to whether the port is maximising its potential and make recommendations as to the optimal ownership and operational structure for the port. The consultants are expected to report in early April.  For the Deputy's information, I have asked that the local Oireachtas members be consulted as part of this process.</p></reply>
