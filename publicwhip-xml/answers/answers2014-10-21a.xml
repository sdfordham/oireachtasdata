The budget for the programme will increase to over &euro;373m in 2015, up from &euro;358 million this year.<br/><br/>As to the duration a person can spend on the scheme,  the position is that, since 2000, lifetime cumulative participation on CE by an individual is 6 years maximum for persons of 55 years of age and 7 years maximum for those over 55 years on disability-linked social welfare payments.  This compares to 3 years for persons under 55 years of age.<br/><br/>At the moment, there are 6,515 participants who are over 55 years on CE.  <br/><br/>I have asked my officials to examine the current duration practices, as part of the on-going monitoring of the CE programme.  However, there are no current plans to extend the participation limit for those aged 55 and over above the current six years cumulative participation limit that currently applies.  <br/><br/>The Deputy will appreciate that consideration of the extension of any duration on CE has to have regard to the availability of places for other job-seekers and vulnerable groups.</p></reply>

The Department will spend &euro;230 million this year on the household benefits package for almost 415,000 customers.  The fuel allowance, worth &euro;520 per year, is paid for 26 weeks from October to April to almost 415,000 households at an estimated cost of &euro;208 million in 2014.</p><p>  This compares favourably with the winter fuel payment for the elderly in Northern Ireland which ranges from &pound;100 (&euro;126) to &pound;300 (&euro;379) per year depending on age and household composition.  There is no equivalent in Northern Ireland to the free electricity allowance.  </p><p>  The Government has already announced that from 2015 both the household benefits package and the fuel allowance will also include a water support payment with an annual value of &euro;100.  The estimated cost of this new water support payment of &euro;100 per annum will be in the region of &euro;66 million in 2015.</p><p>  I am confident that these measures will continue to meet the needs of those most in need.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s affordable energy strategy &ldquo;Warmer Homes&rdquo; indicated that the best measure to address energy poverty is to continue to improve the thermal efficiency of people&rsquo;s homes.  The &ldquo;better energy warmer homes&rdquo; scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to low income households that are vulnerable to energy poverty at no charge to the householder. Since 2000, when the scheme began, over 105,000 homes around the country have received energy efficiency measures under the warmer homes scheme, with a total spend of over &euro;116 million. The warmer homes scheme is expected to upgrade another 12,000 households by the end of 2014.</p></reply>

However, there are complaints and queries procedures which interns, host organisations and other interested parties may use to  raise any concerns that they may have with regard to the operation of the scheme.   All complaints and queries, are processed through the Department&rsquo;s standard complaints procedure, under which all complaints are logged and actions recorded centrally.  I am satisfied with the process works efficiently and effectively and that complaints are dealt with expeditiously.</p><p>  In addition, the Department applies a rigorous quality management and compliance regime in respect of JobBridge.  There are criteria in relation to the duration of internships and the non-displacement of paid positions as well as the inclusion of training and mentoring in internships.       </p><p>  Compliance is enforced through submission of monthly compliance statements by all host organisations and by random onsite inspections.   About 8,000 such inspections have been conducted to date. </p><p>  Inevitably, given the level of interest in and use of the scheme, a small number of internships which may not meet the strict criteria pass through the screening process.  Where this happens and the matter is brought to its attention, the Department acts quickly to withdraw such internships. </p><p>  In this regard, the Department&rsquo;s random inspection regime indicates the incidence of non-satisfactory internships is very low.  Approximately 97% of all JobBridge inspections are found to satisfy the requirement of the scheme.  Just 44 host organisations out of approximately 15,000 who have hosted interns have been excluded from further use of the scheme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-10-21a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014102100059#WRB00900"><p>Child benefit is a universal payment made to families with children. It assists those families with the cost associated with raising children.  It is paid to almost 1.2 million children in over 600,000 families. The estimated expenditure in 2014 will be &euro;1.9 billion.   The cost of the administration of the scheme is in the order of &euro;7.5 million per annum. The Department of Social Protection has not estimated the administrative cost of introducing a means tested child benefit scheme.    There is therefore no reliable estimate of the approximate cost of introducing a means tested system for 600,000 families but this would cost a large multiple of the current administration cost. It would also take a significant time to design and implement.  </p><p>  The Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare examined the structure of child and family income support in Ireland. As part of this examination the Group considered the means testing of child benefit but stated that such a system would have considerable administrative consequences, as the scale of means testing would be considerably greater than anything required by the current system. Instead the Group recommended, among other things, that child benefit should continue to be paid on a universal basis. </p><p>  I am pleased to say that in Budget 2015 it has been possible to increase Child Benefit by &euro;5, from &euro;130 to &euro;135 per month which will benefit over 611,000 households with children. </p><p>  This recognises the sacrifices that families made during the economic crisis and the fact that families are continuing to face difficulties. In the Statement of Priorities published earlier this year, the Government promised a new deal on living standards for hard-pressed families, and this increase is in line with that commitment. </p><p>  In addition, I introduced a new  Back to Work Family Dividend for long-term unemployed jobseekers with children who leave welfare to return to work. These families will, from January, be able to retain the child-related portion of their social welfare payment on a tapered basis over two years.  This includes those who move to self-employment, such as the construction sector.  It will also apply to One Parent Family Payment recipients who similarly go back into the workforce.</p><p>  The scheme will be worth &euro;1,550 per child in the first year of employment or self-employment and half that amount again in the second year. </p><p>  The Dividend will help increase the pace of the progress we are making in helping people back to work.  It will help boost the recovery, reduce welfare expenditure in the long-run, and, most importantly, help the families in question to build a better financial future for themselves. </p><p>  I also provided for an additional &euro;2 million for the School Meals scheme in 2015. In total over &euro;2.4 billion will be provide for child related payments in 2015, up &euro;125 million over this year. </p></reply>

To implement this cap on funding during a time in which passenger numbers have been increasing each year the Department has had to impose a freeze on the amounts paid to companies and a complete restriction on the admittance of new companies or routes to the scheme.  This has included new companies taking over previously extant routes.    Given the increasing number of recipients and the funding pressures, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and I established an interdepartmental working group to examine and report on the current operation and future development of the free travel scheme.  I expect to receive the final draft of the review shortly.  </p><p>  The Government made clear in the &ldquo;Statement of Government Priorities, 2014-2016&rdquo; that we are committed to the full retention of the Free Travel Scheme.  I appreciate the importance of the scheme to customers, particularly pensioners, and am aware of the implications for travel pass holders in those areas where services have been withdrawn.  I have therefore asked officials in the Department to examine ways in which companies could be admitted to the free travel scheme, initially where they are taking over routes for which free travel funding was previously available, including in Donegal, and thereafter on other routes with licensed passenger services.</p></reply>

There is no requirement that a referred client in recovery has to complete education or training to a FETAC Level 5 standard in two years or, indeed, while they are on the scheme.  All participants work to their own individual learning plan, setting personal learning and progression goals at a level that suits their aptitude and capacity.   This is decided between the scheme CE supervisor and the participant over a number of individual meetings.  If the Deputy has a query in relation to a specific individual she might get in touch with me with the details.   The current duration of participation on CE for these participants can be up to 4 years during which time they can access a range of development opportunities leading to relevant qualifications under the National Qualifications Framework.  For early school leavers, compensatory learning objectives are built into their learning plans. </p><p>  Under the CE programme, there are 1,000 CE places ring-fenced for referred clients as part of this Department&rsquo;s contribution to the overall National Drugs Strategy.  Currently, there are 841 referred clients and 199 support workers on the Drug Rehabilitation CE Strand.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, a stakeholders group chaired by this Department was set up in May, 2013 to inform and advise on the delivery of the drugs rehabilitation response within CE.  Membership includes representatives of the community and voluntary sectors, Drug Task Forces and statutory organisations.  </p><p>  Finally, it should be noted that there will be no reduction in the annual CE budget for drug rehabilitation places in 2015 which will remain at circa &euro;15m.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-10-21a.28.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014102100059#WRB01500"><p>There are approximately 73,500 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.  I am acutely aware of the difficulties people are experiencing in maintaining affordable rented accommodation, including those in receipt of rent supplement, in the current market where supply is constrained.  Raising rent limits may not be the solution to the problem as it is likely to add to further rental inflation and impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers, their families and students. I plan to keep the matter under close review.    The Department is reviewing the maximum rent limits and the analysis shows that the impact of increasing limits will yield only a very marginal increase in available supply for rent supplement recipients with the only certainty that raising limits will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to new recipients.  Details of the Department&rsquo;s review will be published when finalised.</p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that officers administering rent supplement throughout the country have considerable experience in dealing with customers and make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met including through the use of their discretionary statutory powers as necessary.  In light of a particular concentration of the homelessness problem in the Dublin area, the Department has agreed a tenancy sustainment protocol with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations so that families on rent supplement who are at risk of losing their accommodation can have more timely and appropriate interventions made on their behalf.  Since the launch of this protocol in mid-June 2014, almost 140 families have had their rent supplement claims revised by the Department.  I will continue to keep the protocol under review. </p><p>  Increasing housing supply and the reactivation of the construction activity is a key issue for Government and is critical to restoring stability to the rental market.  The Government has recently launched its Construction Strategy 2020 and will shortly launch a Social Housing Strategy.  </p><p>  As part of Budget 2015, Government has announced significant capital investment of over &euro;2.2 billion for social housing for the next three years.  In 2015, over &euro;800 million will be invested in a range of housing programmes which represents the first major investment in housing since 2009.  </p><p>  An additional &euro;10.5 million will be provided for accommodation and related services for homeless persons, increasing the annual expenditure for tackling homelessness to &euro;55.5 million next year.</p></reply>

There are currently almost 49,000 persons in receipt of the scheme for periods over 18 months.  Under the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer to local authorities. HAP is being introduced to provide a more integrated system of housing supports and has been designed to allow any households that find full-time employment to remain in the scheme.    HAP was introduced on a pilot basis in Limerick City and County Council in April 2014 and to date some 130 households in Limerick have transferred to this new scheme.   HAP has since been recently extended to Cork County Council, Waterford City and County Council, South Dublin County Council, Kilkenny County Council, Monaghan County Council and Louth County Council. Department of Social Protection officials are working closely with those in the lead Department of Environment, Community and Local Government to support the implementation of HAP within the selected local authorities and to support further roll out during 2015.</p></reply>

I am acutely aware of the difficulties people are experiencing in maintaining affordable rented accommodation, including those in receipt of rent supplement, in the current market where supply is constrained.  Raising rent limits at this time may not be the solution to the problem as it is likely to add to further rental inflation and impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers, their families and students. I plan to keep the matter under close review.   Analysis shows that the impact of increasing limits will yield only a very marginal increase in available supply for rent supplement recipients with the only certainty that raising limits will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to new recipients.</p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that officers administering rent supplement throughout the country have considerable experience in dealing with customers and make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met including through the use of their discretionary statutory powers as necessary.  In light of a particular concentration of the homelessness problem in the Dublin area, the Department has agreed a tenancy sustainment protocol with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations so that families on rent supplement who are at risk of losing their accommodation can have more timely and appropriate interventions made on their behalf.  Since the launch of this protocol in mid-June 2014, almost 140 families have had their rent supplement claims revised by the Department.  </p><p>  Increasing housing supply and the reactivation of the construction activity is a key issue for Government and the resolution of the housing supply situation is critical to restoring stability to the rental market.  The Government has recently launched its Construction Strategy 2020.  </p><p>  As part of Budget 2015, Government has announced significant capital investment of over &euro;2.2 billion for social housing for the next three years.  In 2015, over &euro;800 million will be invested in a range of housing programmes which represents the first major investment in housing since 2009.  An additional &euro;10.5 million will be provided for accommodation and related services for homeless persons, increasing the annual expenditure for tackling homelessness to &euro;55.5 million next year. </p><p>  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Alan Kelly TD, is also due to shortly publish a Social Housing Strategy.</p></reply>

The fuel allowance is paid for 26 weeks from October to April to almost 415,000 households at an estimated cost of &euro;208 million in 2014.  The Government has already announced that from 2015 both the household benefits package and the fuel allowance will also include a quarterly water support payment of &euro;25.  The estimated cost of this new water support payment of &euro;100 per annum will be in the region of &euro;66 million in 2015.  I understand that the average water charge will be &euro;238 per year.<br/><br/>I am confident that the combination of both household benefits and fuel allowance as qualifying payments for water support will ensure that the payment is made to those most likely to be impacted by the charges, including the elderly, the disabled and those on long term social protection payments.  <br/><br/>The following schemes provide entitlement to household benefits or fuel allowance, in some cases subject to a means or household composition test:<br/><br/>- State pension contributory, non-contributory and transition<br/><br/>- widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's contributory and non-contributory pension<br/><br/>- pre-retirement allowance, farm assist and long term (over 15 months) jobseeker's allowance<br/><br/>- one parent family payment<br/><br/>- deserted wife's allowance<br/><br/>- deserted wife's benefit<br/><br/>- disability allowance<br/><br/>- blind pension<br/><br/>- carer's allowance (if carer lives with person being cared for)<br/><br/>- invalidity pension<br/><br/>- injury benefit<br/><br/>- guardian's payment (non-contributory)<br/><br/>- guardian's payment (contributory)<br/><br/>- others, including people over 70, people in receipt of a foreign pension, people aged 66-70 subject to a means test.<br/><br/>People who had an entitlement to household benefits or fuel allowance before beginning employment support or back to education schemes normally retain their entitlements while on the schemes.  <br/><br/>The following short term schemes are not qualifying schemes for either household benefits or fuel allowance:<br/><br/>- basic supplementary welfare allowance (under 15 months)<br/><br/>- short term jobseeker's allowance (under 15 months)<br/><br/>- jobseekers benefit<br/><br/>- maternity or adoptive benefit<br/><br/>- family income supplement<br/><br/>- illness benefit<br/><br/>- carers benefit<br/><br/>- health and safety benefit.<br/><br/>As regards the number who will not be entitled to water support, it is not possible to give a definitive answer, as both household benefits and fuel allowance are paid on a household basis, i.e., a house with several people in receipt of weekly payments from this Department will only receive one water support payment.  People who are in receipt of non-qualifying payments may live in households which qualify through other people in the household. Similarly, while family income supplement (FIS) is not a qualifying payment itself, a person in receipt of both FIS and one parent family payment may qualify for fuel allowance.<br/><br/>In addition to these measures, an income tax relief will apply to water charges from January 2015.  This will mean that people paying income tax will be able to reduce their tax bill by 20% of their water charges, up to a maximum relief of &euro;100 a year.</p></reply>

However, the key objective of activation policy, encapsulated in the recently launched Pathways to Work 2015 strategy, is to provide a pathway back to employment for people with a work capacity who are already, or who will in the absence of support become, long term unemployed.  This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to persons who are signing on the Live Register for the requisite period of time.  Accordingly, the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people.  Notwithstanding the current focus on the Live Register, the State is also mindful that other jobseekers could benefit from support in accessing the labour market. Hence, it will continue to increase the level of awareness among these groups of the employment supports that are available to them.  A range of services are available to persons who are unemployed but in receipt of other social welfare payments.  For example employment services, such as advice on job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with my Department&rsquo;s employment services offices, regardless of their social welfare status.  Further, unemployed persons in receipt of other social welfare payments such as Disability Allowance and the One Parent Family Payment (OFP) are also eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities for example through ETB training for unemployed people, as well as schemes such as Community Employment and JobBridge, while also retaining their social welfare payment.  In particular, the Government recognises the importance of increasing participation in employment for persons with a disability and is committed to removing any barriers that remain which prevent those persons with disabilities from participating in activation programmes and employment.  Aside from mainstream provision, SOLAS also funds customised training for people with disabilities provided by a range of Specialist Training Providers.  The Department also provides a wide range of income and work-related supports specifically for people with disabilities.  Work-related supports include:</p><p>- the EmployAbility service (formerly the Supported Employment Programme) which facilitates the integration of people with disabilities into paid employment in the open labour market; and</p><p>- a number of other supports specifically for employers (the Wage Subsidy Scheme - which pays an employer a subsidy for employing a person with a disability; the Work Equipment Adaptation Grant, the Employee Retention Grant, and the Disability Awareness Scheme). </p><p>  In relation to OFP, a new payment, the Jobseeker's Transition Payment, was introduced in 2013, which allows former recipients of OFP to receive the full support of the Department's activation services to help them return to work, training or education, while recognising the particular difficulties they face, such as childcare and long-term absence from the labour market.</p><p>  The Department will also develop proposals as to how the Intreo activation process could, in time, be extended to jobseekers not on the Live Register. In this regard careful consideration will be given to how to balance the &lsquo;obligation&rsquo; to engage with the Intreo service (which is a defining feature of &lsquo;activation&rsquo;) with an opportunity based approach which may be more suitable to non-Live Register cohorts. Specifically, Pathways to Work 2015 commits to:</p><p>- Developing options for extension of employment services options to cohorts other than jobseeker on the Live Register;</p><p>- Developing resourcing options to support extension of employment services activity to cohorts other than those of the Live Register by 2016. </p><p>  In short, the Government is committed to supporting as many people as possible to participate more fully in employment and to become more self-sufficient by providing supports that address barriers they may encounter in finding and sustaining work employment.</p></reply>

These include age, being in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment for a specific period, be pursuing a full-time course of study leading to a recognised qualification in a recognised college and be progressing in the level of education with reference to the National Framework of Qualifications among others. The qualifying period for the second-level option is three months while the qualifying period for third-level courses is nine months prior to the date of commencement of the course.  A person awarded statutory redundancy may access BTEA immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established.   A waiting period is considered necessary in the context of targeting scarce resources at those who need them most.  People who qualify for a social welfare payment need some time to engage in job search activities and to consider options available to them.  The BTEA confers entitlement to income support for an extended period while in full-time education.  There are no plans at present to modify the existing BTEA qualifying criteria for persons who are not in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment for the required duration.</p></reply>

The Government has already announced that from 2015 the household benefits package and the fuel allowance will also include a quarterly water support payment of &euro;25.  The estimated cost of this new water support payment of &euro;100 per annum will be in the region of &euro;66 million in 2015.  The living alone allowance has been increased to &euro;9 benefitting 177,500 people at a cost of &euro;12 million.  A 25% Christmas bonus will benefit over 1.16 million people at a cost of &euro;63.5 million   I am confident that these measures will continue to meet the needs of those most in need.</p><p>  The Department published a social impact assessment of the main welfare and tax measures in Budget 2014, including the discontinuing of the telephone allowance. The analysis showed that the family type most affected was unemployed single people, not the elderly. There was no significant change in the at-risk-of-poverty rate, as social transfers continue to perform strongly, substantially reducing the at-risk-of-poverty rate during the economic recession. </p><p>  The decision to discontinue the telephone allowance provided annual savings of &euro;48 million and meant that the Department was able to retain the other elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence. These are valuable supports for recipients. The fuel allowance scheme and the free travel pass were also protected for older people and people with disabilities. </p><p>  The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government operates the seniors alert scheme which provides grant support for the supply of equipment such as personal alarms, smoke detectors and security lighting to enable older people without sufficient means to continue to live securely in their homes.  Funding for this scheme will continue in 2015.</p></reply>

Budget 2015 fully protects all existing schemes and supports and will provide for an estimated expenditure of &euro;3.39 billion on the illness, disability &amp;amp; carers programme.  This represents 17.5% of total Departmental expenditure in 2015.Budget 2015 provides for a range of targeted increases to assist families and other vulnerable groups.  Pensioners and people with disabilities who are living alone will have their living alone allowance increased to &euro;9 per week from January or a total of &euro;468 over the course of the year.  Some 177,500 people will benefit from this increase, including around 33,400 in receipt of disability allowance, invalidity pension, incapacity supplement or blind pension. This payment was last increased in 1996.     Budget 2015 will also provide for a partial restoration of the Christmas bonus, which will see 25% of the rate of the weekly payment being paid to all long-term welfare recipients in early December 2014.  The bonus is being paid in recognition of the position of vulnerable households at this time of year and in light of the costs associated with this period. Consequently, the bonus payment is targeted at those who rely wholly or mainly on their social welfare payment for financial support, including those in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit, disability allowance, invalidity pension and the blind pension.  </p><p>  People with disabilities and carers who receiving a household benefits package or fuel allowance will also benefit from the introduction of water support payment.  The value of this payment is &euro;100 a year and will be paid at a rate of &euro;25 every three months.  There will be some 653,000 beneficiaries, including some 73,600 people with disabilities and 31,950 carers.  </p><p>  Over the last three Budgets the Government has succeeded in protecting basic social welfare rates and this year&rsquo;s Budget provides for a range of targeted increases to assist people with disabilities, carers and other vulnerable groups.</p></reply>

These entitlements include wages, holiday pay, sick pay, payment in lieu of minimum notice due under the Minimum Notice &amp;amp; Terms of Employment Acts, 1973-2001, and certain pension contributions.  Various other statutory awards made by the Employment Appeals Tribunal, Rights Commissioners, etc., are also covered by the scheme.  Where a person&rsquo;s former employer was a limited company, the company must be in liquidation or receivership in order for the person to be eligible to claim under the insolvency payments scheme.  In such circumstances, the liquidator or receiver becomes the relevant officer for submitting claims as he or she has access to the company records and can certify that the amounts claimed are in order.      I am aware that there are cases where companies have ceased trading without engaging in a formal winding-up process and that in some such cases those employers may owe monies to their employees.  Such employees are not eligible for payments under the insolvency payments scheme.  I have asked my Department to review the position to establish what, if anything can be done to progress payments to individuals in these situations.    </p><p>  My Department is consulting with a range of interested parties in this review including the ODCE, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Revenue Commissioners.  The Department has received submissions from ICTU on the issue.

However, fraud and abuse of the welfare system is also a reality and it needs to be tackled to protect the integrity of the system and ensure that the resources available are targeted at those who need them most.The Department&rsquo;s overall approach to tackling fraud and abuse is set out in its Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy 2014 &ndash; 2018 which was published earlier this year.  Control work is measured in terms of control savings and they are used as a performance indicator for year-on-year activities. Control savings represent an estimate of the value of prevented expenditure on claims over a future period.  They refer to future expenditure that would have been incurred but for this control work.  Without this control work, the social welfare expenditure would over time increase by this amount.     Control savings do not include any cases of departmental error or any cases where the customer voluntarily told the Department of their means or circumstances, which resulted in a change to their rate of payment.  Control savings arise from proactive reviews on claims in payment. The control savings achieved in 2013 was &euro;631m.</p><p>  The Department also reports on overpayments raised each year.  In 2013, the total value of overpayments raised amounted to &euro;127m.   The Department distinguishes between overpayments it attributes to fraud or suspected fraud, client error or departmental error and estate cases. </p><p>  Fraud or suspected fraud overpayments arise mainly on foot of false declarations by customers concerning their employment, income or family status.  Error cases are primarily due to customer or third party error or departmental error.  Estate cases arise where undisclosed means by customers (usually pensioners) come to light after their deaths. </p><p>  The Department in undertaking measures to combat fraud and error does so to protect the integrity of the system for those who are in genuine need of support, the taxpayer and Irish society generally.</p></reply>

All the PRSI requirements must be met on one person's record - one may not combine the contributions of both spouses or civil partners.  All must have been made before the death of the spouse or civil partner.The Deputy should note that from December 2013 new applicants for Widow's, Widow(er)'s Contributory Pension and Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension require <b>260</b>paid PRSI contributions to qualify, an increase from the 156 contributions previously required.  This change was one of a number of measures introduced in the pension system since the economic downturn, to ensure that the system was sustainable, while maintaining core rates of payment.Virtually all PRSI contributions count towards this pension, including contributions paid by public servants and the self-employed. <br/><br/>In order to qualify, either the person claiming or their spouse or civil partner must have:<br/><br/>- At least 260 paid contributions paid before the relevant date (which is either the date of the bereavement or the 66<sup>th</sup>birthday of one of the spouses, depending on the basis of qualification); and<br/><br/>- An average of 39 paid or credited contributions in either the 3 or 5 years before the death of the spouse or civil partner or before he or she reached pension age (66);<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>- A yearly average of at least 24 paid or credited contributions from the year of first entry into insurance until the year of death or reaching pension age. If this average is used then an average of 24 will entitle a person to a minimum payment, they will need an average of 48 per year to get the full pension. <br/><br/>Once a customer has qualified, the pension is paid as long as the person remains widowed (e.g. it is withdrawn if they re-marry), and is increased to the level of the State pension contributory at age 66.  There is no means test, with the maximum rate payable regardless of other income.<br/><br/>The previous requirement of 156 paid contributions equated in real terms to three years attachment to work by either spouse or civil partner, and had been in place since 1953.  This was not sustainable, particularly at a time when the qualifying condition for the State Pension contributory has increased to 520 paid contributions.  In comparison, the previous qualifying conditions to Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Contributory Pension were very low, and it was decided to increase the contribution requirements to 260 paid contributions.  There are no plans to reverse this decision.<br/><br/>In cases where someone becomes widowed and neither they nor their late spouse/ civil partner satisfy these conditions, but they have an income need, they may qualify for a means-tested non-contributory pension.</p></reply>

Where weekly earnings exceed &euro;352, employees become liable for PRSI which is charged at 4% on all earnings.  While the effect of paying PRSI on all earnings once the &euro;352 employee PRSI threshold is exceeded, is an issue, the yield from those paying PRSI contributes to keeping workers on lower earnings (below the &euro;352 threshold) outside of the PRSI net.  Family Income Supplement (FIS) is available for lower paid workers with families, whose income falls below the relevant FIS thresholds.  The level of FIS entitlement is based on net income after all relevant deductions, including the deduction of PRSI.  The payment effectively preserves the incentive to take up or remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if s/he were claiming other social welfare payments.</p></reply>

This continuous improvement programme is fundamental to the Department&rsquo;s objectives of delivering a comprehensive service to people, positioning the Department to better adapt to changing customer needs and priorities, while delivering on internal effectiveness and efficiency goals. JobsIreland is a vacancy advertising system developed by F&Aacute;S in the early 2000s and is now the largest jobsite in Ireland.  The current service is approaching its end of life and some of its functionality is limited compared to what is typically available on jobsites operated by public employment services in other States, in particular, with regard to the ability of employers and jobseekers to &lsquo;match&rsquo; and  &lsquo;search&rsquo; for suitable candidates/jobs.    The current system also operates outside of the Department&rsquo;s IT architecture and would need development in order to integrate/automate information flows between the systems the Department uses to support jobseekers in Intreo centres and JobsIreland itself.  It is therefore timely to consider refreshing/replacing the system.  </p><p>  The Department has therefore invited tenders for the provision, maintenance, support and operation of a new online Public Employment Jobs Matching/Vacancy Service, to replace the existing JobsIreland (www.JobsIreland.ie) service.  If and when contracts are awarded the new service will continue to be administered and managed by the Department and there are no plans to privatise the service.</p></reply>

As reported in the 2013 Annual Report of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, 28,062 appeals were finalised by Appeals Officers in 2013, and of these 7,598 (27.1%) were decided following an oral appeal hearing.

Although youth unemployment has fallen, the rate remains high and the period of time young unemployed people are out of work for is a particular cause for concern.  In this regard the Government, together with other governments around Europe, is committed to implementation of a Youth Guarantee to ensure that young people are supported and positioned to benefit from the recovery in employment.

It is paid to around 604,000 families in respect of some 1.15 million children, with an estimated expenditure of around &euro;1.9 billion in 2014.  It is paid in respect of all qualified children up to the age of 16 years in line with the statutory school attendance age.  The payment continues to be paid for children up to their 18<sup>th</sup>birthday who are in full-time education, subject to certification from school or college of educational attendance for each of these years.  <br/><br/>A Value for Money Review of Child Income Support Programmes found that the participation pattern in second-level education supports the 18-year age limit for child benefit.  For families on low incomes there are a number of provisions to social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education until the age of 22, including:<br/><br/>- qualified child increases (QCIs) with primary social welfare payments<br/><br/>- family income supplement (FIS) for low-paid employees with children<br/><br/>- The back to school clothing and footwear allowance for low income families. <br/><br/>Therefore, I have no plans to make any changes to the age threshold for child benefit.  <br/><br/>Budget 2015 increased child benefit by &euro;5, from &euro;130 to &euro;135 per month, which will benefit over 611,000 households with children. In addition, the new back to work family dividend for long-term unemployed jobseekers with children and lone parents who return to work, will provide &euro;29.80 per child in the first year and half that figure in the second year.  In total over &euro;2.4 billion will be provided for child income supports in 2015, up &euro;125 million on this year. <br/><br/>These measures recognise the sacrifices that families made during the economic crisis and their continuing difficulties.  They are in line with the commitment in the Statement of Government Priorities for a new deal on living standards for hard-pressed families. Strategically, the measures will increase the pace of the progress in helping people back to work, boost the recovery, reduce welfare expenditure in the long-run, and, most importantly, help the families in question to build a better financial future for themselves.</p></reply>

It is envisaged that the guarantee as it affects those aged under 18 years will be implemented within 2 years, i.e. by the end of 2015. The guarantee of an offer of training, education or work experience for those aged 18-24 years after a four month period should be implemented on a phased basis.<br/><br/>The Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan was published in January.  It provides for over 28,000 programme opportunities for unemployed young people in 2014.  This figure excludes some 24,000 places provided for young people through PLC courses and apprenticeships.  These PLC and apprenticeship places, together with the wide range of vocational third-level courses provided for the young, although not reserved for unemployed jobseekers, nevertheless contribute to the spirit of the guarantee.  <br/><br/>Starting in 2014, and for completion by the end of 2014, processes and programmes are being progressively rolled out to ensure that all of those young unemployed people who need most support (i.e. are assessed as having a low probability of securing employment in the absence of support from the Public Employment Services) will receive a Youth Guarantee offer within four months. <br/><br/>In relation to the 28,000 plus places for unemployed young people, approximately 14,300 of these had been taken up at the end of September.  This excludes a number of schemes where up-to-date figures are not currently available (as outlined in the table provided).  The table supplied displays the total take-up for the year-to-date, together with the estimate for full-year intake provided in the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan. <br/><br/>Take-up is expected to rise substantially by year-end, for several reasons. <br/><br/>First, the student intake on programmes such as the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) and Vocational Training Opportunity Scheme (VTOS) is concentrated in September/October in line with the academic calendar.  In addition, the intake of young people to the 2014 iteration of the Momentum programme for long-term unemployed jobseekers has just begun (late September).  <br/><br/>Second, some of the initiatives planned under the guarantee required primary legislation to allow positive discrimination on age grounds in the provision of employment services and supports.  This legislation was enacted as part of the Social Welfare Bill over the summer.  Two employment schemes in particular, the Youth Guarantee developmental internship programme and the JobsPlus variant for young people (supporting young unemployed at risk of becoming long-term unemployed who have been signing on the Live Register for 4 months), were dependent on this legislation being passed.  These schemes will be in place shortly.  The legislation also permits the introduction of earlier and more intensive engagement by INTREO with the young unemployed which should also translate increased placement on schemes covered by the Youth Guarantee.; processes to give effect to this engagement are currently being implemented by the Department.<br/><br/><br/><br/><table><tr><th><b>Programme</b></th><th><b>Expected full-year intake</b></th><th><b>2014  - YTD</b></th><th><b>Note</b></th></tr><tr><td>Youthreach/CTC</td><td><br /><br />3,300</td><td>1,300</td><td>Only CTC starters  -- Youthreach <br /><br />figures not yet available for 2014</td></tr><tr><td>JobBridge (including planned reserve)</td><td><br /><br />5,000</td><td>2,418</td><td>As of 14<sup>th</sup>October</td></tr><tr><td>T&uacute;s</td><td>1,000</td><td>1,223</td><td>As of  30<sup>th</sup>September </td></tr><tr><td>JobsPlus</td><td>1,500</td><td>265</td><td>As of  30<sup>th</sup>September </td></tr><tr><td>Momentum</td><td>2,000</td><td>13</td><td>2014 intake commencing September-October</td></tr><tr><td>BTEA (excl Momentum)</td><td>3,300</td><td>2319</td><td>As of 14<sup>th </sup>October </td></tr><tr><td>BTWEA</td><td>200</td><td>139</td><td>Including 5 persons on STEA</td></tr><tr><td>VTOS</td><td>500</td><td>Not available </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>FAS/Solas</td><td><br /><br /><br /><br />9500</td><td>6,036</td><td>Based on SST, Traineeship, Bridging &amp;amp; LTI starters YTD <br /><br />(end September)</td></tr><tr><td>CEB youth Entrepreneurship <br /><br />Training and Mentoring supports</td><td><br /><br />700</td><td></td><td>Not yet commenced</td></tr><tr><td>CEB/MFI micro-loans for young people</td><td><br /><br />150</td><td>2</td><td>31<sup>st</sup>August</td></tr><tr><td>International Work Experience and Training</td><td><br /><br />250</td><td></td><td>Not yet commenced</td></tr><tr><td>Gateway</td><td>450</td><td>122 </td><td>26<sup>th</sup>September</td></tr><tr><td>Community Employment</td><td>500</td><td>438</td><td>30<sup>st</sup>September</td></tr><tr><td><b>Total </b></td><td><b>28,350</b></td><td><b>14,293</b></td><td>Excluding where figures are not available</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 8.5%).  </p><p>  The most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund  (published in 2012)  indicated that the self-employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person. </p><p>  Self-employed persons, including former self &ndash;employed, may be eligible for a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment. Jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is a means tested social assistance scheme. For means test purposes, account is taken of the income and assets of the claimant and their spouse or partner. No account is taken of outgoings such as rent or other financial commitments in calculating means for social assistance schemes generally, including jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance. </p><p>  A rent supplement payment can be paid to jobseekers who are in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or benefit payment. This supplement is in addition to their jobseeker&rsquo;s payment and entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or benefit (and the associated weekly rates of payment) does not have regard to whether a person qualifies for the supplement or not or whether the person was renting before becoming unemployed. </p><p>  If the individual in question considers that they may now have an entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance as their income has declined (and they satisfy all of the other statutory conditions), he should reapply for that payment. In this regard, it should be noted that the assessment of income from self-employment is based on gross income less expenses necessarily incurred in carrying out that self-employment.</p></reply>

The fuel allowance is paid for 26 weeks from October to April to almost 415,000 households at an estimated cost of &euro;208 million in 2014.<br/><br/>The Government has already announced that from 2015 both the household benefits package and the fuel allowance will also include a quarterly water support payment of &euro;25.  The estimated cost of this new water support payment of &euro;100 per annum will be in the region of &euro;66 million in 2015. <br/><br/>I am confident that the combination of both household benefits and fuel allowance as qualifying payments for water support will ensure that the payment is made to those most likely to be impacted by the charges, including the elderly, the disabled and those on long term social protection payments.  <br/><br/>The following schemes provide entitlement to household benefits or fuel allowance, in some cases subject to a means or household composition test:<br/><br/>- State pension contributory, non-contributory and transition<br/><br/>- widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's contributory and non-contributory pension<br/><br/>- pre-retirement allowance, farm assist and long term (over 15 months) jobseeker's allowance<br/><br/>- one parent family payment<br/><br/>- deserted wife's allowance<br/><br/>- deserted wife's benefit<br/><br/>- disability allowance<br/><br/>- blind pension<br/><br/>- carer's allowance (if carer lives with person being cared for)<br/><br/>- invalidity pension<br/><br/>- injury benefit<br/><br/>- guardian's payment (non-contributory)<br/><br/>- guardian's payment (contributory)<br/><br/>- others, including people over 70, people in receipt of a foreign pension, people aged 66-70 subject to a means test.<br/><br/>People who had an entitlement to household benefits or fuel allowance before beginning employment support or back to education schemes normally retain their entitlements while on the schemes.<br/><br/>The following short term schemes are not qualifying schemes for either household benefits or fuel allowance:<br/><br/>- basic supplementary welfare allowance (under 15 months)<br/><br/>- short term jobseeker's allowance (under 15 months)<br/><br/>- jobseekers benefit<br/><br/>- maternity or adoptive benefit<br/><br/>- family income supplement<br/><br/>- illness benefit<br/><br/>- carers benefit<br/><br/>- health and safety benefit.<br/><br/>As regards the number who will not be entitled to water support, it is not possible to give a definitive answer, as both household benefits and fuel allowance are paid on a household basis, i.e., a house with several people in receipt of weekly payments from this Department will only receive one water support payment.  People who are in receipt of non-qualifying payments may live in households which qualify through other people in the household. Similarly, while family income supplement (FIS) is not a qualifying payment itself, a person in receipt of both FIS and one parent family payment may qualify for fuel allowance.<br/><br/>The question of income tax relief and the numbers who will be able to avail of it is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</p></reply>

In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In assessing means from self-employment, income from the previous twelve months is used as an indicator of likely future earnings.  </p><p>  In September 2013, I published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral. </p><p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. </p><p>  The Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries.  To this end, the Group recommended that class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work, because of a long-term illness or incapacity, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points.  </p><p>  This recommendation will require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund which indicated that the self-employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  The Actuarial Review found that the effective annual rate of contribution needed to provide the full rate State pension (contributory), currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%. </p><p>  I will keep recommendations contained in the report under review in the medium term taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation.</p><p>  The most recent statistical information available from this Department shows that there were 321,238 persons paying class S PRSI in 2012.</p></reply>

There are approximately 73,500 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.  </p><p>  I am acutely aware of the difficulties people are experiencing in maintaining affordable rented accommodation, including those in receipt of rent supplement, in the current market, particularly in areas of high demand.  Raising rent limits may not be the solution to the problem as it is likely to add to further rental inflation and impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers and students. I plan to keep the matter under close review.</p><p>  Analysis shows that the impact of increasing limits at this time will yield only a very marginal increase in available supply for rent supplement recipients with the only certainty that raising limits will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to new recipients.</p><p>  I can assure the Deputies that officers administering rent supplement throughout the country have considerable experience in dealing with customers and will continue to make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met.  Discretionary powers are available to staff to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant. A notice reminding staff of their statutory discretionary power to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases, for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy was circulated earlier this year.  </p><p>  In light of a particular concentration of the homelessness problem in the Dublin area, the Department has agreed a tenancy sustainment protocol with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations so that families on rent supplement who are at risk of losing their accommodation can have more timely and appropriate interventions made on their behalf.  Since the launch of this protocol in mid-June 2014, over 150 families have had their rent supplement claims revised by the Department.  </p><p>  Increasing housing supply and the reactivation of the construction activity is a critical issue for Government and is key to restoring stability to the rental market. The Government has recently launched its Construction Strategy 2020.  </p><p>  As part of Budget 2015, Government has also announced significant capital investment of over &euro;2.2 billion for social housing for the next three years.  In 2014, over &euro;800 million will be invested in a range of housing programmes which represents the first major investment in housing since 2009. An additional &euro;10.5 million will be provided for accommodation and related services for homeless persons, increasing the annual expenditure for tackling homelessness to &euro;55.5 million next year. </p><p>  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Alan Kelly T.D., is also due to publish a Social Housing Strategy shortly.  This will propose a range of approaches and reforms that are innovative and challenging and will provide a basis for an improved and sustainable approach to the provision of social housing supports in Ireland. </p><p>  Finally, it is clearly my preference that a person in receipt of rent supplement should not be refused accommodation due to the fact that they are receiving support from the State. The fact that approximately 73,500 people are in receipt of rent supplement, of which some 16,500 were awarded this year, shows that a significant number of persons are being accommodated under the scheme. My position on this matter has been advised to the two larger property website owners in terms of their advertising, following which, one subsequently removed the reference to rent supplement on their website. Officials in the Department are also engaging with those in the Department of Justice and Equality in regard to this issue.</p></reply>

The unemployment rate is falling and is currently at 11.1%, the lowest rate in 5 years &ndash; and is down from a peak of just over 15% in 2011. <br/><br/>The most recent QNHS figures for long term unemployment show that since a peak in Q1 2012 of 204,000, the numbers had fallen by 57,800 as of Q2 2014, a reduction of 28% (see Figure 1 below). The percentage of the labour force who are long-term unemployed (the long-term unemployment rate) rose from 8.2% in 2011 Q1 to 9.5% in Q1 2012 before falling over the last two years to a recent low of 6.8% in Q2 2014. <br/><br/></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-10-21a.239.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014102100064#WRG00500"><p>The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for SPC easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC.  It does not involve the award of credits for the duration of the period spent on caring duties.</p><p>  To be eligible for the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, a person must:</p><p>- Permanently live in the State (exception may be made where EU regulations apply),</p><p>- Be aged under 66,</p><p>- Have started insurable employment or self-employment before the age of 56,</p><p>- Not work full-time, although for the purposes of this scheme, a person can work and earn less than &euro;38 gross per week,</p><p>- Care for a child (under 12) or an incapacitated person on a full-time basis.</p><p>  It is important to note that the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a SPC.  The standard qualifying conditions for the SPC must also be satisfied.  These require a person to enter insurable employment at least ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate (credited contributions do not satisfy this condition) and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions paid or credited on their record.  The requirement to have 520 paid contributions (an increase from 260) has been provided for in legislation since 1997, and took effect from April 2012.</p><p>  The 2007 Green Paper on Pensions indicated that to back-date the homemakers scheme to 1953, the year when the unified system of social insurance was introduced, would cost the Exchequer some &euro;160 million per annum.  Costs in relation to this scheme, under the current rules, are expected to increase in the coming years due to the increase in female employment rates since 1994.</p><p>  Where someone age 66 or over does not satisfy the conditions to qualify for a SPC, or qualifies for less than the maximum rate, they may instead qualify for one the following:</p><p>- The means-tested State pension (non-contributory).  The maximum personal rate of this pension is &euro;219, which may be payable if their means are no more than &euro;30 per week.  A reduced rate may be payable if their means are no more than &euro;245 per week.  A living alone allowance may also be paid, where applicable.</p><p>- If a spouse receives the SPC, the other spouse may receive a payment, known as an increase for qualified adult (IQA), which may be up to &euro;206.30 per week.</p><p>- If widowed, they may qualify for a widow's contributory pension, which they may claim either based on their spouse&rsquo;s or their own social insurance record.  The qualifying conditions for this require fewer contributions paid (260) than the SPC, and the maximum personal rate for those aged 66 or over is &euro;230.30.</p><p>  Where a person qualifies for more than one of the above payments, they are paid under the pension that is most advantageous to them.</p><p>  People over 66 may be eligible for household benefits (worth &euro;680 per year from 2015) and fuel allowance (worth &euro;520 per year).  They may also qualify for free travel and assistance with their rent, depending on their circumstances.</p><p>  Under the pension reform programme, it is planned to adopt a total contributions approach where the number of contributions paid over a work life will closely reflect the rate of payment received.  This approach was endorsed by the OECD Review of the Irish Pension System, which was published in April 2013.  It has been planned to introduce this change in 2020, although this date may change.  The position of women, including those who qualify for the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, will be considered carefully in the context of this reform.</p></reply>

It is the Department&rsquo;s policy to investigate and pursue all overpayments so as to protect public monies to the greatest extent possible.  The Department has a responsibility to ensure that all overpayments are refunded in full.  People who have received an overpayment from the Department have a liability under law to refund the amounts involved. (Section 338 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005 (as amended) refers).  They have received monies to which they were not entitled.  In that regard, the Department is fully committed to recovering 100% of all overpayments arising, whether as a result of fraud or error.  The Department does not apply interest or penalties on the amounts owing.</p><p>  Debt recoveries are not categorised by whether the original overpayment was fraud or error.  In 2011, the total value of recoveries was &euro;51.5m while &euro;53.5m was recovered in 2012 and, in 2013, recoveries were made to the value of &euro;70.7m.</p><p>  Until the introduction of recent legislation, the Department was limited in its capacity to recover overpayments without the person&rsquo;s agreement.  For this reason, overpayments often remained outstanding for a long period of time.  Since these legislative changes, the Department can now recovery levels of up to 15% from the personal rate of a person&rsquo;s social welfare payment without consent.  In addition, in order to improve the capacity to recover overpayments from persons no longer dependent on social welfare, legislation was introduced that provides for the Notice of Attachment powers for the recovery of overpayments directly from a person&rsquo;s earnings or from monies held by them in financial institutions or other state payments.</p><p>  These amendments mean that the Department is now in a position to ensure, as far as practical, that all debt-holders are repaying their debt.  The rate a debt is recovered differs from case to case.</p><p>  The Public Services Card (PSC) has been introduced to enable individuals gain access to public services more efficiently and with a minimum of duplication of effort, while at the same time preserving their privacy to the maximum extent possible.  The enhanced identity authentication requirements mainly involves applicants having to attend at a designated office in order to provide appropriate documentary evidence and have their photograph and a sample of their signature recorded electronically.  Since the project commenced, 973,500 persons have been registered for a PSC to date, 260,000 of which are the Free Travel variant.</p><p>  The PSC also provides a higher and enhanced level of assurance as to identity. It acts as a key tool in the prevention and detection of identity fraud.  Identity fraud and identity theft are issues which public bodies are rightly concerned about, both in terms of prevention and detection.  It represents a robust identity registration process involving the capture of an individual&rsquo;s photograph and signature and the verification of identity data already held by the Department.  Provision has not been made for any further biometrics and currently there are no plans to change that.</p><p>  It is anticipated that the secondment of 20 Garda&iacute; to the Department to assist its Special Investigation Unit with fraud investigation work will come into effect in November 2014.</p><p>  Seconded Garda&iacute; will undertake the full range of investigative duties in detecting and combating social welfare fraud.  They will retain their powers as Garda&iacute; for the duration of their secondment.  They will also have powers under the Social Welfare Acts to enable them to work with officers from the Department&rsquo;s SIU and will perform all relevant social welfare fraud investigation functions. Protocols have been agreed between the Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the usage and protection of data.  In addition, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has been consulted on these protocols and the arrangements that will apply.</p></reply>

There were 62,937 people availing of these programmes in August 2014, which is an increase of 551 (0.9%) from the previous year, when there were 62,386 people in activation programmes.  At end August, 2014, JobBridge had 6,053 participants compared to approximately 5,300 at the same time last year.<br/><br/>During the same period, August 2013 &ndash; August 2014,  the number of people on the Live Register (seasonally adjusted)  fell from 415,600 to 380,100 &ndash; a reduction of 35,500.  Given that the reduction in numbers of people on the Live Register is about 35,000 greater than the increase in the number of people on employment schemes it cannot be said, as is implied in the question,  that the reduction in the numbers of people on the Live Register is due to a marked increase in the number of people on employment schemes, including JobBridge.<br/><br/>JobBridge was introduced in 2011 in order to break the vicious cycle whereby unemployed people are unable to get a job without experience but are unable to get experience without a job.  At the time JobBridge was introduced many people were expressing frustration that jobseekers could not take up unpaid work experience opportunities either because they could not afford the expenses associated with going to work or, worse still, because they could lose their entitlement to their jobseeker payment if they were no longer considered available for or to be genuinely seeking work.  JobBridge was developed to overcome these obstacles.  As of 16th October, 2014, approximately 36,149 individual internships have voluntarily been undertaken by jobseekers.<br/><br/>An independent evaluation of JobBridge found that 61% of former interns move into employment 5 months or more after completion.  JobBridge interns are exiting the Live Register in significant numbers to move into employment.  The independent evaluation found that JobBridge would achieve a positive net benefit to the exchequer if participants secure employment and remain off the Live Register for a minimum period of about 5 &frac12; months.<br/><br/>I am satisfied that recent reductions in the number of unemployed jobseekers and a rise in the number of those entering employment show that <i>Pathways to Work</i>, and the Department&rsquo;s activation measures including JobBridge, are achieving significant beneficial results for jobseekers and the wider community.<br/><br/>T&Uacute;S Community Work Placement Initiative had 7,477 participants and Community Employment Schemes had 23,124 participants.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-10-21a.262.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014102100064#WRG02100"><p>I announced, on Budget Day, a number of welfare initiatives costing &euro;198 million.  These measures have four key objectives, as follows:<br/><br/>- Assisting unemployed families to return to work by providing continued financial support;<br/><br/>- Helping all families in the State with the cost of raising children;<br/><br/>- Recognising the additional pressures on pensioners and people with disabilities who are living alone, and<br/><br/>- Helping vulnerable welfare households to meet the costs associated with water services.<br/><br/>The measures included the introduction of a new Back to Work Family Dividend. Through this scheme, long-term unemployed jobseekers with children who leave welfare to return to work can retain the child-related portion of their social welfare payment on a tapered basis over two years.  This includes those who move to self-employment, such as the construction sector.  It will also apply to One Parent Family Payment recipients who similarly go back into the workforce.<br/><br/>The scheme will be worth &euro;1,550 per child in the first year of employment or self-employment and half that amount again in the second year.  The Dividend will help increase the pace of the progress we are making in helping people back to work.  It will help boost the recovery, reduce welfare expenditure in the long-run, and, most importantly, help the families in question to build a better financial future for themselves.<br/><br/>In addition, I also doubled the number of JobsPlus places, from 3,000 to 6,000, to incentivise employers to hire long-term unemployed from the Live Register.<br/><br/>Turning to supports for families generally, I also provided for an increase in the Child Benefit rate of &euro;5, bringing the monthly rate from &euro;130 to &euro;135 per child.  This recognises the sacrifices that families made during the economic crisis and the fact that families are continuing to face difficulties.  In the <i>Statement of Priorities </i>published earlier this year, the Government promised a new deal on living standards for hard-pressed families, and this increase is in line with that commitment. I have also provided an additional &euro;2 million for the School Meals scheme in 2015.<br/><br/>Looking now at pensioners and people with disabilities, there will be an increase in the Living Alone Allowance of &euro;1.30 per week, bringing the rate up from &euro;7.70 to &euro;9.  The Living Alone Allowance is a payment made to pensioners and people with disabilities who live alone, and was last increased in 1996.<br/><br/>In line with the <i>Statement of Priorities, </i>I am introducing a Water Support payment of &euro;100 to recipients of the Household Benefit Package, to help older people and other vulnerable groups meet the cost of water services.  In addition, I am introducing a payment of &euro;100 per annum to Fuel Allowance recipients who are not in receipt of the Household Benefits Package.  This measure will also work to alleviate the impact of water costs.<br/><br/>As you know, the Christmas Bonus was abolished by the previous Government in 2009 . I am pleased to say that I am in a position to partially restore the Bonus this year.  A bonus of 25% will be paid in early December to all long-term welfare recipients including pensioners, lone parents, jobseekers, carers and people with disabilities.  This will cost over &euro;63 million and is in recognition of the position of vulnerable households.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this Budget will:<br/><br/>- help more people return to work, particularly families with children;<br/><br/>- support all families with children as well as pensioners and people with disabilities living alone, and<br/><br/>- assist low-income families on welfare to meet the costs associated with water services.<br/><br/>Throughout the crisis, this Government protected core welfare rates and maintained a massively strong social welfare safety net.  This is acknowledged by the ESRI, among others, which has pointed out that, unlike in other countries, income inequality has fallen in Ireland in recent years, largely because of the overall maintenance of the welfare system.<br/><br/>But we did not just maintain the system throughout the crisis; we transformed it in order to help people back to work.  And in so doing, we have created the room to announce enhanced support for those who need it most, while continuing our unrelenting focus on reducing unemployment.</p></reply>

Each scheme area is continuously monitored and reviewed to ensure customers are responded to as quickly as possible.  In this regard, the Department has had major success in clearing backlogs, notably in the disability and caring schemes.  The following Table provides details of processing times for each of the Department&rsquo;s schemes in September 2014 and the current number of claims pending in each scheme.<br/><br/>Processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria.  Schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness-related schemes, can take longer to process.  Similarly, means-tested payments can also require more detailed investigation and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision making process.<br/><br/>As part of the Department&rsquo;s programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented in recent years.  Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised.<br/><br/>In addition, the staffing needs of the Department are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.  <br/><br/><b>Table: Claim processing times &ndash; September 2014</b><table><tr><th>Scheme</th><th>Average weeks to award</th><th>No. Pending Claims at end September 2014</th></tr><tr><td>State Pension (contributory)</td><td>5</td><td>2,446</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (transition)</td><td>12</td><td>851</td></tr><tr><td>Widow(er)&rsquo;s Pension (contributory)  </td><td>2</td><td>469</td></tr><tr><td>One Parent Family </td><td>9</td><td>1,857</td></tr><tr><td>Household Benefits</td><td>2</td><td>3,113</td></tr><tr><td>Bereavement Grant </td><td>10</td><td>856</td></tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension </td><td>8 (Est. average weeks to award a new claim, excluding claims which are awarded following a review and/or appeal process following initial disallowance).  </td><td>2,161</td></tr><tr><td>Family Income Supplement  - New Claims</td><td>3 (In general, renewal FIS claims are currently processed in advance of previous claim expiry and new FIS claims are processed within 3 weeks of receipt)</td><td>2,037</td></tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance</td><td>11 (Est. average weeks to award a new claim excluding claims which are awarded following a review and/or appeal process following initial disallowance.)  </td><td>6,485</td></tr><tr><td>Carer&rsquo;s Allowance</td><td>12 (Est. average weeks to award a new claim, excluding claims which are awarded following a review and/or appeal process following initial disallowance.)</td><td>4,902</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit  </td><td>1</td><td>2,642</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance</td><td>2</td><td>10,334</td></tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit  </td><td>1</td><td>1,828</td></tr><tr><td>Maternity Benefit </td><td>2 (In July 97% of Maternity Benefit claims were awarded 2 weeks prior to the commencement of maternity leave)</td><td>6,079</td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit</td><td>-</td><td>1,686</td></tr><tr><td>- Domestic</td><td>2</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Domiciliary Care Allowance </td><td>13</td><td>1,194</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Back to Education Allowance</td><td>Applicants for BTEA are already in receipt of another social welfare payment before a decision is made on their entitlement to the Allowance.  </td><td>-</td></tr></table></p></reply>

These policies are at the core of the Government&rsquo;s strategies to get Ireland working again.  The strategy outlined in Pathways is devised to ensure new job opportunities are made available to people on the live register with particular focus on the longer-term unemployed and that jobseekers are prepared to avail of work opportunities.  Since the introduction of Pathways to Work, a significant transformation has already been delivered in the way the Department works with jobseekers and in its engagement with employers.  This has resulted in the revision of a range of services and schemes and the provision of new incentives to jobseekers and employers.<br/><br/>The Department has rolled out new services through Intreo centres, 44 of which are now operational nationally, which provide for improved engagement with jobseekers and employers.  Intreo centres offer one-to-one assistance to jobseekers by dedicated case officers.  This includes the preparation of individual progression plans to identify opportunities and where skills need to be improved which will ultimately improve a jobseeker&rsquo;s employment chances.  Additionally, greater targeting of activation places, work placement schemes and other opportunities have been put in place for jobseekers allied to incentivising the take-up of employment opportunities.<br/><br/>The Department operates a range of employment support measures designed to encourage and support jobseekers to return to and remain at work, establish self-employment opportunities and engage in reskilling and upskilling.  With respect to returning to work and upskilling, the Department along with the Department of Education and Skills under the back to education programme together provide a broad range of access and income support for jobseekers wishing to re-skill or take up a course of education and training.  For jobseekers entering work, financial supports are provided in the form of family income supplement (FIS) for employees with families, including lone parents, to supplement income from work where this is low.  Allied to this, an important new measure was announced in Budget 2015, called the back to work family dividend, which will help long-term jobseekers and lone parents with children return to work by allowing them to retain an element of the welfare payment previously paid in respect of dependent children.  A part-time job incentive scheme is also available which allows long-term jobseekers to take up part-time employment for less than 24 hours per week and to continue to receive a weekly income supplement.<br/><br/>Those jobseekers wishing to pursue a self-employment option can retain all or part of their jobseekers payment for up to two years under the back to work enterprise allowance.  An enterprise support grant was introduced during 2014 designed to provide small scale financial support to underpin the business start-up.<br/><br/>The Department continues to deepen its engagement with employers and to work with them to identify opportunities and what future skills needs will be required.  JobsPlus is a targeted financial incentive designed to encourage employers to focus their recruitment activities on the long-term unemployed.  At the end of September 2014, 3,000 longer-term jobseekers were being supported in work.  A further expansion of JobsPlus was announced in Budget 2015 which will allow for double the number of jobseekers to be supported.<br/><br/>I will be announcing further enhancements to a range of schemes in the coming weeks to underpin the commitment to support young people who are unemployed.  The Deputy should note that a significant range of supports are provided to people with disabilities and members of the Travelling community and to community enterprises to support employment.<br/><br/>Details of all schemes are available on the Department&rsquo;s website , at any Intreo Centre or by contacting the information section on 01 704 3000 or 1890 66 22 44.</p></reply>

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth.  This strategy is working. Employment has risen by over 75,000 since 2012. The unemployment rate is falling and is currently at 11.1%, the lowest rate in 5 years &ndash; and is down from a peak of just over 15% in 2011.</p><p>  However, Government also recognises the need for additional activation measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created as the economy recovers are taken up by those on the Live Register. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy. The latest iteration of the Pathways to Work Strategy - Pathways to Work 2015, which was published earlier this month, includes a wide range of programmes and services to help unemployed jobseekers back to employment. These include programmes such as JobBridge, JobsPlus and Momentum introduced by this Government and schemes such as Community Employment and T&uacute;s, where the Department has significantly increased the number of places available. </p><p>  Persons on the Live Register are also eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities, for example through ETB (formerly F&Aacute;S) training for unemployed people and to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course (if they are already in receipt of a social welfare payment).  Springboard and Skillnets courses for unemployed people, funded through the Department of Education and Skills, are also those who are signing on to the Live Register.</p><p>  Pathways to Work 2015 also includes arrangements to increase the level of systematic engagement of the employment services with those who are out of work for long periods. There is also a specific focus on employer engagement to encourage employers to recruit from the Live Register.</p></reply>

Ballet schools are regarded as providing VAT exempt education of a similar kind.  This is because, in general, recognised ballet schools are run by qualified ballet teachers, who teach to an externally examinable syllabus.  In contrast, a range of dance classes, including Irish dance lessons, do not qualify for the education exemption based on these criteria.</p><p>  Dance lessons in general apply at the standard VAT rate, currently 23%, and not a lower VAT rate, as the EU VAT Directive does not make provision for a reduced rate to apply to dance lessons in general.</p><p>  I would point out that the VAT Consolidation Act does provide a VAT exemption for the promotion of, and admission to, live theatrical or musical performances where food or drink is not provided during the performances.  Admission fees to most feiseanna would benefit from this VAT exemption.</p></reply>

This means that where both cohabitants pay tax at the higher rate, an additional &euro;2,000 of a cohabiting couple's income will be subject to income tax at 20% rather than at 40%, resulting in a potential increase in net take home pay of up to &euro;400 per annum.</p></reply>

The EU VAT Directive provides that VAT exemption limits may only be raised in line with inflation, and as such, under EU VAT law it would not be possible to raise Ireland's VAT exemption threshold to the UK level of Stg &pound;81,000.  I would point out, however, that the Irish VAT exemption for small enterprises supplying services is the seventh highest in the EU while our goods threshold is the third highest.  The UK VAT registration threshold is the highest such exemption in the EU.</p><p>  For income tax purposes the income earned by a professional musician is treated in the same manner as income earned by any other taxpayer.</p></reply>

Finance Act 1999 introduced options to provide control, flexibility and choice to certain individuals in relation to the drawing down of benefits from their pension plans.</p><p>  The choices which then became available included the existing option to purchase an annuity with those remaining pension funds, and new options to receive the balance of the pension funds in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate), to invest in an Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) or an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF), subject to certain conditions.  Access to these flexible options was extended to all main benefits from retirement benefit schemes (other than Defined Benefit pension arrangements) in Finance Act 2011.</p><p>  Clearly, I cannot say why a particular individual may not have been in a position to avail of any of these options other than to purchase a pension annuity.  However, where an individual has agreed or is otherwise contracted to the purchase of a pension annuity and the purchase is effected, I am not aware of any circumstance in which the annuity arrangement may be cancelled as outlined in the question.</p></reply>

Insurance Ireland has indicated that 98% of policyholders have household insurance which includes flood cover.</p><p>  The Office of Public Works (OPW) and Insurance Ireland have agreed a Memorandum of Understanding on a sustainable system of information sharing in relation to completed flood alleviation schemes.  The outcome of this arrangement is that the insurance industry will have a much greater level of information and understanding of the extent of the protection provided by completed OPW flood defence works and will therefore be able to reflect this in assessing the provision of flood insurance to householders in areas where works have been completed.</p><p>  My Department has asked Insurance Ireland when they will be in a position to provide hard information which will demonstrate that the Memorandum of Understanding agreed by Insurance Ireland and the OPW has led to an increase in the availability and reduction of cost of insurance in the twelve areas where the OPW has provided the insurance industry with information on completed flood alleviation schemes.  I am informed by the OPW that the Minister for State met with Insurance Ireland on 29 October and again requested that they provide information on the extent to which the data provided by OPW is being utilised by insurance companies, and the impact this is having on the availability of cover.  Insurance Ireland have indicated that they are gathering data on this subject and will have information available in the coming months.  The OPW and Insurance Ireland have also agreed to resume regular meetings of the joint OPW/Insurance Ireland Flood Working Group.  The OPW is continuing its work on developing data on completed flood relief schemes in the format required by Insurance Ireland.  It is expected that a further batch of data will be provided to Insurance Ireland before the end of the year.</p></reply>

Section 149 does not cover interest rates rather it applies to fees and commissions only.<br/><br/>My Department published a report on the review of the regulation of bank fees and charges in December 2013. This contains a detailed description of the process by which the Central Bank makes decisions on whether or not to approve proposed charges. It is available on my Department's website at<i></i>.<br/><br/>The following are the key findings of the review of the regulation of bank fees and charges undertaken by my Department:<br/><br/>- net fee and commission income divided by average assets in Irish banks was well below the average of their peers,<br/><br/>- net fees and commissions are lower in the Irish banks than in their European peers relative to net interest income,<br/><br/>- fee and commission income have become a more important source of income to the banks in recent years and banks have been able to increase fee and commission income since 2009 despite the restrictions imposed by section 149,<br/><br/>- competition in the Irish banking sector has reduced significantly since the onset of the economic crisis and that this reduction is not related to Section 149,<br/><br/>- it is too early to say whether the recent changes in legislation (under the Central Bank Supervision and Enforcement Act 2013) have been successful in attracting new entrants to the Irish banking sector,<br/><br/>- Section 149 does appear to exert a restraining effect on the development of innovative products by the existing banks in Ireland but this may not be to the detriment of consumers,<br/><br/>- Section 149 may lead to inefficiency in pricing of financial products by the banks in Ireland, and<br/><br/>- Low customer mobility may mean that banks can increase prices without fearing a loss of customers.<br/><br/>The review considered a number of possible changes to the existing regime but concluded that it would not be appropriate to repeal Section 149 at this point in time.  The lack of competition in the banking sector means that the removal of section 149 would give unfettered price setting power to the incumbent banks.  This issue should be revisited when competition in the banking sector has improved significantly.</p></reply>

The first and full year cost of reducing the higher rate of income tax from 41% to 40%, is estimated at &euro;158 million and &euro;225 million respectively.  The first and full year cost of the increase of the Universal Social Charge (USC) threshold from &euro;10,036 to &euro;12,012, is estimated at &euro;19 million and &euro;26 million respectively.  The first and full year cost of reducing the 2% and 4% USC rates to 1.5% and 3.5% respectively and adjusting the USC threshold from &euro;10,036 to &euro;12,012, is estimated at &euro;239 million and &euro;325 million respectively.  The first and full year yield from introducing an 8% rate of Universal Social Charge applicable to incomes over &euro;70,044, is estimated at &euro;52 million and &euro;71 million respectively.</p><p>  These figures are estimates from the Revenue tax forecasting model using latest actual data for the year 2012, adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim. They are estimated by reference to 2015 incomes and are provisional and may be revised.  Married persons or civil partners who have elected or who have been deemed to have elected for joint assessment are counted as one tax unit.</p></reply>

This 'de minimus' weekly amount, which is currently &euro;186, is enshrined in social welfare legislation and it was considered, at the time of the introduction of LPT that it was not appropriate to change the law in this regard.</p><p>  In regard to the specific case to which the Deputy refers, the person in question is meeting his LPT liabilities through DaS from his DSP payment and is fully up to date with his obligations in respect of 2014.  His arrangements in this regard will automatically continue into 2015.  The difficulties relate to an outstanding balance of &euro;21 in respect of 2013, which arose as a consequence of a late start to his DSP deductions and a &euro;200 arrear of Household Charge.  The person would like to meet these arrears by increasing his DaS but to do so would bring him below the 'de minimus' threshold.</p><p>  Given the circumstances of the case, a member of the LPT team made direct contact with the person and firstly explained the Deferral option that exists for people on low incomes.  The person declined the Deferral option and indicated that he wanted to pay his LPT liabilities.  The LPT team member then confirmed to him that his DaS is in order for 2014 and will continue 'as is' to fully meet his 2015 liabilities but could not be extended to meet the 2013 LPT/HHC arrears due to the 'de minimus' threshold.</p><p>  The LPT team member also outlined the various other payment options that are available to him given that he did not want to avail of a Deferral.  From the conversation it emerged that the person misunderstood the conditions for payment of LPT via a service provider (PSP) and was of the opinion that only payments in excess of &euro;50 could be made via this method.</p><p>  On the basis of the conversation the person opted to pay his outstanding arrears through a PSP and the LPT team member assisted him to activate the payment option.  I am assured that the issues are now resolved and the person is meeting his LPT/HHC obligations in a manner that suits his individual circumstances.  </p></reply>

For example, the last 3 Returns have been 3 months, 5 months and 6 months late.

Arising from the recommendations in the Review, I am introducing a number of tax measures to support farming.<br/><br/>The following Stamp Duty measures announced on Budget Day relate to the transfer of either property or land:<br/><br/>Consanguinity Relief<br/><br/>Consanguinity relief, which applies to transfers of non-residential property to certain relatives, is due to expire on 31 December 2014.<br/><br/>This relief, which halves the applicable rate of Stamp Duty, will be available in a restricted form for a further period of three years in certain circumstances where the transferor is 65 years or under and the transferee is an active farmer.<br/><br/>Agricultural Leases<br/><br/>Agricultural leases between 5 and 35 years in duration to active farmers will be exempt from Stamp Duty.<br/><br/>Further details on these measures will be available in the Finance Bill which is due for publication on 23 October 2014.</p></reply>

However, pensioners are entitled to an additional tax credit and/or greater exemption ceilings, which are not available to other taxpayers.</p><p>  Any individual or a couple in a marriage or civil partnership, aged 65 or over, whose income from all sources (including any UK dividend income)  is less than or equal to the exemption limit will not have to pay income tax for that year.  The exemption limit applies where the total income is less than &euro;18,000 for a single individual, widowed person or surviving civil partner and &euro;36,000 for a married couple or civil partnership couple.</p><p>  These exemption limits are increased by &euro;575 for each of the first two children and by &euro;830 for each subsequent child.</p><p>  Any individual or a couple in a marriage or civil partnership aged 65 or over whose income from all sources is slightly over the exemption limit may qualify for marginal relief.  Marginal Relief will only be granted if it is more beneficial to the claimant than their tax credits.</p><p>  In addition, the over 70s are only liable to a maximum rate of USC of 4% on their income where it does not exceed &euro;60,000.

I also informed the Deputy that if Irish Water was classified inside general government then all revenue and expenditure would count towards the general government balance.</p><p>  My colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is providing &euro;533 million from the Local Government Fund, which is in general government, to Irish Water in 2015.  Accordingly, this amount of &euro;533m is already included in general government expenditure for 2015.</p><p>  Furthermore revenue from non-domestic customers, which I understand is worth about &euro;230m annually, will count as general government revenue off-setting an equal amount of general government expenditure.</p><p>  I am also providing equity investment of &euro;222m to Irish Water in 2015 subject to the CSO and Eurostat classifying Irish Water as a market institutional unit outside of general government. If this were not the case then such a transfer could, if it were made, be classified as a capital transfer and become general government expenditure when invested by Irish Water.</p><p>  Accordingly, under the scenario that Irish Water is in general government, any expenditure or investment undertaken by Irish Water in 2015 over and above the amounts outlined above would be counted as general government expenditure and impact the deficit. Money borrowed by Irish Water would also count towards general government debt.</p><p>  Regarding the costs associated with water provision in 2015, I refer you to PQ No. 498 (35470/14) of 23 September last answered by my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

This has involved public consultations as well as the preparation of needs analyses and ex-ante evaluations.    In accordance with EU requirements, Ireland has prepared a draft Partnership Agreement with the European Commission which sets out funding priorities that take account of the Europe 2020 Strategy for Smart, Inclusive and Sustainable Growth and the National Reform Programme.  These priorities include promoting jobs and growth; combating unemployment and social exclusion; promoting R&amp;amp;D and ICT investment and the competitiveness of the business sector; and promoting an environmentally-friendly and resource-efficient economy.</p><p>  Draft Operational Programmes, including one covering the BMW region, have been prepared in accordance with these priorities and with the relevant EU Regulations, and these have been submitted to the Commission.  The Regulations specifically exclude airport infrastructure except for measures related to environmental protection. </p></reply>

Whilst individual contracting authorities in the public and utilities sectors would hold information in relation to contracts awarded by them, they are not required to collect the details of all the shareholders that have invested in a company that has been awarded a public contract.<br/><br/>Historical contract award data available to the OGP only pertains to what was previously mandated to be entered into e-Tenders. All government entities are mandated to publish all above OJEU threshold tender notices and awards on OJEU via e-Tenders but Tenders below threshold value but above &euro;25,000 have a general requirement to be advertised on e-Tenders and no requirement to enter award details.  Circular 10/14 which was issued this year mandates the entry of award details in e-Tenders for all tenders &amp;gt;&euro;25,000 published after August 1 2014 so we expect to be able to report on award details for all contracts awarded above &euro;25,000 in the future.  We have developed new functionality in e-Tenders which we released in August 2014 to assist the OGP with ensuring award data is entered into e-Tenders and for reporting on this data.<br/><br/>It should be noted that the contract details provided below are limited to awards for which the details have been entered into eTenders (historically mostly only those above OJEU threshold) and the Supplier details are dependent on information provided by Suppliers for which an award notice was published by the contracting authority. They do not reflect the majority of tenders for which there is no EU Directive requirement to publish an award notice and no historical mandate (prior to Circular 10/14) as usual behaviour is not to enter award details for these awards. The EU thresholds are: for works contracts the threshold is &euro;5.186 million; for supplies and service contracts awarded by Government Departments the threshold is &euro;134,000 and for the remainder of public bodies the threshold is &euro;207,000. The threshold for supplies and service contracts of entities operating in utility sectors (water, energy, transport and postal) is &euro;414,000.<br/><br/>Nine contracts are recorded as been awarded to companies with an address in County Wexford since the current government inception. The details are:<table><tr><th>Contract Name</th><th>Contracting Authority</th><th>Company Name</th><th>Planned Value</th><th>Year</th></tr><tr><td>Proposed Upgrading of Existing Waste Water Treatment System</td><td>Irish Aviation Authority</td><td>Molloy Engineering</td><td>&euro;60,000</td><td>2014</td></tr><tr><td>Provision of Endpoint solution for over 1000 endpoints</td><td>Brothers of Charity Services Galway<br /><br /><br /><br /></td><td>Datapac</td><td>&euro;30,000</td><td>2014</td></tr><tr><td>The supply and erection of Safety Barrier repairs on National Roads In County Kerry<br /><br /><br /><br /></td><td>Kerry County Council</td><td>Guardrail Ireland ltd<br /><br /><br /><br /></td><td>&euro;150,000</td><td>2014</td></tr><tr><td>Multi Supplier Framework Agreement for the Provision of Stationery, Printer Toners, Printed Material and Hospital Charts<br /><br /><br /><br /></td><td>The National Maternity Hospital<br /><br /><br /><br /></td><td>Datapac</td><td>&euro;1,000,000</td><td>2014</td></tr><tr><td>Provision of Servers for the Office of Public Works</td><td>OPW</td><td>Datapac</td><td>&euro;50,000</td><td>2014</td></tr><tr><td>Supply of SAN Storage Device to SFI<br /><br /><br /><br /></td><td>Science Foundation Ireland</td><td>Datapac</td><td>&euro;80,000</td><td>2013</td></tr><tr><td>Multi Supplier Framework for the Provision of Personal Computers</td><td>Office of Government Procurement</td><td>Datapac</td><td>&euro;2000,000</td><td>2014</td></tr><tr><td>Supply of ICT Consumables</td><td>Office of Government Procurement</td><td>Datapac</td><td>&euro;11,000,000</td><td>2013</td></tr><tr><td>Supply of ICT Consumables</td><td>Office of Government Procurement</td><td>Datapac</td><td>&euro;8,000,000</td><td>2012</td></tr></table><br/><br/><br/><br/>Of the list of companies supplied by the Deputy only three are recorded on the eTenders system as having been awarded contracts in the lifetime of the current Government. It should be noted that Another 9 is a trading name of Business Recovery Services Ltd. The details are:<table><tr><th>Company Name</th><th>Contract Name </th><th>Contracting Authority</th><th>Planned Value</th></tr><tr><td>Sierra Communication</td><td>Framework Agreement for Installation of Street Lighting in the Dublin City Council Area</td><td>Dublin City Council</td><td>#</td></tr><tr><td>#</td><td>Dublin Region Water mains Rehabilitation Project - Contractor Framework No. 2</td><td>Dublin City Council</td><td>#</td></tr><tr><td>#</td><td>Blanchardstown Regional Drainage Scheme - Contract No.9 - Permanent Flow Monitors</td><td>Fingal County Council</td><td>&euro;600,000</td></tr><tr><td>Business Recovery Services Ltd</td><td>The Provision of an Infrastructure Platform to Horse Racing Ireland</td><td>Horse Racing Ireland</td><td>&euro;600,000</td></tr><tr><td>Another 9<br /><br /><br /><br /></td><td>The Provision of an Infrastructure Platform to Horse Racing Ireland<br /><br /><br /><br /></td><td>Horse Racing Ireland</td><td>&euro;600,000</td></tr><tr><td>#</td><td>Business Continuity Disaster Recovery 2013-2016</td><td>Commission for Aviation Regulation</td><td>&euro;15,000</td></tr></table>The Deputy should be assured that all public contracts are awarded following a transparent and competitive process conducted in compliance with the National and EU rules.  The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.  Public bodies cannot favour or discriminate against particular candidates and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules. It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the process.<br/><br/>The Deputy will be aware that reform of public procurement is a key element of the Government's Public Service Reform agenda. The new approach to public procurement involves integrating procurement policy, strategy and sourcing in one office; ensuring a consistent approach to procurement across the public service; strengthening spend analytics and data management; much greater aggregation of purchasing across public bodies to achieve better value for money; examining the specifications set out for goods and services; evaluating demand levels to assess how demand and volume can be reduced; and strengthening supplier and category management.<br/><br/>The Office of Government Procurement is engaged in changing the administration of procurement throughout the public service. Currently public service procurement activity is transacted by several hundred contracting authorities throughout the State. The Office of Government Procurement together with reformed sector procurement functions in Health, Education, Local Government and Defence will enable the public service to speak with one 'voice' to the market for each category of expenditure, ensuring a consistent approach to procurement across the public service.</p></reply>

Construction work started on all three of the contracts during Spring 2014. The aggregate capital value of the contracts is c. &euro;70m.</p><p>  I understand that overall compliance in relation to the pilot clause has been good. The Department of Social Protection and its local Intreo offices are working closely with the appointed contractors to support the pilot initiative and there has been strong positive engagement from the contractors involved in each of the projects.</p><p>  The most recent monthly progress reports to the NDFA provided by each of the main contractors involved indicate that they are on target to achieve the cumulative percentages set out in the pilot clause. In the monthly report period for September 2014, across the three contracts there are 39 employees working on the sites who had been unemployed for more than 12 months and 12 further employees who are either apprentices or trainees, of whom 7 (of the 12) have also been unemployed for more than 12 months.</p><p>  The Department of Social Protection, through its local Intreo offices is continuing to liaise with the contractors on all three contracts to identify and fill further positions from the live register.</p><p>Once initial evaluations on the performance of the clause have been undertaken any necessary amendments will be tabled at GCCC before they are incorporated into the &euro;1.5bn, PPP element of the &euro;2.25bn Stimulus Programme that I announced in July 2012.</p></reply>

Payments are made in respect of members of the party elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and members elected/nominated to Seanad &Eacute;ireann at the last preceding general election or a subsequent bye-election or, in the case of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, nominated to it after the last preceding general election. The legislation also provides that payments may be made to a member of D&aacute;il or Seanad &Eacute;ireann who is elected other than as a member of a qualifying party.<br/><br/>The conditions governing entitlement to payment of the allowance are set out in the Act. The primary restriction in the Act on the use of the allowance is that it may not be used in respect of election expenses. The allowance is non-taxable and is paid monthly in arrears into a bank account specified by the beneficiary of the allowance.<br/><br/>The legislation provides that each party leader must prepare a statement of expenditure for the allowance, to have it audited by an independent auditor and furnish it with the auditor's report to the Standards in Public Office (the Commission) Commission. Based on the accounts submitted, the Commission is required to make a report in relation to the use of the Parliamentary Activities Allowance and cause a copy of the report to be laid before the Oireachtas.<br/><br/>Following a review of the allowance and a consultation process with leaders of qualifying political parties, qualifying independent members and with the Standards in Public Office Commission, I provided for certain amendments to the allowance under this year's Act.<br/><br/>The Act provided for a reduction of 10% in the rates of the allowance with effect from 1 July of this year, representing an estimated full year Exchequer saving of &euro;0.84 million. Furthermore, with effect from 1 July, the same audit and reporting provisions that apply to parliamentary leaders now also apply to independent members in receipt of the allowance. For the first time, all independent members have to record and account to the Commission for expenditure from the allowance, all of which is to be expended in respect of parliamentary activities, including research.<br/><br/>The total amounts paid to each qualifying party and independent member from 1 January 2007 to 30 September 2014 are as

for the Electoral Acts is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. Under section 17 of the Electoral Act 1997, as amended by section 50(c) of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001, provision is made for two payments to be made to qualified political parties.<br/><br/>Section 17(1)(a) of the 1997 Act, as amended, provides for a fixed payment of &euro;126,973.81 (&pound;100,000) to be made to each qualified party in each period of 12 months.<br/><br/>Section 17(1)(b) of the 1997 Act, as amended, provides for an annual sum to be shared among qualified political parties. When introduced in 2001, the legislation provided for an amount of &euro;3,809,214 (&pound;3,000,000) to be shared. In accordance with the legislation, the sum has increased in line with general increases in Civil Service remuneration. The current sum shared amongst qualified parties amounts to &euro;4,948,201.68, and to &euro;5,456,096.92 when the fixed amount referred to above is included.<br/><br/>Payments under section 17(1)(b) are calculated on the basis of the share of first preference votes obtained by an individual qualified party at the previous general election. These shares are calculated by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government. Payments are made quarterly in arrears.<br/><br/>The conditions attaching to payment are set out in the Act. The primary restriction in the Act on the use of the allowance is that it may not be used in respect of election expenses.<br/><br/>The amounts paid from 1 Jan 2007 to 30 September 2014 are as follows:<table><tr><th>Section 17(1)(a), as amended</th><th>2007</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>Sept. 2014</th></tr><tr><td>Fianna F&aacute;il</td><td>&euro;126,973.80</td><td>&euro;126,973.80</td><td>&euro;126,973.80</td><td>&euro;126,973.80</td><td>&euro;126,973.80</td><td>&euro;126,973.81</td><td>&euro;126,973.81</td><td>&euro;95,230.35</td></tr><tr><td>Fine Gael</td><td>&euro;126,973.80</td><td>&euro;126,973.80</td><td>&euro;126,973.80</td><td>&euro;126,973.80</td><td>&euro;126,973.80</td><td>&euro;126,973.81</td><td>&euro;126,973.81</td><td>&euro;95,230.35</td></tr><tr><td>Labour</td><td>&euro;126,973.80</td><td>&euro;126,973.80</td><td>&euro;126,973.80</td><td>&euro;126,973.80</td><td>&euro;126,973.80</td><td>&euro;126,973.81</td><td>&euro;126,973.81</td><td>&euro;95,230.35</td></tr><tr><td>Progressive Democrats</td><td>&euro;126,973.80</td><td>&euro;126,973.80</td><td>&euro;0.00</td><td>&euro;0.00</td><td>&euro;0.00</td><td>&euro;0.00</td><td>&euro;0.00</td><td>&euro;0.00</td></tr><tr><td>Sinn F&eacute;in</td><td>&euro;126,973.80</td><td>&euro;126,973.80</td><td>&euro;126,973.80</td><td>&euro;126,973.80</td><td>&euro;126,973.81</td><td>&euro;126,973.81</td><td>&euro;126,973.81</td><td>&euro;95,230.35</td></tr><tr><td>Green Party</td><td>&euro;126,973.80</td><td>&euro;126,973.80</td><td>&euro;126,973.80</td><td>&euro;126,973.80</td><td>&euro;51,142.43</td><td>&euro;0.00</td><td>&euro;0.00</td><td>&euro;0.00</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>&euro;761,842.80</td><td>&euro;761,842.80</td><td>&euro;634,869.00</td><td>&euro;634,869.00</td><td>&euro;559,037.64</td><td>&euro;507,895.24</td><td>&euro;507,895.24</td><td>&euro;380,921.40</td></tr><tr><td>Section 17(1)(b), as amended</td><td>2007</td><td>2008</td><td>2009</td><td>2010</td><td>2011</td><td>2012</td><td>2013</td><td>Sept. 2014</td></tr><tr><td>Fianna F&aacute;il</td><td>&euro;2,247,246.89</td><td>&euro;2,157,897.72</td><td>&euro;2,202,444.28</td><td>&euro;2,202,444.28</td><td>&euro;1,508,733.78</td><td>&euro;1,040,882.44</td><td>&euro;1,040,882.44</td><td>&euro;780,661.83</td></tr><tr><td>Fine Gael</td><td>&euro;1,361,733.52</td><td>&euro;1,418,656.54</td><td>&euro;1,447,942.56</td><td>&euro;1,447,942.56</td><td>&euro;1,869,664.07</td><td>&euro;2,154,080.84</td><td>&euro;2,154,080.84</td><td>&euro;1,615,560.63</td></tr><tr><td>Labour</td><td>&euro;665,763.21</td><td>&euro;525,730.01</td><td>&euro;536,582.88</td><td>&euro;536,582.88</td><td>&euro;909,076.40</td><td>&euro;1,160,292.92</td><td>&euro;1,160,292.92</td><td>&euro;870,219.69</td></tr><tr><td>Progressive Democrats</td><td>&euro;307,361.31</td><td>&euro;141,759.19</td><td>&euro;0.00</td><td>&euro;0.00</td><td>&euro;0.00</td><td>&euro;0.00</td><td>&euro;0.00</td><td>&euro;0.00</td></tr><tr><td>Sinn F&eacute;in</td><td>&euro;467,226.64</td><td>&euro;360,457.65</td><td>&euro;367,898.76</td><td>&euro;367,898.76</td><td>&euro;502,301.67</td><td>&euro;592,945.48</td><td>&euro;592,945.48</td><td>&euro;444,709.11</td></tr><tr><td>Green Party</td><td>&euro;338,588.66</td><td>&euro;243,617.98</td><td>&euro;248,647.08</td><td>&euro;248,647.08</td><td>&euro;100,149.53</td><td>&euro;0.00</td><td>&euro;0.00</td><td>&euro;0.00</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>&euro;5,387,920.23</td><td>&euro;4,848,119.09</td><td>&euro;4,803,515.56</td><td>&euro;4,803,515.56</td><td>&euro;4,889,925.45</td><td>&euro;4,948,201.68</td><td>&euro;4,948,201.68</td><td>&euro;3,711,151.26</td></tr></table><br/><br/><br/><br/>The provision of secretarial facilities for Members of D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann and for qualifying Parties falls under the remit of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. The current provisions are set out in the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Secretarial Facilities) Regulations 2013 (S.I.

The programme of works the Council submitted to the OPW detailing how it proposes to spend the total allocation of &euro;1,226,920 included an amount of &euro;30,000 for repairs to a coastal embankment at Cromane Lower. This programme was approved, and it is a matter for the Council to prioritise and progress these works and to draw down the funding that was allocated. An application to draw down part of the funding was submitted by the Council last week and this is currently being processed.  The application did not include an amount for drawdown in relation to the repair work for the embankment at Cromane Lower.</p><p>  The Council will need to address the strengthening works at Cromane Lower and Incherea separately and outside of the current process aimed at storm repairs and emergency works only. </p></reply>

The launch of new schemes, including GLAS, is dependent on getting EU approval for the Rural Development Programme.  I am aware of the correspondence mentioned by the Deputy and I appreciate that there remain many concerns amongst hill-farmers in respect of the new proposals for commonages under GLAS.  My Department conducted an extensive consultation process on all aspects of the Rural Development Programme over a period of a year and half, including the proposals for commonages.  I have listened very carefully to the concerns expressed by hill-farmers and their representatives and have adapted these proposals significantly in the light of those concerns. </p><p>  The original requirement was for 80% participation, but this was subsequently reduced to 50%, with further clarification provided that this would be calculated on the basis of the number of active farmers on the hill.  What this means in practice is that in a situation where there are 20 shareholders on a commonage, of whom 16 have claims, and 10 of these have sheep, then the 50% requirement to set up a GLAS Plan would be just 5 shareholders - not 8, and not 10.  In practice, then, the 50% requirement is unlikely to be an obstacle, but where it still proves impossible to achieve the shareholders concerned who wish to join GLAS can still do so by bringing their case to the Implementation Committee. </p><p>  On the question of the agreement reached between the group and the Commonage Implementation Committee, it was made very clear in the agreed wording that there could only be one plan for each commonage and that a minimum participation level of 50% would continue to apply.  However, it was also made clear that farmers could indicate their interest in joining the scheme on an individual basis, applying directly to the adviser preparing the single plan, or routing that through their own adviser if preferred.  This remains the case. I have also made it clear that where it is not possible to achieve the required 50% participation level on any commonage, no genuine applicant will be locked out of the scheme. </p><p>  Over the past few weeks my Department held a series of information evenings for hill-farmers, where the new proposals have been explained in detail and where the farmers themselves have had the opportunity to express their concerns in person. In most cases, the farmers at these meetings have engaged very constructively and positively in the discussion and it has been a very useful process.  Once within the scheme, it is the farmers themselves who, in consultation with the commonage advisor, design their own plan, set the grazing levels and distribute any additional grazing requirement.  This puts the development of the plan in the hands of the farmers themselves and my Department has no role in drawing up or paying for the plan; the cost of the plan is built into the payment rate for the commonage which has been significantly increased for the new programme from &euro;75 per hectare to &euro;120 per hectare. </p><p>  If people look carefully at what is actually proposed, they will see that this is a very flexible scheme which actually gives the shareholders a real say in how the hills are managed, in their own best interests and in the interests of the environment.  Ongoing consultation is taking place with individual farmers, farming organisations and public representatives to address any outstanding reasonable concerns.  The priority is to progress the launch of the scheme so that the benefits of these new arrangements, including the increased payments, can transfer to farmers as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The maximum payment available per annum is &euro;5,000.  As this is a voluntary scheme, driven by the actions selected by the applicants themselves, it is not possible to say in advance whether all farmers will draw down the maximum amount.  However, it should be clearly understood that payments in respect of 2015 will be in respect of a part-year only, with a maximum first instalment of 75% of whatever is due payable next year.  This is the usual approach taken in the introduction of a ll new agri-environment schemes.  However, I should also point out that all farmers joining GLAS in 2015 will go on to receive an <i>additional</i>five years of full payment from 2016 on.  Any payments made for 2015 will be over-and-above what would usually be payable over the standard five year contract. It should be remembered that the launch of GLAS is dependent on Ireland getting EU approval for our new Rural Development Programme.

In particular, I am fully aware of the additional costs incurred in farming island lands.  Mindful of this, I have decided to target specific support for island farmers via a new top-up to be introduced under the Areas of Natural Constraint (ANC) Scheme.  This additional payment will commence in 2015 with the introduction of the ANC Scheme, which is currently known as the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme.  I am proposing the use of differential payment rates, however this is subject to clearance by the EU Commission.  My Department is currently in the process of identifying and investigating all islands situated both offshore and inland on lakes and rivers, and determining the eligibility of each.  Following initial analysis, it has been considered that islands connected to the main land by permanent access route will not incur the same costs as farmers living and farming on the islands and therefore will not be eligible.  These proposals have been submitted to the Commission earlier this week as part of the overall Rural Development Programme, with approval anticipated later this year.</p></reply>

This is consistent with the newly reformed Common Fisheries Policy. A core objective of the Common Fisheries Policy is to &quot;ensure exploitation of living aquatic resources that provides sustainable economic, environmental and social conditions&quot;. Overfishing is, of course, not sustainable While achieving this objective through the regulation of catches (TACs) may be relatively straight-forward in the context of a single species fishery, in multi-gear, multi-species and multi-fleet fisheries, delivering on this objective is complex and challenging.  Specifically with regard to the stocks identified by the Deputy the position is as follows:<br/><br/><i>Seabass</i>: The scientific advice is that an urgent reduction in fishing mortality is required for the stocks of seabass in the Celtic Sea, Irish Sea, Channel and North Sea. The specific mechanism to achieve this has been under discussion but no proposal has been brought forward by the EU Commission. Ireland has a negligible impact on seabass mortality as, nationally,we operate a complete ban on commercial landings of sea bass and a daily bag limit for anglers of only 2 fish. <br/><br/><i>Mackerel</i>: following lengthy negotiations a tripartite agreement between the EU, Norway and the Faroe Islands set a TAC of 1.24m tonnes for 2014, which was in excess of the scientific advice. However, under this Agreement, a proportion amounting to 15.6% was reserved to cover catches by Iceland and Russia, in particular. The tripartite agreement provided that the TAC for 2015 to 2018 will be based on ICES advice. However, concern remains that Iceland is operating outside the Coastal States Tripartite Agreement and is likely to continue its unacceptable unilateral fishing of the mackerel stock. There is also concern about the fishing levels of both Russia and Greenland. Coastal State negotiations on the mackerel fishery and on setting a mackerel TAC for 2015 are ongoing in London this week. <br/><br/><i>Cod:</i>Cod stocks are separately managed in the Celtic Sea, the Irish Sea and off the north west coast. ICES advice on each of these stocks for 2015 has been made available. ICES advises that for the cod stock in the north west, on the basis of the MSY approach, that there should be no directed fisheries and that bycatch and discards should be minimized in 2014. In relation to the Irish Sea stock, ICES advises, on the basis of the MSY and precautionary approaches, that there should be no directed fisheries, and bycatch and discards should be minimized in 2015 and 2016. Recruitment in the cod stock in the Celtic Sea has been highly variable over time with occasional very high recruitment. The most recent scientific advice indicates that there is significant recruitment of cod in the Celtic Sea, which is good news, and I will be doing my utmost to ensure that this is reflected in the TAC set for 2015 in order to avoid discarding of fish. <br/><br/>The EU Commission&rsquo;s proposals for TACs for 2015 are expected to be available in the next fortnight. As soon as they are available, I will have a full sustainability impact assessment undertaken, including a public consultation and will bring it before the Oireachtas for views to inform negotiations at the December EU Fisheries Council. </p></reply>

Compensation of the kind in question would usually result from a civil action for damages against the Minister for Defence, but compensation received from any other source is not excluded.</p><p>  In April 1986 the person in question was awarded a disability pension under the Army Pensions Acts in respect of a wrist injury that he sustained while serving in the PDF. The person in question also instituted civil proceedings in respect of the same injury and was awarded compensation of &euro;37,457 (&pound;29,500) by the High Court in July 1986. The annuity value of the compensation was assessed at &euro;3,648 (&pound;2,873) a year. The disability pension payable was therefore reviewed under the provisions of section 13(2) of the 1923 Act and it was decided to reduce it by the annuity value of the total compensation which he had received.</p><p>  Subsequently, the person in question applied to the High Court for a judicial review of the decision to reduce the disability pension. The High Court quashed the decision to reduce the disability pension and ordered that the matter be considered anew. A fresh review of the disability pension was accordingly undertaken.  All aspects of the case (including, in particular, representations made by his solicitors) were fully considered and in March 1988 it was decided to reduce the disability pension payable by the annuity value of the total compensation received by him. This reduction took effect from 1 April 1988. The effect of this decision was to reduce the current rate of disability pension payable from &euro;13,373.17 a year to &euro;9,725.17 a year (tax free).</p><p>  Compulsory retirement or discharge from the Defence Forces on medical grounds does not give an automatic entitlement to a disability pension and does not affect the rate of disability pension payable.  The rate of disability pension depends on the degree of disablement as assessed by the Army Pensions Board, the independent statutory body appointed to adjudicate on applications.   The Board&rsquo;s principal function is to investigate applications for pensions, allowances and gratuities under the Acts and to report thereon. The Board determines the question of attributability to military service in each case and assesses the degree of disability.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the disability pension in this case has been properly determined in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions and I do not believe that a further review would be appropriate.</p></reply>

Agreement was reached on revised integrated pay scales for new entrants applicable to the Defence Forces. The revised scales will have retrospective effect to 1st November 2013, which is the agreed date for applicability across all sectors of the Public Service.  <br/><br/>  The technical work to give effect to the revised incorporated scales is now underway and testing of the software adjustments required to the payroll systems is close to finalisation.

The conditions are that the applicant must <br/><br/>- be of full age or be a minor born in the State<br/><br/>- be of good character<br/><br/>- have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years<br/><br/>- intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation<br/><br/>- have,<font color="#212100">before a judge of the District Court in open court, in a citizenship ceremony or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows -</font><br/><br/><font color="#212100">(i) made a declaration, in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, and</font><br/><br/><font color="#212100">(ii) undertaken to faithfully observe the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values.</font><br/><br/>Section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in her absolute discretion, waive some or all of the statutory conditions in certain circumstances i.e. where an applicant is of Irish descent or of Irish associations; where an applicant is a person who is a refugee within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees; or where an applicant is a Stateless person within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Stateless persons.<br/><br/>It is open to any individual to lodge an application for citizenship if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements as prescribed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended.<br/><br/>It is not possible to consider an application from or on behalf of a person born outside the State in advance of him or her meeting the Statutory requirement of being of full age, unless he or she is of Irish descent or Irish associations or unless the application is made by a naturalised Irish citizen on behalf of his or her minor child.  A person is of Irish associations if, inter alia, he or she is related by blood, affinity or adoption to a person who is an Irish citizen or entitled to be an Irish citizen.<br/><br/>The Deputy may wish to note that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been established specifically for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

Referral and access to addiction services is made in a number of ways through addiction workers, self referral, family members, GPs, drop-in centres, and needle exchange and community support groups.  <br/><br/>Unfortunately, information on the number of clients attending addiction services in the community, residential treatment centres, and the various referral and entry pathways used is not readily available.  The compilation of these statistics would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort to prepare and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b><br/><br/>However, the Deputy may be interested in two Drugs and Alcohol surveys undertaken by the Probation Service in recent years to ascertain the number of offenders on probation supervision who misused drugs and/or alcohol.  <br/><br/>The first survey, published in May 2012, on adult offenders on probation supervision covered almost 3,000 offenders.  It found that 89% of the adult offender population had misused drugs or alcohol at some time either currently or in the past.  Of the 2,471 offenders that had abused drugs or alcohol, 1,556 (63%) had attended or were attending drug or alcohol treatment.<br/><br/>The second survey, published in October 2013, on young offenders on probation supervision covered over 700 offenders.  It found that 87% of the young offender population (under 21 years old) had misused drugs or alcohol at some time either currently or in the past.  Of the 628 offenders that had abused drugs or alcohol, 334 (53%) had attended or were attending drug or alcohol treatment.  Both surveys are available on www.probation.ie<br/><br/>Finally, the Deputy may recall that I commented when publishing the Parole Board's Annual Report in September on how struck I was by the statistics which highlight how drink and drugs influence criminal offending.  I am determined to work with the Agencies under my remit to address the issues involved.  It is my intention that a review of alcohol and drugs services for offenders will be undertaken as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Sections 4 and 5 of the 1993 Act provide that only the Minister for Justice and Equality may grant &lsquo;authorisations&rsquo; to intercept and then only for the purposes of the investigation of serious crime (Section 4) (i.e. crime punishable by a sentence of five years imprisonment or more) or in the interests of the security of the State (Section 5).  </p><p>  Both the Garda Commissioner and the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces are entitled to make applications for authorisations to intercept.  The Garda Commissioner may make applications under Section 4 or Section 5. However, the Chief of Staff may make applications only under Section 5. Furthermore, an application from the Chief Of Staff must be submitted in the first instance to the Minister for Defence who shall forward it to the Minister for Justice and Equality accompanied by a recommendation in writing supporting the application.</p><p>  The 2011 Communications (Retention of Data) Act provides for access to retained data such as  traffic data, location data and subscriber data. It does not include the content of calls or texts etc.  The Act sets out the agencies which are entitled to request access to this data and the circumstances in which such requests can be made. The relevant agencies are An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners, the Defence Forces and the Garda Siochana Ombudsman Commission (GSOC).  Access to such data is only permitted in specific circumstances. These circumstances are in the case of An Garda Siochana,  the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of a serious offence, the security of the State and the saving of human life. In the case of the Defence Forces,  the security of the State and in the case of the Revenue Commissioners,  the investigation and prevention of certain revenue offences.  In the case of GSOC, it would relate to the investigation of criminal offences which come within their particular remit.</p><p>  The operation of the legislation is subject to independent judicial oversight by virtue of the appointment of a Designated Judge.  The Designated Judge, a judge of the High Court,  must make a report to the Taoiseach on his or her findings on at least a twelve month basis. The report is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Acts also provide for the appointment of a complaints referee, currently a Judge of the Circuit Court. A person who believes their data has been accessed under the Acts may make a complaint to the Referee.</p><p>  It will be seen therefore that there is no question of any direct access to telecommunications networks by agencies of the State. That would not be in accordance with the comprehensive legislation in place in this jurisdiction for dealing with such matters. It should also be clear that the courts do not authorise interception or access to retained data under that legislation. Of course the courts may themselves on occasion make orders for the disclosure of material such as retained data in the course of their deliberations in civil or criminal cases. However this function does not come within the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></reply>

All applications are processed with a view to establishing whether the applicants meet the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation, such as good character and lawful residence, and are submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible. As the processing requirements and time taken to complete necessary checks vary from case to case, it is not possible to provide a specific date for determination of an individual application. </p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been established specifically for this purpose.

The security situation is also the focus of my meetings with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers.</p><p>  The threat from these groups is real and persistent.  It is a matter of shared concern North and South and there is a common resolve to continue to take all necessary actions within the law to bear down on these groups.  I can assure the Deputy that countering the paramilitary threat has always been a priority for the Government and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and nothing has changed in that regard.</p><p>  Operational security co-operation is the key to putting these groups out of business and the Garda authorities work very closely and successfully with their counterparts in Northern Ireland in actively bearing down on these groups and on the organised criminal gangs with which the paramilitaries are inextricably linked.  Indeed, they are deeply involved in serious crime in order to fund their activities and their lifestyles.  The Deputy will know that the Garda&iacute; and the PSNI have mounted a number of successful co-operative Border operations to disrupt paramilitary activities.</p><p>  I am strongly committed to ensuring that the Garda&iacute; have the necessary resources they need to bear down on these groups not just in terms of personnel and equipment, but also in terms of the legislative provisions available.  I have secured an increase in the Garda funding for 2015 which will facilitate increased recruitment to the force and additional Garda equipment.  In this regard the Deputy will also be aware that I recently published the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2014 to further strengthen the State's body of counter terrorism law.</p></reply>

While some complainants will understandably wish to see the review completed as soon as possible, it is important that nothing arises which might detract from the integrity of the review mechanism.

In practice, for a short-stay visit visa, if a visitor has been granted two previous Irish visas and has observed the conditions of those visas (e.g. they did not overstay or work illegally) they may apply for a Multiple Journey visa. The purpose of a Multiple Journey visa is to allow a person to travel to Ireland on a number occasions, during the dates shown on the visa, for short trips only.  </p><p>  The majority of short-stay visit visa applications are processed with five working days of receipt of the required documentation. Some applications may take longer to assess depending on the particular circumstances of the case. The issuance of a visa, including whether to grant a Multiple Journey visa, is at the discretion of the Visa Officer. </p><p>  In addition to the general practice above, there are certain circumstances where a multiple entry visa may be issued to applicants with no previous travel history to Ireland. For example, a person can apply for a Multiple Journey visa if:</p><p>- they need to travel regularly to Ireland on short visits for business meetings.</p><p>- while in Ireland on business they need to travel to another country, returning to Ireland for further meetings, for onward travel.</p><p>- they are travelling to and from another country, via Ireland.</p><p>  In relation to the specific individuals referred to by the Deputy, I have been advised by INIS that one of the relatives of the person legally resident in Ireland made one previous visit to Ireland in 2012 and there is no record of a visa application having been made or a visa granted in respect of the other named relative.  </p></reply>

These programmes represent an annual investment of almost &euro;260 million in childcare supports with more than 80% of this funding provided through the ECCE and CCS programmes. </p><p>  In the case of the ECCE and CCS programmes, preliminary payments to participating childcare providers are made prior to the submission of the annual enrolment returns at the beginning of the school year and subsequent payments are made in advance of each school term.</p><p>  The process involved in making payments under the TEC programmes does not allow for advance or immediate payment as qualifying parents become eligible for support whenever work or training opportunities commence.  The information relating to qualifying parents and the services in which they have enrolled their children is forwarded through the City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) to this Department for processing.  The actual payment is made by Pobal following receipt of the payment details from this Department.   There is a delay, therefore, between the time a child actually takes up a TEC place and the completion of the payment process with the result that the payments will normally involve some element of back payment and an advance payment.</p><p>  The length of the back payment can vary, but the longest period of back payment normally occurs at this time of year. This is primarily due to the volume of parents starting education or training programmes at the commencement of the school year in September, and whose childcare needs are catered for under the CETS element of the TEC programmes.</p><p>  I am aware of the considerable adjustments that childcare providers have made to facilitate the introduction and implementation of the childcare support programme in recent years. I understand how the payment process in relation to the TEC programmes can result in problems for participating childcare services.  The issue of how support programme payments are made is being addressed and my Department is currently finalising the migration of the payment process for all our programmes into a new on-line database system, to which childcare services will have direct access to input relevant details.  This new system will substantially reduce the delays caused by the transmission of information and will allow for more frequent and prompt payments to be made.</p></reply>

I believe that Budget 2015 confirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to supporting children and families. The level of funding provided, and the range of services available, is by any measure, very significant.</p><p>  There are two elements to my Department&rsquo;s Vote which amounts to &euro;1,010 million in 2015. The Vote is split to fund:</p><p>- Services and programmes provided by the Child and Family Agency (&euro;635m), and</p><p>- Schemes and services funded by my Department (&euro;375m) respectively.</p><p>  My Department's Vote is split into three distinct programmes. Programme B - Sectoral Programmes for Children and Young People - aims to support the provision of both universal and targeted services for the care, development and well-being of children and young people. The 2015 estimates provision for this Programme in my Department`s Vote amounts to &euro;319 million. This represents a reduction of &euro;2 million on the 2014 allocation of &euro;321 million. The reduction is largely attributable to the costs associated with the implementation of the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides for an annual programme of early learning for children in the year before primary school. The decrease in funding, from &euro;175 million in 2014 to &euro;173 million in 2015, is reflective of demographic reductions in the number of children participating in the Pre-School Year and does not impact negatively on access to the programme.</p></reply>

This includes a provision of &euro;975 million in current expenditure and &euro;35 million in capital expenditure, which in Vote terms, represents an overall increase of &euro;13 million over the 2014 allocation. </p><p>  The Estimate for 2015 contains significant additional resources to fund the services and programmes provided by the Child and Family Agency. This amounts to &euro;635 million, which accounts for 63% of the Vote allocation, and represents an increase of &euro;26 million or 4.3% against the 2014 provision. While I understand that this level of funding cannot address all of the challenges, including those of a demographic nature, that the new Agency faces in doing its work, I believe that the additional funding will allow the Agency not only to alleviate the pressures on the range of services currently in place, but also to build on the extensive programme of reform across the range of services for children and services which is well underway. The balance of funding in the Vote, which amounts to &euro;375 million, relates to a range of other programmes administered by my Department including those relating to child-care and youth services.</p><p>  Demographic change and its influence on the cost of implementing programmes and services is one of many considerations taken into account in securing and finalising expenditure provisions in the context of the annual Estimates cycle. This was the case when agreeing the 2015 provision for my Department and due account will again be taken of demographic factors when my Department is negotiating its allocation in respect of 2016. While it is important that unavoidable cost increases as a result of demographic pressures are not overlooked, it is also the case that demographic changes can lead to a reduction in programme costs. For example, the costs associated with the implementation of the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, which is administered by my Department, are showing a marginal demographic reduction in the number of children eligible to participate in the Pre-School Year in 2015.</p></reply>

The standard capitation fee paid to participating services is &euro;62.50 per week per eligible child.  A higher capitation fee of &euro;73 per week per eligible child is available to pre-school services with more highly qualified staff.  </p><p>  The Government succeeded in maintaining the pre-school year on a universal and free basis despite the difficult budgetary situation that prevailed in recent years.

A minimum qualification of Level 5 (or equivalent) on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) will be required for all staff working with children in pre-school services and the minimum qualification for all pre-school leaders delivering the free pre-school year under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme will be increased from Level 5 to Level 6 (or equivalent) on the NFQ.  </p><p>  To support staff who are seeking to meet the new qualifications requirement, funding of &euro;3 million is being made available over the two years 2014/2015 under the new Learner Fund which was launched in March this year.   The Fund is being administered by Pobal, with the assistance of local City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs). </p><p>  My Department also provides annual funding to seven voluntary childcare organisations in the childcare sector, who provide support to childcare services throughout the country. This funding, which will amount to over &euro;2.6 million  in 2014, enables the voluntary organisations to provide a range of support services to their members, including on-going training supports.</p></reply>

Dedicated funding of around &euro;125m has been provided since 2012 to enhance all aspects of services, to realise implementation of <i>A Vision for Change</i>. Our commitment is reinforced by the &euro;35m announced in the recent Budget to progress various new initiatives next year.<br/><br/>The HSE Service Plan 2014 provides in the region of &euro;766m for mental health services, including progressing the phased implementation of over 1,100 new posts allocated to enhance services at local and regional levels. Services overall have been expanded this year, to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams for both adults and children and to enhance specialist community mental health services for older people with a mental illness, those with an intellectual disability and mental illness, and forensic mental health services<i>.</i>Services will be developed further in light of new initiatives to be agreed in the context of the HSE Service Plan for 2015.<br/><br/>To-date, upwards of 230 new posts has been allocated to the Child and Adolescent Services (CAMHS), in respect of those under 18 years of age requiring services or supports. The HSE recently commenced an initiative to improve various operational aspects of the CAMHS service, including access to and use of CAMHS. This involves, for example, looking in greater detail at trends in performance and underlying contributing factors, consultant capacity and availability, and correlation with other related services in regard to the nature or complexity of those waiting for service.<br/><br/>There are a range of supports available to young people with mental health difficulties, either through services provided directly by the HSE, or through various non-statutory agencies funded by the Executive.  In particular, this includes support by the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) for LGBT advocacy groups, such as GLEN, Belong To or other groups that also cover, to some degree as part of their overall mental health services, LGBT issues relating to young persons. <br/><br/>A wide ambit of supports are available to young people ranging from, for example, initial counselling at Primary Care level through to community or in-patient care under the Mental Health programme. Therefore, bearing in mind all the circumstances raised by the Deputy, I am satisfied that it is open to any young person who may face serious negative mental health impacts arising from the proposed referendum, or for whatever other reason, to access relevant existing services delivered by the HSE or the many agencies funded by it, operating in this area.</p></reply>

It aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p><p>  Anyone who is ordinarily resident in the State and is assessed as requiring long-term nursing home care can avail of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, regardless of age.  However, nursing home care must be appropriate to meet the individual&rsquo;s care needs.</p><p>  A fundamental principle enshrined in the legislation underpinning the Scheme is that of patient choice.  Once a person receives approval for financial support, they can choose to enter any nursing home that is participating in the Scheme in any part of the country, subject to the nursing home having an available bed and being able to cater for the person&rsquo;s particular needs.  This applies to public, private and voluntary nursing homes alike.</p><p>  In general terms, eligibility for health services is based primarily on residency and means. Under the Health Act 1970, the public health system provides for two categories of  eligibility for persons ordinarily resident in the state, i.e. full eligibility (medical card holders) and limited eligibility (all others). Full eligibility is determined mainly by reference to income limits. Determination of an individual's eligibility status is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.</p><p>  The level of private health insurance cover for inpatient hospital treatment is set out in the terms and conditions of the insured person's private health insurance policy.</p></reply>

No 328 of 1988) requires pharmacies to maintain a controlled drugs (CD) Register in respect of all drugs listed in Schedule 2, including methadone. All entries must be recorded in a chronological sequence and in a manner which shows a running balance.<br/><br/>Inspections are carried out by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) under Section 67 of the Pharmacy Act 2007 (the Act) to review compliance with the Act, regulations made thereunder and medicines legislation. The sale and supply of all Schedule 2 controlled drugs and the manner in which the CD Register is maintained are checked as part of these inspections. The Register is reviewed to see if running balances are properly maintained. The physical inventory of three controlled drug preparations is counted during each inspection.  The physical tally is then checked against the balance indicated in the CD Register to see if they match. The manner in which the findings are reported does not differentiate the record keeping requirements observed for methadone from other Schedule 2 controlled drugs. <br/><br/>As part of the registration process for retail pharmacy businesses, pharmacy owners and Superintendent Pharmacists are required to notify the PSI if the pharmacy concerned is engaged in the sale or supply of methadone.  As of 20<sup>th</sup>October 2014, records indicate that 797 pharmacies are engaged in the sale and supply of methadone. These figures are contingent on the accuracy of the information provided by the registrants.<br/><br/>From 1<sup>st</sup>November 2013 to the 20<sup>th</sup>October 2014, 546 pharmacy systems inspections were recorded in the PSI inspection database. These show that 84 pharmacies failed to record or properly record the running balance in respect of one or more Schedule 2 controlled drugs in the CD Register, and in 115 cases the physical inventory did not agree with the balance specified in the Registers.<br/><br/>Once an inspection is completed, a report is issued to the registrant. The report cites both compliances and non-compliances. The registrant is required to respond to the report within a given timeframe and to confirm that each of the non-compliances identified in the report has been addressed.  As part of the response registrants review and investigate deficiencies and, where appropriate, provide evidence and explanations in respect of particular matters noted. In some cases they may provide evidence/documents in support of explanations furnished.  In the majority of cases, these explanations lead to the closure of the matter. In certain cases, re-inspections are directed to confirm that matters have been addressed. In 2013, one report which identified non-compliances with controlled drugs legislation, together with other non-compliances, was referred to the complaints process operated under Part 6 of the Act. <br/><br/>Certain inspection reports are considered by the PSI Council under section 71 of the Act (in Part 7 of the Act, which refers to Powers of Investigation). Following the consideration of a report the PSI Council may direct the Registrar to:<br/><br/>-Take no action<br/><br/>-Make a complaint against a pharmacist/(s) or a pharmacy owner<br/><br/>-Take such other action as is considered appropriate. This includes initiating prosecutions, directing re-inspections, seeking undertakings, deferral of decision pending undertakings. <br/><br/>In 2013, 388 routine inspections were carried out. Approximately 10% of these reports were considered pursuant to section 71 of the Act. The following is an approximate breakdown of the actions taken further to consideration of these reports, (noting that these are global figures and do not relate exclusively to breaches of controlled drugs legislation):<br/><br/>-67% - Decision to re-inspect the pharmacy/Deferral of Decision pending re-inspection<br/><br/>-27% - Take no action<br/><br/>-6% - Other (This includes 1 complaint which was made against a pharmacist).</p></reply>

Such services greatly reduce the risk of the use of contaminated injecting equipment through providing sterilised needles, syringes and associated injecting items.  They also reduce the dangers posed by discarded needles through the strong emphasis on the exchange of used supplies for new.  As well as the direct benefits of needle exchange services, they also bring people into contact with other services and increase the possibilities for further engagement aimed at reducing heroin use.</p><p>  In Dublin, needle exchange services are provided through HSE clinics and through voluntary sector providers.  Needle exchange services outside Dublin have been expanded through the Pharmacy Needle Exchange Programme, with the target of recruiting and training 130 pharmacies achieved this year.</p></reply>

Four sources are used to collate deaths: Coroner&rsquo;s records; Hospital In-patient Enquiry System; Central Treatment List; and the General Mortality Register.</p><p>  The Health Research Board (HRB) launched their report on the 21st January 2014 which showed deaths for 2011, the latest year for which data is available.  These figures indicate that there was a substantial increase in the number of deaths where methadone was implicated with 113 such deaths reported in 2011 compared to 60 in 2010.  However, the majority of these deaths (86%) involved poly-substance poisonings.  In addition, 68% of those who died where methadone was implicated, were not in opiate substitution treatment at the time of their death.  There is clear evidence to indicate that having access to drug treatment is one of the major factors in reducing drugs-related deaths.

Seven have opened and seven are under way.  It is expected that those under way will be delivered over the period 2015-2017.<br/><br/>As regards the location where details are supplied, the HSE has terminated the agreement for lease.  It is focussing on establishing an alternative proposal which would also use the lease mechanism.<br/><br/>All potential primary care centres are subject to suitable locations being offered/provided/available, to successful planning processes and GP engagement.  In addition the operational lease mechanism is subject to market pressures such as the developers' access to sufficient financing.  Delivery of primary care infrastructure is a dynamic exercise, constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances including the feasibility of implementation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Primary Care Infrastructure opened since March 2011 - </b><b><i>Update at 30 Sept 2014</i></b><table><tr><th><b>Count</b></th><th><b>HSE Region</b></th><th><b>County</b></th><th><b>PCT Name / Location</b></th><th><b>Delivery Method</b></th><th><b>Open</b></th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>DML</td><td>Dublin</td><td>Inchicore</td><td>Direct Build</td><td>2011 Q4</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>DML</td><td>Dublin</td><td>Ballyfermot</td><td>Direct Build</td><td>2012 Q3</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>DML</td><td>Dublin</td><td>Rathfarnham</td><td>Lease</td><td>2012 Q4</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>DML</td><td>Dublin</td><td>Churchtown</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2012 Q4</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>DML</td><td>Dublin</td><td>Dublin City at James's St / Pimlico / Liberties</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2012 Q4</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>DML</td><td>Dublin</td><td>Bride St / Liberties (Old Meath Hospital Campus)</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2014 Q2</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>DNE</td><td>Dublin</td><td>Blanchardstown / Grove Court / Blakestown / Mountain View</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2013 Q4</td></tr></table><br/><br/><b>Primary Care Infrastructure - under way - </b><b><i>Update at 30 Sept 2014</i></b><table><tr><th>Count</th><th>HSE Region</th><th>County</th><th>Location / PCT Name</th><th>Delivery Method</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>DML</td><td>Dublin </td><td>Kilnamanagh / Tymon</td><td>Operational Lease</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>DNE</td><td>Dublin </td><td>Finglas</td><td>Direct/own build</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>DNE</td><td>Dublin </td><td>Grangegorman</td><td>Direct/own build</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>DNE</td><td>Dublin</td><td>Corduff </td><td>Direct/own build</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>DNE</td><td>Dublin </td><td>Coolock / Darndale</td><td>PPP</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>DNE</td><td>Dublin </td><td>Summerhill, north inner city Dublin</td><td>PPP</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>DNE</td><td>Dublin</td><td>Ashtown (Navan Rd) &amp;amp; Cabra West</td><td>Operational lease</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Act provides, inter alia, for the protection of the public in its dealings with nurses and midwives and the enhancement of their high standards of professional education and competencies. The Department of Health is responsible for oversight of the governance of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI). The Department has no role in setting or approving registration fees.</p><p>  The Board is an independent body, answerable to the Oireachtas, with the responsibility to ensure that it has the financial capacity to undertake all its legal obligations.  The cost of enacting the additional requirements under the Nurses and Midwives Act 2014 was set out in the Regulatory Impact Analysis that was carried out prior to the enactment of the legislation.  These costs include an enhanced regulatory process with supporting systems for continued professional development and certain education and training requirements for the professions.</p><p>  It was also made clear at the time of the legislation that the Board would continue to be self-funding and needed to plan and cost how it would fulfil its legal obligations.  Following detailed negotiations with the Executive and Board members in 2013 it was agreed in October 2013 that an initial once-off sum of &euro;1.6m would be granted by the Department to the Board to cover 2013/2014 costs, but that the Board would have to increase its income in 2015 to undertake its commitments in the legislation.  The Board of the NMBI made the decision to increase the annual registration fee at its meeting on 17th September, 2014.  A helpline, email address and website information page have been made available by the NMBI to provide clarification for registrants who may have queries on this matter.</p></reply>

The Directive seeks to ensure a clear and transparent framework for the provision of cross-border healthcare within the EU, for those occasions where the care the patient seeks is provided in another Member State rather than in their home country. However, it should be emphasised that the vast majority of EU patients receive healthcare in their own country and prefer to do so. </p><p>  A Statutory Instrument to transpose the Directive was signed on 14th May, 2014.  The European Communities (Application of Patient&rsquo;s Rights in Cross-Border Healthcare) Regulations - S.I. 203 of 2014 - commenced on 1st June 2014 and subsequently the HSE is in the position to operate the terms of the Directive. The S.I. provides for reimbursement by the HSE of qualifying cross-border healthcare, a system of prior authorisation and the placing of the National Contact Point (NCP) on a statutory basis.   </p><p>  The principal function of the National Contact Point is to facilitate exchange of information for patients concerning their rights and entitlements relating to receiving healthcare in another Member State, in particular the terms and conditions for reimbursement of cost and the procedures for accessing and determining those entitlements. The National Contact Point also has a responsibility to ensure that all enquirers are informed of the rights, if any, that they may have through the legislation on the coordination of social security schemes (Regulation 883/04) and which may be more beneficial to them. The National Contact Point is able to inform patients what the cost of their treatments would be in Ireland to allow them make a comparison with the costs they are being quoted for comparable treatment in another Member State.</p><p>  The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine the remaining parts of this question and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Under EU legislation, persons insured in any EU Member state, together with persons insured in any EEA Member state (Iceland, Norway or Liechtenstein) or in Switzerland, are entitled to healthcare.  In order to obtain a Medical Card under EU legislation, the applicant must produce the appropriate E or S-form, completed by their Member State confirming the healthcare entitlement for which that state is liable.  </p><p>  The position regarding the UK is that, under a reciprocal agreement, the EU S form is not required, however, proof of receipt of a qualifying payment from the UK authorities should be provided with the application to the HSE. The issue of citizenship is not relevant in determining eligibility, rather it is residential status in Ireland and the linkage to the social security system in the UK.</p><p>  The HSE has responsibility to establish if an applicant is subject to Irish social security legislation. A person is considered subject to Irish social security legislation if s/he is in receipt of a contributory Irish social welfare payment or engaged in work in Ireland and subject to PRSI.  If a person is considered subject to Irish social security legislation, that person will not qualify for a Medical Card under EU legislation, but may qualify for a means-tested Medical Card under national legislation.</p></reply>

These standards outline what is expected of a provider of services and what a person, his or her family, and the public can expect to receive from residential care services. They also seek to ensure that vulnerable older people and people with disabilities in residential services are safeguarded and protected and their quality of life is enhanced.</p></reply>

The Act provides that persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange GP services for themselves and family can qualify for a medical card. The HSE awards medical cards in accordance with the Health Act and, therefore, it assesses applicants on the overall financial situation of the applicant and his or her spouse or partner. <br/><br/>The HSE gives effect to this legislation through its Medical Card National Assessment Guidelines. Under the guidelines, &quot;applicants whose weekly incomes are derived <i>solely</i>from Social Welfare allowances/ benefits or Health Service Executive allowances, which are in excess of the Income Guidelines (either at first application or on renewal), should be granted a medical card&quot;.<br/><br/>Under the Guidelines, applicants are assessed on the basis of means when there is income in addition to that derived from Social Welfare.

No challenge being made to the procurement process for this lot, the NPHDB proceeded with appointment and the relevant contractors are now in place as part of the design team. The design team has begun work on development of detailed plans for the new children's hospital on the site at St. James's, with the aim of submitting a planning application in June 2015. </p></reply>

This would equate to an additional resource requirement of the order of &euro;170 million.</p><p>  In Budget 2015 the Government has provided an additional &euro;305 million in Exchequer funding bringing the Exchequer contribution to &euro;13,079 billion. In addition, a further &euro;330 million in once-off revenue measures will also be available to fund health services. This means there will be an increase of &euro;635 million in health services current spending compared to the initial 2014 health budget allocation.  </p><p>  Specific savings and efficiencies of &euro;130 million have also been identified in the areas of procurement, drug costs, agency costs, clinical audit and special investigation. Significantly, any savings made will go back into the development and delivery of services for patients and will not be used to reduce the overall Budget deficit or pay down the national debt. This will ensure that any further savings identified and achieved can be reinvested in the service in the years ahead.</p><p>  The Government has also increased the health expenditure ceiling for 2016 to &euro;13,253 billion. These higher funding levels in 2015 and 2016 will allow the health system to support our growing and ageing population.  Furthermore, the additional investment provided over this period will enable the health system to invest in a number of enhancements including the commencement of an extension to the BreastCheck programme, expanded Mental Health teams and further investment in suicide prevention.  Free GP care for the over 70&rsquo;s and the under 6's will also be introduced when negotiations conclude with the IMO.</p><p>  It is important to note that in Fianna F&aacute;il's pre-budget submission they only provided for an extra &euro;94 million Exchequer allocation for health.  This is to be set against &euro;305 million by the Government.  Furthermore, Fianna F&aacute;il only set aside &euro;10 million in new money for mental health.  This is in stark contrast to the &euro;25 million from the Government.</p></reply>

The only mechanisms for staff to register an interest in being transferred to a regional location is through application to another Department with an office in that location or application through their Staff Association for a head to head swap. Staff may also now apply for any one of the many re-deployment vacancies advertised in the Public Service through the Public Appointments Service.

Through our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates throughout the U.S., we are working closely with many other individuals and groups across Irish America and beyond towards achieving some relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the United States and improved channels for legal migration between Ireland and America.During my recent visit to the US from 23 September to 1 October I had a wide range of meetings with both Irish community groups and high level government contacts on this important issue.</p><p>  My programme included discussions with Vice President Joe Biden, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, Secretary of State John Kerry, and Congressman Joseph Kennedy.  I had a meeting in New York with Irish-American community leaders, including from the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers, Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, Ancient Order of Hibernians and the New York branch of the GAA, with whom the Government has worked closely on our shared U.S. immigration reform agenda. I also had the opportunity to visit the Emerald Isle Immigration Center and Aisling Irish Center in New York and the Irish International Immigrant Center in Boston, which gave me the opportunity to meet some of those most affected by the current state of affairs.</p><p>  Following the bipartisan U.S. Senate bill last year, and despite extensive combined efforts at Government, Embassy and Irish-American community levels since then, the U.S. House of Representatives has not yet taken action that would deliver relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the U.S. or an improved facility for future legal migration between Ireland and the U.S. While it appeared before the summer to be the intention of President Obama and his Administration to examine the scope for action on immigration via executive authority, President Obama announced on September 6 that he would delay any such action until after the November U.S. elections.</p><p>  The exact extent, nature and timing of any action that the U.S. Administration will be ready to take remains to be confirmed and there is clearly no guarantee as to the outcome that can be achieved via executive action.  However, in my contacts in Washington, including in my conversation with the White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough,  I stressed the importance of addressing the needs and concerns of the undocumented Irish migrants in any such action. There are of course limits to what executive action is likely to be able to do and so further progress on the legislative track is also necessary.</p><p>  While there appears to be some willingness to consider further action in Congress at some future point, this is dependent on many factors and will not be easy to achieve. The Government will continue to work resolutely for progress over the coming months from which currently undocumented Irish migrants in the U.S. and their families can benefit.</p></reply>

As set out in the Government&rsquo;s Policy on International Development, <i>One World, One Future,</i>we regard gender-based violence as a major abuse of human rights which undermines women&rsquo;s health, well-being and livelihoods. Irish Aid is playing an active role in international policy development, funding and research to address gender based violence, including the broader challenges of women&rsquo;s economic and political empowerment and their access to justice.  Ireland also continues to work with civil society organisations and national and local governments in Uganda, Mozambique, South Africa, Sierra Leone and Liberia supporting service delivery, building capacity and lobbying for the development and roll out of laws and policies to tackle gender-based violence.As women and girls are particularly vulnerable to such violence in emergency situations, Irish Aid prioritises the protection of women and girls in its response to humanitarian emergencies.<br/><br/>Irish Aid is an active member of the <i>Irish Consortium on Gender-based Violence</i>, an association of Irish development, human rights and humanitarian organizations and the Irish Defence Forces. This aims to build members&rsquo; capacity to respond to all forms of gender-based violence in conflict, post-conflict and long-term development contexts.<br/><br/>Ireland also supports UN Women to advocate for an end to violence against women, to increase awareness of the causes and consequences of such violence and to build the capacity of partners to prevent and respond to violence.  Ireland is also supporting the UN Women administered Trust Fund to End Violence Against Women.  This supports NGOs, governments and UN country teams in their work to prevent violence against women and girls, to assist survivors and expand their access to key legal, psychosocial and health care services.The aim, in turn, is to strengthen implementation of laws and policies on violence against women, and to address the linkages between violence and HIV and AIDS.</p></reply>

Of this total, &euro;479 million is allocated to Vote 27 &ndash; International Cooperation - managed by the Development Cooperation Division of my Department. A further estimated &euro;120 million is allocated to &lsquo;other ODA&rsquo;.  This comprises Ireland&rsquo;s share of the EU Development Cooperation budget together with ODA-eligible contributions made by other Government Departments.  Final outturn figures for 2014 will be available and published early next spring.   Since coming to office, and in the context of very difficult budgetary circumstances, this Government has largely managed to stabilise annual allocations to ODA.   On Budget day last week we announced a total allocation to ODA of just over &euro;600 million for next year, ensuring that we have protected the aid budget.   Of this total, &euro;476 million was allocated to Vote 27 &ndash; International Cooperation which will be managed by my Department.</p><p>  Our 2015 allocation to ODA demonstrates our ongoing and firm commitment to the aid programme.   Our priority now is to ensure we continue to focus this significant level of public funding on delivering real and sustainable improvements to the lives of some of the world&rsquo;s poorest men women and children.</p></reply>

A number of organisations have expressed their concern to me about the overall level of funding currently available for peace and reconciliation work.The advancement of reconciliation on this island remains a priority issue for me and my Department.  I am pleased that the budget of my Department&rsquo;s Reconciliation Fund has been maintained in Budget 2015 at &euro;2.74 million. This reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement commitment relating to the promotion of reconciliation, and its recognition of the importance of supporting the work of civil society groups in this area.   The Reconciliation Fund awards supports projects that tackle sectarianism and contribute to reconciliation through education, dialogue, culture and commemoration; promote tolerance and respect; challenge stereotypes of one&rsquo;s own and other communities;  and develop and strengthen meaningful cross-border links. All applications to the Fund are assessed in terms of their potential to meet the objectives and criteria of the Reconciliation Fund&rsquo;s Strategy, which was launched in June 2014. Each year, approximately 150 organisations are awarded funding for their work on addressing sectarianism and promoting reconciliation.</p><p>  As well as the Government&rsquo;s own support for reconciliation, the international community has, of course, made a major contribution to this work. The previous phase of a number of EU funding programmes, which support reconciliation and peace-building work, ran from 2007 to 2013.  The draft operational programme for EU PEACE IV (covering the period 2014-2020 and involving resources of some &euro;260M) was jointly submitted to the European Commission by the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive in late September.</p><p>  In addition to the EU, the International Fund for Ireland, which is supported by financial contributions from the US Government, continues to make a valuable contribution to promoting community relations in marginalised and hard to reach communities.</p></reply>

Ireland is deeply concerned by the persecution of Christians.  Ireland attaches great importance to combatting all forms of discrimination based on religion or belief and incitement to religious hatred.  We firmly believe in tolerance, non-discrimination, freedom of expression, freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief. Where possible, Ireland raises the issue of the safety of Christians through its official bilateral contacts with the countries in question, stressing the responsibility of the government to protect all citizens and minorities.</p><p>  Ireland consistently presses for effective action to counter the persecution of minorities in all relevant international fora, including the EU and UN.  Just last month (29 September) I highlighted the issue when I addressed the UN General Assembly in New York.  I also raised it during my meeting with UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon.</p><p>  Ireland is working within the EU to address  the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities, notably with the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief adopted during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union last year. These Guidelines provide EU officials with an overview of the legal and policy framework within which the right to freedom of religion or belief is protected. They also elaborate an EU strategy on how to engage with third countries on the right to freedom of religion or belief, a strategy which we hope to see bear fruit as we assess the implementation of the Guidelines.</p><p>  Ireland has been active at both the United Nations Human Rights Council and the Council of the European Union in raising human rights issues, and in particular issues regarding freedom of religion or belief. We appreciate the input from Church in Chains, and their input informs our position on particular issues of persecution of religious minorities.</p><p>  I can assure you that Ireland will continue to actively support freedom of religion or belief across our foreign policy.</p></reply>

A total of 18 career clusters have been identified by SOLAS and one of these clusters is focussed on training and education programmes in the Transportation, Distribution and Logistics sector in order to meet skills shortages.  This sector is also one of the targeted areas of the second round of the Momentum programme for long term unemployed people that was launched in recent weeks.</p><p>  Approximately every two years, SOLAS commissions independent researchers to carry out a survey to track employment and progression outcomes for participants completing training and employment programmes. The most recent survey, published in June of this year, documents the experiences of those who exited during the summer of 2012.  Whilst this survey provides global information on progression and employment outcomes it does not track the outcomes in relation to specific training programmes or clusters. The survey is available on the SOLAS Website, www.solas.ie.  Work currently underway in SOLAS and the ETBs on the development of a new learner database, along with data matching against other systems, will improve our capability to track specific outcomes for participants in coming years.</p></reply>

It is expected that the guidelines will be available later this year or early in 2015. </p><p>  These guidelines will complement 'Well-Being in Post-Primary Schools: Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention' which were published by my Department in 2013. These guidelines were  developed by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive. They provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour. </p><p>  The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including through the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, and the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model. Information is also provided on how to access support from the Professional Development Service for Teachers, the HSE, Health Promotion Officers and  other external agencies and support services. </p><p>  The new Framework for Junior Cycle also places a clear emphasis on overall student health and well-being. This Framework is underpinned by eight principles, one of which is &quot;Well-being&quot;. It also has eight key skills which are to be embedded in every new Junior Cycle subject and short course including  the key skills of &quot;Managing Myself&quot; and &quot;Staying Well&quot;. In addition, the 24 'Statements of Learning' that a student should experience during their Junior Cycle programme involve the student taking action to safeguard and promote their own well-being and that of others. </p><p>  One of the innovative features of the Junior Cycle Framework is the introduction of short courses that schools can choose to implement. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) has developed a new short course in SPHE, which may be delivered for certification purposes and will involve an increase in the time allocation for SPHE at Junior Cycle up to 100 hours over the three year cycle.  The new short course is now available to implement in  post-primary schools, should they wish to do so, as part of their Junior Cycle programme.  It includes strands such as &quot;Minding Myself and Others&quot; and &quot;My Mental Health&quot;, and deals with issues such as mental health and mental ill-health, dealing with tough times, loss and bereavement.  </p><p>  My Department is also working with the Department of Health to promote participation by primary and post-primary schools in the 'Health Promoting Schools' initiative, which is supported by the Department of Health. This European-wide programme aims to strengthen schools' capacity to be a healthy setting for learning and working by focusing at whole-school level on all the conditions that affect health and well-being. </p></reply>

The NCCA has consulted on their work so far which is focussed on junior infant classes through to second class. The findings of the consultation are informing the development of the curriculum.  It is expected that the new curriculum will be available to schools from September 2015 and implemented from September 2016.  The emphasis is not only on reading and writing but also on the listening and speaking aspects of the languages.<br/><br/>The NCCA, having completed its consultation on a background paper on Irish for the Junior Cycle, is currently working on the development of the new specification.  This will be available for implementation in schools for their first years from September 2016. This specification will clarify the learning outcomes to be achieved by students and place an increased emphasis on the development of oral language skills. Consideration is also being given to the introduction of a short course in Irish in Junior Cycle particularly for Irish students in the Gaeltacht, or students in Gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute; who would like the opportunity to study additional Irish.<br/><br/>Since June 2012, the weighting for oral Irish proficiency in the Leaving Certificate was increased from 25% to 40%. The impact of this change is being reviewed.  It should be noted that the percentage of Irish candidates taking the Higher Level paper has risen from 37% in 2012 to 40% in 2014.  This is most likely attributable to the new weighing / emphasis on oral Irish. <br/><br/>An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta (COGG) has been co-located with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) so that the development of curricula and support materials for Irish (this is a key part of the remit of COGG) can take place in a closely co-ordinated way. This approach should allow for the enhancement of the quality of teaching and learning.<br/><br/>There has been significant investment in continuous professional development (CPD) for Irish teachers in recent years. For example,<br/><br/>- CPD in relation to the national literacy and numeracy strategy for primary teachers and post-primary teachers has included specific provision for teachers in Irish medium schools and a commitment to offering 20 hours of CPD over the course of 5 years to certain teachers.<br/><br/>- CPD for post primary teachers of Irish from 2007 - 2012 has provided by the Seirbh&iacute;s Taca&iacute;ochta Dara Leibh&eacute;al don Ghaeilge. This team has now been integrated with the Professional Development Service for Teachers and continues to provide CPD for teachers of Irish as part of the literacy strategy<br/><br/>- CPD for post-primary teachers of Irish in the context of the new junior cycle Irish specification will begin in the school year 2015/2016.<br/><br/>Thus at both primary and post-primary there is a significant amount of work being done or being reviewed.

It is expected that any further increase in enrolments in the following years will further offset the issue of the extra Department funded teaching posts.<br/><br/>Capitation and Capital Grants provided to the fee charging schools which transferred to the Free Education Scheme were as follows:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Amount</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;218,987</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;1,647,352</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;3,409,908</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;1,191,885</td></tr></table>The capital grants were utilised by the schools to meet liabilities incurred for building and associated works undertaken which would have been eligible for consideration for such funding, that would otherwise be met from fee income, had the school not entered the Free Education Scheme.<br/><br/>In the years before entry to the Free Education Scheme the salaries of teachers employed within the annual staffing allocation for fee charging schools were paid by the State. Capitation grants were not paid to these schools in the period prior to entering the Free Education Scheme.<br/><br/>When examining the issue of additional costs to the Department arising from the entrance of schools to the Free Education Scheme, it must also be recognised the savings which the Department has realised through the changes to the staffing schedule of fee charging schools over recent years. Since 2009, those savings amount to approximately &euro;27m, greatly exceeding the additional costs which have been incurred from the entry of the five fee charging schools into the Free Education Scheme.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing arrangements for the 2014/15 school year are set out in Circular 0007/2014 which is available on the Department website. There is no change to the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the current 2014/15 school year. The school has four classroom teachers (including the Principal teacher) based on an enrolment of 91 pupils at 30 September, 2013.<br/><br/>  Data in relation to enrolment figures in primary schools in the current school year are not yet available to my Department. The number of pupils enrolled in individual schools is provided in the National School Annual Census and refers to the number of pupils enrolled as of the 30th of September in the given academic year. The National School Annual Census is generally returned by schools to the Department by end October.<br/><br/>  The staffing arrangements for the 2015/16 school year will be published early in 2015 and this will enable schools to determine their staffing levels for the 2015/16 school year. The staffing process also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board. The Appeals Board operates independently of the Minister and the Department and its decision is final.</p></reply>

Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments.</p><p>  In 2006 the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills commenced a unique project in relation to biomass energy use in schools to evaluate the suitable application and performance and compatibility of biomass systems. The evaluation process included school heating requirements in terms of heating demand characteristics, controls, reliability, fuel storage and maintenance and operation and customer satisfaction. The evaluation of the 14 sites that formed the Biomass Deployment Pilot Programme from 2007 to 2009 met the overall objective in that it trialled a number of boiler types for integration into a representative sample of educational buildings which included both new and existing structures.</p><p>  The project was assessed by independent consultants. The pilot highlighted the positive and negative aspects in the challenges of successfully integrating biomass into the school stock. This was not achieved without some issues and the overall level of satisfaction was rated at approx. 56%. The study found that biomass boilers can provide an efficient and renewable form of heating in schools but cannot be deemed an exact fit. It is also considered that it will prove difficult to match the small schools in the country with biomass heating on an operational and costs basis. The study found that as reflected in the satisfaction rating, biomass systems can require a significant amount of management input on site to ensure that they operate at optimum level and provide reliable heating to the school.</p><p>  One outcome from the project highlighted the potential market for Energy Supply Companies (ESCO) to provide a heat contract to schools based on biomass heating, where the ESCO finances, operates and maintains the system and sells heat to the school. The Department also makes allowances for same in all new school designs via our Technical Guidance Documents, thus ensuring that there are no barriers to an ESCO being developed on a new school site.</p><p>  The potential for renewables in schools is under continued review by my Departments Energy Research Programme with continued research and by monitoring improvements in technology and the market place.</p></reply>

All mainstream Primary schools have been allocated additional teaching resources under the GAM to cater for children with high incidence <br/><br/>special educational needs.<br/><br/>Separately, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocates additional resource teaching hours to schools for children who have been <br/><br/>assessed within the low incidence, or more complex, category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05. The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.<br/><br/>  It is a matter for schools to monitor and utilise their allocation of additional teaching support to best support the needs of identified pupils, in accordance with my Department's guidance.<br/><br/>  Should a parent be dissatisfied with the manner in which the resources or facilities which have been provided to support their child's education are being applied in school, they should raise this matter directly with their school Principal or the Board of Management of the school.<br/><br/>  Schools may also apply to the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) for Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support in respect of children with special educational needs who have care needs in schools, in accordance with the criteria set out in my Departments Circular 0030/2014 on the SNA scheme. <br/><br/>  Schools who wish to make applications for SNA support for children with special educational needs for the current school year may continue to make such applications to the NCSE.<br/><br/>  Details of the NCSE application criteria are available at www.ncse.ie.<br/><br/>  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.<br/><br/>  Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that the availability of Health related services, such as occupational therapy support, is a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE). Questions relating to such health services should therefore be addressed to the HSE, or to my colleague, the Minister for Health.</p></reply>

These additional costs amount to approximately &euro;88 million. In the region of three-quarters of these costs are accounted for by increased numbers of pupils at first and second level.  The precise impact of demographic factors in respect of 2016 expenditure is difficult to project at this stage and will depend partly on actual 2014 and 2015 pupil and teacher number outturns.  However, it is considered that demographic factors could give rise to increased expenditure in 2016 of up to the same level as 2015.<br/><br/>  My Department's capital allocation for 2015 stands at &euro;530m of which almost &euro;470m is in respect of the school sector including PPPs.  The focus under the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Programme 2012-2016 in the education sector is on the provision of sufficient school places to meet demographic demand and my Department will continue to meet this challenge in 2015 and 2016 through Large Scale Project delivery and the Additional Accommodation Scheme. </p></reply>

These posts were in 173 DEIS Band 1 and Band 2 Schools, 163 post primary schools, 16 rural DEIS schools and 17 non DEIS schools.<br/><br/>  My Department produced a report on the impact of the withdrawal of these legacy posts from Band 1 and Band 2 Schools.  Subsequently, under the Government's decision of 21 February 2012, a number of schools continued to retain disadvantaged legacy posts from previous disadvantaged schemes on a year to year basis and only where warranted, based on the enrolment of the previous 30th September. <br/><br/>  As the Deputy may be aware, a range of factors contribute to determining the staffing requirement for individual schools including changes to enrolment and the reforms to the teacher allocation process in 2012.  The overall objective of the reforms is to enable the teacher allocation and redeployment process to operate more smoothly and efficiently, to give a more equitable distribution of existing posts between schools, give earlier certainty to schools about their staffing allocations and, where possible, simplify and streamline existing processes and give greater autonomy to schools.  This also removed the need to directly notify every DEIS school of its staffing levels each year. <br/><br/>  As the teaching allocation to schools, including disadvantaged legacy posts, are enrolment-based, this determines whether schools gain or lose teaching posts from year to year. <br/><br/>Some schools seemed to be under the impression that the Government decision of February 2012, in relation to legacy posts, implied that they would retain legacy posts, regardless of changes in enrolment.  I wish to clarify that legacy posts are retained in schools from year to year, only where warranted, based on the enrolment of the previous 30th September. <br/><br/>It is not my intention to review this decision.</p></reply>

The primary purpose of the Act is to replace the system whereby a vehicle was declared off the road retrospectively with a system under which the vehicle must be declared off the road in advance.  The system of making retrospective declarations had become a means of evasion of motor tax estimated to  have cost the taxpayer some &euro;50m annually.  The Act provides that a vehicle can be declared off the road for a minimum period of three months and a maximum period of twelve months.  Where the owner of a vehicle wishes to make a declaration of non-use, he or she must do so during the final month of an existing tax disc or a previously made declaration of non-use.  The declaration can be made on-line at or through the local motor tax office.<br/><br/>Where a declaration of non-use is not made in the final month of a tax disc or previously made declaration of non-use, a vehicle must be taxed for the minimum period provided for in motor tax legislation, which is three months in the case a car and twelve months in the case of a motorcycle.  A new declaration can then be made at any stage during the final month of the new motor tax disc if the vehicle is thereafter not going to be in use in a public place.<br/><br/>Exemptions are not provided for in individual cases.  This is to protect the new arrangements; allowing an owner to declare a vehicle off the road after the expiry of a current declaration of non-use could potentially be a move back to the system of retrospective declarations, thereby undermining the overall objective of the legislative change. </p></reply>

Over 7,500 new homes will be provided in 2015 under a range of housing programmes. A Social Housing Strategy, as committed to under Action 8 of Construction 2020, is currently being finalised and will provide the basis for an enhanced approach to social housing delivery and financing over the next five years.  The Government is acutely aware of the issue of rising rents and the difficulties being experienced by households. The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PTRB) was asked by my predecessor to conduct a study to explore options to address the difficulties being experienced. That report, Rent Stability in the Private Rented Sector was submitted to me last month and is one of two reports commissioned by the PRTB, the second of which, Future of the Private Rented Sector, is currently being finalised. The options put forward in these reports will require careful consideration, together with stakeholders, before deciding on the best policies to address the current difficulties in the market.  The Government&rsquo;s overriding objective in relation to rents is to achieve stability and sustainability in the market for the benefit of tenants, landlords and society as a whole. <br/><br/>With regard to homelessness, the Implementation Plan on the State's Response to Homelessness was published in May and outlines the Government's approach to delivery on its objective of ending involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 was outlined.  A copy of this plan is available on my Department's website at, .<br/><br/>The Plan sets out a range of measures to secure a ring-fenced supply of accommodation to house homeless households and mobilise the necessary supports by 2016. I am very pleased that the funding available in 2015 for homelessness accommodation and related services across the country has increased by over 20% to &euro;55.5 million.  This funding will be used to achieve the Government&rsquo;s objective outlined in the Implementation Plan. <br/><br/>My Department, the Housing Agency and NAMA will continue to work together with housing authorities and approved housing bodies to identify suitable NAMA housing units and bring them into social housing use. By the end of Q3 2014, 669 housing units have completed transfer with a further 257 units contracted with completion work on-going. This brings the overall total delivery of social housing from NAMA-sourced units to 926 units (completed or contracted) since the process began. </p></reply>

The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.  The Act defines a customer as the occupier of the premises in receipt of water services. As such, third level students who have moved away from home to an alternative primary residence will be liable for water charges, Management companies of student accommodation are already categorised as non-domestic customers for water services. Local authorities, acting as agents of Irish Water, have continued to bill such companies that recover this cost via the fees charged for the accommodation. Students who are tenants in private rented accommodation will be liable for water charges, similar to other utility supplies, but will also be eligible to claim the household allowance being provided by Irish Water. </p></reply>

In May of 2014,  the Council notified my Department that two houses in another local authority estate may also be affected. As matters stand, my Department understands that a total of 17 houses in the three local authority estates are affected by the cracking in the blockwork. The majority of these dwellings appear to have been constructed between 2000 and 2002. </p><p>  In early March 2014, my Department also met with a number of private homeowners whose homes are similarly affected by structural problems. The problems appear to concern approximately 15 houses and the period of construction for the houses involved was 1997 to 2002. My Department has not been made aware of other dwellings affected by structural problems in the blockwork in County Mayo.</p><p>  While I fully appreciate and acknowledge the extremely difficult and distressing situations that householders have to deal with when faced with the consequences of the use of defective materials or poor workmanship, building defects are, in general, matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, i.e. the owner, the builder, the manufacturer, supplier, quarry owner and/or their respective insurers. In the event that the contracting parties cannot reach a settlement by negotiation the option of seeking redress in the Courts can be considered. In this regard, I believe that the responsible parties should face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate actions to provide remedies for the affected homeowners.</p><p>  The Building Regulations 1997 &ndash; 2014 set out the legal requirements for the construction of new buildings (including houses), extensions to existing buildings as well as for material alterations and certain material changes of use to existing buildings.  The regulations are divided in to 12 Parts (classified as Parts A to M), and Technical Guidance Documents (TGDs) are published to accompany each of the parts and provide guidance indicating how the requirements of each part can be achieved in practice. Where works are carried out in accordance with the relevant technical guidance, such works are considered to be, prima facie, in compliance with the relevant regulation(s).</p><p>  Primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations rests with the designers, builders and owners of buildings. Responsibility for enforcement is delegated under the Building Control Act 1990 to local building control authorities who are independent in the exercise of their statutory powers. The use of these powers is, however, subject to a statute of limitations of five years from the date of completion of the buildings concerned. </p></reply>

The NPPR Charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence. The self-assessed charge is set at &euro;200 per annum and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties. Section 6 of the 2009 Act, as amended, provides that the owner of a liable property who fails to pay the charge, in addition to his or her being liable to pay the charge, is liable to pay to the relevant local authority a &euro;20 late payment fee in respect of each month or part of a month in which the charge, any late payment fee, or any part of such charge or fee, remains unpaid.  Part 12 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 deals with the collection of undischarged liabilities relating to the NPPR charge. The Act provided for a period from 2 March 2014 to 31 August 2014 during which time no new late penalties were applied to existing liabilities. If payment was not made in full or if settlement terms were not agreed by the end of that period, an additional late payment fee of &euro;120 per liability date applied on 1 September 2014. As the Charge applied in each of the years from 2009 to 2013, there were five liability dates &ndash; 31 July 2009 and 31 March for each of the years 2010 to 2013. In addition to this late payment fee to be applied per liability date, the entire NPPR liability is then increased by a factor of 50% and frozen. <br/><br/>My Department undertook an initial media campaign when the NPPR Charge was first introduced in 2009. Nationwide advertising has also taken place in each year since the introduction of the Charge under the auspices of the local authorities to ensure general awareness of the Charge and the liability dates. In addition, local authorities have undertaken their own advertising campaigns locally. The NPPR Project Board, in conjunction with individual local authorities, undertook a media campaign this year aimed at reminding non-compliant owners that additional late payment penalties applied after 31 August 2014. The extensive radio and print media campaign reminded non-compliant owners of their obligations to come forward to regularise their affairs and to take advantage of this once-off grace period. While it is a necessary principle of law that all citizens are required to be aware of relevant legal obligations and duties in respect of such charges, as is the case in other jurisdictions, it remains my view that reasonable efforts have been made to ensure that property owners have been aware of the Charge and liability dates. <br/><br/>Under section 77 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 my Department issued guidance to local authorities concerning matters relating to arrears of the NPPR Charge and late payment fees to ensure that a consistent national approach is adopted. The guidelines, which are available at , encourage local authorities to take a proactive approach to ensure that any outstanding NPPR liabilities are discharged in the most equitable, efficient and economically beneficial manner and also include information in relation to dealing with hardship cases, It is expected, in the majority of cases, that local authorities will collect the full NPPR Charge liability from owners. In some cases, this may be by means of arrangement by instalment. The Act places the Charge under the care and management of the local authorities and application in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority. All non-compliant owners should log on to <font color="#0000FF"> </font>or, alternatively, contact their local authority to discuss any matters they wish to clarify and to make their outstanding payments. </p></reply>

The making of a special amenity area order is a reserved function of the elected members of a local authority.

In addition, while article 6 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended, provides that development specified in Schedule 2 of the regulations shall be exempted development for the purposes of the Act, article 9 of the Regulations provides that development to which article 6 relates shall not be exempted development for the purposes of the Act if the carrying out of such development would, among other things, interfere with the character of a landscape, or a view or prospect of special amenity value or special interest, the preservation of which is an objective of a development plan for the area in which the development is proposed or, pending the variation of a development plan or the making of a new development plan, in the draft variation of the development plan or the draft development plan. </p><p>  I am satisfied with the existing provisions relating to the protection of special amenity areas, and I have no plans to establish a fund for this purpose. </p></reply>

In order to provide for free allowances and give greater visibility on the expected level of water charges, the Government have decided to provide the following subvention to Irish Water in 2015 and 2016:</p><p>- An average subvention of &euro;537m in each of the two years, and</p><p>- Provision of just over &euro;400m in 2015 and 2016 to support increased investment in public water services, including the provision of a &ldquo;first fix scheme&rdquo; by Irish Water.</p><p>This funding package for 2015 and 2016 builds on the Exchequer funding being provided to Irish Water in 2014, which includes &euro;239m that will be used to primarily fund the core capital expenditure programme of Irish Water. In addition, Irish Water will receive a subvention of some &euro; 440 million from the Local Government Fund in 2014, which will fund water- related expenditures incurred heretofore by local authorities and which would, historically, have been met by local authorities from their own resources, non-domestic water charge revenues and general purpose grants from the Fund. It is anticipated that Irish Water will finance other costs from non-domestic water charge revenues of some &euro;190m and from borrowing, which will be the subject of appropriate Ministerial consents in due course.  The local government funding model has changed considerably in 2014 and, in particular, the establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector has a considerable impact on local authority financing. The Revised Estimates Volume for Public Services 2014 estimates total expenditure from the Local Government Fund of &euro;1.779 billion in 2014, with income from, primarily, estimated Local Property Tax proceeds of &euro;550m and revenue from motor tax of &euro;1.16 billion.</p><p>  The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group, to be formed and registered under the Companies Acts.

In this regard, advice was sought on the possibility of legislative provision being made whereby a person substantially deprived of the enjoyment of their property, such as the deprivation of light caused by high trees on a neighbouring property, could apply to the Courts for an order, and that the Courts could make an order as they see fit, e.g. to cut the trees back to an appropriate height. The Minister for Justice responded in July 2012 suggesting that disputes of this nature between neighbours could perhaps be more appropriately dealt with through mediation rather than through the Courts. I understand that the Department of Justice proposes to publish a Mediation Bill during 2015.</p></reply>

The valuation determined by the Commissioner is fixed on a property and generally does not change from year to year, unless the valuation is revised or revalued in the normal course of that office&rsquo;s work.  Part 6 of the Valuation Act 2001 provides that a revision of the valuation of a particular property may only be carried out if a "Material Change of Circumstances" has taken place since the property was last valued.  The application and management of this process is a matter entirely for the Commissioner of Valuation and the Valuation Office.</p><p>  The Local Government Act 1946 provides that where a property is unoccupied on the date of the making of the rate, the owner becomes liable for rates.  However, the owner is entitled to a refund if the property is vacant for specified purposes i.e. if the premises are unoccupied for the purpose of additions, alterations or repairs; where the owner is bona fide unable to obtain a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent; and where the premises are vacant pending redevelopment.  The collection of rates and the determination of eligibility for a refund in this context are matters for each individual local authority.</p></reply>

The ESB General Employees&rsquo; Superannuation Scheme is the scheme through which pensions for the majority of employees in the electricity business are funded.  The fund is vested in trustees nominated by ESB and its members for the sole benefit of employees and their dependents.  The Scheme is a defined benefit scheme and is registered as such with the Pensions Authority (formerly the Pensions Board).  The Trustees of the ESB scheme, with the agreement of ESB, submitted a funding plan for the Scheme to the then Pensions Board, which was approved in October 2012.</p><p>  The 2013 ESB Annual Report stated that the pension scheme does not have a deficit on an ongoing actuarial basis, and while it would have a deficit in a wind-up situation (&quot;Minimum Funding Standard&quot;), the funding plan which was approved by the Pensions Board was to resolve this deficit by 2018.  This plan is on track and there are no plans to wind up the scheme.  Should a deficit arise in the future, the obligation on the company, as set out in the Scheme regulations, to consult with the parties to the Scheme remains unchanged.</p><p>  The issue of management of and attendance at meetings convened in respect of operation of the pension scheme is a matter for the Trustees of the Pension Fund and not one in which I have a role or function.</p></reply>

The process currently underway involves all of these stakeholders, including the deferred members.</p><p>  I can assure you that I do understand the concerns of the deferred members in relation to the funding of the scheme.  However, such matters are governed in the first instance by the trust deed and rules of a pension scheme.  In this regard the trustees of the scheme must, in the management of the scheme, act in the best interests of all scheme members and beneficiaries.    Trustees of a pension scheme must also comply with the provisions in the Pensions Act 1990 which, among other things, sets down certain requirements in relation to the funding of pensions scheme.  The funding requirements under the Pensions  Act essentially provide a &lsquo;health check&rsquo; on the  funding level in a pension scheme and provide an indication to the trustees that action is required if the funding level falls below the requirements of the Act.  Matters relating to the provisions in the Pensions Act are the responsibility of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection.  I understand that a number of  changes have been made to the Pensions Act in recent years to assist, and to provide additional options to, employers and the trustees of pension schemes to address the funding challenges facing many schemes.</p><p>  I understand that where a pension scheme operates across EU Member States, the employees who are employed in a different Member State (i.e., the host Member State) may be subject to certain provisions (i.e., the social and labour law relevant to the field of occupational pensions) in that Member State which may provide for a different level of protection of pension rights.</p><p>  In their discussions with the deferred members, the Expert Panel explained that the process was an industrial relations process and that responsibility for dealing with the deferred members of the scheme rested with the IASS Trustee through engagement with the employers.  Notwithstanding that strict legal position, the Panel recommended, inter alia, that the IASS Trustee engage with the employers on ways to alleviate as much of the impact of the Trustee proposal as is possible whilst also recognising the overall affordability to the employers of the proposals for active and deferred members.  As a result of that Report, there was an uplift in the monies to be provided by the employers outside of the IASS, a significant proportion of which is intended for the deferred members and which goes a long way towards mitigating the benefit cuts proposed by the IASS Trustee.</p><p>  The IASS Trustee and the principal employers have recently issued documents in respect of the proposed changes in pension arrangements.  These communications mark the commencement of the formal consultation process which the Trustee is required by the Pensions Act 1990 to undertake in respect of the reductions in benefits that it is proposing.  Each member will also have received by now a personalised illustration of future pension benefits.  All members have been invited to send their views on the proposals to the IASS Trustee by 27 October 2014.  The target date for implementation of the proposals remains 31 December 2014.</p><p>  Huge efforts have been put in by all concerned over many years in an attempt to resolve the scheme's funding problems.  A set of clear proposals has now been put forward which offer the best chance to resolve the long-standing problems of the scheme and resolve members&rsquo; uncertainties about their future pension entitlements.  I would urge all parties to accept them.</p></reply>

However, section 10 of the Road Traffic Act 2014, when commenced shortly, will bring this offence within the Fixed Charge Payment System and will attract 3 penalty points on payment of the Fixed Charge.</p><p>  Under the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 (Conferral of Functions) Order 2006 (S.I. No. 477 of 2006), the Road Safety Authority has responsibility for the delivery of the National Car Test.  The RSA has overall responsibility for the operation, oversight, development, quality assurance and delivery of vehicle testing arrangements.</p><p>  I am advised that any car owner will receive an appointment within 28 days.  I understand that, in order to meet this standard, in some cases, the National Car Testing Service (NCTS) holds requests on a waiting list until a suitable slot is found.  In the majority of cases, customers are given a slot within the required timescale.  However, if a slot is not found within 28 days, the test should be offered free of charge.</p><p>  Also, to further facilitate demand, an NCT may be undertaken up to 90 days in advance of the test due date without affecting the expiry date of the new certificate.  This system is in place to ensure that owners have ample time to have their vehicle tested before their current NCT certificate expires.</p><p>  The RSA informs me that it is in a favourable position to deal with current demand and that the NCTS has been testing record numbers to date in 2014, with the number of vehicles tested each month being approximately 12% higher than in the corresponding months in 2013.</p></reply>

It is a matter for Louth County Council to further develop its proposal including the need for an economic appraisal to be undertaken in addition to an assessment of alternative funding arrangements for such a scheme.  Accordingly, no specific provision has been included in my Department's 2015 Estimate for such an alternative project.  My Department continues to operate within a very constrained budget and the priority, therefore, has to be road maintenance and renewal rather than new projects.</p></reply>

If a person has any concerns about the risk any adult may pose to a child, or children, these may also be reported to the Agency under the Guidance.</p></reply>

As such, it enjoys the full range of protections afforded by those Acts, including a requirement that any works at, or in proximity to it, are subject to my prior written consent. The Skellig islands themselves also form part of the Skelligs Special Protection Area (SPA). The SPA is designated for the protection of various species of seabird and is subject to the provisions of the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.</p><p>  On foot of detailed discussions regarding a proposal submitted to film on the island in July, my Department made a determination that the activities proposed were of such a nature that Ministerial consent under the National Monuments Acts was not required. However, it was determined that consent was required under the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 and the Statutory Instrument that designated the site as an SPA.</p><p>  The initial filming proposals raised some concern with respect to the potential impact of the activities on the SPA. Following discussion with my officials, the film company submitted a revised application with a significant reduction in activity and a re-design of several elements of the original proposal, including a 90% reduction in proposed helicopter activity for the project.</p><p>  The revised application was then screened for Appropriate Assessment in accordance with the Birds and Natural Habitats Regulations. The screening concluded that, provided the avoidance and mitigation measures proposed by the film company were implemented in full, and subject to 15 special conditions attached to the consent for the project, the proposal would not have a significant effect on the Skelligs SPA. </p><p>  The activities of the film crew were supervised at all times by personnel from the Office of Public Works and my Department&rsquo;s National Monuments and National Parks and Wildlife Services. A condition of the consent was that the salary costs and expenses of NPWS staff were charged to the filming company.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the diligence of my staff and that of the OPW, together with the professional and constructive approach of the film company, ensured that the filming activities had no negative impacts on the archaeological or ecological heritage present on the island and that there were no implications for the outstanding universal value of the world heritage property.</p></reply>
