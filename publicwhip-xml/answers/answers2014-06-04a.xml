    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-04a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014060400050#WRA00600"><p>There has been no change in policy in relation to dividends from the HFA. The primary concern is to ensure that the HFA, like any financial institution, maintain sufficient reserves.</p><p>The reserves of the Housing Finance Agency at the end of 2012 stood at &euro;72.8m having increased by &euro;13.7m during 2012. It was considered by the Board that the Reserves, which are maintained at prudent levels to counter risk, had reached a point that allowed a dividend of &euro;20m to be declared. A dividend of &euro;20m to the Housing Finance Agency's beneficial shareholder, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, was agreed and then declared at the Agency's Annual General Meeting on 25<sup>th</sup>April 2013. </p><p>However, local authorities had introduced a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) in 2012 for local authority mortgage holders that are in or are facing mortgage arrears. The Local Authority MARP process is in line with the guidance set down by the Central Bank, and comprehensive information on this process is available at . My intention in accepting a dividend, which was agreed with the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government, was that the dividend should be for the benefit of the Local Government Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process Fund. This will greatly enhance the capacity of that resource to assist local authority borrowers in mortgage distress.</p><p>Accordingly, it was decided in late 2013 to waive the dividend as financial procedures prevented the direct application of the dividend to the MARP Fund. On waiving my rights to the dividend, I requested that the HFA uses the funds to help address the issue of mortgage arrears in the local authority sector and that HFA Management will arrange a suitable mechanism for forwarding the funds into the Local Authority MARP fund. In order for the HFA to pay the &euro;20m in funds directly into the MARP Fund, legal advice indicates the HFA may require changes to its statutory powers and its Articles of Association. I understand that the legal mechanism required to pay the &euro;20m into the MARP Fund is currently under discussion between the Housing Finance Agency and the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, and this mechanism is expected to be in place in 2014.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-04a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014060400050#WRA01200"><p>As outlined to the Deputy in the reply to Parliamentary Questions 16 and 41 of 26 February 2014, the core strategy for addressing flood risk in the Shannon Basin is the River Shannon Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management (CFRAM) Study and I am advised that good progress continues to be made on the project.</p><p>A total of 66 locations along the Shannon have been identified for further assessment under the Study. The output of this important project will be an integrated plan of specific measures to address, in a comprehensive and sustainable way, the significant flood risk factors in the Shannon basin.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, operational control of water flows and levels on the Shannon is the responsibility of both the ESB and Waterways Ireland.  In order to address ongoing concerns that the existing water level control regime may be a contributory factor in early Summer flooding in the Callows, the OPW facilitated discussions between these principal operating stakeholders with a view to their agreeing a new interim control regime on the regulation of water levels.  Under this interim regime the ESB agreed to a trial lowering of the Spring/early Summer target levels in Lough Ree to reduce somewhat the risk of summer flooding, particularly in the Shannon Callows area.  This trial commenced in Summer 2013 and will remain in place until the publication of the Shannon CFRAM Plan.</p><p>On foot of discussions between the OPW and the IFA and with the cooperation of both the ESB and Waterways Ireland, a water level monitoring exercise is being carried out as part of the CFRAM process. This will allow for analysis of water flows and levels at key points around the Lough Ree and Callows areas.  Interim data from this exercise has been collated and this data will feed into the overall Shannon CFRAM study. The interim data is available on and on .  The OPW will continue to review these developments on a regular basis in consultation with the ESB and Waterways Ireland.</p><p>The Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht report on Shannon flooding dealt with and included recommendations on a number of issues within the areas of responsibilities of a range of Government Departments and State Bodies.  The OPW responded to the Committee, by way of a written reply in September 2012, in relation to the specific matters within the OPW's area of responsibility. The main area addressed in the reply related to the CFRAM programme and how the OPW is addressing flood risk on the River Shannon in the context of that Programme.  The Committee Report was forwarded to OPW's technical consultants for consideration in the context of the Shannon CFRAM Study.  The Committee received a briefing from the OPW in late 2012 including briefing on the Shannon Levels Operations Report.</p></reply>

This allocation included up to &euro;19.6m for repairs of existing coastal protection and flood defences, to be provided through the Vote of the Office of Public Works (OPW).   </p><p>The DoECLG wrote to all local authorities notifying them of their allocations in respect of each category of infrastructure covered by the Government Decision. Each Council was directed to submit overall programmes of works to the DoECLG detailing how it proposes to spend the total allocation that is being made available. The Council must also submit the relevant elements of its programme to each Department from whom funding will be made available for consideration of technical aspects of the proposed works. In preparing this programme, it is a matter for the local authorities to satisfy themselves that works they propose to undertake fall within the ambit of those covered by the Government Decision.</p><p>The programmes of coastal protection and flood defence projects received by the OPW are reviewed having regard to the Council's allocations and related guidance issued by the DoECLG to the local authorities in relation to works that may qualify for funding.</p><p>To date, total funding of &euro;18.240m has been approved and allocated by the OPW to nine Local Authorities that have submitted programmes of works as directed by the DoECLG.  This funding includes &euro;0.93m in respect of approved projects on 12 off-shore islands. A further &euro;0.055m has been allocated for works on islands that are linked to the mainland by causeways.</p><p>The commencement and progression of the works is a matter for the local authorities. The OPW has informed the local authorities that in order to assist them in a practical way and to avoid any potential cash-flow issues, it will consider requests for advance funding of up to 80% of the estimated cost of approved projects where a contract for works has been made. It is not possible at this point to estimate the precise amount that will be spent by the local authorities or that will be drawn down by them from the OPW this year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-04a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014060400050#WRA02000"><p>The public service Pension-related Deduction (PRD) was introduced in March 2009 under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. PRD is a progressively structured multi-band reduction imposed  on the pay of pensionable public servants. </p><p>  PRD continues to be a critical component of the public service pay and pension measures adopted as part of our national fiscal consolidation. Across all sectors of the public service, and based on the current PRD rates structure, it is estimated that the deduction raises in the region of &euro;950 million per year. A large proportion of this revenue would no longer accrue to the Exchequer if PRD was abolished or no longer applied to persons earning less than &euro;60,000 per annum. In these circumstances, that revenue would have to be raised through other means in order to maintain our necessary fiscal consolidation targets. Nevertheless, a start has been made in relation to the amelioration of the impact of PRD on public servants. As legislated for in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, and as provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement, the rate of PRD on the &euro;15,000 to &euro;20,000 band of pay received fell from 5% to 2.5% on 1 January 2014. This rate cut is worth &euro;125 annually in gross terms to most public servants, with those taxed at the standard rate enjoying the greater gain in terms of take-home pay boost.</p><p>  I should also point out that I will be reviewing PRD, as part of my overall annual review of the wider set of emergency fiscal measures introduced under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2009-2013. This review arises under section 12 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, and I am required to cause a written report of my findings to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. As part of that review I must consider whether the measures continue to be necessary having regard to the purposes of the legislation, the revenues of the State and State commitments in respect of public service pay and pensions. My next such report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas by 30 June 2014.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-04a.30.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014060400050#WRA02200"><p>The reform of the procurement system across the public service is a key element of the reform programme for the public service.  Public Procurement savings enable public service organisations deliver much needed services within the tighter budgets that they much now operate. The fragmented procurement arrangements across the public service have enabled suppliers to charge different public service bodies different prices for the same goods and services. This is not sustainable, as the State cannot afford to continue to purchase works, goods and services in a manner that undermines the level of services it can deliver.   </p><p>  Reforms are being carried out in a manner that recognises the importance of SMEs in the economic recovery of the country.  The establishment of the Office of Government Procurement will be key to bringing a more professional and whole of government approach to procurement. It will drive fair, transparent and open competition in the marketplace but also continue to work with business to ensure that government procurement policies are business friendly.</p><p>  As a government we want better value for money for our substantial procurement spend and we want Irish SMEs, where necessary, to form consortia to ensure they can tender on a competitive basis for this work.  In this regard the Office of Government Procurement has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 4,500 SMEs nationwide.  These 'Meet the Buyer' events afforded suppliers an opportunity to meet and discuss the issues with public service buyers and provide networking opportunities for suppliers and encourage consortia-building. </p><p>  The Office of Government Procurement is committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged with public sector procurement and the opportunities presenting.  In conjunction with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the OGP has set up a high level group on SME access to Public Procurement.  The focus of this group is to develop and monitor strategies for SME access to public procurement.  The group also has regard to the Government's Action Plan for Jobs and specifically those actions aimed at maximising procurement opportunities for SME in the public sector.  In this context my Department has also recently finished reviewing and updating existing guidelines and procedures aimed at promoting SME participation in public procurement.  Circular 10/14, launched on 17 April, sets out new initiatives aimed at opening up opportunities for small businesses to bid for State business, reducing barriers in the procurement process and reducing costs for bidders.  These new guidelines have been broadly welcomed by industry representative associations.</p></reply>

Freedom of religion or belief is one of Ireland&rsquo;s priorities for our membership of the Human Rights Council, from 2013 to 2015, and we have played a central role in the negotiation of two important resolutions on this issue in the past year. I am appalled by the sentencing of Mrs. Mariam Ishaq.  On 15 May, the EU issued a statement, which I fully support, expressing dismay at the sentence and emphasising that freedom of religion or belief is a universal human right that must be protected everywhere and for everyone.  Sudan has ratified the relevant United Nations and African Union conventions and has an international obligation to defend and promote freedom of religion or belief.</p><p>  Ireland and our EU partners have been calling on all countries to repeal legal provisions that penalise or discriminate against individuals for leaving or changing their religion or belief or for inducing others to change a religion or belief, especially when such cases are punishable by the death penalty.   We are committed to working to ensure that citizens of Sudan and elsewhere do not suffer violence or discrimination on the grounds of religion. </p><p>  I have asked our Embassy in Cairo, which is accredited to Sudan, to follow the case of Mrs. Ishaq closely, and to ensure that our serious concerns are understood.

Flexible options at retirement are available in respect of all benefits from DC retirement benefit schemes and other DC pension savings. Choices which are available to individuals (after taking the tax-free retirement lump sum) include the option to purchase an annuity with the remaining funds, to receive the balance of the pension funds in cash (subject to marginal rate income tax, as appropriate), to invest in an approved retirement fund (ARF) or an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF), subject to certain conditions. </p><p>  Under the regime the options to:</p><p>  - invest in an ARF, or</p><p>  - receive the balance of the pension fund in cash)</p><p>are subject to conditions. The conditions include the requirements that the individual be over 75 years of age or, if younger, that the individual has a guaranteed level of pension income (&quot;specified income&quot;) actually in payment for life at the time the option to effect the ARF or cash option is exercised. The purpose of the specified income requirement is to ensure, before an individual has unfettered access to their remaining retirement funds via an ARF or by way of the cash option, that they have the security of an adequate guaranteed pension income throughout the period of their retirement. The specified income requirement is &euro;12,700.  </p><p>  Where the minimum specified income test is not met, and an individual does not wish to purchase an annuity, then an AMRF must be chosen into which a &quot;set aside&quot; amount must be invested. The purpose of an AMRF is to ensure a capital or income &quot;safety net&quot; throughout the latter period of an individual's retirement where their pension income is below the specified income limit. The maximum &quot;set aside&quot; amount is &euro;63,500 of the pension fund or the remainder of the pension fund after taking the tax-free lump sum, if this is less than &euro;63,500. The capital in an AMRF is not available to an individual until he or she reaches 75 years though any income generated by the fund can be drawn down subject to tax. The capital in an AMRF can be used by the owner at any time to purchase a pension annuity and the AMRF can be changed to an ARF with access to the capital sum (subject to taxation) before the age of 75 where the specified income test is met before that age.This question may have been prompted by changes proposed to be introduced by the UK authorities to their equivalent regime from next year. In terms of increased flexibility, the primary difference between the proposed UK regime and the regime that operates here is the fact that from April 2015, the UK proposes to dispense with their guaranteed income test. In that regard, I have no plans to change the equivalent rule here or the alternative AMRF set aside rule.</p></reply>

The European Commission has indicated that it will also review whether any issues raised relating to the regulatory framework require action.</p><p>  In my role as the Minister for Finance, I have responsibility for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation in Ireland.  The day to day responsibility for the supervision of Irish authorised financial institutions is a matter for the Central Bank of Ireland which is statutorily independent in the exercise of its regulatory and supervisory functions. </p><p>  In October 2013 the Central Bank undertook a consumer protection inspection of Setanta.</p><p>  The Central Bank became aware of prudential issues in the course of this investigation and subsequently shared these with the MFSA, Setanta's prudential regulator, in November 2013. At this point, and in line with its role, the Central Bank entered into a phase of heightened contact with the MFSA in relation to these issues.</p><p>  Setanta is a Maltese incorporated company and was subject to prudential supervision in Malta by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) in accordance with the legal regime applied across all of the Member States by the relevant European directives. Therefore, the MFSA, and not the Central Bank, is the appropriate authority to comment on the financial position of Setanta.</p><p>  The extent of the Central Bank's regulatory responsibility in respect of Setanta, in accordance with the legal regime applied across all of the Member States by the relevant European directives, is limited to the area of consumer protection. The current focus of the Central Bank is to ensure that Setanta policyholders are being communicated with by the liquidator and that consumers are aware of what to do in terms of seeking alternative cover.  The Central Bank has had extensive contact with the Maltese Regulator and the Liquidator of Setanta Insurance in this regard.</p><p>  The Central Bank has advised me, regarding both its ongoing and specific communications with the MFSA, that it maintains ongoing supervisory contact with regulators throughout Europe as part of its regulatory approach. As part of this approach it had Regulator to Regulator contact with the MFSA in September 2013.</p><p>  In January 2014 an announcement was made by the Maltese Regulator that the firm would cease writing new business and issuing further renewals. That MFSA public notice stated that Setanta had ceased carrying on business of insurance, including the renewal of existing business, in terms of the Insurance Business Act with effect from 24 January 2014 and that Setanta had appointed Heritage Insurance Management (Malta) Ltd to carry on the run-off of its business.  That notice did not advise that it would be business as usual for claims settlement.</p></reply>

The European Commission has indicated that it will also review whether any issues raised relating to the regulatory framework require action.</p><p>Setanta is a Maltese incorporated company which was both authorised and prudentially supervised by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). While its financial position is not supervised by the Central Bank of Ireland, the firm is supervised by the Central Bank for conduct of business rules, i.e. consumer protection obligations.  The Central Bank is in contact with the MFSA in relation to Setanta Insurance Company Limited, the impact on policyholders and the provision for relevant and appropriate information.</p><p>Setanta was regulated at EU regulatory level in accordance with a directive known as Solvency I which currently places requirements on the amount of regulatory capital European insurance companies must hold against unforeseen events. I understand that Setanta met its EU regulatory obligations and under EU law is, therefore, entitled to trade across EU borders.  Following negotiations that were completed at European level in November, 2013, a new regime known as Solvency II will commence on 1 January 2016, which will further strengthen the EU regulatory framework. The Solvency II EU Directive sets out new, stronger EU-wide requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers with the key aim of increasing policyholder protection.  The new regime will also ensure greater cooperation between supervisors.</p><p>Under EU legislation the Central Bank of Ireland is not<b></b>responsible for the prudential supervision of Irish branches of credit institutions authorised in other EEA Member States and operating under a passporting arrangement in Ireland.  The Central Bank does however have responsibility for the supervision of such entities in the following areas:<ol type="1"><li>in co-operation with the home state regulator, assessment of their compliance with liquidity requirements;</li><li>consumer protection issues; and</li><li>compliance with Anti-Money Laundering regulations.</li></ol>Further information is available on the Central Bank's website on for Credit Institutions.  A current extract from the website is at the Appendix to the PQ response.</p><p>The current legal and regulatory framework for the provision of insurance in the EEA, and the supervision of that activity, is prescribed by European Union Law in the Life and Non-Life Insurance Directives. The provision of insurance throughout the EEA on a freedom of services basis and a freedom of establishment basis (i.e. a branch) within this framework is predicated upon the absence of internal market frontiers and the mutual recognition of the authorisation of insurance undertakings by Member States.</p><p>The Insurance Directives specify particular roles for both the home Member State supervisory authority (i.e. the supervisory authority that grants an authorisation) and the host Member State supervisory authority (i.e. the supervisory authority of a Member State where an insurance undertaking conducts business of a freedom of services or freedom of establishment basis) of an insurance undertaking. Insurance undertakings authorised under the Insurance Directives are subject to solvency and financial reserving requirements, the supervision of these requirements is the sole responsibility of the home Member State supervisory authority. The primary objective of these requirements is to ensure that claims made in respect of policies issued will be adequately provided for by an insurance undertaking.</p><p>Under EU law which governs non-life insurance, an insurer is required to inform the regulator in its home Member State (its home regulator) that it intends to pursue business in another Member State. The home regulator must then provide the host regulator with a certificate attesting that the insurer covers the EU Solvency Capital Requirement, as well as the nature of the business which the insurer intends to undertake. The insurer may start to pursue business from the date that the certificate is communicated to the host regulator, in this case the Central Bank of Ireland.</p><p>Under Article 20 of the Third Non-Life Directive the Home Regulator is also required to notify the Host Regulator if the solvency margin of an undertaking falls below the statutory requirement. In such instances the Home Regulator should inform the Host Regulator of the measures it has taken to address the solvency deficit.</p><p>EEA insurance regulators are also members of EIOPA (European Insurance &amp;amp; Occupational Pension Authority) and are required to comply with the General Protocol relating to the collaboration of the insurance supervisory authorities of the Member States of the European Union.   This general protocol statement was issued in 2008 and is currently under review by EIOPA.</p><p>With regard to the position of Setanta policyholders, my officials have been in discussions with the Central Bank of Ireland, with the Setanta Liquidator, the Accountant of the High Court and with the insurance industry representative bodies and I have asked them to convey my wish that every effort is made to facilitate Setanta policyholders in obtaining new motor insurance policies and in understanding their overall position.  We are endeavouring to obtain legal certainty on a number of matters relating to policyholders' claims for compensation and this will be made publicly available in due course.  At this time, I propose to set out the position as it currently stands.</p><p>Setanta was formally placed into liquidation by the MFSA on the 30 April 2014 and a liquidator was appointed. Officials from my Department together with officials from the Central Bank met with the Liquidator and his representatives in Ireland on 7 May 2014 and the Central Bank is in ongoing contact with him regarding the position of Setanta policyholders. All Setanta policies have now been cancelled in line with the terms of the policies.</p><p>In the circumstances, I continue to strongly advise policyholders to make alternative insurance arrangements without delay and that they should contact their insurance broker or an insurer directly to seek alternative cover.  This is also the advice of the Central Bank.</p><p>The Liquidator made arrangements for policyholders to obtain their &quot;no claims bonuses&quot; certificates from Setanta. Insurance Ireland have informed me that these certificates are being honoured by other insurers and we are aware that many insurers are being flexible surrounding requirements for documents.  In addition, the Insurance Ireland 'Declined Cases Agreement' is available to policyholders of Setanta.  I am informed that under the agreement, the insurance market will not refuse to provide insurance to an individual seeking insurance, if he/she has approached at least three insurers and has not been able to obtain cover from them.  I understand that Insurance Ireland is also making information available to those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to this matter through their service at (01) 676 1914 or by email at .</p><p>With regard to Setanta premiums and claims, the position on each policy is for the liquidator to decide in due course.  My officials and the Central Bank will remain in close contact with the Liquidator and I have asked that public statements are provided to clarify matters for policyholders and claimants.</p><p>The Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) is a non-profit-making organisation registered in Ireland.  All insurance companies underwriting motor insurance in this county must, by law, be members of MIBI and contribute to the funding of claims in proportion to their market share.  The principal role of MIBI is to compensate innocent victims of accidents caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles. This is regulated under the terms of an Agreement between the MIBI and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We are endeavouring to clarify the position on a number of matters relating to policyholders' claims for compensation, including the role of MIBI in this regard.  However, if, for legal reasons, MIBI is not in a position to accept a claim, these third party claims will be eligible to proceed for consideration by the High Court for compensation from the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF).</p><p>Claims on personal insurance policies will be payable from the ICF.  All ICF payments are subject to the limit of 65% of the amount due or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser. Under Section 3.6 of the Insurance Amendment Act 1964 (as amended) first party claims by a body corporate or unincorporated body are not covered by the ICF.</p><p>The refund of premiums for either commercial or personal insurance policies is not covered by the ICF or MIBI. However, unpaid premium would fall to be claimed from the Setanta Liquidator in due course.</p><p><b>APPENDIX</b></p><p><b>Passporting for Credit Institutions  </b></p><p>Under European Union (EU) passporting rules a credit institution authorised in one EEA Member State can establish as a branch in another Member State and/or provide services in another EEA Member State without establishing a physical presence there.  The supervisory responsibilities of financial regulators in relation to credit institutions operating in more than one EEA member state have been set out by the EU in a number of Directives and cover both home and host state regulators.</p><p><b>Notification Process</b></p><p>- A credit institution authorised in Ireland must notify the Central Bank of Ireland if they wish to operate under a passporting arrangement in another EEA Member State. </p><p>- Credit institutions authorised in another EEA Member State must notify their home state regulator if they wish to operate under a passporting arrangement in Ireland. </p><p><b>Role as Home State Regulator</b></p><p>When the Central Bank of Ireland authorises a credit institution it is responsible, as home state regulator, for regulating their activities in other EEA Member States.</p><p><b>Role as Host State Regulator</b></p><p>As host state regulator the Central Bank of Ireland is not responsible for the prudential supervision of Irish branches of credit institutions authorised in other EEA Member States and operating under a passporting arrangement in Ireland except, in co-operation with the home state regulator, for their compliance with liquidity criteria.  The Central Bank of Ireland is responsible for consumer protection issues and compliance with Anti-Money Laundering regulations for the services provided by these entities in Ireland.</p><p>Download our </p><p><b>Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995 (as amended) ('the Act')</b></p><p>Credit institutions operating in Ireland on a branch basis and passporting their services into Ireland must comply with Section 149 of the Act, which provides that you shall not impose or increase a charge for a service provided to a customer or a group of customers, without the prior approval of the Central Bank of Ireland (the 'Central Bank').</p><p>Read further details of this requirement in .</p></reply>

Currently about 59% of all credit unions are subject to lending restrictions. This compares to a corresponding figure of 57% at the end of 2012. Almost all credit unions with a lending restriction in place have a maximum individual loan size restriction. Of the credit unions with lending restrictions, over 67% currently, which compares with 68% at the end of 2012, can lend &euro;20,000 or more to an individual member.</p><p>  2.8% of all credit unions are restricted to issuing loans of less than &euro;10,000 to an individual member. The corresponnding 2012 figure was fewer than 2.5%. Fewer than 1% of all credit unions are currently restricted to issuing loans of less than &euro;5,000 per member, unchanged since 2012. These are the cases where there are more significant concerns in terms of risk to members' savings. </p><p>  For those credit unions where there is an individual loan size restriction in place, the level at which the limit is imposed ensures that the vast majority of those credit unions can continue to make loans significantly greater than the average loan for the sector of just above &euro;6,000. Lending restrictions are, in most cases, intended to be short-term in nature and kept in place until the credit union has addressed the issues giving rise to the particular concerns advised to the credit union. </p><p>  The Registrar of Credit Unions informs me that lending restrictions are reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether they are still set at appropriate levels.    Section 14 of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 provides for the appeal of certain decisions of the Central Bank, including some lending restrictions, to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal.</p></reply>

Following consultation with An Garda Sioch&aacute;na, the Central Bank's investigation has been deferred pending completion of investigations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>Upon presentation of the Final Inspectors' Report on Custom House Capital Ltd (CHC) to the High Court in October 2011, Justice Hogan ordered that CHC be wound up immediately.  It should be noted that copies of the Final Report have been provided to other relevant state authorities for their consideration i.e. the Minister for Justice and Equality, to the Director of Public Prosecutions, to the Director of Corporate Enforcement, to the Revenue Commissioners and to the Garda Commissioner.  </p><p>The Central Bank provides regular updates on Custom House Capital on its website. </p><p>In relation to enhancing the investor protection legislative framework, I can assure the Deputy that the Central Bank has been provided with extensive new powers since the onset of the financial crises to prevent the loss of client assets as occurred in the case of Custom House Capital. The principal developments are set out below:</p><p><b>Client Assets Regime</b></p><p>An independent review of the Regulatory Regime for the Safekeeping of Client Assets was published by the Central Bank in 2012 and is available on the Central Bank website. The Central Bank fully accepted the specific recommendations contained in this independent review and established a process of implementing all of the necessary changes required. In 2013 the Central Bank published on its website a Consultation Paper on Client Assets Regulations and Guidance, which will replace the existing client assets requirements (issued in 2007). The Review set out the following three objectives as the foundation of any client asset protection regime:</p><p>- The maintenance of public confidence in the client asset regime;</p><p>- The mitigation of the risk of misuse of client assets whether as a result of maladministration or fraud; and</p><p>- The provision of a system which in the event of a firm's insolvency will enable the expeditious return of available client assets to the owner at lowest cost.</p><p>It is envisaged that the new rules for the Safekeeping of Client Assets will be in place before the end of the year.</p><p><b>New rules in respect of key management positions </b></p><p>I have already brought forward a very wide range of statutory powers to enable the Central Bank to deal with such an issue across the financial service sector under the Central Bank Reform Act 2010, which sets out a far-reaching regime for the Central Bank to set out and enforce standards of fitness and probity across the financial service sector, including standards of honesty, integrity and ethical judgement, which apply to those in key management positions. The Act provides for sanctions, at the discretion of the Central Bank, of suspension, or even, prohibition orders, following an investigation and due process. In terms of addressing poor management, the code applies similar requirements in respect of skills and experience.  </p><p><b>Enhanced monitoring and enforcement powers for the Central Bank </b></p><p>The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 also sets out a number of new provisions that are relevant. The fitness and probity provisions are reinforced by the whistleblower protections, which place an onus on those performing pre-approval controlled functions to disclose information relating to offences, prescribed contraventions, and breaches of Irish financial services legislation or the destruction of evidence. The Act also provides for the Central Bank to commission, as part of the proper and effective regulation of financial service providers, an independent expert report<b></b>at the cost of the financial service provider. It strengthens the authorised officer regime,<b></b>enables the Central Bank to secure assurances from auditors<b></b>of regulated financial service providers.  It strengthens the enforcement powers<b></b>of the Central Bank through enabling it to apply to the High Court for (i) an order to restrain a party from engaging in conduct that contravenes financial services legislation and (ii) an order for restitution where a person has been unjustly enriched as a result of contravening financial services legislation. It provides for a substantial increase in monetary penalties: for a corporate body, the maximum penalty is increased to the greater of either &euro;10m or 10% of the turnover of the corporate body for its last complete financial year before the finding is made. For an individual, the maximum penalty is increased to &euro;1m. The Central Bank also has the power to suspend or revoke a regulated entity's authorisation following an Inquiry. </p></reply>

These figures refer to licences of up to 1 year and licences of up to 3 months and the current rate of duty on these licences is &euro;505 and &euro;145, respectively. As there is no set licensing year for gaming machines, the numbers above relate only to machines licensed at close of business on 29th May 2014 and do not include recently expired licences which operators may be in the process of renewing. </p><p>  It is not possible to compare the licence fees applicable to gaming machines in the State with those applying in Northern Ireland as the licensing and duty arrangements differ between the two jurisdictions.  In particular, in Northern Ireland the operator pays machine gaming duty which is chargeable on the total net takings from his or her dutiable gaming machines rather than a fixed amount per machine. </p></reply>

I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the balance of the funding, some &euro;8.3m, will be divided among all primary schools that currently operate book rental schemes in 2015 and 2016. These schools are expected to receive &euro;18 per pupil or &euro;20 per pupil in DEIS schools over those two years.  Every primary schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy, will now benefit from the School Book Rental Scheme.</p></reply>

In order to gain ACELS recognition, ELTOs must demonstrate their compliance with ACELS standards, which set out requirements relating to the management of the ELTO, teaching and learning, students welfare, premises and accommodation and other relevant matters. ELTOs are not required to put in place financial bonding arrangements in order to gain ACELS recognition.</p><p>  It should be noted that none of the private colleges which have recently closed had ACELS recognition at the time of their closure.</p><p>  Under the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act, 2012, QQI provides for the introduction of a Code of Practice for the education of international learners, and related International Education Mark.

The Code of Practice will include requirements relating to protection for enrolled learners (PEL), which can include financial bonding in certain circumstances.

It does not receive core funding, however, my Department provides a grant in lieu of tuition fee funding to the College in respect of three approved undergraduate courses.  Whilst there is a cap on the number of students to which such free fees funding applies , the College has not reached that number since its introduction. Funding of 430,000 for the 2013/14 academic year has been allocated to All Hallows.  The ALBA programme referred to by the Deputy is a part-time course and is therefore not an approved course for fee fees funding.</p><p>  A wide ranging reform programme of the higher education system is being implemented arising from the modernisation framework in the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030.  That report recommended that continuing funding support for institutions such as All Hallows, who receive limited public funding for specific programmes, should be a matter for the HEA and subject to ongoing review in the context of quality outcomes, overall demand and available provision within relevant regional clusters.  In their consideration of the limited free fees funding that is allocated to All Hallows, the HEA concluded that existing provision should be continued.  The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for my Department to become involved in issues surrounding courses in one college whilst the overall reform agenda is underway.</p><p>  My Department does not have a role in the placement of students in any third level institution, including All Hallows College, however, I welcome the fact that the college has stated that it intends to wind down in a phased basis in order to facilitate as much as possible the completion of students' studies.</p></reply>

The LEAP programme is a FETAC level 4 programme in information and communications technology.  The course is 30 weeks in duration.

The programmes were due to commence on the 12th of May, however the start day was delayed by two weeks due to insufficient numbers of participants and I understand that a new start date of 16th June has been put in place to allow sufficient time to complete the recruitment process.  In addition to the fact that there are currently insufficient numbers for these programmes, I also understand from CDETB that there are a number of other issues with programme delivery which CDETB is working with the centre in question to address.</p></reply>

My officials have already consulted with school Management Bodies prior to issuing the circular and are currently setting up further meetings with Management Bodies and Parent representative groups to address any concerns which may have arisen since the circular issued.</p><p>  The Government approved an extra 390 SNA posts last December for the period to end-December 2014, which means that there are now almost 11,000 SNAS available to work with children who have an assessed care need in primary, post-primary and special schools.  This means that rather than a reduction of SNA posts, there is provision for a further 309 posts to be allocated to schools to the end of December 2014.</p><p>  In June 2011, the DES published a Value for Money and Policy Review of the SNA scheme.  In May 2013, the NCSE published its Policy Advice on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools.  Both reports concluded that the SNA scheme has been highly successful in supporting the care needs of children with special needs in schools, and with assisting to facilitate their integration and inclusion. However, the reports also concluded that the intended purpose of the scheme was not always generally well understood by parents or schools and that the scope and purpose of the scheme should be clarified for schools.</p><p>  Whereas all SNA allocations are reviewed annually, it should not be assumed that any such review may lead to a reduction in SNA support for individual pupils, or for schools who have pupils who have continuing care needs.  The Circular acknowledges that many pupils will have care needs which may remain constant.  However, the Circular makes clear that whereas supports may be reduced to ensure that pupils who have diminishing care needs can be afforded an opportunity to develop independent living skills, that SNA supports will continue to be provided for those pupils who have ongoing care needs.</p><p>  My Department encourages parents and school authorities to engage locally regarding pupils' education.  Should a parent be dissatisfied with the manner in which SNA supports have been provided to support their child's education they should raise this matter directly with their school Principal or the Board of Management of the school.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.  Implementation of this circular should ensure that children's care needs are better understood so that SNAs can work more effectively to assist children.</p></reply>

Public Servants have made a significant contribution to the fiscal recovery of the State, through a number of measures which have helped to reduce the Public Service gross pay bill from its peak of &euro;17.5 billion in 2009, to an estimated &euro;13.63 billion net of the pension related deduction in 2014.  In this context, reducing the Exchequer Pay Bill has been an important element in reducing public expenditure.  While unprecedented efforts have been made to reduce the cost of the public service pay bill since 2009 through the operation of the Financial Emergency legislation and other measures, pay costs still account for some 29 per cent of current expenditure.</p><p>  The Haddington Road Agreement (HRA), which came into force on 1 July 2013, included a number of measures including pay reductions for those public servants on annual salaries of &euro;65,000 or more under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, 2013.  These measures  provided for a reduction of the public service pay and pensions bill by &euro;1 billion by 2016. It is a three year Agreement covering the period to end June 2016 and forms the basis for current public service pay policy over that period.  Through its provisions, the Agreement is also delivering an unprecedented structural increase of almost 15 million additional working hours annually in the productivity of the Public Service.  That productivity is contributing to the maintenance of our public services at a time of significant resource constraints and is a core enabler for a sustainable reduction in the cost of the public service pay bill. In addition, it is important to note that the measures introduced under Haddington Road provides the scope to recruit additional staff to frontline services, particularly in the Education Sector and the Health Sector.  This is a reform dividend that will help sustain the Public Service Reform agenda by re-investing some of the efficiency savings we are delivering into improved services.</p><p>  Under section 12 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, I must review the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2009-2013 annually and cause a written report of my findings to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  As part of that review I am required to consider whether the measures continue to be necessary having regard to the purposes of the legislation, the revenues of the State and State commitments in respect of public service pay and pensions.  My next such report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas by 30 June 2014.</p></reply>

The criteria and procedures required for an employee to retire on grounds of ill-health are set out in Circular 22/2007: Ill-Health Retirement from the Civil Service.  This Circular sets out the procedures to be followed in a case of ill-health retirement, either on the initiative of the civil servant or of the Department/Office.</p><p>Where a civil servant applies to retire early on the grounds of ill-health he or she must provide the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) with a completed Ill-Health Retirement form along with a medical report detailing his/her diagnosis, treatment and prognosis.  Section 9 of the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956 provides for retirement on grounds of ill-health in circumstances where the civil servant has not tendered his/her resignation.  Where a Department/Office seeks to compulsorily ill-health retire a civil servant, the appropriate authority should refer the matter to the CMO.  The CMO will arrange for the civil servant to be medically examined and may also arrange for an outside specialist opinion if the CMO feels that this would be of benefit.  If the CMO is of the opinion that the civil servant is incapable on medical grounds of regular and effective service and that the situation is likely to be permanent, then the CMO will sign the relevant part of the Ill-Health Retirement form and return the form to the civil servant's Department/Office.</p><p>In all cases, the final decision on whether or not a civil servant is granted ill-health retirement, lies with the relevant appropriate authority having received the advice of the CMO.  This allows management discretion to consider both medical and non-medical matters.  A civil servant whose application for ill-health retirement has been refused, may request that his or her case be referred on appeal to a medical referee.</p><p>Circular 22/07 replaced a previous circular (Circular 7/57: Retirement from the Civil Service on the ground of ill-health) to take account of an amendment made by the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act 2005 to the Civil Service Regulation Act 1957.  The 2005 Act amended the definition of &quot;appropriate authority&quot; under the 1957 Act to streamline management procedures by allowing the heads of Civil Service Departments and Offices to manage middle-ranking and junior staff without reference to Ministers or Government.  Where an officer retires on the grounds of ill health notional service may, at the discretion of the Minister, be added to his/her actual service for the purposes of calculating retirement lump sum and personal pension.</p><p>Initially the provision for &quot;added years&quot; was provided for on an administrative basis during the 1970s as a result of General Agreements.  The provision of added years' service was put on a statutory basis in 1980 (Civil Service Superannuation Regulations 1980, S.I. 188/1980).  There has been no change in the past ten years in pension policy in respect of added years for ill health benefits.</p><p>The following table provides details of the number of ill health retirements in each Department /Office in Civil Service over the past 10 years.<table><tr><th><b>Department</b></th><th><b>Number of Retirees</b></th><th><b>2004</b></th><th><b>2005</b></th><th><b>2006</b></th><th><b>2007</b></th><th><b>2008</b></th><th><b>2009</b></th><th><b>2010</b></th><th><b>2011</b></th><th><b>2012</b></th><th><b>2013</b></th><th><b>2014</b></th></tr><tr><td>Agriculture, Food &amp;amp;

The Regulations came into effect in the majority of Public Service organisations on 31 March 2014 and will come into effect in the Education Sector on 1 September 2014.</p><p>  The new Public Service Sick Leave Scheme as set out in the Regulations allows staff access to paid sick leave for a maximum of 6 months in a rolling four year period, comprising of 3 months on full pay, followed by 3 months on half pay in a rolling one year period.  The Scheme also allows for the granting of Temporary Rehabilitation Remuneration (previously pension rate of pay).  This payment may be paid for up to a maximum period of 18 months generally and only on the basis of a reasonable prospect of return to work by the staff member. It will be calculated on the basis of what an individual would be entitled to if they were to be paid an ill health pension at that time.  A Critical Illness Protocol was also developed with the staff side which provides the basis for access to extended sick leave with pay.  In the event that a staff member is diagnosed with a critical illness or serious physical injury they will be allowed access paid sick leave for a maximum of 12 months in a rolling four year period comprising of 6 months on full pay, followed by 6 months on half pay in a rolling one year period. This was agreed as part of the Labour Court recommendations.</p><p>  The Regulations are being challenged in the High Court in two different cases.  The four Associations representing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Chief Superintendents Association, Superintendents Association, Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and Garda Representative Association) have a joint application for Judicial Review in the High Court in relation to the these Regulations.  The Garda Associations sought an interim Injunction to restrain the application of the Regulations pending the outcome of the Judicial Review hearing.  This application was refused and the main hearing for the Review is scheduled for mid-July.  The Psychiatric Nurses Association have also been given leave to apply for a Judicial Review by the High Court.  As both these cases are being dealt with by the Courts it would be inappropriate at this time to comment further on these matters.</p></reply>

The site actually came  into public ownership following the Irish Church Act of 1869.  The 1869 Irish Church Act held as a premise belief that Churches covered by the Act were to be preserved as National Monuments and not used as places of public worship: Section 25 (1) of the Act vested certain ecclesiastical buildings in the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland on condition that the properties were wholly disused as places of public worship and not suitable for later restoration for that purpose.  The Commissioners of Church Temporalities in Ireland Reports 1869 to 1880, Appendix 7,  lists Skyrne "Ruins of Church and two Stone Crosses"  as one of 107 Churches in the Diocese of Meath that was vested in the ownership of the Commissioners of Public Works for preservation as a National Monument.</p></reply>

Overall net voted expenditure of &euro;43.1 billion was &euro;0.3 billion below the budget profile for 2013. Any overruns in individual Departments were more than offset by savings in other Departments. </p><p>  The expenditure position up to the end of May this year is that total gross expenditure of just under &euro;21.7 billion is 0.6% (&euro;140 million) below profile. The Government is committed to ensuring that our fiscal targets for 2014 are achieved, and in this regard my Department meets regularly with line Departments to review financial management with regular reporting to Government on these matters.</p><p>  Following on from Ireland's successful exit from the Troika programme in December last year, the Government's fiscal target for 2015 is to bring the General Government Deficit below 3% of GDP, in line with our commitments under the Excessive Deficit Procedure. </p><p>  The Comprehensive Review of Expenditure and the Review of Capital Expenditure that are currently in progress will inform discussions in relation to Budget 2015, including Government decisions on the expenditure ceilings for the years ahead, and will underpin decisions on the specific expenditure measures required to meet our fiscal targets for 2015.  Decisions on the Budget will be informed by the up-to-date economic and fiscal outlook at that time. </p><p>  The ongoing delivery of expenditure savings requires a robust public expenditure framework.  The new Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) was first introduced in 2011 and provides for a more effective examination of public expenditure.  The new framework takes account of the experience of a number of other OECD countries who also implemented a MTEF in recent years.  Part III of the Expenditure Report 2014 sets Ireland's public expenditure framework in the context of the international experience, drawing on a number of OECD research papers.  On the reform front, the Public Service Reform Plan (PSRP) 2014-2016 was published in January this year. The development of the plan was led and coordinated by the Reform and Delivery Office in my Department, in collaboration and consultation with key stakeholders across the Public Service. The plan is also informed by best practice in the Public Service in other jurisdictions and in the private sector, where appropriate.</p></reply>

In this context, the Public Service Exchequer Pay Bill has been reduced by 22%, from &euro;17.5 billion gross in 2009 to an estimated &euro;13.6 billion net by the end of 2014.</p><p>  In relation to the Croke Park Agreement, I am satisfied that the Agreement delivered on its objectives, facilitating the delivery of &euro;1.8 billion in cost reductions over its lifetime, a view shared by the Implementation Body in their final report. </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Haddington Road Agreement will facilitate a &euro;1 billion reduction in the Public Service Pay and Pensions Bill by 2016.  That remains the key objective of the Agreement and I am satisfied that the various measures negotiated under the Agreement will deliver on this target.  </p><p>  In 2013, the Public Service Exchequer Pay Bill reduced by &euro;210 million. This reduction was enabled, in part, by the implementation of various measures under the Haddington Road Agreement which helped to ensure that spending remained in line with profile and resulted in Ireland delivering on our fiscal target for 2013. </p><p>  To date, over 75% (&euro;762 million) of the &euro;1 billion savings target has been allocated to the various Votes and other non-Exchequer sources as appropriate, approximately &euro;300 million of which was allocated in 2013 and a further &euro;462 million in 2014.</p><p>  The focus is now on the comprehensive delivery of the Agreement and that task falls to public service management and each Department's Accounting Officer  to deliver the required level of savings to ensure that their respective pay bill targets are met.</p></reply>

While the application of these additional hours varies by sector, depending on local patterns in the demand for services and the scale of ongoing reductions in staff numbers, the additional hours will help to deliver long term and sustainable increases in productivity, while also helping public service management to maintain and indeed improve service delivery against the backdrop of decreasing staff numbers.  The potential benefits of the additional hours are significant.  The additional hours will deliver approximately &euro;430 million, a significant proportion of the &euro;1 billion savings target.  These cash savings will be delivered through reducing the requirement for overtime and agency payments; facilitate reductions in staff numbers and the associated annual paybill cost over the course of the Agreement; and also allow for amendments to the Supervision and Substitution payments in the Education sector.</p><p>  It is essential that public service management continually evaluate new and innovative ways for utlilising the additional hours, including revised rostering arrangements, to ensure that the full potential of this agreement is realised.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-04a.217.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014060400058#WRJ00600"><p>The new Public Service Sick Leave Scheme came into effect from 31 March 2014 for the generality of the Public Service.  The Scheme is set out in the Public Service Management (Sick Leave) Regulations S.I. 124 of 2014 and, generally, applies to all public servants.  The new Sick Leave Scheme was introduced, following the enactment of the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments)(Amendment) Act 2013 by the Oireachtas, to reduce the very high and unsustainable cost of sick leave in the public service.  The new provisions allow staff access to the following paid sick leave:</p><p>- maximum of 92 days on full pay in a rolling one year period;</p><p>- followed by a maximum of 91 days on half pay in a rolling one year period;</p><p>- subject to a maximum of 183 days paid sick leave in a rolling four year period.</p><p>  Temporary Rehabilitation Remuneration (TRR - previously Pension Rate of Pay) can be granted where an individual has exhausted the limits for sick pay provided there is  a realistic prospect of that person returning to work.  The maximum period for which TRR can be paid is 547 days under ordinary sick leave arrangements.  In addition, in order to provide support for public service employees the new Critical Illness Protocol (CIP) was put in place as part the scheme.  This allows an employee, who suffers a critical illness or serious physical injury, access to 12 months of paid sick leave on the same basis as the previous sick leave scheme (i.e. 183 days on full pay in a rolling one year period, followed by 182 days on half pay subject to a maximum of 365 days in a rolling four year period).  In such cases TRR is for also available for 12 months with a further possibility of 2 years depending on the severity of the illness.</p><p>  The need to protect women during pregnancy and ensure that they are not discriminated against was reflected in the design of the new sick leave scheme.  In that context, the public service continues to operate its provisions for pregnancy-related illness in accordance with a European Court of Justice ruling (ref: McKenna case C-191/03) in relation to the application of sick leave provisions to staff who are absent on pregnancy-related sick leave.  This means that a female employee will not be taken off pay while on pregnancy related sick leave.  In addition, the CIP provides specifically for pregnancy-related illness.  Where a pregnancy related illness is serious it will also be covered by the CIP.  One of the criteria for awarding of CIP more generally is 2 consecutive weeks of hospitalisation, however, this requirement is reduced to two days for pregnancy related illness in accordance with Labour Court recommendation (ref: LCR 20667).  Moreover, the provision, which allows management discretion to award CIP, can be used where a woman is very unwell requiring extended sick leave in excess of that available under standard sick leave arrangements due to pregnancy-related illness.  The inclusion of this provision enables management within organisations, on the basis of medical evidence, to provide the additional support available under the CIP where an employee may require access to extended sick leave over and above the normal arrangements on account of pregnancy-related illness.  Pregnancy related illnesses are also discounted for consideration of promotion and higher duty allowances.</p></reply>

This work has not yet commenced but as part of the process, the Property Division of IDA Ireland will firstly assess the potential of the current property stock available in Castlebar.  Following this, they will examine whether this stock matches the expectations and demands from FDI companies and whether constructing any new capacity would be likely to make a difference to the site selection decisions of FDI companies.  In this connection I should point out that under legislation, IDA Ireland is independent in the exercise of its property function.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2014 includes a commitment to develop a framework for a Regional Enterprise Strategy to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprises.

Its aim is to support enterprises to create employment throughout the whole of the country and in all regions.  The 2014 Action Plan for Jobs recognises that regions that support strong and dynamic enterprises are crucial to Ireland's return to overall economic growth.  In this context, the Action Plan contains a number of measures to be taken in 2014 to support competitive regions.  For example, this year, the IDA will commence building new advanced manufacturing facilities in Waterford and Athlone, and office space in Letterkenn, to help cater for FDI projects.</p><p>  The Local Government Reform Act 2014 has introduced wide-ranging reforms to Local Government in Ireland and the reconfigured Regional Assemblies will be tasked with preparing regional Spatial and Economic Strategies which will ensure the coordination of economic and spatial development across the regions and enable Local Government to play a stronger role in economic development in general.  As a core element of the Action Plan for Jobs, my Department has reformed the system for delivery of support to micro and small enterprises by dissolving the County and City Enterprise Boards and replacing them with Local Enterprise Offices within the Local Authority structure.  This reform will help to make the operating environment for businesses more coherent, responsive and conducive to entrepreneurship at local level across the country.  The Action Plan also includes a commitment to develop a framework for a Regional Enterprise Strategy to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprises.  My intention is that the framework will be developed on a pilot basis initially, based on the Midlands region, and focusing, in particular, on co-ordinating the efforts of the agencies under the remit of my own Department &ndash; Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, as well as the new Local Enterprise Offices.  The overarching objective of the framework is to enhance synergies between the agencies, their client companies and other key stakeholders to maximise the potential for job creation in the region.  In addition, many actions under the Entrepreneurship pillar of the Action Plan for Jobs, such as Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Competitive Regional Feasibility Funds, will support enterprise development and job growth at regional level.  The most recent employment data published by the Central Statistics Office show that employment has grown in most regions of the country, year-on-year.  However, we must continue, through the Action Plan for Jobs process, to maximise the job creation potential of all regions.</p></reply>

Under legislation both agencies are independent in the exercise of their property function.  Property solutions to companies who are clients of Enterprise Ireland are also provided by IDA Ireland.  As part of the restructuring of Shannon Development, the enterprise support functions have transferred to IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  This will ensure the continuation of support to both FDI and indigenous enterprises in the region.  In addition, IDA Ireland is in the process of purchasing lands in the National Technology Park in Limerick and the Raheen Business and Technology Park from Shannon Development.  By bringing together the remaining property functions of a restructured Shannon Development with the Shannon Airport Authority under the umbrella of the new Shannon Group, the combination of the airport business with the adjoining industrial property portfolio can provide the region with the capacity to exploit sectoral opportunities and crucially those in the aviation sector.</p><p>  In respect of IDA Ireland, the empirical results of international research has demonstrated that the availability of suitable property solutions is a key element in the location decision making process undertaken by prospective investors in determining where projects will locate.  Most International development agencies with which IDA Ireland competes hold substantial stocks of such properties. </p><p>  In recent years, IDA Ireland has taken the decision to rationalise its non-core land holdings in a number of locations throughout the country.  Land holdings are initially offered to Local Authorities and recent examples of rationalisation of IDA Ireland non-core lands completed include the transfer of lands to Roscommon County Council, Donegal County Council, Wicklow County Council and South Dublin County Council.  In addition, current transfers in legal process include Cork County Council, Leitrim County Council, Wexford County Council and discussions are on-going with Galway County Council, Sligo County Council, Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and Kilkenny County Council.  The Agency has explained that non-core lands which are not required by the Local Authorities are placed on the Open Market for disposal.  IDA Ireland also markets non-core lands and properties directly to stakeholders including; OPW, HSE, Chambers of Commerce, An Post and other similar bodies through active engagement in sharing portfolio information with common objectives.  IDA Ireland keeps its property portfolio under constant review and of course the matter will again be reviewed in the context of the work currently being undertaken on the preparation of a new strategy for the Agency from 2015 onwards.</p></reply>

Section 124 (3) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005, states that &quot;a widow shall be disqualified from receiving a pension if and so long as he or she and any person are cohabiting as husband and wife&quot;.  </p><p>The legal context governing relationships such as marriage is regulated by the Minister for Justice Equality &amp;amp; Law Reform.  Where that legal context changes, the social welfare code is examined for appropriate changes, e.g.  the scheme was introduced for widows on 1<sup>st</sup>January 1936; it was extended to widowers on 28<sup>th</sup>October 1994 and extended to surviving civil partners from 1<sup>st</sup>January 2011.</p><p>Entering into a marriage or civil partnership is, inter alia, a legal act, which confers both rights and obligations on both parties, which do not exist in law between co-habiting couples.  Widows, widowers and surviving civil partners, who become bereaved, therefore, lose someone who had legal duties towards them, and the social welfare code recognises this by providing a pension to them, subject to certain conditions.  </p><p>In terms of income support, social welfare will always provide a safety net for those who most need it.  Supplementary welfare allowance, administered by the community welfare service of the Department, is a means tested weekly payment subject to certain terms and conditions, which provides a basic income support to eligible people whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</p></reply>

The scheme, which is means tested, is available to assist people whose homes are damaged by flooding and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and in some instances structural repair.  Levels of payment under the scheme depend on the relative severity of damage experienced and the household&rsquo;s ability to meet these costs ensuring that the funding is appropriately targeted.  Compensation payments per se are not covered by the scheme.  Humanitarian assistance also does not cover risks that are covered by insurance policies or cover business or commercial losses. </p><p>  As of 26 May 2014, some &euro;430,000 has been paid this year in the Limerick area in respect of over 530 claims under the humanitarian assistance scheme.

This will be achieved by providing:- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and - a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses.  For example:</p><p>- Eircom is rolling out a &euro;400 m investment in a Next Generation Access Fibre Network that offers speeds of up to 100Mbps.  Service is already available to over 800,000 addresses, with planned coverage to reach 1.4 million addresses by 2016. </p><p>- UPC has invested over &euro;500 m in upgrading its cable network.  Over 700,000 homes can already access minimum broadband speeds of 120Mbps and up to 200Mbps.  Businesses can access speeds of 500Mbps. </p><p>- ESB is engaged in a new project allowing a fibre network to be rolled-out on its existing electricity infrastructure.  It is understood that discussions between ESB and Vodafone to form a new Joint Venture Company are at an advanced stage.  The company has initial plans to construct a fibre network directly to 450,000 premises outside of Dublin and it is expected that details will be announced over the coming weeks. </p><p>- Mobile operators have launched 4G high speed mobile broadband services following ComReg&rsquo;s multiband spectrum auction.  There has also been continued investment by all operators in enhancing and broadening 3G services and network improvements. </p><p>- Fixed wireless operators are continuing to invest in high speed point-to-point wireless broadband. </p><p>- The broadcaster Sky has entered the broadband market, increasing choice for consumers.</p><p>Of the estimated 2.3 m premises in Ireland, approximately 1.4 m are expected to be served by these commercial next generation broadband services over the coming years. </p><p>This accelerated roll out of high speed services by the commercial sector means that the addressable area required by the State intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched.  While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns.  The speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. </p><p>On 25 April, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment under the National Broadband Plan.  This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way. </p><p>Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network.  It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users.  The fibre build-out will also ensure that fibre is deployed to strategic locations on each route such as schools, business hubs and health facilities.  The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.</p><p>I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out.  This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the comprehensive mapping process currently underway.  Further locations may be identified as this process continues.  Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention.  Currently I envisage that a total of 108 areas in County Cork will be included in the proposed fibre build-out, including the area of Dromore.  The list is available on my Department's website <i>.</i></p><p>In tandem with the fibre build-out, the Strategy will include measures to respond to aggregated community demand for services, and the provision of access services in the most remote areas where fibre rollout may be insufficient to stimulate commercial investment or may be cost-prohibitive. </p><p>Intensive design work is ongoing in the Department with a view to publishing an end-to-end implementation strategy later this year, together with the outcome of the mapping exercise which will identify the areas that require intervention.  A full public consultation will take place once the strategy is published and EU State Aids clearance will be required for the intervention strategy once finalised.  It is expected that the detailed procurement process will take place in 2015 with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in the areas that require intervention as quickly as possible. </p><p>I fully share the concerns of local representatives about the quality of broadband in rural areas.  I intend to ensure that rural Ireland enjoys similar opportunities to urban areas by ensuring an end-to end market intervention with fibre as a core component.  In committing to a fibre build-out at the heart of this strategy, the Government is acknowledging that broadband is the key infrastructure of the 21<sup>st</sup>century.</p></reply>

The National Smart Metering Programme is a central component of the Government&rsquo;s strategy to enhance management of energy demand, deliver smart networks and enable greater energy efficiency.  It is also aligned with EU obligations on Member States under the Energy Efficiency Directive to progress smart metering.  The national roll-out of Smart Meters has been assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  A major programme of technology and user trials showed that a national rollout of Smart Meters could lead to reductions in overall electricity and gas consumption, as well as an 8.8% reduction in peak-time electricity consumption.  Following the successful completion of these trials by the CER a decision to proceed to the design of the National Smart Metering Programme was taken in 2012.  Subject to completion of the design work, which is currently underway, the building and testing of the smart meters infrastructure and confirmation that the programme continues to be justified on cost/benefit grounds, it is expected that smart meters will be rolled out nationally between 2016 and 2019. </p><p>  The rollout of the National Smart Metering Programme will require legal underpinning.  This will be facilitated either by way of the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Smart Metering) Bill 2014 or, as an alternative, by transposition of the Energy Efficiency Directive.  If the legal basis can be incorporated in the transposition of the Energy Efficiency Directive, this would remove the need for a separate piece of primary legislation.  The optimal legal approach is currently under consideration by my Department in consultation with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office.</p><p>  One of the objectives of the National Smart Metering Programme is to support renewable energy and facilitate wider take up of micro-generation.  To this end, the design of the National Smart Metering Programme will cater for micro generation metering data.  However, the offering of a tariff for micro-generation is a commercial decision for electricity suppliers.</p></reply>

Neither the Building Control Act 1990 nor any regulations made thereunder, including the new Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, place any restriction on whom an owner may assign as a builder once the owner is satisfied that the builder is competent to undertake the works involved.</p><p>An owner who intends to self-build, and who contracts out elements of their work to other parties, must assume legal responsibility for ensuring that the building or works concerned will comply with the requirements of building regulations. </p><p>The reply to Question Nos. 432 and 434 of 4 February 2014 addresses some of the practical considerations that arise for an owner in meeting their obligations as owner and as builder in a self-build situation. An <i>Information Note on Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 and the Self-Build Sector</i>issued by my Department on 26 February 2014 has also been placed in the Oireachtas library.</p><p>The responsibility of the manufacturers of construction products to provide robust and reliable information in relation to the performance characteristics of such products arises from<i><i></i></i><i>Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products and repealing Council Directive 89/106/EEC.</i>In addition, the National Standards Authority of Ireland has also produced additional guidance in respect of some harmonised standards in the form of National Annexes or Standard Recommendations which set out appropriate minimum performance levels for specific intended uses of certain products in Ireland<i>.</i>The key effect of the EU Construction Products Regulations is that since <i>1</i>July 2013, manufacturers of any construction product which is covered by a harmonised European product standard (known collectively as hENs) are required, when placing a product on the market, to make a Declaration of Performance for the product, and to affix the product&rsquo;s CE mark. </p><p>The recent reforms of the arrangements in place for the oversight of building activity will mean that all those along the supply chain, including small quarries and joinery shops, can now expect certification to be sought in relation to the products they carry. </p></reply>

Against this background, I am acutely conscious of the difficulties caused by rising rents and the problem of sourcing suitable accommodation, especially in Dublin and other urban centres. </p><p>The most recent data from the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) Rent Index and from the Daft.ie Rental Report show the extent of rising rents, particularly in Dublin and the major cities. In Dublin, rents for houses increased by 6.4% annually, and for apartments the figure was 8%.</p><p>The fundamental reason behind the rise in rents is a lack of supply. In 2006, some 93,419 housing units were completed across the country, 19,470 of them in Dublin. In 2013, a total of 8,301 homes were completed nationally , with just 1,360 in Dublin. The volume of activity in residential building and construction remains less than half of the volume seen in the year 2000.</p><p>Increasing both public and private housing supply is a critical issue and on 14 May 2014 the Government published <i>Construction 2020</i><i>-</i><i>A Strategy</i><i>for a Renewed Construction Sector</i>. This publication is a blueprint for a properly functioning and sustainable construction sector. It provides for a strategic approach to the provision of housing based on real and measured demand and addresses the full range of relevant issues including the planning process, financing, access to mortgage finance and the construction workforce. As part of the Construction Strategy, the Government is committed to publishing a social housing strategy by the end of the third quarter 2014 which will set out a vision for social housing and identify ways to increase social housing supply over the next 5 years. </p><p>Over half a billion euro in funding is being made available through my Department across a range of housing programmes in 2014 and I expect that in the region of 5,000 social housing units will be provided this year.</p><p>Resolution of the housing supply situation is the key element in restoring stability to the market but I recognise that the provision of additional units of housing takes time. Consequently, I have asked the PRTB to carry out a focused piece of research that will explore options to address the difficulties being experienced in segments of the private rented sector due to rising rents and to report back to me with policy recommendations before the end of June. My goal is to achieve stability and sustainability in the market for the benefit of tenants, landlords and society as a whole.</p></reply>

Under this legislation a tenancy must be registered within one month after the commencement of the tenancy. In all circumstances where the tenancy is being registered more than one month after the commencement of the tenancy an additional fee of &euro;90 is payable for these late registrations.</p><p>  The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 does not provide for any exemptions from the requirement to pay the late fee. As such , the PRTB has no power to waive the late fee in any case regardless of the circumstances or the reasons for the delay.</p><p>  The Residential Tenanci   es (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill 2012, which has passed all stages in the D&aacute;il and is currently before the Seanad, will amend section 137 of the 2004 Act to provide for penalties for late registration on an ascending scale. The purpose of this amendment is both to incentivise early registration and to make the system fairer since under the current provision a landlord who registers a tenancy a year late is subject to the same penalty as a landlord who registers a tenancy a day late. The proposed amendment provides that the late fee will be an additional &euro;20 for each month that the landlord is late registering the tenancy. </p></reply>

Following examination of these submissions, decisions regarding the application of the direct payment regime which takes effect in 2015 were finalised in early 2014. </p><p>  A fundamental premise of the new Basic Payment Scheme and related Schemes is that the redistribution of funds in Ireland should be managed solely through the mechanism of the Internal Convergence Model. This model provides a predictable and effective methodology for the redistribution of funds from those who currently hold high entitlements to those who hold low value entitlements making it possible to provide precise information to farmers regarding the level of support they can expect to receive for the period 2015 to 2019. As applied in Ireland, the model will include a cap on the payment per hectare of &euro;700 by 2019 as well as a guarantee that all entitlements will reach a minimum unit value of 60% of the national average entitlement value by 2019. This model achieves the stated objectives of a gradual phased redistribution of funds in a fair and objective manner. </p><p>  My Department has undertaken an extensive programme designed to make available all relevant information regarding the new Scheme to the farming community including through farmers&rsquo; meetings and the publication of a detailed booklet &lsquo;CAP 2015: An Introduction to Direct Payments&rsquo;.</p></reply>

The purpose of these roundtable discussions with key stakeholders in the beef sector, which includes representatives from IFA, ICMSA, ICSA, MII, Teagasc and Bord Bia, is to reflect on recent developments in the sector and set out a series of actions that will aid viability across the supply chain in light of current market conditions.</p><p>  So far this year there have been two Beef Roundtable Discussions, on 17 April and 3 June.   I believe that all sides agree that these discussions are a worthwhile exercise and the constructive engagement of participants confirms my belief that ongoing dialogue and collaboration, supported by the Government, is essential to improving the interdependent relationship between and producers and processors. The positive outcome of the roundtable discussions is reflected in the various measures announced so far. These include:</p><p>-   the Beef Roundtable discussions will reconvene quarterly to exchange intelligence on market developments and forecasts particularly in relation to supply, demand, prices, product specifications, retail changes etc; </p><p>-   a commitment to launching a &lsquo;Beef Pricewatch&rsquo; online tool to make price information more accessible and free of charge to farmers, </p><p>-   Mr. Michael Dowling, Chairman of the Beef 2020 Activation Group was asked to look at the role that specifications play in the young bull production and prices and to review implementation of the Group&rsquo;s report. His report made a number of recommendations on which I have asked the roundtable participants to reflect and consider. </p><p>-   My Department will prioritise its targeted on-farm capital investments for suckler farmers through the new Rural Development Programme; </p><p>-   Bord Bia has allocated &euro;0.5m to expand and target promotion of Irish beef through its campaigns in the UK and in certain continental markets;</p><p>-   Teagasc will intensify its efforts to enable farmers to maximise on-farm efficiencies through lowering input costs and increasing output value to deliver a better margin for suckler farmers and finishers. This assistance will include advice on adapting productions systems to meet market specifications; &amp;amp;</p><p>-   I have undertaken discussions with my Northern counterpart, Ms Michelle O&rsquo;Neill, on issues relevant to the sector including cross-border trade.</p><p>  The second Roundtable discussions were open and lively and all sides (farmers, meat processors and officials) committed themselves to continuing the process. For the next Roundtable discussions my Department will follow up on improving the Beef Pricewatch information available to farmers as well as examining the role Producer Organisations could play in establishing a better price for beef farmers. </p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that one of my priorities since taking office has been the continued development of the beef sector. The Government&rsquo;s commitment to the primary production in the sector is evidenced by an investment package worth up to &euro;40m to beef farmers in 2014 allied with a number of progressive schemes to be implemented over the lifetime of the new RPD. Taken together with the leadership provided by my roundtable initiative, beef farmers have the necessary supports to enhance the profitability and sustainability of their livestock enterprises.</p><p>  In my view the work following on from the Beef Roundtable discussions taken together with the investment outlined above and further support for beef farmers from the new Rural Development Programme (RDP) will mean that the targets set for the sector in Food Harvest 2020 will be achieved.</p></reply>

The term &lsquo;small farm&rsquo; has different meanings in different countries, so I think it is more meaningful to focus on the distinction between family farms and large-scale corporate farms. </p><p>  In relation to Ireland, the CSO&rsquo;s Census of Agriculture in 2010 showed that there were almost 140,000 farms in Ireland, a decline of only 1% in farm numbers since the previous Census of Agriculture in 2000.  The average farm size in 2010 was 32.7 hectares, and 99.8% of farms were in family ownership.  I am confident that the CAP reform agreement successfully concluded during the Irish Presidency last year will ensure a range of supports for family farming in Ireland and in the EU as a whole.</p><p>  On the global scale, given that there are 500 million family farms in the world, the sustainable development of agricultural productivity on family farms must be a priority if global issues associated with food and nutrition security, poverty and hunger are to be addressed.  In this regard Ireland supports the introduction of policies targeted at family farmers which facilitate access to land, water, finance, and appropriate mechanisms for knowledge and technology transfer.  In particular, as women make up 43% of the global agriculture labour force and their role in family farms is crucial to farm productivity, policies aimed at reducing the gender gap in terms of access to resources and opportunities for women should be prioritised.</p><p>  2014 has been designated as International Year of the Family Farm and events have taken place in Ireland and internationally to highlight the importance of this topic.</p></reply>

This process has already commenced.</p><p>  The National Disability Authority (NDA) facilitated consultations with the Deaf Community in Ireland in 2012 at my request in relation to actions that could make improvements in the lives of deaf people and submissions received from them were considered for inclusion where possible and appropriate in the National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan (NDSIP) which was published in July 2013.  </p><p>  As part of the follow-up to that initiative,  I chaired the first special themed meeting of the National Disability Strategy Implementation Group (NDSIG) on the issue of Irish Sign Language on November 28, 2013.  This meeting brought together representatives of relevant Departments, the NDA, the Deaf Community and other relevant stakeholders with a view to further progressing the implementation of the NDSIP in this regard. </p><p>  The meeting reviewed the current situation across Government Departments and their Agencies with regard to promoting recognition of Irish Sign Language including in service provision and provided the Deaf Community with the opportunity of presenting their experience of interaction with the Public Sector.  It also provided a useful opportunity to examine mechanisms which could promote the further use and recognition of Irish Sign Language and understand practical implications for service users.  Further to this meeting, the Deaf Community prepared a report to reflect their views on key actions and priorities.  This report was submitted for my consideration last month.  The intention is that the recommendations from this report, where practicable, will be reflected in the NDSIP through the incorporation of new actions and related performance indicators and timelines where necessary.  Progress on all relevant actions will then be monitored as part of the Implementation Plan monitoring process.   The focus therefore remains on the identification of mechanisms for the further promotion and recognition of Irish Sign Language with a view to promoting and supporting its use, thereby improving service delivery on the ground, rather than on its designation as an official language. </p><p>  The existing legislation in Ireland gives a level of recognition and practical measures equal to, or above that, in countries which have formally recognised sign language.</p></reply>

An application fee of &euro;175 is payable on application for a certificate of naturalisation and a fee is payable by applicants on the issue of a certificate of naturalisation.  The standard certification fee is &euro;950, while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.  In the case of refugees and stateless persons the certification fee is nil.  The certification fees were last changed in 2008.</p><p>  The standard fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation.  Every application must be assessed to establish if the statutory requirements are met.  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.  I might also add that following the grant of citizenship it is no longer necessary for the person concerned to register their presence in the State with the Garda National Immigration Bureau which requires the payment of a fee of &euro;300 per registration.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware formal citizenship ceremonies have been introduced at no extra cost to applicants.  These have been universally well received by participants as the ceremonies provide a sense of dignity and occasion that serves to underscore the importance to both the State and the applicant of the granting of Irish citizenship.  All of the fees payable under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 are kept under ongoing review by my Department.</p></reply>

In order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has stated that if the deputy in his reference to &ldquo;District Court lodgements&rdquo;, is referring to the fact that cash collections in Court Offices are made just once a week, the position is that the frequency of cash collections in Court Offices has no impact on the timing of family law maintenance payments.  I am informed that the only factors that impact the timing of the issuing of maintenance payments relate to the method of payment by the maintenance debtor and the method of payment to the maintenance creditor.</p><p>  When a payment from a maintenance debtor is received in a court office or electronically via the banking system, it is available for immediate disbursement.  A high percentage of payments are made by way of Bank Standing Order and go directly to the Courts Service Bank Account.  Similarly there is no waiting period in relation to payments received as cash, bank draft or money order.  Where payment from the maintenance debtor is made by way of cheque the position is that there is a holding period of ten working days before the payment can issue.  The holding period commences when the cheque is received and entered in the Courts Accounting System.</p><p>  Where the maintenance creditor has elected for payment by electronic funds transfer (EFT), the payment should be in the creditor's bank account within 2 working days of the payment being receipted by the Courts Service.  In the case where the maintenance creditor has elected for payment by cheque, cheques are issued once a week every Tuesday.  The Courts Service is actively encouraging maintenance creditors to elect for payment by EFT as this is the most efficient method of payment.  At present 94% of family law payments are being made by EFT, with 6% being paid by cheque.</p></reply>

Guidelines regarding family reunification were set out in a policy document published  last December and the intention of these guidelines is to provide greater transparency and more comprehensive and consistent standards in respect of applications where non-EEA nationals seek to come to live in Ireland on the basis of their relationship with an Irish citizen or with another non-EEA national entitled to reside here. The  guidelines are available on the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service website at www.inis.gov.ie.</p><p>  Family reunification policy should strike a fair balance between the sometimes competing interests of the individuals concerned and society in general. </p><p>  One of the key principles underpinning this balance of interests is that family reunification should not cause an undue burden on the public finances. Therefore, in general, the Irish citizen sponsor must be in a position to support such family members by not having been totally or predominantly reliant on State benefits from the Irish State for a continuous period in excess of two years immediately prior to the application and must, over the three year period prior to the application, have earned a cumulative gross income over and above any State benefits of not less than &euro;40,000.  </p><p>  All family reunification applications are dealt with on a case by case basis and it should of course be borne in mind that financial capacity is just one of the conditions that is considered. </p><p>  Finally, policy on family reunification here is broadly in line with that in other EU Member States.</p></reply>

Currently, RIA is providing accommodation for approximately 4,300 persons in 34 centres located in 16 counties throughout the State. All centres are managed by private entities under contract to RIA. Seven of these centres are State owned - that is to say, the land and buildings are owned by the State - while the remaining centres are privately owned.</p><p>  It has been the policy of RIA not to allow political canvassing in centres since its inception and this policy was formalised in 2008 by a RIA circular to centre managers. In 2014, this policy was modified to allow candidates in the then forthcoming local Government elections to drop off election leaflets which could be placed in a common area in the centre where they could be picked up by residents.  Candidates could provide on the leaflets contact details or times of political meetings outside the centre which residents could attend.  The RIA circular stresses the importance of RIA centres operating in a politically neutral environment given the particular nature of the accommodation provided in those centres. </p><p>  This policy reflects a number of factors - the communal nature of the direct provision system, the desirability that they operate in a politically neutral environment, the many practical and logistical difficulties that would arise for centre managers in providing unsupervised access in circumstances where families and children live together. </p><p>  The RIA policy does not breach any national or international legal obligations. No restrictions are being placed on residents&rsquo; voting rights, or on their rights to access whatever information candidates wish to convey to them, or on any rights to meet with candidates, albeit outside centres.  The policy derives solely from the practical issues involved in the particular circumstances of the direct provision system.  The policy is kept under continuous review and, to that end, RIA has invited a number of interested NGO's to submit their views as to how its concerns on the practical issues involved, as outlined in this response, could be reasonably addressed in future local Government elections.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-04a.455.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014060400068#WRT00400"><p>I can advise the deputy that supports available to juveniles and young persons leaving the prison system can arise in a variety of ways under the auspices of the various services provided by my Department.  These include the following: supervision, in the form of community return or community support.  Such supervision is undertaken by the Probation Service; training and rehabilitation within the prison system, for prisoners as a continuing component of their post-release programmes; structured temporary (or early) releases from prison granted for the purpose of undertaking educational and/or training courses or programmes or other rehabilitative opportunities (such as a hostel placement, non-residential placement, participation in a community project, or other support).</p><p>  A wide variety of agencies are involved in all of these areas - both from the statutory and voluntary sectors.  I might also mention that my Department and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operate youth diversion programmes in urban and rural communities throughout the State which are aimed at diverting those at most risk of offending away from crime and thus intervening before the youths concerned end up either under supervision by the Probation Service or in the prison system.</p><p>  While the specific focus of the Deputy's Question is the post-release training and rehabilitative services for persons whose sentences have ended, I should also mention that the Prison Service provides to those in custody a wide range of rehabilitative programmes, which have the dual purpose of providing prisoners with purposeful activity while serving their sentences and encouraging them to lead non-offending lives on release.</p><p>  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015.  There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning through Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes such as education, work training and resettlement programmes.  There is a Guidance Counsellor available to all young persons in prison.  This teacher's role is to make contact with outside schools, informal education centres and community training centres.  In addition he/she will also liaise with guidance services and social welfare services and be in contact with prison linkage groups and Pathways Education Centres.  The Guidance Counsellor advocates on behalf of the prisoner before their release with these educational facilities in the community.  This teacher also liaises with other services working with the prisoner to get the best possible placement available on release.</p><p>  Other areas where there has been significant progress in prison education are in physical education, in the provision of higher education, in the arts and in preparing prisoners for release and supporting their transition to life, and often to education, on the outside.  A top priority for the Irish Prison Service is ensuring help for those with reading and writing problems and peer mentoring programmes are currently active in all of our prisons.</p><p>  As part of a joint initiative between the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service, to address the needs of Young Offenders, education and training specific community return options have been designed for young offenders under the age of 21.  A new approach to structured probation supervision of released young offenders is being implemented.  In addition, the Irish Prison Service fund the GATE service, whose staff are trained career guidance specialists based in the prisons.  Young persons engage with the services Training and Employment Officers (TEO&rsquo;s) as early as possible prior to release.  The GATE Service has been in operation since 2007 and is a joint initiative between the Irish Association for the Social Integration of Offenders (IASIO) and the Irish Prison Service (IPS).</p><p>  Lastly, I would mention that generally, once a person's prison sentence has ended, there is no enduring obligation on that individual to remain in contact with the agencies of my Department.  There are a small number of exceptions to this including sex offenders who may be required to register with their local Garda station and life sentenced prisoners who will be required to remain under supervision by the Probation Service after their release.  However, every effort is made to encourage prisoners to avail of the community supports available.</p></reply>

We did, however, indicate our willingness to consider the matter further after adoption, subject to the instrument being compatible with Irish law and practice.</p><p>  The EIO was recently adopted and it is due to come into force in 2017. In this regard, my Department is engaged in consultations with the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Garda authorities to establish whether Ireland might now be in a position to opt in to the instrument.  Once these consultations have concluded, the question of opting in to the EIO will be further considered.</p><p>  Ireland fully participated in the negotiations on the EIO and, indeed, chaired the negotiations on the proposal with the European Parliament during our Presidency of the Council in 2013.  Ireland raised a number of issues concerning the proposal including the grounds for non-recognition and non-execution of an EIO and, in particular, the absence from those grounds of a dual criminality provision with regard to certain coercive measures.  Finally, it should be noted that Ireland's non-participation in the EIO does not, in any way, affect our rights and obligations to seek and afford mutual legal assistance with reference to existing instruments.</p></reply>

The objective of this scheme is to support early learning in a formal setting in advance of starting school.  I understand that certain flexibilities are built into the scheme in an effort to accommodate children with special needs, such as an overage exemption, or waiver, for children with special needs who do not meet the age criteria and the option to avail of the free pre-school year over two years.</p><p>  The Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the free pre-school year.  However, it works at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This is done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some cases at local level disability services have also facilitated children with disabilities to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible.</p><p>  The HSE&rsquo;s role in supporting children with disabilities involves it working in close co-operation with the disability service providers that it funds, with the education sector, with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and with the parents and families of the children in question.  However, there is a need to strengthen these arrangements.  A dedicated Cross-Sectoral Team, comprising representatives of my Department, the HSE, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs plays a key role in fostering greater collaboration on children&rsquo;s disability issues and to build on the cross-sectoral working arrangements that are already in place.  A sub group of this Cross-Sectoral Team has been set up to examine the issues around the integration of children with disabilities into mainstream pre-school settings, building on previous analysis in this area.  Representatives of the Departments of Health, Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills, the Health Service Executive and of the City and County Childcare Committees are members of this group and it is chaired by the Department of Health.  The issue of supports for children with disabilities in mainstream pre-school settings is being looked by this sub-group.  Within this context I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy in respect of the individual case that he has raised.</p></reply>

The health care service delivery objectives are set out in each year's annual Service Plan which is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p><p>  The senior manager with responsibility for the delivery of the health care service requiring accommodation must be satisfied that (a) the accommodation is required and (b) formally approve a detailed Business Proposal before a Business Case and a Property Transaction Application Form are completed.  In addition, a decision to lease accommodation must deliver value for money and must be guided by The Public Financial Procedures (also known as the Blue Book) which states that 'In the longer term, purchasing will generally tend to provide better value for money than leasing.  Contracting authorities should therefore ensure that, if leasing is to be availed of, the leasing contract to be availed of should be the best that can be concluded in the commercial circumstances obtaining'.</p><p>  The HSE is also engaged in rationalising its property portfolio and is disposing of surplus assets by rescinding leases and selling property which is no longer required for service delivery.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme. There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p><p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p><p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive (HSE), unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations.</p></reply>

In addition to giving employment opportunities, a major objective of the Nurse Graduate scheme is to put in place more cost-effective service delivery arrangements, having regard to the high rates of expenditure on agency staffing and overtime.</p><p>  Under the Haddington Road Agreement it was agreed that participants will be paid 85% of the first point of the new entrant scale in the first year and 90% in the second. Alongside these valuable employment opportunities, those who take up offers will also be able to avail of supported further professional development. The scheme will support the retention of graduate nurses and midwives within the Irish health system and enable them to gain valuable work experience and development opportunities post-graduation.  Participants will have access to a variety of care settings while gaining clinical experience.  Under the Programme, by the end of April 2014 the recruitment of almost 500 graduate nurses was completed.</p><p>  Subject to overall Government policy recruitment of staff is, under the Health Acts, a matter for the HSE.

The Act provides that persons, who are unable to arrange GP services for themselves and family without undue hardship, having regard to their overall financial situation, can qualify for a medical card. The HSE can only award medical cards in accordance with the Health Act and, therefore, it must assess the means and reasonable expenditure of the applicant, and his or her spouse or partner. On this basis, statistical data relating to the condition or illness of applicants is not collated under the Medical Card Scheme.</p><p>  The HSE provides a range of health and personal supports to people with disabilities, including those with Multiple Sclerosis, which incorporate hospital, primary care and community services.  Community services and supports for people with disabilities, including those with Multiple Sclerosis, are provided in a variety of community and residential settings in partnership with service users, their families and carers and are provided directly by the HSE or through a range of voluntary service providers.</p><p>  People with Multiple Sclerosis can benefit from therapy services including Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy, Speech &amp;amp; Language Therapy as well as a range of medical interventions.  The HSE provides assisted living services, including Personal Assistant services, to support individuals to maximise their capacity to live full and independent lives.  People with Multiple Sclerosis may also be eligible for medical / surgical aids &amp;amp; appliances that facilitate and/or maintain mobility and/or functional independence.</p><p>  MS Ireland receives annual funding from the HSE under Section 39 of the Health Act 2004 towards the provision of a range of services at local and national level to those newly diagnosed, carers, children of parents with Multiple Sclerosis and health professionals.  Programmes include physical therapies, symptom management, information / education seminars and a confidential helpline.  In 2013, MS Ireland received funding of &euro;2.56 million from the HSE.</p><p>  The Government is very aware of the public concern in relation to the issue of medical cards. The Cabinet Committee on Health met last week and decided to develop the policy framework governing eligibility in a manner that will also take account of medical conditions   in light of its decision. The process will include the development of a new legislative framework, as necessary. The HSE will establish an expert panel to examine the range of conditions that should be brought into consideration. The Department of Health has also been mandated to develop a policy paper on the further roll-out of GP care free at the point of access in the context of the move to universal health insurance. </p><p>  The Minister for Health will present a Memorandum to Government setting out the next steps.</p></reply>

Under the Health Act 2008, automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons aged 70 and over ended on 31 December 2008.  Under the arrangements effected by the Act, a revised system of assessment for eligibility was introduced for those 70 years of age and over, based on the significantly higher gross income limits rather than the standard net income thresholds. This advantageous arrangement for persons aged over 70 years has facilitated a much greater share of this cohort qualifying for a medical card compared to the general population as a whole.</p><p>  In the main, persons in the over-70s age cohort do not have the same outlays and expenses as those under 70 years of age who are assessed on a means basis. Under the standard  means tested medical card scheme, allowance may be made for rent/mortgage, travel to work and child care costs.  Generally, for the over 70s, mortgages have been cleared, children have been catered for and they would not have travel to work related costs. </p><p>  However, persons aged 70 or older who are assessed as ineligible under the gross income thresholds may also have their eligibility assessed under the means tested medical card scheme where they face particularly high expenses, e.g., nursing home or medication costs. As I have outlined, this assessment is based on net income and assessable outgoing expenses and the qualifying income thresholds under this scheme are lower than over -70s gross income thresholds.  </p><p>  Furthermore, persons aged over 70 years may still be eligible for a medical card where discretion is exercised where they face undue hardship in arranging medical services as a result of medical or social circumstances.</p></reply>

The deficit in the scheme has arisen over the years as the companies and the members did not put enough into the scheme to match the benefits that were expected/promised.  Resolution of the issues will involve contributions from all the parties involved.</p><p>  There are over 5,000 deferred members of the scheme and I do understand their concerns in relation to the funding of the scheme. However, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I have no function in relation to the administration of the IASS.  While I am keen to see a solution, this is primarily a matter for the trustees, the members of the scheme, the companies participating in the scheme and the Pensions Authority, which is the regulator of such pension schemes.</p><p>  Pension schemes are closely regulated under Irish and European pension law and the Pensions Authority is the statutory regulator. There are prescribed procedures and limitations in place governing any reductions in pension rights introduced to address funding difficulties in a scheme such as the IASS. Pensions policy  is primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister for Social Protection, Ms Joan Burton T.D.  The trustees are required by law to act in the best interests of all members: active, deferred or pensioner.  The letter from the trustees to the employers and unions earlier this year concerning amendments to the scheme formally requested them to give appropriate consideration to the position of the deferred members in further discussions.</p><p>  Following consultations between my Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, an Expert Panel was set up to investigate how a resolution of the industrial relations issues relating to the IASS could be resolved.  The Panel is due to make its final report in the next two weeks.  In the course of its deliberations the Panel met with representatives of the deferred pensioners.</p></reply>

The criteria in respect of applications was made clear from the outset.  The Department was seeking to fund high quality, safe, off-road greenway routes that would have the potential to be world class trip attractors.  It was clear from the criteria that successful projects would need to show capacity as a tourism and day trip attraction and, where feasible, as a transport corridor for local use.  A scoring matrix was established to reflect the criteria and all applications received a score out of 100.  A number of projects were selected for site visits and a recommendation for funding was then made by the associated assessment team to me, for the NCN Programme.  The scores attributed to the successful projects were as follows: Galway to Moycullen Greenway (66), Glenbeigh to Cahirciveen (65) and Clonea to Durrow (55).  These projects received &euro;2 million, &euro;3.4 million and &euro;898,000 respectively.</p><p>In relation to the &quot;second round&quot; of funding, I presume the Deputy is referring to the recently announced stimulus package where &euro;10 million was allocated to the delivery of greenways as part of a &euro;200 million national infrastructure package.  The criteria applied to this funding was slightly different as projects were prioritised on the basis of capacity to deliver infrastructure within a short timeframe in order to maximise the stimulus effect.  The River Barrow, Carlow Town to St. Mullins greenway project is considered a good quality project with<i></i>potential to generate economic activity as a local and regional amenity.  I will continue to explore alternative funding streams for such projects given the associated potential.</p><p>It is also worth noting that the EU Structural Funds Programme 2014 to 2020 is currently being finalised and there may be significant opportunities for cycle infrastructure development under Interreg and the Rural Development Programme.  I understand that many local authorities are already positioning themselves to avail of such opportunities.</p></reply>

Directive 36 allows Member States the option that drivers who have passed a test for vehicles of categories C, CE, D, and DE with an automatic transmission to drive vehicles of those categories with a manual transmission, providing that they also have a licence to drive vehicles of categories B, BE, C, CE, C1, C1E, D, D1 or D1E, and that when tested they underwent tests in safe and energy-efficient driving.  Ireland has not adopted this measure, and I have no plans to introduce it.  In regard to the second part of the question, standards for vehicles to be used in driving tests are set out in Annex II of Directive 126, as amended by Directive 36, and transposed into Irish law in the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 537 of 2006), as amended.</p><p>  The regulations provide that, from 30 June 2014, vehicles of categories C and CE must have a transmission of at least eight forward ratios. This is in line with the original text of Directive 126, but more stringent than the amended minimum standards set out in Directive 36.  However, under the Directives, it is open to Member States to adopt as a minimum the standards set out in the amended Directive, or to apply more stringent requirements.  Ireland has chosen to adopt a more stringent position by continuing to apply the minimum eight-ratio requirement.</p></reply>

The objective of this funding is to ensure that previously-funded community facilities remain fit-for-purpose, maintain and improve quality, and to make community services more efficient and sustainable through improving the energy rating of these facilities.  The Early Years Childcare Capital 2014 programme is being administered by Pobal on behalf of my Department. It was a condition of the programme that all groups seeking funding submit their application through the Pobal on-line application facility only.</p><p>  In the guidance documentation provided prior to the commencement of the application process, applicants were advised that, if they were experiencing any difficulties with the on-line process, they should seek assistance from Pobal through a helpdesk e-mail address.  There is no record of the group having sought such assistance.  The group's application for funding is ineligible for consideration on the grounds that their application was not submitted through the Pobal on-line facility within the specified deadline.  More than 220 applications for funding under the programme have been received.  These are currently being assessed.</p></reply>

As part of the ongoing progression of the pre-school quality agenda, it was announced last year that by September 2015 all staff working with children in early years services would have to have a minimum Level 5 qualification on the National Qualifications Framework in early years care and education, or an equivalent qualification.  In addition, by September 2015, Preschool Leaders delivering the free pre-school provision under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme will have to have a minimum Level 6 qualification, or equivalent. It is estimated that over 85% of staff working in the childcare sector already hold a Level 5 or equivalent qualification.</p><p>  In March this year the launch of a Learner Fund to assist existing staff working directly with children in registered early years services to meet the new requirements, was announced. The Fund, which is being administered by Pobal with the help of local City and County Childcare Committees, has a total allocation of &euro;3 million for the years 2014 and 2015 and will be used to subsidise the cost for eligible learners to undertake accredited Level 5 and Level 6 courses.</p><p>  A panel of more than 50 training providers has been approved to deliver the training programmes following the completion of an Expression of Interest process.  The fund closed for applications from staff seeking support under the programme at the end of April.  Over 2,200 staff have applied to the fund.  The cost to staff will be &euro;25 per module with the fund providing the balance of up to &euro;175 per module. The funding available will be sufficient to provide for all the applications on hand.  The applications for support are currently being assessed and training will commence in September this year.</p></reply>
