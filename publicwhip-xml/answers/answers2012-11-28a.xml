The effect of the Preservation Order is that any works affecting these properties require the consent of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, under section 14 of the National Monuments Act 1930, as amended.  The landowner&#8217;s application to my Department for consent to proposals that envisage the retention of the buildings and the provision of a commemorative centre to the 1916 Rising is being examined.  </p><p>  As part of the consent process, the applicant has been asked by my Department to submit an environmental impact statement in relation to the proposal.  This is in accordance with the <i>European Union (Environmental Impact Assessment of Proposed Demolition of National Monuments) Regulations 2012,</i> which Minister Deenihan made in July.  Those Regulations placed additional responsibilities on landowners in respect of monuments protected under the National Monuments Acts.  </p><p>  Following receipt of the environmental impact statement, which has yet to be submitted to my Department, and having completed the prescribed consultation procedures, the Minister will proceed as quickly as possible to undertake a formal environmental impact assessment and to make a decision on the consent application.</p></reply>

Our national cultural institutions are promoting a number of initiatives specifically designed to contribute to the success of The Gathering:</p><p>- The <b>National Museum</b><b>of Ireland </b>is working closely with F&aacute;ilte Ireland to promote the Museum&#8217;s four sites as part of the Gathering. The Museum is also promoting its four sites directly as places where Gathering events from small family reunions up to big marqueed events can take place. The Museum of Country Life is a leading member of the Mayo Gathering Steering Committee and has had direct meetings with Mayo&#8217;s Co-ordinator to ensure the Museum is to the forefront of any formal (and informal) Gathering events in the region.</p><p>- The <b>National Gallery of Ireland</b> will be holding a sustained programme of exhibitions, temporary displays, weekly events such as public lectures and tours to enhance the participation and engagement of visitors to Ireland during The Gathering.  In addition, there will be a number of study mornings, lectures, conferences and symposia that will involve guests from overseas.</p><p>- The <b>Irish Museum of Modern Art </b>is taking significant steps to increase the number<b></b>of foreign visitors of Irish descent visiting the Museum in 2012.  Specific initiatives for The Gathering centre mainly on the promotion of those exhibitions which have the greatest capacity to attract this segment of the market, e.g., the exhibition of the famous <i>Ned Kelly </i>series of paintings by the celebrated Australian artist, Sidney Nolan.</p><p>- The <b>National Library of Ireland </b>  will have a number of events and activities that are relevant to The Gathering e.g. Free Family History advice service: a drop-service free to all visitors to Kildare Street, advising visitors on how to get started on researching their family history.  </p><p>  The Arts Council will also play a key role in funding and developing arts events around the country during 2013 and are in regular contact with F&aacute;ilte Ireland with regard to its contribution to The Gathering.  In particular, the Arts Council provides funding to small arts festivals as well as touring and dissemination of works.  This will ensure that more people around the country &#8211; including, the Minister hopes, many of the visitors for The Gathering &#8211; can experience excellent performances and exhibitions locally.</p><p>  In addition, both the Culture Night and <i>International Celebration of Irish Culture</i> initiatives will also make a significant contribution of The Gathering. The Culture Night initiative has grown into a significant national cultural event, with more than 300,000 people visiting museums, galleries and other across the country in 2011. The International Celebration of Irish Culture is a new initiative based around the St Patrick&#8217;s Day festival, which was well supported this year. Plans are already in hand to develop the concept further in 2013 with a key aim of using the existing St Patrick&#8217;s Festival activity to promote Ireland and its culture, both domestically and internationally.</p><p>  Last September, my Department launched two new websites which aim to highlight these lesser-known sites - national monuments and heritage buildings that are open to the public but which tend to be only visited by those very familiar with the particular area in which they are situated.  It is hoped that the new <b><i>Places to See</i></b> and <b><i>Monuments to Visit</i></b> websites will assist in encouraging tourists to visit locations that might not otherwise be on their itineraries and also assist those of us welcoming relatives and friends from abroad as part of The Gathering next year to be able to identify locations close by that will interest visitors.  Both websites feature easy-to-use digital maps that provide directions to the sites and details of what the visitor can expect to find on arrival. My Department will also continue to co-operate closely with our colleagues in the Office of Public Works (whose role it is to manage national monuments in our ownership or guardianship) to further enhance the tourism value of our built heritage.</p><p>  In an example of inter-agency co-operation, my Department is supporting an initiative planned for 2013 by Mayo County Council under the Government Policy on Architecture 2009-2015 to create an architectural installation in a westerly location in Co Mayo which will be informed by past and present diaspora celebrated by The Gathering of 2013.</p><p>  Finally, the Minister is aware that genealogy is very important in the context of The Gathering, especially for members of the Irish diaspora establishing the details of their Irish family history.  In relation to my Department and the agencies under its auspices, genealogical services are provided by the National Library of Ireland, the National Archives and through my Department's website . My Department and the relevant institutions are currently exploring what improvements could be made to our genealogical offering for of The Gathering.  That work is ongoing.</p></reply>

The National Archives Advisory Council will be retained, with a reduced membership operating <i>pro bono</i>. A single statutory NLI and NMI Advisory Council will operate <i>pro bono</i> in place of the existing boards. Board membership will be reduced overall by some 60%.</p><p>  The NAI will continue to operate, as currently, with a statutorily independent Director, within the ambit of my Department, and a similar model will be put in place for the Directors of the NLI and NMI.  A robust shared services model will be deployed - through my Department in relation to corporate support services and by formal inter-institutional agreement in relation to operational services.</p><p>  A number of meetings have already taken place at senior management level between the NLI, NMI, NAI and my Department to develop detailed implementation plans regarding this shared services model. Communications, procurement, security and marketing are some of the operational areas being discussed by the institutions and it is expected that early savings will be made in these areas, with long-term savings projected in other areas of work.</p><p>  The &#8364;1m savings referred to relates to initial annual savings in reduced administrative costs and fees for all of the rationalisation measures relating to my Department, which were recently agreed by Government.  The expected savings of &#8364;1m do not refer only to board fees of the NMI and NLI, though this will, in itself, be a significant saving over time. It is expected that further savings will be identified as the various cost saving measures across the different national cultural institutions are implemented.</p><p>Full details of all the reform measures agreed by Government in relation to bodies within my Department's ambit can be found on my Department's website at .</p></reply>

The continuing programme reflected the progress of debate on the Bill and the response in Ireland, including the organisation of resistance in Ulster culminating in the signing of the Ulster Covenant on 28 September 1912.</p><p>  The Minister very much appreciates the continuous support and partnership in events of the British Ministers in Northern Ireland and the British Ambassador in Dublin in relation to the commemorations programme. The participation of Mr Hugo Swire, MP &ndash; the NIO Minister at that time &ndash; at the Waterford event to speak from the perspective of Westminster on the achievement of John Redmond was very welcome.  His participation attested to the partnership that will endure in the exploration and presentation of our shared heritage.</p><p>  Minister Deenihan was also very pleased to join with Minister Swire at Belfast City Hall for a discussion of the Ulster Covenant organised by the Presbyterian Church in Ireland.  The special display in the Oireachtas and at Westminster of exhibition panels relating to the Home Rule Bill was a shared initiative with NIO Ministers. In addition to meeting with British Ministers at special commemorations, the Minister meets often with the British Ambassador at annual commemorations and other events arising from his Ministerial responsibilities.</p><p>  Both me and Minister Deenihan met the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr Owen Paterson, MP, on several occasions in the context of matters relating to commemorations. The Minister was pleased to meet the newly appointed Secretary of State, Ms Theresa Villiers, MP, at Glasnevin on 1 October and the new NIO Minister, Mr Mike Penning, MP, in London on 25 October. The Minister will meet again with Minister Penning in Dublin this week.  Our discussions relate to the co-ordination and development of commemorative programmes relating to the shared history of the Decade of Centenaries. Commemorations in the coming years will adhere closely to the timeline of 1912-1922, seeking to enhance the understanding of those historic years.</p><p>  Minister Deenihan very much appreciates too the contributions of the members of the All-Party Oireachtas Consultation Group on Commemorations to the development of an authentic and balanced programme that will deal with all aspects of the cultural, economic and social history of the revolutionary period in Ireland.  Meeting eight times since the commemorative programme commenced in April, the Group has addressed the programme content and particular arrangements for events in the current year along with the development of the commemorative programme for the coming years.  Reflecting the Minister's commitment towards an inclusive approach, he has arranged where possible that significant proposals from institutions and community groups relating to commemorations are presented directly to the Group by the promoters. The Minister has also introduced a special liaison between the Group and the commemorative planning by Dublin City Council in relation to the Centenary of the Rising.</p><p>  The Minister would also acknowledge the high level of engagement regarding commemorations from members of the Northern Ireland Executive, especially Ms Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n, MLA, Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, with whom he and I as Minister of State at the Department, have attended a number of events. It is appropriate also to acknowledge the work of Dr Maurice Manning and the Advisory Group on Commemorations, comprising eminent historians, which he chairs.</p></reply>

These arrangements involve the groups moving to nearby bogs, with the group from Clara Bog having commenced turf cutting at the relocation site in Killeranny, County Offaly, in June last. Progress has also been made with a view to the relocation of qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog special area of conservation in County Kildare in a similar manner. My Department envisages that qualifying turf cutters from Carrownagappul Bog, Curraghlehanagh Bog and Ballynafagh Bog special areas of conservation will be able to commence turf cutting in the relocation sites in the 2013 turf cutting season.</p><p>  24 qualifying turf cutters have been accommodated at the relocation site in Killeranny. It is envisaged that more will be accommodated at the site for the 2013 cutting season.</p><p>  69 applicants for compensation under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme from Carrownagappul Bog special area of conservation, 19 applicants from Curraghlehanagh Bog special area of conservation, and 29 applicants from Ballynafagh Bog special area of conservation have expressed an interest in relocation to non-designated bogs.</p><p>  I am advised that of the remaining 49 raised bog special areas of conservation, potential relocation sites have been identified for a further 30 bogs and work is ongoing on identifying and investigating potential relocation sites. Relocation is unlikely to be required or is likely to be small scale for another 15 raised bog special areas of conservation due, for example, to the small number of turf cutters that have been active on these sites.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that relocation is a very complex process, in terms of investigating suitable sites for turf quality and quantity, the infrastructure/drainage works required, establishing the number who can be accommodated on the site, the cost and feasibility of land purchase or lease, and possible planning and Environmental Impact Assessment requirements. Accordingly, it will only be possible to bring this process to a conclusion over time in respect of all the relocation sites.</p><p>  It is not possible to indicate, therefore, when exactly additional turf cutters can be accommodated at any of these sites over and above the specific cases mentioned above.</p></reply>

Employment in the arts sector embraces a very diverse and broad extent of activities, encompassing those engaged in specific arts practice, as well associated wider elements. The arts and culture sectors continue to offer vital opportunities for the provision of important cultural, social and employment benefits to communities throughout the country.</p><p>  A 2009 by DKM study reported that employment dependent on the arts, culture and creative sectors combined was 170,000, or 8.7% of total employment in the economy. Taking into account economic multipliers, the same study estimated that the value added dependent on the arts, culture and creative sectors was &#8364;11.8 billion, or 7.6% of total GNP.</p><p>  A more recent study by Indecon in 2011 showed that total employment in the wider arts sector, which includes film and video, museums and other cultural activities, literature and publishing, amounted to 21,300 and contributed &#8364;716m (GVA) to the economy in 2010.

Insofar as supports from my Department or agencies under its aegis are concerned, the company is funded by the Arts Council and has also received some support from Culture Ireland in respect of touring activities abroad.   As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is primarily devolved to the Arts Council. The Council is independent in its day-to-day operations, including in relation to its funding decisions. The question of a review of funding for this company does not, therefore, fall within my remit.</p></reply>

I am continuing to work towards this goal with my Department and the agencies within its remit, and I remain committed to securing the best possible level of public funding for the arts sector. </p><p>  The Government appreciates the importance of the arts, culture and the creative industries to both our society and to our economy. I am fully aware of the challenges for those involved in the arts and culture sectors and of the tremendous work they are doing.  I am committed to supporting the essential elements of the arts and culture sectors, within the available financial resources and in the light of the evolving budgetary and Estimates processes. </p><p>  I was pleased to launch the Philanthropy Leverage Initiative in May 2012. This initiative, established with funding of &euro;230,000 for 2012, is designed to encourage philanthropic sponsorship and endowment funding of the arts from private sources. The scheme aims to promote support for the arts from private sources and to unlock 2 to 5 times the funding put up by the taxpayer. The Philanthropy Leverage Initiative has provided an incentive to arts organisations to proactively seek new and multi-annual relationships with sponsors which deliver private sector financial support, thereby increasing overall funding available to the arts.  Applications for the initiative were made across projects of varying scale, geography and art forms. The Leverage Initiative will run in parallel with a second initiative &ndash; the Philanthropy Capacity Building Initiative &ndash; which is operated by the Arts Council.  </p><p>  A conference on Philanthropy and the Arts, which I hosted recently at Smock Alley Theatre, was a huge success and I will follow up on that initiative again next year. </p></reply>

The progress achieved on these dossiers has been the focus of much of the work of the preceding Trio Presidencies, Poland, Denmark and Cyprus.  It is my intention to pursue these issues to successful conclusions within the limitations of time, budgets procedures and activities in other EU Institutions. The key priorities on the Council's Culture agenda are Creative Europe, Europe for Citizens, Europe Cities of Culture and Europeana. </p><p>  The Culture Programme for the EU Presidency, which will embrace international and national elements, is being co-ordinated and planned by my Department in conjunction with the Arts Council and other partners. I am confident that, through the diverse and comprehensive range of activities planned across Ireland, in Brussels, Paris, Berlin and throughout Europe, that Ireland's reputation as a progressive, imaginative and innovative nation within the arts, culture and heritage spheres will be further enhanced and consolidated.</p><p>  I should also say that I am acutely aware of the importance of the contribution of the country&rsquo;s genealogy resources to the country&rsquo;s overall cultural policy. In this regard, I will shortly be bringing a memorandum to Government setting out my proposals in this area. In the context of Ireland's Presidency of the European Union, I will be anxious to avail of every opportunity to exploit our county's rich genealogical heritage in engaging with our European neighbours. These plans will also be of benefit in relation to the ongoing arrangements for The Gathering.</p></reply>

A single statutory NLI and NMI Advisory Council will operate <i>pro bono</i>  in place of the existing boards. Board membership will be reduced overall by some 60%.  It is anticipated that this model will achieve significant savings and increase efficiencies across the institutions. The NLI and NMI will operate with statutorily independent Directors. A robust shared services model will be deployed - through my Department in relation to corporate support services and by formal inter-institutional agreement in relation to operational services. </p><p>  It is my intention to make clear statutory provision for the independent status of the Director of the NLI and the Director of the NMI. Issues such as the status of staff (whether as civil or public servants) and related administrative matters will be pursued at the appropriate time with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the institutions and relevant staff associations/unions. </p><p>  These reforms will, I believe, lead to significant efficiencies for both institutions and will improve their ability to programme events, exhibitions and other activities of interest to cultural tourists.</p><p>  The Government has also agreed a range of reforms in relation to our national galleries under the Public Service Reform Plan.  In relation to the National Gallery of Ireland, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and Crawford Art Gallery, the reform actions include:</p><p>- the boards of the three institutions to be scaled back to a maximum of 9 members each, including the Chair, with all to operate on a <i>pro bono</i>   basis; and</p><p>-   the three institutions to implement an agreed range of corporate support and operational shared services.</p><p>  I believe that these reforms will help the institutions to run more efficiently, provide a better service to the public in the new and challenging environment that they must operate in and better equip them to raise funds independently of Government.  </p><p>  Ireland has an impressive cultural offering and I wish to equip our organisations with the skills and structures they need in the challenging times ahead. I am pleased too to acknowledge the crucial importance of all of our national cultural institutions as custodians of Irish culture and history.</p></reply>

I have made clear, both on this occasion and in previous discussions with the Israeli authorities and at EU level, that Israel&rsquo;s right to defend itself &ndash; which I fully accept &ndash; cannot be exercised in disregard of the rights of others, and must respect the principles of international law.</p><p>  Ireland has consistently sought, both in discussions at EU level and bilaterally in the region, to ensure that the ongoing problems of Gaza are not lost sight of in the many competing issues and crises in the Middle East. I have continually stressed that the blockade of Gaza, as currently operated, is both unjust and counterproductive, and impacts particularly on the ordinary people of Gaza. Prominent among these damaging effects is the maintenance of a de facto exclusion zone of between 500 metres and a kilometre on the Gaza side of the security fence, in which Palestinian residents will be fired on if they enter. The object of this exclusion zone is to make it more difficult for militants in Gaza to attack Israeli forces on the border, but it has the very serious effect of rendering some 17% of the very scarce agricultural land of Gaza unusable. Similar measures have restricted Gaza&rsquo;s small fishing fleet to a fraction of the available waters, from which fish stocks have now been almost entirely depleted. </p><p>  These measures, coupled with general economic collapse caused by the blockade, have resulted in a large proportion of Gaza&rsquo;s population being dependent on direct food aid from the United Nations Relief and Works Administration, to which Ireland is a significant contributor. Despite this massive and costly relief, instances of malnutrition nonetheless still occur.</p><p>  I will continue to strongly argue for the easing of these damaging measures. I welcome the fact that the recent understanding on a renewed ceasefire in Gaza has included provision for active discussion of these issues, linked to a lasting cessation of attacks on Israel from Gaza. I have been pleased to note some early indications &ndash; small but potentially important &ndash; of a relaxation in the regime of restrictions on both fishermen and farmers in the border strip.</p></reply>

Catering supplied by small pubs is liable to VAT at the 9% VAT rate, as it is where supplied by a restaurant.  Similarly, alcohol supplied by a small pub is liable to VAT at the standard VAT rate of 23%, the same as if it was supplied by a hotel, restaurant or larger pub.  With regard to expanding the 9% rate to include the supply of alcohol by small pubs, the VAT rating of goods and services is constrained by the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.

My officials and the banks have provided a very significant level of detail on remuneration and pensions in the Covered Banks and other institutions in tight timeframes.   We have received over 50 Parliamentary Questions on these topics alone in the past few weeks.  The further more detailed information sought in this question is not available to my Department at the present time and the compilation of this information, is likely to delay completion of the Mercer Remuneration Report which is a Government priority. I have committed to publishing the details underpinning the review in view of the public interest in the matter.  The report will provide a comprehensive and professional analysis of remuneration structures and levels across the Covered Banks both now and before the onset of the banking crisis.

Officials of my Department and of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform continue to engage with third-party investors on how investment deals could be structured to facilitate the provision of funding for new infrastructure projects.  With regard to tax-based incentives for investment in the economy, pension fund investments should be executed at a level of return comparable to that earned by other investors accepting the same level of investment risk.

The VAT rating of goods and services is constrained by the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Defibrillators, other than implantable defibrillators, are liable to VAT at the standard rate of 23%. Parts or accessories are also liable to VAT at the standard rate. </p><p>  There is no provision in VAT law that would make it possible to apply a reduced rate or zero rate to the supply of such products. Under the EU VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rate on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services. In addition, Member States may only apply a reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the VAT Directive. While Annex III does include the supply of medical equipment for the exclusive personal use of a disabled person, it does not include defibrillators for general use. In this regard, a reduced rate cannot be applied to the supply of defibrillators. Therefore the only rate of VAT that can apply to the supply of defibrillators is the standard VAT rate of 23%.</p><p>  It is not possible to provide the number of submissions received which relate to VAT on defibrillators, as many of the submissions and representations received relate to a variety of issues.</p></reply>

The repair and maintenance of movable goods, such as motor vehicles, is subject to VAT at the 13.5% rate and it is not possible to reduce the VAT rate applying to such repairs servicing below 12%.  This is because such repairs, including many of the goods and services to which Ireland applies a reduced rate of VAT, are based on an EU derogation under Article 118 of the EU VAT Directive, which provides that as we applied a reduced rate to these items on 1 January 1991, we are entitled to continue to apply that reduced rate to those items, provided the rate is no less than 12%.  Furthermore, while is it possible to reduce the VAT rate on repairs and servicing to 12%, this could only be done through the application of a 12% VAT rate to all goods and services that currently apply at the 13.5%, and such a move would be very costly to the Exchequer.  However, it must be noted that in the majority of EU Member States, where the derogation under Article 118 does not apply, repair and servicing is subject to a higher VAT rate.   With regard to removing VAT on the supply of service and repair work undertaken by tax compliant businesses, the EU VAT Directive does not allow for such a distinction between taxpayers, and in any case, it is not possible to remove the VAT on such supplies.  Furthermore, the enforcement of tax law through tax reductions is not an advisable policy, especially in the current economic climate.  The black economy in the construction sector is dealt with, and should continue to be dealt with, through ongoing enforcement procedures by the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

Both banks were required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion this year and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks achieved their 2011 targets. The Head of the Credit Review Office (CRO), Mr John Trethowan, stated in his recently published ninth quarterly report that "&euro;3.5bn of sanctions for each bank is a very challenging target, however the remaining five months typically show more lending activity and I am of the view that, after a slow start to the year, the targets will be a challenge but still may be achieved."  As the Deputy may be aware, one of the key priorities of the Programme for Government is to ensure that an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs in the real economy during the restructuring and downsizing programme. The Economic Management Council meets the banks on a regular basis and discusses the key issues pertaining to this priority.</p><p>  The banks have not been requested to report to my Department on the specific breakdown between new and increased lending. The important thing from a policy perspective is whether the additional credit is available to the SME customer, not whether they are a new or existing customer. I should say that this information would be commercially sensitive and I would not be able to release it to the Deputy even if it was to hand.</p><p>  Mr Trethowan in his ninth report provided information on what is included in the figures reported to the CRO and my Department. This report is available at .</p><p>  He says that Loan Sanctions i.e. total amount made available includes</p><p>  &ldquo;(i) Loans sanctioned but not yet drawn or utilised e.g. overdrafts are typically only @40% utilized, (ii) contingent liabilities? to support trade, such as letters of credit for exporters and performance bonds for certain contracts. These only become drawn balances if the transaction defaults, (iii) restructuring activities without which many more businesses would have failed&rdquo;. Therefore a new facility would be included as new lending.</p><p>  It is vital that the banks continue to make credit available to support economic recovery and I would advise any SME who is refused credit to seek an internal review and go to the Credit Review Office if necessary. However, it is not in the interest of the banks, businesses or the economy for finance to be provided unless the business is viable and has the capacity to meet the interest payments and repay the sum borrowed.</p></reply>

There has been continued close engagement with the EIB since President Werner Hoyer&rsquo;s visit in July when he met with the Taoiseach as well as the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and myself. This visit led to the establishment of a Joint High-Level Working Group between my Department and the EIB to enable close collaboration on projects aimed at expanding the Irish economy and supporting growth.</p><p>  These discussions have culminated in the announcement today of EUR 375m in part-funding for various projects, as follows: </p><p>(i) Irish Water Investment Programme (Dept of Environment, Community and Local Government) - EUR 60m</p><p>(ii) Bord Gais onshore wind farms EUR 155m</p><p>(iii) SME/midcaps Financing for AIB - EUR 100m</p><p>(iv) Risk Sharing Instrument (RSI) for SME/midcaps in innovative sectors of the economy EUR AIB EUR 60m.</p><p>  I recently met with President Hoyer on the margins of ECOFIN, where it was agreed to progress a number of other projects across several sectors during the coming months.

Decisions on the funding arrangements for those projects are primarily the responsibility of individual Departments, in consultation with the National Development Finance Agency.

Similarly, the forecasts also assume a &#8364;25 million cash payment in respect of the EBS Promissory Note next year. These payments are part of the estimate of Exchequer non-voted capital expenditure, as set out in table 3.3 on page 26 of the MTFS.  The Deputy should also be aware that tables 4a and 4b on pages 92 and 93 respectively of the MTFS show the current schedule with regard to Promissory Note payments out to 2031 as well as the impact on the General Government Balance (GGB) of the initial principal sum of &#8364;30.85 billion and accrued interest. The 2013 GGB forecast, as per the MTFS, of -7.5 per cent of GDP makes allowance for some &#8364;1.9 billion or 1.1 per cent of GDP in accrued interest on the Promissory Notes in 2013. This has a significant negative impact on the GGB next year.</p><p>  National debt stood at &#8364;136.8 billion at end-October 2012. As regards payments for banking recapitalisation which affected the National debt, the following is the position: </p><p>  - In 2009, the Exchequer injected &#8364;4 billion into Anglo Irish Bank. </p><p>  - In 2010, the Exchequer provided, by way of Special Investment Shares (SIS), &#8364;625 million to EBS and a further &#8364;100 million to INBS.</p><p>  - In 2011, the Exchequer funded the first of the Promissory Notes payments to IBRC (formerly Anglo Irish Bank and INBS) and EBS. These amounted to &#8364;3,060 million and &#8364;25 million respectively. The Exchequer also provided a net &#8364;6.5 billion towards the recapitalisation of Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Irish Life and Permanent (ILP) in July 2011.</p><p>  - In 2012, the Exchequer funded the second &#8364;25 million instalment of the EBS Promissory Note. It also funded the &#8364;1.3 billion acquisition of Irish Life Limited from ILP. Finally the bond issued to settle the 2012 IBRC Promissory Note also added to National debt this year.</p><p>  Table 4.2 on page 35 of the MTFS sets out the latest projections for national debt interest expenditure in 2013. As regards interest resulting from banking recapitalisation costs, it is generally the case that no specific tranches of borrowing were undertaken solely for the purpose of recapitalising the banking sector. Therefore it is not possible to accurately quantify that part of national debt interest that relates to borrowing undertaken to recapitalise the banks. The Deputy should be aware that the Exchequer is funded by tax revenue, non-tax revenue and capital resources as well as by borrowings.</p></reply>

The Commission on Credit Unions was established to review the future of the credit union movement and to make recommendations in relation to the most effective regulatory structure for the sector.  The Commission took into account credit unions&rsquo; not-for-profit mandate, their volunteer ethos and community focus, while paying due regard to the need to fully protect depositors&rsquo; savings and financial stability.  The Commission recognised that credit unions aim to provide for the economic and social goals of members and wider local communities.  The Commission noted that credit unions are niche players in the retail financial services industry and that there is an opportunity for the development of services by credit unions as a mutual alternative to the two pillar banks. </p><p>  Section 48 of the Credit Union Act 1997 facilitates the provision of additional services to members.  This section provides for an application process whereby credit unions may apply to the Central Bank to be allowed to provide additional services.  Some services are exempted from this process and can be provided by credit unions at present.  These include ATM services, money transfers and third party payments.</p><p>  The Commission on Credit Unions recommended that a new regime for the provision of additional services should be developed within the context of the tiered regulatory approach set out the Report.  Credit unions in Tier 1 would be able to provide certain exempted additional services, while tier 2 and 3 would be able to offer a larger range of services.  Under the Credit Union Bill 2012, the Central Bank will be able to exempt certain services from the additional services requirements set out under section 48.  The Bill also provides that decisions to provide new services can be taken by the board of directors, rather than having to be decided at a general meeting of the members.  Section 48 (7) as amended by the Bill provides that the Bank may set out the requirements that credit unions would need to comply with in relation to the provision of certain services. </p><p>  Credit unions already have access to payments infrastructure, via providers such as BOI, AIB and BNP.  I am aware that the Irish League of Credit Unions is seeking to enter this market on a commercial basis via its Credit Union Service Organisation for Payments (CUSOP) project.</p><p>  The latest ILCU Annual Report sets out the details of this project, which requires authorisation from the Central Bank.  However, this is a commercial project from ILCU and credit unions will have to decide for themselves whether to get involved.</p><p>  I do not propose to comment on matters of a commercial nature such as this given that it is subject to authorisation by the Central Bank.</p></reply>

Following completion of Second Stage, the Bill has been referred to the Select Sub-committee on Education and Skills.</p><p>  The Bill provides for 18 person boards consisting of 10 local authority members, 2 staff representatives, 2 parents' representatives and 4 community representatives.  Where more than one local authority elects members to an education and training board, the numbers to be elected by each local authority will be specified by Ministerial order which will be made having regard to population.  This is considered to be the most appropriate and fair way to devise the proportions in which each local authority will be represented on the new bodies.  It is intended that staff representatives on the board will be elected by members of staff of the education and training board and that parent and community representatives will be nominated by the relevant bodies.  The chairperson will be elected by the members of the board.</p><p>  The establishment of education and training boards will position the sector to support the evolution of service delivery not just in schools under the direct governance of a board but in the wider education sector.  The new boards will be well positioned to establish shared services and to provide support services to all schools, including primary schools and other second level schools in their areas.  In particular, education and training boards can contribute significantly to driving an agenda of encouraging aggregated procurement of supplies and services.</p></reply>

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.</p><p>  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act 1998. In this regard a board of management may deem it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular age group or to children living in a particular area or on the basis of some other criterion. Some schools use parish or other boundaries for this purpose. </p><p>  The selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based is matter for the individual school authority. In formulating an enrolment policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful and applied fairly to all applicants.</p><p>  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department. </p><p>  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that last year, I launched a discussion paper on school enrolment. The &quot;Discussion Paper on a Regulatory Framework for School Enrolment&quot; contains suggestions on how to make the process of enrolling in schools more open, equitable and consistent. </p><p>  I invited education partners and interested parties to submit their views to my Department by the 28th of October last year. The feedback from this consultation will help inform the nature and scope of a new regulatory framework for school enrolment. </p></reply>

The purpose of the report was to identify possible new structures to improve initial teacher education in Ireland so that it is comparable with the best in the world.</p><p>  The international panel of education experts recommended that teacher education be provided in six &quot;centres for teacher education&quot;.  Currently there are 19 state funded providers of ITE (and three non-state funded) offering more than 40 college programmes in primary and post-primary teaching.  The new collaborations recommended by the international panel will mean that there will be a smaller number of centres for ITE offering education across multiple sectors from early childhood to primary, to post primary to adult education.  These centres for teacher education will also possess a critical mass in terms of research capacity which is not always possible in smaller institutions.</p><p>  The HEA has been requested to consult with the relevant parties and to prepare a detailed plan on how to implement the recommendations of the Panel.  I understand that this process has started and a plan is expected by the end of the year.</p><p>  I will consider the implementation plan from the HEA when received and a further announcement will be made at that stage.</p></reply>

Its aim is to promote reconciliation and to help to build a more peaceful and stable society in Northern Ireland and the border region of Ireland.</p><p>PEACE III is managed by the Special EU Programmes Body and is subject to the European  Union<font color="#000080"> </font>  regulations governing structural funds.</p><p>  Under EU rules, PEACE III programme funds must be committed by the end of 2013 and project expenditure must be completed during 2015 at the latest for programme closure. Each project will have a timeframe agreed in its Letter of Offer so while some projects have already completed expenditure, others are ongoing and some will still be spending in 2014 and 2015.  SEUPB works closely with all project holders in receipt of PEACE III funding to ensure that their objectives are completed within the timeframe outlined and agreed in their conditions of grant.</p><p>  The next round of EU Structural Funds will cover the 2014-2020 period and negotiations on the Commission&#8217;s legislative package are currently under way.  In fact, we will be seeking to make substantial progress on the Cohesion dossier during our Presidency.</p><p>  I am continuing to press for a new PEACE Programme for the 2014-2020 period.   However, the support of the UK Government and the EU Institutions (Commission, Council and Parliament) will be required.  If a PEACE IV programme is agreed, there will be an overlap period between PEACE III and PEACE IV in 2014 and 2015, where some projects continue to have activity and expenditure under PEACE III, and PEACE IV projects are commencing.  This position pertains to all EU Structural and Cohesion programmes and transitional provisions are  included in the regulations.</p></reply>

Ireland does not ratify international Conventions until any such necessary amendments to domestic legislation have been identified and effected. </p><p>  A preliminary assessment of the implications of ratifying the International Labour Organisation&rsquo;s Convention 189 on Domestic Workers is currently being finalised by my Department.  The Assessment includes an Article-by-Article examination of the extent to which Domestic legislation provisions already provide for the Rights and Entitlements enunciated in each Article, as well as the extent to which any legislative amendments will be required.  This assessment will then be forwarded to the Office of the Attorney General for their examination. </p><p>  My officials have been in contact with EU Commission officials and I am aware that they are in the process of issuing a document to all its members in relation to the ratification of the Convention.  I have asked the Commission to provide me with this document when it is available.</p><p>  It is important, to note, however, that domestic workers are protected by virtue of the fact that the full suite of employment rights legislation, including that of redress for violations of their employment rights, apply to domestic workers in the same way as they apply to other categories of employees in Ireland.  Also it is worth pointing out that NERA has carried out a programme of inspections involving Domestic Workers as well as continuing to respond to any complaints it receives from Domestic Workers.</p><p>  A voluntary Code of Practice for Persons Employed in Other People&rsquo;s Homes was developed under the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  The Code sets out certain employment rights and practices for persons employed in other people&rsquo;s homes and encourages good practice and compliance with the law in such employment situations.  In any proceedings before a court, or a workplace relations dispute resolution body, a code of practice shall be admissible in evidence and any provision of the code which appears to the court, body or officer concerned to be relevant to any question arising in the proceedings shall be taken into account in determining that question.</p></reply>

Applications for renewal may also be considered in respect of non-EEA nationals already legally resident in the State on a valid employment permit.  In addition it appeared on the basis of documentation provided in support of this application that more than 60 days lapsed since the position was advertised in national newspapers.  Finally, no evidence of advertisements in respect of the post in a local newspaper was provided. </p><p>  With regard to the point made about the lack of time afforded to the applicant to prepare an appeal, my officials inform me that the notice of refusal was incorrectly dated.

Increasingly, referral is now based on profiling people at the beginning of a spell of unemployment, so as to focus resources on those most in need at an even earlier stage. </p><p>  By definition, such an approach focuses resources on those areas where unemployment is highest and of longest duration. The roll-out of the profiling system at my Department&rsquo;s &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; Intreo offices will further enhance this effect as one of the main variables in the profiling system is geographical location. In other words, if someone comes from an area of high unemployment, s/he will, all other things being equal, receive more targeted assistance.</p><p>  In addition, the geographical distribution of places on employment programmes such as CE and T&uacute;s &amp; training programmes has been highly correlated with unemployment rates for each region. Within the T&uacute;s programme there is a specific area-based approach to the allocation of places. The 5,000 places on the scheme are allocated to community and voluntary organisations involved in the delivery of local services in urban and rural areas. The allocation is based on the numbers of eligible unemployed people in each local development company or &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta area.  </p><p>  Other than through administrative mechanisms like those described, it is difficult to identify and target specific unemployment black spots at a very local level. The most frequent unemployment data come from the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS); as a sample survey, the QNHS provides reliable data at a regional, but not at a local level. Small-area statistics are collected in the Census, but these are available only at five-year intervals, and the unemployment concept underlying them does not correspond exactly with that used in the QNHS.  </p><p>  However, the Government&rsquo;s policy of targeting resources at those most at risk of long-term unemployment overcomes this statistical deficit and ensures those areas that are most in need of assistance are prioritised. My Department works primarily at a local level and is acutely aware of the differentiated impact of unemployment across local areas. The Department has 59 local offices, 63 branch offices and newly incorporated employment offices. The Live Register figures by office are closely monitored and are an important consideration for the provision of our activation services.</p></reply>

Within those categories, those waiting the longest will be processed first.  </p><p>  While it is not possible to clear all claims in the backlog before Christmas, every effort will be made to pay as many eligible claims as possible in that timeframe.  It is expected that the backlog will be fully eliminated by the end of March 2013.

The approach differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice. The first two elements involve the enhancement of the website <i></i> and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline within the Citizens Information Board (CIB) both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears. There are strong linkages between this service, the MABS and other areas of the CIB, as envisaged by the Keane report, to ensure the development of a seamless service for the public.</p><p>  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders. This advice will be provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.</p><p>  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender will advise the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &#8364;250 to an accountant of the borrower&#8217;s choosing for the provision of this advice.</p><p>  An operating protocol for the provision of this advice has been agreed between the main accountancy bodies and the lenders. The general scope of the advice will be limited to the borrower&#8217;s principal private residence. </p><p>  To date, some 2,700 accountants have confirmed to their accounting body that they wish to be part of the panel and their details are now listed on a county by county basis on the website <i></i> .</p><p>  The Personal Insolvency Bill provides for a Debt Relief Notice for persons with no assets or income with unsecured debts of up to &#8364;20,000. With the assistance of an approved intermediary, a person may apply for a Debt Relief Notice which will allow for the full write-off of qualifying unsecured debt after a three year supervision period.<b></b>The Citizens Information Board, which has the statutory responsibility for MABS has<font color="#4181C0"> </font>  agreed to my request that MABS be an approved intermediary for the purpose of processing applications for Debt Relief Notices.

The 2008 downturn in the financial markets put in excess of 90% of DB schemes into an underfunded position, and while there has been some recovery since in the markets, the situation is still volatile and many schemes remain in a difficult funding position.  These schemes face serious challenges in restoring their funding levels to enable the scheme deliver on the pension promise.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s Funding Standard provides a benchmark against which the &lsquo;health&rsquo; of a scheme can be tested and is the regulatory mechanism for ensuring that a scheme can live up to the promised level of pension benefits.  If the scheme does not satisfy the funding standard the trustees of the scheme must prepare a funding proposal to restore scheme funding within a three year period.  The Pensions Board recently revised the timeframe for DB schemes with funding deficits to submit funding proposals to the Board.  This decision was made to allow trustees additional time to fully explore all options available to address scheme funding deficits.  Trustees of all schemes required to submit funding proposals will now have until 30 June 2013 to submit their proposal to the Board.    </p><p>  In relation to the wind-up of schemes, my Department is currently finalising a review of Section 48 of the Pensions Act (commonly referred to as the &lsquo;Priority Order&rsquo;).  The objective of the review is to determine to what extent, if any, the provisions of Section 48 might be revised to provide for a different approach to the distribution of assets in the wind up of an underfunded scheme.   </p><p>  On a more general note, in an effort to help schemes better match their liabilities, legislation to enable the issuing of sovereign annuities has been introduced to provide pension schemes with an additional option, not previously available to trustees. The NTMA have issued just over one billion of sovereign amortising bonds to pension schemes to date. Pension schemes that purchase sovereign annuities or the underlying bonds will benefit from a reduction in their liabilities under the Funding Standard to the extent that they actually make those purchases.  The nominated bonds underpinning these annuity policies can also be bought by investors or by pension scheme trustees who wish to pay pensions directly from the pension fund.</p></reply>

This additional evidence, along with the original information, was evaluated by a different medical assessor who expressed the opinion that the person concerned does not satisfy the medical criteria.    The deciding officer confirmed the original decision and notified the claimant of the outcome on 08 June 2012, advising him of his right to appeal the decision to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.  </p><p>  The person concerned has appealed the decision and submitted further medical evidence which is currently with the medical assessor to further review his medical eligibility for invalidity pension.</p><p>  If following this review, it is decided that he still does not satisfy the medical criteria, his file and all relevant papers will be prepared and forwarded to the Social Welfare Appeals Office for determination.

The arts, culture, film and heritage sector constitute an essential part of our national tourism offering: indeed, they animate the brand globally. In that context, my Department and the relevant agencies under its aegis are working closely with the lead Department on this important initiative.</p><p>  Art in all its forms is an intrinsic part of Irish culture and will play an important part in The Gathering.  Our national cultural institutions will be promoting a number of initiatives specifically designed to contribute to the success of The Gathering:</p><p>-  The <b>National Museum</b><b>of Ireland </b>  is working closely with F&aacute;ilte Ireland to promote the Museum&#8217;s four sites as part of The Gathering. The Museum is also promoting its four sites directly as places where Gathering events from small family reunions up to big marqueed events can take place. The Museum of Country Life is a leading member of the Mayo Gathering Steering Committee and has had direct meetings with Mayo&#8217;s Co-ordinator to ensure the Museum is to the forefront of any formal (and informal) Gathering events in the region.</p><p>- The <b>National Gallery of Ireland</b>   will be holding a sustained programme of exhibitions, temporary displays, weekly events such as public lectures and tours to enhance the participation and engagement of visitors to Ireland during The Gathering.  In addition, there will be a number of study mornings, lectures, conferences and symposia that will involve guests from overseas.</p><p>- The <b>Irish Museum of Modern Art </b>is taking significant steps to increase the number<b></b>of foreign visitors of Irish descent visiting the Museum in 2012.  Specific initiatives for The Gathering centre mainly on the promotion of those exhibitions which have the greatest capacity to attract this segment of the market, e.g., the exhibition of the famous <i>Ned Kelly </i>  series of paintings by the celebrated Australian artist, Sidney Nolan.</p><p>- The <b>National Library of Ireland </b>will have a number of events and activities that are relevant to The Gathering e.g. Free Family History advice service: a drop-service free to all visitors to Kildare Street, advising visitors on how to get started on researching their family history.</p><p>  The Arts Council will also play a key role in funding and developing arts events around the country during 2013 and are in regular contact with F&aacute;ilte Ireland with regard to its contribution to The Gathering.  In particular, the Arts Council provides funding to small arts festivals as well as touring and dissemination of works.  This will ensure that more people around the country &#8211; including, I hope, many of the visitors for the The Gathering &#8211; can experience excellent performances and exhibitions locally.  </p><p>  In addition, both the Culture Night and <i>International Celebration of Irish Culture</i>   initiatives will also make a significant contribution towards the success of The Gathering. The Culture Night initiative has grown into a significant national cultural event, with more than 300,000 people visiting museums, galleries and other across the country in 2011. The International Celebration of Irish Culture is a new initiative based around the St Patrick&#8217;s Day festival, which was well supported this year. Plans are already in hand to develop the concept further in 2013 with a key aim of using the existing St Patrick&#8217;s Festival activity to promote Ireland and its culture, both domestically and internationally.  </p><p>  With regard to the Gaeltacht, The Gathering has been raised by my Department in discussions with CONCOS - the representative body for over 40 Irish Summer Colleges.  Plans are progressing and CONCOS has expressed an interest in participating in this important national event.</p><p>  Last September, my Department launched two new websites which aim to highlight these lesser-known sites - national monuments and heritage buildings that are open to the public but which tend to be only visited by those very familiar with the particular area in which they are situated.  It is hoped that the new &#8216;Places to See&#8217; and &#8216;Monuments to Visit&#8217; websites will assist in encouraging tourists to visit locations that might not otherwise be on their itineraries and also assist those of us welcoming relatives and friends from abroad as part of The Gathering next year to be able to identify locations close by that will interest visitors.  Both websites feature easy-to-use digital maps that provide directions to the sites and details of what the visitor can expect to find on arrival. My Department will also continue to co-operate closely with our colleagues in the Office of Public Works (whose role it is to manage national monuments in the ownership or guardianship of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht) to further enhance the tourism value of our built heritage.</p><p>  My Department is supporting an initiative planned for 2013 by Mayo County Council under the Government Policy on Architecture 2009-2015 to create an architectural installation in a westerly location in Co Mayo, which will be informed by past and present diaspora celebrated by The Gathering.</p><p>  Finally, I am aware that genealogy will have relevance in the context of The Gathering, particularly for members of the Irish diaspora and establishing the details of their Irish family history.  In relation to my Department and the agencies under my auspices, genealogical services are provided by the National Library of Ireland, the National Archives and through my Department's website <i></i> . My Department and the relevant institutions are currently exploring what improvements could be made to our genealogical offering against the backdrop of The Gathering.  That work is ongoing.</p></reply>

The Council is independent in its decision-making process.  Details of the Council's successful applicants are available on the Council's website at , as well as the decision-making panel and statistics on applications.  The Council's 2012 allocation of &#8364;63.241 million will allow it to maximise its continuing support for its clients in the arts. </p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">The Government's policy on the arts is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, to increase access to and participation in the arts and to make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life.  I am continuing to work towards this goal with my Department and the agencies within its remit and I remain committed to securing the best possible level of funding for the arts sector. </font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  In addition, my Department through its Culture Ireland Division, supports Irish arts worldwide by creating and supporting opportunities for Irish artists and companies to present and promote their work at strategic international festivals and venues, presenting outstanding Irish creative work to international audiences through showcases at key global arts events including the Edinburgh Festivals and Venice Biennales, as well as through special initiatives such as the recently concluded Imagine Ireland initiative in the United States.  Details of those awarded grants so far in 2012 are available on the Department's website </font><font color="#2F2F2F">.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  Last May </font>I was pleased to launch the Philanthropy Leverage Initiative.  This initiative, established with funding of &#8364;230,000 for 2012, is designed to encourage philanthropic sponsorship and endowment funding of the arts from private sources.  The scheme aims to promote support for the arts from private sources and to unlock two to five times the funding put up by the taxpayer.  The Philanthropy Leverage Initiative has provided an incentive to arts organisations to proactively seek new and multi-annual relationships with sponsors which deliver private sector financial support, thereby increasing overall funding available to the arts.  Applications for the initiative were made across projects of varying scale, geography and art forms.  Details of awards made under this initiative are available on my Department's website.  The Leverage Initiative will run in parallel with a second initiative &#8211; the Philanthropy Capacity Building Initiative &#8211; which is operated by the Arts Council. </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, I wrote to him on 25 April 2012 setting out details of all arts bodies and/or groups that received funding since 1 June 2011, the amount of the funding provided and the purpose of the funding.  I also supplied details of all funding provided by Culture Ireland to organisations from June 2011 to then.  In addition, I forwarded details received from the Arts Council of all funding provided by it to arts practitioners, arts groups and venues in 2011 and 2012.  I am arranging to have this information updated and will forward it to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p><p>  The State appreciates and values the contribution the arts sector makes to the internationally renowned artistic reputation of this country.  Within the current economic constraints, that investment in the arts, culture and creative sectors is more important than ever, having regard to the employment intensity of the sector.  In the context of the 2013 Estimates, I will, of course, be endeavouring to maximise continuing Government support for the arts.</p><p>  My Department receives submissions regularly from heritage organisations seeking financial and other assistance towards heritage related projects.  Each request is reviewed by my Department on a case by case basis and those projects deemed suitable are supported within available budgets and resources, or redirected to a more appropriate heritage body.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-28a.401.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1046" speakername="Jimmy Deenihan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012112800077#WRR01500"><p>The Deputy will appreciate that tourism policy is primarily the responsibility of my colleague, Mr. Leo Varadkar, TD, Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. </p><p>  Of course, my Department and the institutions which it funds continue to work closely with the tourism agencies, at home and abroad, to promote cultural tourism.  In that context, there are a number of stand-out initiatives and a whole host of ongoing events of note, especially Culture Night. In 2012, Culture Night took place on September 21st in a record 30 towns and cities throughout the island of Ireland, showcasing the best of our artistic and cultural heritage and facilities. It is estimated that upwards of 200,000 participated in the event in 2012, with over 150 cultural venues in Dublin alone welcoming visitors until late in the evening.  </p><p>  Arising from discussions at the Dublin Castle Global Irish Economic Forum on the most appropriate way to increase the impact and popularity of Culture Night and beyond, it is proposed to designate St Patrick's Day as the <i>International Day of Irish Culture,</i> thereby building on solid foundations already in place.  Discussions are ongoing with all relevant stakeholders as to the exact format and scope of such an event, which will depend also on the amount of funding that is available.  I also propose to deepen the engagement with Music Day, held this year on 21 June, and create a further cultural pivot point at a key moment during the year.  In that way, there will be three main national cultural focus points throughout the year - St Patrick&#8217;s Day in Spring, Music Day at Midsummer and Culture Night in the Autumn.  </p><p>  The National Cultural Institutions and other cultural venues supported by my Department play a very significant role in Ireland's cultural tourism product.  In 2011, there were over 3.6 million visitors to such institutions and venues.  At the moment, they and the Arts Council are being activated to support both <i>The Gathering</i> and our upcoming EU Presidency Cultural programme.  Indeed, the National Museum alone surpassed 1 million visitors for the year last week. </p><p>  While the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and the agencies under its remit, have primary responsibility for the promotion of Ireland generally as an attractive visitor location, heritage sites, including national parks and national monuments, feature strongly in much of this promotion.  In addition, my Department through, for example, the provision of important heritage inventories, the funding for the conservation and presentation of the built heritage and through support for the Heritage Council, assists in promoting greater appreciation and understanding of Ireland&#8217;s heritage as a valuable amenity for residents and visitors alike.  My Department is also directly involved in developing heritage initiatives with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Heritage Council and other organisations.  I am confident that these and other initiatives will contribute to the quality of the national heritage tourism product, economic recovery and job creation.</p><p>  Cultural and heritage tourism is one of the most important elements of Ireland&#8217;s tourism product and heritage properties, including those in State care, are an important element of that attraction.  My Department is, therefore, focusing on working creatively across Government and with partner bodies, such as the Heritage Council, the Irish Heritage Trust, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the LEADER Programme and other heritage interests, in seeking to ensure that resources are directed towards the heritage sector.</p><p>  The Heritage Council, which is funded by my Department, recently commissioned the report <i>Economic Value of Ireland&#8217;s Historic Environment</i>. This report, published in May 2012, provides comprehensive evidence-based data that supports and enhances our innate understanding of the importance of our built heritage.  The Report establishes that heritage conservation and tourism has very significant economic value and that Ireland&#8217;s historic environment supports over 35,000 jobs and contributes in the order of &#8364;1.5 billion to the national economy.  It values the economic impact of Ireland&#8217;s historic environment/built heritage on the tourism sector through visitor expenditure at &#8364;700 million Gross Value Added (GVA).  The report indicates that capital investment in built heritage conservation provides significant employment in the construction industry and is of major benefit to the national economy.  </p><p>  My Department is also currently engaged in developing a specific heritage-led Historic Towns Initiative in collaboration with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Heritage Council.  My primary objective with this initiative is to ensure that the participating towns have access to and an understanding of appropriate guidance to assist them in best conserving their heritage assets and, in so doing, underpin the sustainability of their community and local economy.  It is my hope that meeting these goals will also, by extension, significantly enhance the visitor experience in these towns, thus helping to maximise the potential positive contribution of tourism to each of these towns and their respective hinterlands.  It is intended that the initiative will be piloted in three towns in Ireland in 2013.</p><p>  The arts and culture sectors continue to offer vital opportunities for the provision of important cultural, social and employment benefits to communities throughout the country.  The nature of employment within the arts sector encompasses a very wide range of activities.  The Government appreciates and values the contribution the arts sector makes to the internationally renowned artistic reputation of this country.  Within the current economic constraints, investment in the arts, culture and creative sectors is more important than ever, having regard to the employment intensity of the sector.</p></reply>

Many of these are ringforts.  My Department does not have comprehensive information on the numbers of reports of actual damage or threats of damage to protected structures and sites but it does have a suite of tools, both legislative and advisory, at its disposal to address such reports, where and when they are received. </p><p>  Given the total number of monument sites involved, it is not feasible to identify the position regarding public access in each case.  However, the 757 national monument sites in my ownership or guardianship, of which 32 have been identified as ringforts, are, in general, freely accessible to the public, or where privately held, are accessible under local arrangements.  National monuments in my ownership or guardianship are managed and maintained by the Office of Public Works on a day to day basis, including operation of Visitor Centres and the collation of data on visitor numbers. </p><p>  Under the provisions of Part IV (Architectural Heritage) of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2012, each planning authority is required to include in its development plan a Record of Protected Structures.  The making of an addition to, or deletion from, a Record of Protected Structures is a reserved function of the planning authorities.  Inclusion in the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them, seek to safeguard their future and serve notice to require works to be carried out in relation to endangerment of protected structures. </p><p>  Section 59 of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2011 provides for a planning authority to serve notice to require works to be carried out in relation to endangerment of such structures.  On the basis of information submitted by the planning authorities to my Department, there were 19 such notices served in 2008, 27 in 2009, 10 in 2010 and a provisional figure of 2 in 2011.</p><p>  My Department does not list historical or heritage structures in terms of top five per county. </p><p>  In 2011 my Department set up an Expert Advisory Committee representing key stakeholders to review the operation of Part IV (Architectural Heritage) of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2012.  This review includes an examination of how the legislation is operating in practice regarding the protection and management of architectural heritage from a central and local government perspective and the need, in the light of current economic circumstances, to consider alternative ways of supporting the conservation of protected structures.</p><p>  I am committed to working creatively across Government and with partner bodies, such as the Heritage Council, the Irish Heritage Trust, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Rural Development Programme (formerly LEADER) and other heritage interests, to ensure that all available supports are directed towards the heritage sector.  In this context, my Department is actively promoting the role Ireland&rsquo;s heritage has to play in making our country an attractive destination for sustainable tourism and inward investment, both in terms of the operation of Ireland&rsquo;s national parks and nature reserves, and in terms of our unique built heritage. </p><p>  Culture and heritage are important elements of Ireland&rsquo;s tourism product, and heritage properties, including those in State care, are prominent tourism sites.  At the National Ploughing Championship earlier this year, I formally launched new elements of my Department&rsquo;s websites, www.archaeology.ie and www.buildingsofireland.ie, which will guide visitors to a selection of our national monuments and structures of architectural heritage interest.  I intend to continue with such promotional measures in the future. </p><p>  While funding for investment in heritage is particularly limited at present, my Department will continue to provide funding for the protection, conservation and development of our built and natural heritage, in so far as resources allow, and, when necessary, will intervene as provided by law to protect such sites. </p></reply>

The licence for this area has been held since June 1994 and covers exploration for base metals (lead and zinc), barytes, silver, calcite and fluorite.  Reports submitted by the company and assessed by Departmental geologists merited a number of extensions to the licence since 1994.</p><p>  The licence was due for renewal again in 2012 and in this regard, the notice of intention to grant a Prospecting Licence was published in July last.

The Department exercises this role by promoting investment in modern fit-for-purpose infrastructures and by providing a supportive legislative and regulatory environment within which competition can flourish and private sector investment can take place.</p><p>  Where there is evidence of a failure by the market to provide the necessary investment to enable the market to develop and services to be deployed, my Department, with my approval, may design and implement schemes to address that market failure thereby ensuring that the necessary infrastructure and services are made available to all parts of the country and to all businesses and citizens, irrespective of location.  State investment in the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) and the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) are examples of recent such interventions.</p><p>  With basic broadband services now widely available across Ireland, the major challenge is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.</p><p>  The National Broadband Plan, which I launched in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  This plan follows on from the publication of the report of the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce and a period of public consultation.  Full details of these reports can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p>  It is intended that the private sector will be the key driver of investment with potential State intervention only where the market is unlikely to invest.</p><p>  The plan contains actions for: investment, demand stimulation, infrastructure barrier removal, spectrum policy, potential contribution of State entities, and policy and regulation.</p><p>  This approach seeks to achieve a step-change in the level of services available throughout the country, by accelerating private sector investment through a range of actions by public stakeholders, and particularly with regard to rural areas where the State expects to co-invest with the private sector in areas where the commercial case for infrastructure investment does not exist.</p><p>  During the preparation of the National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.</p><p>  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30Mbps and 40Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&rsquo; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  Preparatory work has commenced within my Department to expedite this mapping exercise.</p><p>  The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  This process is expected to take at least a number of months to complete and will identify the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention to ensure that the Government&rsquo;s commitment that a minimum of 30Mbps is available throughout the country is realised.</p></reply>

The exploration licence held by Providence Resources and their partners PSE Seven Heads Limited is over an area of the Kish Bank Basin off the Dublin/Wicklow coast.</p><p>  The licence is for a six year period and includes an obligation to drill an exploration well by August 2014, however at this stage my Department has not received an application from the licensees to conduct a site survey or drill on the licence.</p><p>  In relation to the impact of the proposed site survey and exploration well on fisheries, my Department undertook a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SAE) of the Celtic and Irish Seas during 2010/2011.  The SEA, which included a public consultation phase, concluded that the impact of anticipated oil and gas drilling activity on fisheries is considered to be minor.</p><p>  In relation to environmental impact assessment, I am satisfied that the current exploration licensing process is compliant with the requirements of both European and domestic law.  In the event that the proposed drilling resulted in a commercial discovery being made then the licensees would require a number of statutory approvals for an extraction project, including a petroleum lease and a plan of development consent from the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Other relevant statutory consents could include a planning and development consent from An Bord Plean&aacute;la, a safety case approval from the Commission for Energy Regulation, an IPPC Licence from the EPA and a Foreshore Licence from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>  All of these consent processes would include an environmental impact assessment including a public consultation phase.</p></reply>

The Programme reflects the need, in the context of the State's overall financial position, to put the funding of locally-delivered services on a sound financial footing, improve accountability and better align the cost of providing services with the demand for such services.  It was considered that, in light of the complex issues involved, a Local Property Tax would take time to introduce and accordingly to meet the requirements in the EU/IMF Programme, the Government decided to introduce a household charge in 2012 as an interim measure.  This was done via the Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011.</p><p>  An appropriate broadening of the revenue base for local government will be achieved through the Household Charge and the forthcoming full Local Property Tax. Income from the Household Charge and from a future Local Property Tax is critical in ensuring that local authorities have the necessary resources to continue to deliver services to their communities.</p><p>An independently-chaired Inter-Departmental Expert Group was established earlier this year to consider the structures and modalities for an equitable Local Property Tax to replace the Household Charge.  The Group submitted its report and proposals will be brought to Government which will decide on the exact details of implementation , including the relationship between the Non Principal Private Residence Charge and the Local Property Tax, and the Local Property Tax&rsquo;s role within the wider funding of local government.</p><p>  The Government has decided that the Local Property Tax will be collected and administered by the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

The Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI) has been designated as the registration body for the purposes of Part 3 of the Act. </p><p>  A number of routes to registration are provided for in Sections 14, 15, 16 and 22 of the Act having regard to the differing approaches to gaining the requisite knowledge, skills and experience adopted by individual applicants.  Section 22, in particular, includes a provision to address the position of a category of practically trained persons who had already been providing architectural services in Ireland commensurate with those understood as being provided by Architects for the purpose of the Building Control Act 2007 for a period of ten years at the time the Act became law.  This provision is transitional in nature and enables this category of persons to become registered once they have been assessed as eligible for registration by the Technical Assessment Board in accordance with the practical experience assessment procedure. </p><p>  Taken in their totality the various routes to registration provided for under Part 3 of the Act represent a registration process that is open, fair and transparent. </p><p>  Section 62 deals with the specification of registration fees and, importantly, requires that a fee specified must not in any case exceed the total of the costs in providing the services for which the fee is paid and the reasonable costs incurred by the registration body in collecting, accounting for and administering the fee.  I understand that the registration body has confirmed that the recommended fees are in line with the requirements of Section 62. </p><p>  The Act does not seek to regulate the function or role of architects.  Its purpose rather is to provide statutory protection of the title Architect so that only those who are suitably qualified and registered will be lawfully entitled to use the title. Eligible persons who decline to register can continue to practice architecture and provide architectural services but they cannot use the title Architect or sign certificates to that effect. </p></reply>

This role is critical notwithstanding that children living in the Direct Provision system are not in the care of the State.  All children live in a family context and their parents/guardians have primary responsibility for their care and welfare.  It should also be noted that RIA does not accommodate unaccompanied minors: they are in the care of the HSE.</p><p>  In the Direct Provision system, children are protected in a number of ways - primarily through RIA's Child Protection policy; its House Rules; its requirement that all centre staff are Garda vetted; and through the coordination role of a dedicated unit in RIA.</p><p>  RIA's Child Protection Policy is based on the HSE's &#8220;Children First - National Guidelines for the protection and welfare of children&#8221;.  This policy requires, inter alia, that children must be supervised by their parents/guardians at all times and that children are not permitted to be left alone overnight.  It also provides that each centre has a designated Child Protection liaison officer who is responsible for following a referral procedure should he or she suspect that a child welfare incident has occurred. Management of accommodation centres are obliged to ensure that all staff working in the centre are aware of, and adhere to, RIA's Child Protection Policy. The HSE has provided 'Keeping Safe' child protection training to each centre's designated officers and other staff members.</p><p>  The RIA House Rules set out information for residents and staff in respect of child protection and the responsibilities of all parties.  A copy of these Rules, as well as its Child Protection Policy, is available on RIA's website -   <i>www.ria.gov.ie</i></p><p>  Staff of centres under contract to RIA are Garda vetted.  This is in furtherance of RIA's policy which has as its principal aim the minimisation of risk to children and vulnerable adults residing in its centres. </p><p>  There is a specific unit in RIA called the Child and Family Services Unit, which is fully staffed and whose role is to manage, deliver, coordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all asylum seekers residing in the direct provision system.  It also acts as a conduit between RIA and the HSE, the latter having statutory functions in this area.  </p><p>  It should be acknowledged that the system of Direct Provision allows for a level of non-intrusive supervision of residents which would not be found in other living arrangements in the community.  Other residents, centre staff, designated liaison officers, Public Health Nurses, General Practitioners, Community and Ethnic Liaison Gardai etc. are alert to child welfare issues in centres. </p><p>  In relation to the specific issue raised of children in centres sharing bedrooms with adults who are not known to them, there are a number of points to be made. There is only one instance where children share bedrooms with an unrelated adult.  This occurs in the Eglington centre in Galway where, in each of three very large en-suite rooms, a female lone parent with infant children shares with another female lone parent with infant children. This must be seen in the context of there being 646 lone parent families, 314 of whom involving only one child, in the overall profile of residents in the RIA system.  Under RIA policy, children aged 10 years or more should not share a bedroom with a family member of the opposite gender.  Where this circumstance arises, RIA offers alternative accommodation elsewhere in its portfolio but, in a number of cases, such offers are declined.</p><p>  RIA acknowledges that child protection is on ongoing and evolving responsibility and that it must constantly adapt to legislative and policy changes.  In this respect, RIA is liaising with the HSE to update its Child Protection Policy in line with the recent revisions to the HSE's &#8220;Children First&#8221; published in 2011.  This will involve the re-training of the designated Child Protection liaison officers across all its centres.  RIA is also pro-actively engaging, internally and externally, in relation to, for example, putting Children First on a legislative basis as well as other associated child protection measures.</p></reply>

Under the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006, the Property Registration Authority (PRA) was established on 4 November 2006.  The PRA replaces the Registrar of Deeds and Titles as the registering authority in relation to property registration in Ireland and, subject to the above Act, is independent in the performance of its functions. </p><p>  I am advised by the Authority that applications under Section 49  are based upon adverse possession and such applications are governed by a detailed and relatively complex area of land law and the circumstances of each case dictate the nature and the processing time of each individual application.  Any party who may have an interest in the property is notified that a Section 49 application has been lodged.  There will routinely be ongoing and detailed correspondence between the Property Registration Authority and other parties. Such applications, of necessity, may take a long time to process and it is therefore not possible to give an average turnaround time for these types of cases.  However, every effort is made   to ensure that unnecessary delay is avoided.   </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware of the service to T.D.s and Senators which provides information on the current status of applications, such as the subject of this question, which was introduced in May 2006.  The service provides a speedier, more efficient and more cost effective alternative to submitting Parliamentary Questions.  It is operated by the PRA and is available all year round.   I can further inform the Deputy that his query in relation to a specific case has been forwarded to the PRA for attention and direct reply via the above mentioned service.</p></reply>

Firstly, in sourcing accommodation RIA must ensure that the basic legal conditions, in terms of capacity and toilet and bathroom facilities, are met.  Secondly, in relation to room sharing, where it comes to RIA's attention that accommodation is not suitable for a family where, for example, its size has increased, alternative accommodation in another centre is offered.  In some cases, this offer is not accepted and families prefer to stay in a centre. Thirdly, in relation to families having to share bathrooms, a majority of families living in the system have sole access to their own bathroom and toilet facilities. Whilst the nature of Direct Provision is such that en suite facilities are not guaranteed, RIA will continue to seek over time to increase the percentage of families having access to non-shared bathroom/toilet facilities.  </p><p>  The policy of direct provision and dispersal is one of the central features of the State&#8217;s asylum system. I have recounted in previous responses to D&aacute;il Questions how the direct provision system was a necessary response to the increasing number of asylum seekers arriving into the State given the incapacity of the structures dealing with homelessness to cope with the crisis.</p><p>  A comprehensive Value for Money review on the operation of the asylum seeker accommodation programme was carried out in 2010 which found that alternatives to the existing direct provision structures would be significantly more expensive than Direct Provision. The Report is available on RIA's website www.ria.gov.ie . Copies are also available in the Oireachtas library.</p><p>  In relation to the broader asylum issue, particularly the complexity and length of the associated processes, my efforts are concentrated on<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>speeding up the processing of applications, primarily by redeploying staff from the refugee determination bodies. The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, 2010 which I intend to republish early in 2013 provides for the introduction of a single procedure to determine applications for protection and other reasons to remain in the State. This should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements. This reorganisation of the protection application processing framework will remove the current multi-layered processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their applications in a more straightforward and timely fashion. </p></reply>

The Courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and, therefore, it is not open to me as Minister to comment in any way.  Section 4(3) of the Courts Service Act 1998 provides that the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions, which are specified in section 5 and includes the management of the Courts.  Court funds which are held for the benefit of Wards of Court are private funds under the control of the Courts Service which, through its offices in the High, Circuit and District Courts, has responsibility for the management and investment of funds in court.</p><p>However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that court funds, which amounted to approximately &euro;1.188 billion at 30 September 2012 are managed in a fiduciary capacity by the Courts Service on behalf of more than 18,000 beneficiaries.  Approximately 2,500 of these are wards of court with funds in the amount of &euro;800 million in value.  Other beneficiaries include minors and various categories of litigant.  The Deputy will appreciate the amount of damages awarded or approved by the courts in any case of a ward of court, cannot be guaranteed to meet the needs of the ward for their lifetime.  Many factors will determine the extent to which the sum awarded will be sufficient, including expenditure incurred, inflation and investment performance.  The Courts Service is not responsible for ensuring that the amount awarded in any case is sufficient to maintain an individual for their lifetime.</p><p>The Courts Service has assured me that it operates a conservative investment policy and seeks to invest all funds in the best interests of each beneficiary.  The funds are invested in line with the provisions of the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958 and subsequent orders and are regulated by the Financial Regulator.  I am informed that the beneficiaries benefit from the investor protection structure inherent in such funds.  The investment arrangements for all court funds operate under a structured framework.  The Investment Committee of the Courts Service has an advisory role and its main function is to devise investment policy for court funds, oversee the recommendations received from its investment advisors, and to ensure compliance with best practice in the management of court funds.  It monitors the investment arrangements of court funds on a regular basis.  The Committee comprises members of the judiciary, representatives from the Courts Service and independent members.  The Committee is chaired by the President of the High Court and is also supported by external investment advisors.

Warrants will continue to show on PULSE until such time as they are recorded as being finally disposed of and, as some of the warrants in question are outstanding for many years, I am concerned that the total figure for outstanding warrants as shown on PULSE may not be a reliable indicator of the number of 'live' warrants which are enforceable which are on hand.</p><p>In these circumstances, in July of this year I asked the Garda Commissioner to consider whether there may be a better way of maintaining statistics which gives a more realistic indication in relation to any backlog of warrants that arises.  At the same time I also asked him to report to me again within six months on the situation in relation to unexecuted warrants and indicated that if he has any recommendations in relation to legislative or administrative action open to me as Minister which would assist in this area I will, of course, consider them.</p><p>While genuine difficulties can arise where it does not prove possible to enforce a warrant, it is obviously important that systems are in place to ensure that warrants are enforced as quickly as possible.  In this regard, I have been assured by the Garda Commissioner that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na give priority to the execution of warrants in respect of serious crime and will continue to do so.</p><p>I have been advised by the Garda Commissioner that at present there is an Inspector in each Garda District in the Dublin Metropolitan Region and each Division outside the DMR tasked with managing the execution of warrants, and other issues relating to them.  In addition, specific members of the Force are tasked with their execution.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continually liaises with other agencies, including Government Departments, to locate individuals sought on warrant.  This has resulted in the provision of addresses, other than those provided on the warrants, for many persons sought.  In particular, Garda warrants personnel regularly liaise with the Irish Prison Service and the Courts Service to ensure the timely exchange of relevant information regarding persons sought for the service of warrants.</p><p>I am also advised that there is a warrants working group in place which facilitates liaison between the various stakeholders, including the Court Service and the Prison Service and which works to identify, address and prevent difficulties in the warrants process.  The work of the group is ongoing and relevant recommendations for the improvement of systems are being implemented on an ongoing basis.  The Garda Commissioner has assured me that both he and his senior management team are closely monitoring the situation with a view to ensuring that warrants are executed as expeditiously as possible.</p></reply>

The central recommendation from the VFM Steering Committee is for the retention of the Reserve with 4,000 personnel spread countrywide to be based in barracks and in 16 other locations. This requires the consolidation of existing Reserve Units throughout the country into a smaller number of full-strength Units. The retention of all locations was not a viable or sustainable option.</p><p>  A new &ldquo;Single Force&rdquo; concept will see PDF Units having Reserve components, rather than a parallel Reserve as at present. Reserve Units within barracks will be supported by their parent PDF Unit and the 16 Units outside of PDF installations will be supported by dedicated full time PDF personnel. This concept offers significant potential advantages in terms of training and development of the Reserve. The initiative of locating Reserve Officers within the Defence Forces command structure will likewise underpin the future of Reserve personnel.    </p><p>  All options to avoid the need for personnel to relocate are being explored as part of the reorganisation process. Personnel are being offered the opportunity for reassignment and every effort is being made to minimise the requirement to relocate.  Inevitably, given the scale of the reorganisation, it will be necessary for some staff to move to new locations.  </p></reply>

All options to avoid the need for personnel to relocate are being explored as part of this process but inevitably, given the scale of the reorganisation, it will be necessary for some staff to move to new locations.    The creation of a new two Brigade structure for the Army under the reorganisation has resulted in Combat Support Units being reduced from nine units to six.  The Field Engineer companies based in McKee Barracks fall into this category, and the Headquarters element and Field Engineer Company are being relocated to Custume Barracks, Athlone. The 2 Field Artillery Regiment based in McKee Barracks are also relocating as part of this process and consideration is not being given to reversing these operational decisions.  However, I understand that a number of vacancies have been offered in Dublin to personnel where units are being relocated.</p><p>  It is important to restate that the reassignment, promotion and appeals processes are still ongoing and that the numbers of personnel to be mandatorily reassigned remains fluid at this point making it impossible to give final definitive figures at this juncture. All members of the Defence Forces reassigned under the Defence Forces Reorganisation Plan 2012 will be entitled to Change of Station Allowance in circumstances where they meet the qualifying criteria.  The Defence Forces Personnel Support Service has a representative in every Barrack or Installation to which personnel are being reassigned and these individuals are in a position, using both internal and external resources to provide the necessary supports to the redeploying personnel and their families if applicable, as was previously provided during recent Barrack closures and redeployments.</p></reply>

No further payments can issue under this forestry contract until both Tax Clearance Certificates are received.</p></reply>

To further enhance the patient safety aspect of generic substitution, Section 13 of the Bill allows a prescriber to indicate on a prescription that a branded interchangeable medicinal product should, for clinical reasons, not be substituted.</p><p>  I am satisfied that these provisions address the concerns raised by the Deputies.</p><p>  It is important to point out that generic medicines must meet exactly the same standards of quality and safety and have the same effect as the originator medicine.

The Bill completed its passage through the Seanad on Wednesday, the 19th of September, and is currently continuing its passage through the D&aacute;il.

The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive service reforms and provide the maximum possible benefit to patients. Reform across the three domains of access, quality and resources is not achievable unless there is real clinical and managerial accountability at hospital level.</p><p>  The work on hospital groups is not about downgrading hospitals. It is about the bringing together groups of hospitals to form single cohesive entities to allow maximum flexibility in management, budgets and service delivery. Hospital groups will be established on an administrative basis pending the legislation required to set up hospital trusts by 2014. Before those trusts are established the make-up and functioning of the Groups will be reviewed and if changes prove necessary then they will be made with Government approval when the hospital trusts are being formed. </p><p>  Last June I appointed Professor John Higgins to chair a Strategic Board on the Establishment of Hospital Groups. The Strategic Board is composed of representatives with both national and international expertise in health service delivery, governance and linkages with academic institutions. A Project Team was established to make recommendations to the Strategic Board on the composition of hospital groups, governance arrangements, management frameworks and linkages to academic institutions. </p><p>  The Project Team is currently finalising a Report on the recommendations outlined above, taking account of the observations and comments made by the Strategic Board at their meeting on 14th November. It is anticipated that this work will be completed within the next week. Upon completion, this Report will be submitted to me and I will then bring it to Cabinet. The composition of Hospital groups will be a Government decision, taking into account the recommendations of that Report.</p></reply>

The Report noted that there was no agreed definition of what constitutes a complementary therapy.  While it focussed on the regulatory environment, some definitions which the Report considered were: </p><p>-  <i> &#8216;&#8216;Complementary Medicine refers to a group of therapeutic and diagnostic disciplines that exist largely outside the institutions where conventional health care is taught and provided.&#8217;&#8217;</i></p><p><i>- &#8216;&#8216;Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) is a broad domain of healing resources that encompasses all health systems, modalities and practices and their accompanying theories and beliefs, other than those intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period&#8230;&#8230;&#8221; </i></p><p>There are no approved grades in the complementary therapies in the publicly-funded health sector and there have been no requests to my Department from the publicly-funded health sector for the approval of such grades.  However the Report noted a large increase in the number of people using complementary therapies, both in Ireland and worldwide, and my Department makes available an information leaflet on complementary therapy to assist consumers in making an informed choice if they choose to use complementary therapy.  A copy is available on the Department&#8217;s website at </p><p>  The 2006 Report made recommendations on strengthening the regulatory environment for complementary therapists.  My Department&#8217;s concern, while carefully considering this Report, has been the most effective way to regulate this sector and protect public safety while still allowing people freedom of choice.  My Department therefore supports greater voluntary self-regulation for all such therapies and has facilitated workshops for stake-holders.  Issues such as therapeutic effectiveness; initial professional training/entry qualifications; continuing professional development; quality and accountability of complementary therapists; and agreement among practitioners within each individual profession so that professional bodies are representative, all need to be considered in this context.  </p><p>  In relation to entry level qualifications, a review on the academic recognition of five specific complementary therapies (Osteopathy, Chiropractic, Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine) was jointly commissioned in 2010 by my Department and Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC), now Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI).  Its conclusions are now being considered.</p></reply>

The overall average pay cost of management/ administration based on 2009 data was calculated at &euro;116m, or 11.1% of total pay costs, with management pay accounting for 4.4% of total pay, and clerical and administrative pay accounting for another 6.7% (ref. VFM Review, Table 4.13).</p><p>  The VFM Review found that there were many factors influencing the percentage of an agency&rsquo;s budget which was spent on administration, including the size and function of the agency, so that comparisons were best made between agencies of similar scale and model of service.  The Review found that it was difficult to draw any conclusions about a universal approach to the generation of management/ administration savings, which were likely to vary on a case by case basis. On the broader front, the VFM Review identified significant opportunities to achieve savings in agencies&rsquo; unit cost base and to reduce average costs across the sector. Savings in management/ administration costs would be a component in this overall cost reduction.    In terms of driving efficiencies,  a number of administrative areas such as Human Resources, Finance, and Procurement are being examined and progressed through the work of the National Consultative Forum. The Health Service Executive remains committed to working with all voluntary disability service providers to ensure that all of the resources available for specialist disability services are used in the most efficient and effective manner possible.</p></reply>

However, causation has not been established.  My priority is to ensure that children/adolescents affected by narcolepsy with symptom onset post pandemic vaccination are provided with services and supports to meet their health needs.  The HSE and the Department of Education and Skills together provide a comprehensive range of services and supports to those affected.  These supports and services include access to rapid diagnosis, clear treatment pathways, temporary medical cards and reimbursement of expenses incurred.  Multidisciplinary assessments which allow for the appropriate individualised health and educational supports to be put in place are ongoing.  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is also engaging with the HSE and with the individual schools and parents of children concerned to identify and provide educational supports for the children and adolescents affected. </p><p>Both myself and officials from my Department and the Department of Education and Skills has met SOUND on a number of occasions, to outline the services available.  At our most recent meeting, in July 2012,  I reiterated my commitment to bring a Memorandum to Cabinet setting out the full response to the issue.  My Department is considering all possible supports which may need to be put in place for those affected.  Any such supports require my approval and the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>
