Institutions have different rules on the particular circumstances that may be considered as reasons for a deferral.  As the Deputy will appreciate, higher education institutions are autonomous bodies.  As such, the governing authority of each institution is responsble for the day-to-day operational affairs, including conditions governing deferral of places.</p><p>  It would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the practice of individual institutions on deferrals.  I would however say that individuals, for a variety of reasons and circumstances, consider deferring their courses.  </p></reply>

That reduction takes account of VEC capacity to utilise cash balances on a once off basis.</p><p>  While it would have been preferable not to have to make any changes, bringing the pupil teacher ratio for PLC from 17:1 into line with that of free second level schools at 19:1 ensures that our limited resources are rightly focused on the children in our education system.</p><p>  The change will reduce the overall number of PLC teaching posts by 200 and may lead to some reduction in subject choices for students but not approved places.  CEOs of VECs and school principals have until next September to plan how best to deal with this change so that they can continue to deliver programmes which meet the needs of students and employers.</p></reply>

The Heads of a Bill for the establishment of SOLAS were approved by Government last year.  The Bill will, among other things, provide for the establishment of SOLAS, the dissolution of F&Aacute;S and the transfer of the F&Aacute;S training services to the  Education and Training Boards that are being established under separate legislation.</p><p>  The timing for establishment of the new authority is dependent on the enactment and entry into force of this legislation.  Following the commencement of the relevant legislation, the transfer of training services to the Education and Training Boards will be phased through 2013 and 2014.</p></reply>

In current economic circumstances it is important that small and medium sized businesses are not hindered in competing for contracts that they are performing effectively and centralising the process would make it more difficult for these to compete.</p><p>  In recent years the emphasis within my Department has been to reduce the reliance on prefabs.  Schools being approved for devolved grant aid for additional accommodation are given the option to build a permanent classroom(s) rather than purchase a prefab.  In 2012 from a total of 409 classrooms sanctioned, over 360 classrooms will be permanent builds.</p><p>  Only 56 new rental contracts were approved last year.  This compares to 266 approved in 2008 and 715 in 2007.  In March of last year I also introduced a Prefab Replacement Initiative to assist schools in the removal of rented prefabs and to replace these with permanent structures.</p></reply>

In December 2011, the European Commission produced a legislative proposal to modernise this Directive and it has been examined by the European Council and the European Parliament since then.</p><p>  The facilitation of the mobility of professionals between member states is a key element of a package of measures to re-launch the Single Market and articulates well with the overall theme of the Irish Presidency of stability, jobs and growth.  Ireland has made reaching agreement on the modernised directive a priority in its Presidency Programme.</p></reply>

Major changes are being made to initial teacher training and literacy and numeracy units are now in place in the National Teacher Induction Programme.  School self-evaluation is being rolled out and I have introduced new requirements on standardised testing including the return of aggregate data to my Department.</p><p>  A national programme of professional development for primary and second level teachers is underway.

A range of recommendations to ensure the system continues to respond to enterprise needs is being implemented through the National Strategy for Higher Education.  The creation of a new further education and training authority, SOLAS, will also ensure a focus on the needs of enterprise.</p><p>  The Enterprise Engagement Forum provides for bi-annual dialogue between the Department and enterprise on education policy issues.  In addition, research from the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs provides a valuable input to the development of course curricula and has informed the development of new competitive funding models of provision, such as Springboard and Momentum, to address skills needs.</p></reply>

I understand from SUSI that grants processing is now largely up to date and that completed applications are being dealt with as they come in.  Priority continues to be given to some 3,700 students who are due payment of their maintenance grant.</p><p>  SUSI is also concentrating its efforts on ensuring that any student who has yet to complete their application is given the necessary support to do so.  In the case of over 9,000 online applications students have never sent in any documentation and SUSI is engaging with those students to confirm closing out these applications.  Documentation is outstanding in relation to the remaining 10,000 cases.  This is similar to the position in previous years and SUSI is actively contacting these students to assist them with finalising their applications.</p></reply>

They will continue to be a feature of our education landscape. In these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement.</p><p>  How best to sustain provision for widely dispersed and small Protestant communities does present as a particular challenge especially  in any locality where enrolment in their schools is declining to single figures and amalgamation is not an option because there is no other school nearby. The Government is intent in fostering pluralism in school provision. Supporting minority churches in maintaining their schools is part of that policy.</p><p>  A Value for Money examination of small schools is being carried out and my Department expects to publish the analysis and findings in the near future. I hope that this report will foster constructive engagement both in the Oireachtas and among all interested parties in looking at the challenges ahead and how best to make provision for primary education in rural and dispersed communities.</p><p>  My Department and I will continue to engage with the relevant education sector stakeholders, including the Church of Ireland, in relation to education provision for all areas.</p></reply>

The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of the budget. When account is taken of additional posts for demographics at primary and second level there is an estimated net increase of up to 900 posts on overall teacher numbers for the 2013/14 school year compared to the current 2012/13 school year.</p><p>  The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on my Department's website. The staffing arrangements for the 2013/14 school year at post primary level have just recently been published and the arrangements at primary level will be published shortly.</p><p>  In respect of further education, while it would have been preferable not to have to make any changes, bringing the pupil teacher ratio for PLC from 17:1 into line with that of free second level schools at 19:1, ensures that our limited resources are rightly focussed on the children in our education system. The change will reduce the overall number of PLC teaching posts by 200 and may lead to some reduction in subject choices for students but not approved places. CEOs of VECs and school principals have until next September to plan how best to deal with this change so that they can continue to deliver programmes which meet the needs of students and employers.</p></reply>

This arrangement was discontinued in January 2013 for new participants on these schemes aged 25 years and over. Accordingly their training allowance will not exceed their previous social welfare entitlement. In the case of new participants aged under 25, there continues to be a potential increase , but to the reduced maximum level of &euro;160.

Under this scheme NEPS psychologists make recommendations annually in respect of some 5000 applications for accommodations such as readers, scribes, etc.  based on criteria applied by, and agreed with, the State Examinations Commission (SEC).</p><p>  Applications under the scheme are submitted by schools on behalf of students to the SEC, who in turn forward them to NEPS regional offices countrywide.  Each application must include information supporting the candidate's request for a particular accommodation, including current school based testing on ability / attainments, to inform the psychologist's recommendation under the schemes' criteria.</p><p>  Most requests are processed and returned, with recommendations, from NEPS to SEC upon examination of the application form and supporting information. Those applications which do not include all the appropriate data are returned through the SEC to the school for update, resubmitted and reviewed again by the NEPS psychologist and a recommendation is made.  Where the information, duly submitted, does not allow for a clear determination in relation to the accommodation requested, the psychologist may visit the school concerned and carry out additional assessment with the candidate to further inform the process of establishing eligibility, or not, under the criteria for the scheme.  The overall focus of the process applied by NEPS  is designed to ensure consistency in the application of the scheme's criteria and fairness and objectivity in reaching a recommendation for the candidate.  Candidates who are not satisfied with the determination reached in the process may appeal the decision though a process moderated by the SEC under the scheme.</p><p>  Neither I, nor my Department, is aware of the anomalies to which the Deputy alludes in her question.</p></reply>

Such surveys give an insight into how schools exercised the enhanced discretion or autonomy that they had because the reduction in posts was done by bringing guidance in quota. If the alternative (a worsening of the basic schedule) had been done then any impact survey conducted would have shown greater impact in all other curricular areas identified in this survey other than guidance. The bottom line is the budget measure allowed schools deal with the reduction on an individual basis according to their own judgement of what was best.</p><p>  I have already acknowledged to the House and indeed previously to the Institute of Guidance Counsellors that bringing guidance provision within quota is challenging for schools. All of us in the public sector have to do more with less and teachers including those who are assigned as guidance counsellors cannot be exempt from this requirement.</p><p>  It is important to note that the provision of guidance in schools is a whole school activity and it does not just involve the guidance counsellor. All teachers in the school have an important role including Year Heads and this would not be captured in surveys of this type.</p><p>  The budget decision actually sheltered the impact for all the DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations.</p></reply>

SNAs are allocated to schools in order to provide for the care needs of children with special educational needs attending such schools. The policy of my Department in relation to the SNA scheme is set out in Circular 07/02, which also provides details regarding the role and duties of an SNA.</p><p>  The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that SNAs are not allocated to individual pupils. The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school, and on the basis of the assessed care needs of the children, rather than solely by reference to a pupils' disability categorisation.</p><p>  SNAs should then be deployed by schools in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p><p>  There has been no reduction in the number of Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) available to schools this year, with 10,575 posts remaining available for allocation.</p><p>  The fact that the number of special needs assistant posts are being maintained at current levels is a reflection of this Governments commitment to prioritising supports for children with special educational needs, at a time when there is a requirement to make expenditure savings across a range of areas.</p><p>  All children who have qualified for such support this year have been provided with access to SNA support. Notwithstanding the fact that there is potential for demographic growth in the pupil population over the coming years, there has been no indication to date that there are insufficient SNA posts to cater for the care needs of all children with special educational needs who qualify for SNA support.</p><p>  It should also be noted that the total number of posts which are available for allocation, which is 10,575 posts, remains significantly greater than the number which were allocated to schools in recent years, for example, 10,342 posts at the end of 2009 and 10,442 posts at the end of 2008.</p></reply>

The Commission also offers placements from time to time for up to six interns. The Commission has recently advertised new internships and received applications which are under consideration.</p><p>  The Commission also has an arrangement with third-level institutions for short-term internships which take place over the summer months.  The total budget allocation for the Law Reform Commission for 2013 as advised by the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform is &euro;2,114,000.</p><p>  Part of the work of the Commission is to make legislation in its current state easily accessible online to the public, as amended rather than as enacted, and provide related information (the Access to Legislation project). The Commission provides online access to Revised Acts from 2006 onwards and selected others, and electronically-searchable indexes of amendments to legislation and other related information to facilitate ascertaining the current state of amended legislation.  The indexes include the Legislation Directory of primary and secondary legislation and a Classified List of Acts in force. (A Classified List of in-force Statutory Instruments is in course of preparation.) The areas of the Commission&rsquo;s work referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s second two questions (i.e. restatement of Statutes, production of revised Acts and work on the Legislation Directory) form part of this Access to Legislation project.</p><p>  The staff of the Access to Legislation Project consist of one Project Manager (Principal Officer standard scale), one Assistant Project Manager (Assistant Principal standard scale) and two legal researchers (single point salary scale &euro;28,789 per annum).  From time to time the Commission also offers placements of up to two interns to work on this project.  The position of Assistant Project Manager is currently vacant and in the process of being filled.  The total pay cost (including Employer PRSI) for the staff working on the Access to Legislation Project in 2013 is estimated to be &euro;250,330.  The specialist XML authoring system needed for production of the Legislation Directory and revised Acts in conformity with existing standards for the repository of legislation costs in the region of &euro;23,400 per annum in technical support and licensing fees.  The staff working on the Access to Legislation Project (as with all staff of the Commission) are supported by the Commission&rsquo;s existing HR, IT, Finance, Corporate Services, secretarial support services and other facilities.</p></reply>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and Forfas are also members of the Monitoring Committee. at Committee has published three Progress Reports to date (available on the DJEI website) which show that the 160 measures due for completion in the first six months of last year under the Plan have been delivered and that 58 of the 67 of the measures due in Q3 of 2012 were delivered on schedule. The Fourth Progress Report detailing progress made on Q4 measures, as well as those described in the Action Plan as "ongoing in 2012", is due shortly. The Department of the Taoiseach has some responsibility in relation to two measures outlined in the 2012 Plan.</p><p>  Firstly, regarding the approach to agreeing new structures to improve Coordination and Synchronisation of Regulation (Action 1.53) by Departments and Agencies, this measure was delivered on schedule in Q2.  In April 2012 the Government agreed a cohesive approach to the overall regulation agenda across Government and confirmed the assignment of a number lead responsibilities with overall strategic coordination and work on economic regulation in general overseen by D/Taoiseach and progressed at Cabinet Committee level. The work on economic regulation is being informed by the Forf&aacute;s study on sectoral regulators which is expected to be completed shortly.</p></reply>

Each application received by the Passport Service must, therefore, demonstrate that person's entitlement to Irish citizenship before a passport can issue.  The Passport Service must operate within the law on this as in all matters.  The Department received an application from the parents of the child in question last August.  As she was born in Dublin on 4 May 2012<font color="#004080">,</font>her entitlement to Irish citizenship is subject to the terms of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended.<font color="#004080"> </font> The Act provide<font color="#004080">s</font> that a person, born in the State on or after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction at the time of that person's birth, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for an Irish passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three years of the four years preceding that<font color="#004080"> </font>person's birth.</p><p>  Moreover, the Act makes particular provision for nationals of EU member states, who may make a declaration concerning their residence in the island of Ireland within the four years preceding their children's birth.  In such cases, the EU national is regarded as having resided in the island of Ireland for the declared periods for the purposes of the Act, unless the contrary is proved.  These declarations must be supported by documentary evidence (e.g. tax documents, bank statements, social welfare benefit payments, work permits, rent leases etc) to verify actual residence in the State. </p><p>  In this case, the applicant's parents are Romanian citizens.  Romania entered the EU on 1 January, 2007.  While parents from that country (and Bulgaria) are equal to other EU nationals in terms of free movement and residence, there were restrictions in terms of access to the labour market.  </p><p>  At the time of application last August, the Department had undertaken a review of the kind of evidence, such as work permits, that may be required to establish lawful and reckonable residence for Romanian and Bulgarian parents.  The Department of Justice and Equality, which is the Department responsible for immigration and citizenship, provided detailed advice on this last November.  This enabled the Passport Service to finalise last month guidelines in this area.  </p><p>  Work has been ongoing since then to clear the small number of applications which were delayed as a result of this review.  This person's application was among them.  The Passport Service is in ongoing discussion with the applicant's parents regarding the evidence required to determine that child's citizenship. </p></reply>

Studies by international organisations such as the OECD have demonstrated that tying aid can reduce the overall benefit to developing countries by up to 30%.</p><p>  Ireland is one of a number of key of donor countries whose aid is 100% untied.  This is one of the principal reasons that Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme is internationally recognised as being of the highest quality.</p><p>  Irish companies already bid and tender for the provision of goods and services to our partner Governments in line with international transparent and open procurement standards.  The Department's Africa Strategy seeks to build these opportunities and linkages. </p><p>  The Programme for Government included a commitment to review the 2006 White Paper on Irish Aid.  This review is now complete and a new policy to guide Ireland&rsquo;s role in global development will be submitted to Cabinet for approval in the near future.

At its meeting on 22 and 23 November 2012, the European Council gave a mandate to President Van Rompuy and President Barroso to pursue work on the MFF, with a view to reaching agreement at the beginning of 2013.  President Van Rompuy now hopes to close negotiations at the meeting of the European Council on 7 and 8 February.  The Irish Presidency will support President Van Rompuy in his efforts to secure a deal on the MFF. </p><p>  The EU and its member states are collectively the largest provider of development assistance in the world, providing over 55% of global ODA.  This will remain the case under the next MFF.  The strength of the development budget enables the EU to implement large scale projects and to respond effectively to humanitarian crises when they emerge.  It also confers great legitimacy on the Union when it calls on all international donors, including new and emerging partners, to raise their level of ambition and to increase their ODA efforts to a level similar to the EU, thus contributing their fair share to the global development efforts. </p><p>  In the course of the MFF negotiations, we have sought to ensure that a fair proportion of the EU budget is allocated to development assistance.  We have pointed out that this will allow the EU to continue playing a leadership role, to engage effectively when humanitarian crises emerge and to target extreme poverty and hunger.  Given the financial constraints across the EU there has been pressure from member states to seek reductions across every heading of the MFF.  Nevertheless, I am hopeful that development funding in the next MFF will be at a higher level than for the current 2007 to 2013 MFF.</p></reply>

A resolution of the situation for undocumented Irish migrants will continue to be pursued by the Government in our ongoing contacts with the US Administration and Congress.  The advice of Ireland&rsquo;s friends and contacts within the US Administration and Congress has long been that comprehensive reform of the US immigration system and procedures is likely to be the only manner by which such a resolution can be achieved.  The prospects for such reform would appear to have advanced in the wake of President Obama&rsquo;s re-election.  Through our Embassy in Washington and in close liaison with Irish-American community representatives, our contacts with the US Administration and Congress will intensify with a view to ensuring that the interests and concerns of undocumented Irish immigrants are captured in any future legislative deal in this area that emerges.  In this regard, I raised the issue with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during our bilateral meeting on 6 December last and recalled our strong support for comprehensive immigration legislation and the passage of E3 visas for Irish citizens.   </p><p>  Much further debate and discussion is likely to be required within the US political system as to what any future legislative deal might comprise.  It is therefore not possible at this stage to specify its contents or identify an exact timescale in which these may become clear but the area will continue to receive the Government&rsquo;s close attention over the period ahead.</p></reply>

The Government agreed with this recommendation of the Thornhill Group.</p><p>  I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, that his Department operates a grant scheme for the renewal or repair of thatched roofs.

In that regard, there is no application process to Revenue or otherwise. A transfer can take place once it complies with the requirements of the Regulations and the rules without prior Revenue approval. Under the Regulations, in the case of occupational pension schemes, the facility to transfer only applies to a scheme member who is entitled under the Pensions Act 1990 to &ldquo;preserved benefits&rdquo; under the scheme - in other words to a scheme member whose service in the relevant employment has terminated  .</p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is the responsibility of all trustees to ensure full compliance with the requirements of the Regulations. In essence, the Regulations require that, prior to making any overseas transfer payments, the trustees and PRSA providers must be satisfied that:</p><p>  (a)  The member has requested a transfer.</p><p>  (b) The overseas arrangement provides relevant benefits as defined by section 770 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.</p><p>  (c) The overseas arrangement has been approved by the appropriate regulatory authority in the country concerned. </p><p>  In practice, trustees and PRSA providers are required to obtain written confirmation to that effect from the trustees, custodians, managers or administrators of the overseas arrangement to which the transfer is to be made.</p><p>  I am advised by the Commissioners that if the transfer is to another EU Member State, Revenue rules require the overseas scheme to be operated or managed by an Institution for Occupational Retirement Provision (IORPS), within the meaning of the EU Pensions Directive (known as the &ldquo;IORPS Directive&rdquo;), and to be established in a Member State of the European Communities which has implemented the IORPS Directive in its national law. The scheme administrator must also be resident in an EU Member State. In broad terms, the purpose of the IORPS Directive is to ensure that members and beneficiaries of occupational pension schemes are properly informed about the rules and financial position of the scheme and their rights under the scheme, and to ensure the efficient management and investment of scheme assets.</p><p>  If the transfer is to a country outside the EU, under Revenue rules a transfer may not be made to a country other than the one in which the member is currently employed.</p><p>  I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in recent years two additional approval conditions have been introduced for all existing and new retirement benefit schemes and PRSAs in relation to overseas transfers. In late 2009, a condition was introduced to the effect that all overseas transfers under the provisions of the above mentioned Regulations may be made to facilitate bona fide transfers only, that is that they are not made with the primary purpose of circumventing Irish tax requirements. Early last year, in response to an apparent increase in requests to pension fund trustees and administrators for transfers of Irish pension funds abroad following newspaper advertisements encouraging such actions in order, for example, to access tax-free cash early, a further condition was introduced requiring a member of an occupational pension scheme or a PRSA contributor who directs the trustees of the scheme or the PRSA provider to make a transfer to an overseas scheme, to sign a declaration to the effect that the transfer conforms to the requirements of the Regulations and Revenue pension rules, is for bona fide reasons and is not primarily for the purpose of circumventing pension tax legislation and Revenue rules. </p><p>  Moving pension funds abroad in an effort to frustrate Irish tax rules would fall foul of these approval conditions and could ultimately result in approval being withdrawn which would have very significant consequences for any individual concerned.</p><p>  Tax relief given on pension savings is intended to encourage individuals to save for the long-term with a view to providing them with an income in retirement. That is why our tax rules, like those in many other jurisdictions, set a minimum age from which benefits from pension savings can normally be accessed. It is important that these rules are not abused and that savings built up with the benefit of generous tax reliefs are not misused. </p></reply>

The Agency generally has no objection in principle to considering other foreign law to govern its debt and is guided rather by commercial and pragmatic considerations with a view to minimising the burden of the National Debt on the tax payer.   With regard to the inclusion of Collective Action Clauses (CAC) in Irish Government Bonds issued this year, I am informed by the Agency that, following the conclusion of the European Council of 24-25 March 2011, a standardised and identical CAC including supplemental provisions was developed and agreed by the Economic and Financial Committee on 18 November 2011. In accordance with paragraph 3 of Article 12 of the ESM Treaty, the model CAC became mandatory for all new euro area government securities with a maturity above one year issued on or after 1 January 2013 and in a way which ensures the legal impact is identical in all Member States. This will be incorporated in any new issue of Irish Government Bonds. However, to ensure the smooth operation of the financial markets, it is possible to continue to issue or tap existing bonds which do not have CAC clauses. However, the degree to which a country can continue to issue existing bonds is limited. In 2013 the limit is 45% of the total face amount of all central government debt securities issued by that Member State.</p></reply>

However, I have received a number of submissions from, and on behalf of, private coach operators seeking to have this relief extended to them. I will consider these proposals and the level of the rebate in the context of the Finance Bill.  It is worth noting that one of key arguments for introducing a rebate for the haulage industry is the fact that a large quantity of fuel purchased by this industry is purchased abroad thus generating no tax revenue for the State.  A rebate should encourage hauliers to start purchasing their fuel in Ireland thus offsetting some of the costs involved. Such an argument does not exist for the most part for the coach industry. </p><p>  The fuel rebate scheme proposed is governed by the terms of Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 which limits its application to auto diesel used in defined categories of road vehicles. </p></reply>

A number of initiatives are being implemented at EU level in order to boost growth.  I believe the cumulative impact of all of these measures will be positive in terms of supporting economic activity in the EU at this difficult juncture.</p><p>  For instance, Heads of State or Government in the EU agreed on a compact for growth and jobs at the European Council on 28th and 29th June.  This involves action by both Member States themselves and at EU level in order to boost growth, investment and employment.</p><p>  Measures to be implemented at the national level include the full implementation of the country-specific recommendations from the European Semester, including the pursuit of differentiated and growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, the restoration of normal lending to the economy and the promotion of competitiveness.</p><p>  At an EU level, policies to promote growth include a renewed emphasis on deepening the Single Market and reducing the regulatory burden.  In addition, an important measure is the mobilisation of EUR120 billion - about 1 per cent of EU gross national income - to boost European growth.  These funds will be made available via EU structural funds, European Investment Bank lending, and the 2020 Project Bonds initiative, which entered its pilot phase last November.  Constituting part of these efforts is a EUR10 billion paid-in capital increase for the EIB, a substantial boost to its lending capacity. </p><p>  It is also worth pointing out the progress that has been made in terms of the European financial sector, in recognition of the important role this sector plays in terms of supporting growth in the EU.  </p><p>  Finally, considerable progress has been made at a euro area level to put the single currency on a more solid footing.  For instance, the establishment of the European Stability Mechanism and the ECB&rsquo;s announcement of Outright Monetary Transactions have helped restore confidence, while the enhanced system of governance will have a positive impact on economic activity.</p></reply>

This increase is an international phenomenon. Fuel prices are driven by a number of factors including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs. The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflected additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty in Northern Africa and the Middle East with potential supply disruptions. However, fuels prices have receded in recent times from highs experienced last year.   Contractors using such machinery in the course of farming work are entitled to use Marked Gas Oil (MGO). The current excise duty including the carbon charge on MGO is 10.23 cents per litre, this compares to 47.9 cents per litre in respect of auto-diesel. In terms of VAT, the reduced VAT rate of 13.5% applies to MGO and the standard VAT rate of 23% applies to auto-diesel. MGO is therefore taxed more favourably compared to auto-diesel. I will not be introducing a tax rebate for users of MGO.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-22a.259.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013012200058#WRF03100"><p>While I believe that there is considerable merit in making more information available to members of the public about the sources of Exchequer income and its expenditure, I must be conscious of the costs and practicalities of issuing every household who pays Local Property Tax with an annual receipt.    I believe that transparency is to be welcomed.  If people are better informed then they will better understand the need for current levels of taxation. It will also serve to enhance public knowledge of the extent of spending on our vast range of public services and, indeed, provide an increased understanding of their cost.</p><p>  The Local Property Tax will be collected by the Revenue Commissioners.  However, they do not issue statements to the vast majority of taxpayers and as part of their modernisation programme they are actively working to reduce the incidence of such statements.  The core mission of the Revenue Commissioners is the collection of taxes and duties, and the implementation of customs controls.   It has no function in decisions relating to the allocation or expenditure of Government funds arising from taxes received.  The proceeds of the Local Property Tax will accrue to local authorities and will support the provision of local services.  How this will be spent will vary from local authority to local authority and this information will not be readily available to Revenue.  Any requirement on Revenue to gather, analyse and provide details of how taxes were spent would be adding the burden of a non-core function on an already fully engaged office and could prove to be a drain on limited resources.  Decisions about the allocation of resources for local services would primarily be matters for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and for the local authorities themselves.</p><p>  Turning to the question of distributing statements, the most obvious and efficient mechanism to distribute any proposed statements to individuals is by way of an electronic interface.  However, in order to protect taxpayer confidentiality, any electronic system containing taxpayer information and data must be properly secured and accessible only through secure passwords and other protections.  Although Revenue has a number of online systems, they are designed for the declaration and collection of tax. They would require extensive and expensive development to reconfigure for use in the distribution of the data outlined in this parliamentary question.</p><p>  Not all taxpayers have, or indeed want, access to Revenue's online facilities.  Accordingly, in these cases, Revenue will be obliged to print and then post the data and information to individual taxpayers. The operational costs involved in this can be significant.  </p><p>  Furthermore, Revenue has found that in the past the distribution of unsolicited information has sometimes surprised many taxpayers and caused needless concern.  This gave rise to substantial increases in phone calls, letters and personal callers to Revenue offices.  These, often simple information or explanatory enquiries, resulted in the diversion of experienced staff away from essential tax compliance related functions. </p><p>  Taxpayers should be as well-informed as possible about where their money goes.  It is appropriate also that they should have confidence that their money is used wisely, by a Government which focuses on efficiency and effectiveness.  Having said that, I am not satisfied that the benefits to be derived from implementing a system of issuing every household who pays Local Property Tax with an annual receipt outlining the way the tax was spent would outweigh the costs and administrative burden involved.</p></reply>

Should authorisation on enhanced co-operation be granted, the Commission will bring forward a revised proposal for an FTT to be introduced in participating member states.

The framework documents define the relationship between the Minister and the relevant institutions.  These documents are structured to ensure that the institutions operate on a commercial basis and independent of the Minister in respect of their day to day operations.  As a result of the State&rsquo;s recapitalisation of Bank of Ireland, the State has a number of different investment interests in the Bank including equity, Preference Shares and the investment in the Contingent Capital Notes (CCNs). </p><p>  These give rise to a number of financial interactions between the Government and the Bank of Ireland. For instance, in July of 2012, the Government received the coupon interest on the CCNs of &euro;100m.  In February 2012, the Government received a dividend of &euro;188m in cash, on its preference shares and this year&rsquo;s dividend is expected, again in cash, next month. </p><p>  Under the terms of the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee (ELG) scheme, the Bank remits ELG fees on a quarterly basis to the Department. The ELG fees received by the Department from Bank of Ireland in 2012 were &euro;375.4m.  In addition Bank of Ireland is invoiced periodically in respect of administration and legal costs associated with implementation of the ELG scheme, the fees for which were &euro;92,087 for the period November 2011-October 2012.</p><p>  Two weeks ago, the Government was pleased to announce the sale of the Contingent Capital Notes (CCNs) at a profit to the Government of &euro;10m. The transaction settled on Tuesday the 15th of January and the State was paid proceeds of just over &euro;1,056 million, comprising the nominal principal amount of &euro;1,000 million, interest accrued of over &euro;46 million covering the period 29th July 2012 to the disposal date, and the profit of &euro;10 million.</p><p>  The Deputy should also be aware that officials from my Department meet with representatives of Bank of Ireland on a regular basis &ndash; including a monthly management meeting. This is the main forum for the Bank and Department to discuss matters of financial interest.</p></reply>

Any amounts withdrawn will be subject to tax at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate. The option will be available for 3 years from the passing of the 2013 Finance Bill which is expected to become law in early April at the latest.    This is a restricted measure which will enable rather than incentivise certain individuals to access part of their pension savings beyond their regular or compulsory pension contributions. I do not wish to damage future pension provision and it is important that individuals continue to provide for their retirement.

The overall results of the survey, which are available on the HEA website (www.hea.ie), were very positive, with over 75% of companies expressing confidence that graduates have the right workplace and transferable skills and relevant subject or discipline knowledge. While satisfaction levels with written communications was lower than in other specific skill areas, only 14% of employers reported being dissatisfied with these skills.  The National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030 includes ease in written communication as one of the key generic skills that students should acquire during their undergraduate education.  Support of the implementation of the Strategy recommendations in relation to improving this and other teaching and learning quality outcomes will be a key priority of the new National Forum for Teaching and Learning which I launched last November.  </p></reply>

For families of less than four dependent children, the threshold for the payment of the student contribution is &euro;51,380.  A further income threshold of &euro;55,920 exists for a grant of 50% towards the student contribution.  This ensures that students from lower socioeconomic groups are not adversely impacted by the increases in the student contribution.  The higher education access programmes continue to be supported by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) with funding from my Department as part of the implementation of the current National Access Plan (2008-2013).  Some &euro;29 million was allocated to 27 higher education institutions in 2012 as the access premium in their core funding and the HEA has advised my Department that the same magnitude of funding will be allocated for access in 2013.  Work has commenced by the HEA on the development of a new national access plan for 2014 onwards.  This will include new targets to increase participation by under-represented groups.  Further dialogue between the HEA and institutions on access funding and programmes will also take place as part of the implementation of the National Strategy for Higher Education.</p></reply>

The roll-out of the approved process now provides an opportunity to meet the commitment set out in the Programme for Government to &quot;explore the establishment of a multi-campus Technical University in the South East&quot;.  In relation to the evolutionary pathway laid out in the National Strategy for institutes of technology, the implementation process is well under way.  The Landscape document published in February 2012 lays out a clear four stage process and criteria for institutes of technology who wish to apply for designation as a technological university.   The process for designation is designed to ensure educational quality, objectivity, international expertise, fairness and transparency.   The process will consist of four stages overseen by HEA, with an independent international panel of experts to advise the Authority in the final stages.  The first stage requires institutes of technology to submit a formal expression of interest in merging and seeking designation.  I understand from HEA that three such expressions of interest have been received.  One of these is a proposal that Waterford Institute of Technology and Carlow Institute of Technology to seek designation.  The Higher Education Authority is considering all proposals and its advice on system configuration in March 2013 will include advice on the progress of institutes of technology interested in seeking designation to the second stage of the designation process.  Having regard to the process that has been put in place to assess proposals for designation as technological universities, I do not propose to comment specifically on any potential applications for designation by any group of Institutes of Technology.</p></reply>

The decision making authority for any amalgamation belongs to the Patron of a school, subject to the approval of the Minister for Education and Skills.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the staffing arrangements in small primary schools are considerably more favourable that other medium to larger schools, consequently, it is important to retain a sense of perspective and balance when discussing this matter. For example, a two teacher school with 32 pupils has an average class size of 1 teacher for sixteen pupils. In contrast, a typical ten teacher school with 272 pupils has an average class size of 27.2 pupils.</p><p>  The numbers of pupils in these schools is relatively small, so it is not necessarily the case that capital investment would be needed to support amalgamation. However, each case is assessed on an individual basis to determine the extent and type of accommodation required taking into account the condition of buildings, site capacity etc. My Department would discuss any issues arising with the boards of management of the schools and would aim to provide an appropriate accommodation solution subject to available resources.</p></reply>

The work of the expert group informs the selection of new targeted programmes designed to provide interventions to tackle the skills shortages in particular elements of the economy, e.g. Springboard, Momentum and the ICT skills conversion initiative, which was introduced as part of the ICT Action Plan.</p><p>  In 2013, there will be continued targeted investment in over 430,000 part-time and full-time places across the further and higher education and training sectors, all of which are open to unemployed people including young people and the long-term unemployed.</p><p>  This investment includes the provision of the Skillnets Training Networks Programme, which is enterprise-led by nature, where the development of training is led by representatives of industry to ensure that training provision meets the identified needs of the network stakeholders and companies.  Furthermore, the establishment of SOLAS, will facilitate a coherent integrated strategic national response across the further education and training sectors and will ensure a greater focus on the evolving skill requirements of the unemployed and of industry. Under SOLAS, training and further education courses will be constantly reviewed to ensure that they are fully aligned to meet the skills needs of enterprise.</p><p>  The establishment of SOLAS is part of a complex range of related reforms including the transformation of the 33 VECs into 16 Education and Training Boards.</p></reply>

In particular, they should ensure, as far as possible, that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and the differential between the largest and the smallest classes is kept to a minimum. With over 20,000 individual classes spread across all schools throughout the country there will always be differences in individual class sizes.  Class size data for all primary schools is compiled by my Department on an annual basis and is available on the Department's website. The most recently published data relates to the 2011/12 school year. The staffing schedule is the mechanism used for allocating mainstream teaching posts to all schools. It currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools. Schools have autonomy on how these posts are deployed to individual classes.</p></reply>

Teachers and SNAs who had been absent on statutory unpaid maternity leave could also avail of leave in lieu for public holidays which occurred during that period.  These additional days, which were taken during a period when the school was open, required the school to employ a substitute teacher or SNA to cover the absence.</p><p>  Statistics are normally provided by my Department on a school year basis and, for the 2011/12 school year, 2378 teachers and 294 Special Needs Assistants availed of maternity leave in lieu.  The Government has decided it is no longer justifiable to provide additional paid days off for those on maternity leave and this arrangement has been ended. This will not affect a teacher or SNA's entitlements to 26 weeks' paid leave and an optional 16 weeks' unpaid maternity leave.  A similar change has been made to adoptive leave in lieu.</p><p>  I am conscious that teachers may be already planning their maternity leave arrangements and I have given the sector as much notice as possible before implementing this change. It will take effect from 1 May 2013, and will deliver savings of up to &euro;20m in a full year. Days in lieu of maternity leave will not be accrued on and from 1 May 2013 but any remaining leave in lieu on that date may be taken after it.</p><p>  My alternative choice in this Budget was to increase the pupil-teacher ratio for all mainstream schools and I decided to retain the existing ratio in order to avoid having larger class sizes for our children.</p></reply>

The most recent statistics are for the 2011/12 school year. The national average class size is 24.4 pupils.  However, with over 20,600 classes in over 3,100 primary schools throughout the country there will always be variations in class sizes at individual school level.

Following a Government-wide review of the public capital programme, a five year multi-annual envelope for 2012 to 2016 was set in November 2011; this was slightly adjusted in Budget 2013 to address pressures relating to contractual commitments, drawdown of EU funding, replacement of Garda vehicles and to allow for the progression of a new children's detention facility at Oberstown. In deciding on the capital allocations, the Government gave strong consideration to the employment impact of the investment and on the economic and social infrastructure needs.</p><p>  There will, of course, be direct employment benefits in the delivery of the infrastructure proposed in the Investment Framework and most importantly from the contribution that this capital investment makes to providing the capacity for the economy to grow. In this context, supports to the enterprise sector through agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and the IDA were protected in the review of the Public Capital Programme. The unprecedented level of investment over the past few years delivered through the Enterprise Development Agencies helps to foster sustainable and valuable employment in the exporting sectors of the economy which will be critical to recovery. My Department had a central role in conducting the Capital Review and in developing the multi-annual investment framework.</p><p>  The Government decides on annual allocations taking account of the overall budgetary position, strategic investment needs and the benefits that will flow from investment, including employment. Each spending Department then considers the expected cash requirements for each of its projects and constructs its profile of how much cash it will need to draw down each month from its allocation for the year. These monthly profiles are published for each Department.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, capital spending has general characteristics which influence the drawdown pattern. Expenditure on capital projects typically occurs in large tranches at fixed milestones, unlike current expenditure which is generally continuous throughout the year. Obviously, this affects the phasing and profiling of capital expenditure. In addition, public financial rules require that payments are only made on foot of matured liabilities, so payments are made on foot of work that has already been satisfactorily completed. The trend is therefore that the bulk of capital expenditure takes place in the final quarter of the year. For these reasons it is not appropriate for employment and job creation to be factored into the administrative exercise of profiling monthly cash drawdown requirements from annual capital allocations, although these factors are, of course, critical in formulating Government decisions on the capital budgetary allocations in the first place.	</p></reply>

The revaluation programme which has been completed in three County Council areas in Dublin began in November 2005 in the South Dublin County Council area and has since been rolled out to the areas covered by Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Councils.  The revaluation of South Dublin was completed in December 2007, Fingal was completed in 2009 and D&uacute;n Laoghaire- Rathdown was completed in 2010.  The revaluation of Dublin City Council area began in May 2011 and will be completed in 2013.  The Commissioner signed valuation orders for Waterford on 12th December, 2011 and Limerick on 29th March, 2012. The Waterford and Limerick revaluations will be completed in 2013 and 2014 respectively.  At that stage, approximately 33% of all rateable properties in the country, representing over 50% of the national valuation base in monetary terms, will have been revalued. It is intended to extend the revaluation programme to further local authority areas as soon as it is practicable to do so but it is not possible at present to say where these areas will be.  The Commissioner of Valuation, in accordance with the Act, consults with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and with the rating authority concerned before making an order.</p></reply>

My understanding is that this situation has arisen due to difficulties across its operations in the UK and Ireland, caused by dramatic changes in the way music and films are bought and sold.  As it operates in the domestic market, this company is not supported by the State's enterprise agencies. Clearly, my hope is that jobs can be saved.</p><p>  Consumers who purchased vouchers using payment cards from companies that subsequently go out of business may be able to recover the amount spent on the gift voucher under the charge back rule. Such consumers should contact their card issuer.  With a view to prioritising the interests of taxpayers and employees of insolvent companies, Irish company law provides a ranking of creditors, which determines the order in which different types of creditors are paid in the event of an insolvency.  Holders of gift vouchers in an insolvency situation are considered unsecured creditors, and rank after other creditors such as the Revenue on behalf of the taxpayer and employees.  I consider that this priority accorded to taxpayers and employees is correct, and as such I have no plans currently to alter this ranking.</p></reply>

The headline Europe 2020 target is focused on employed persons aged 20 to 64 as a percentage of the population aged 20 to 64. Member States may set their own national targets in the light of the headline Europe 2020 target taking into account their relative starting positions and national circumstances and draw up national reform programmes setting out the actions they aim to undertake in order to implement the strategy.</p><p>  As noted in the Social Justice Ireland report &quot;<i>Ireland and the Europe 2020 Strategy,&quot; </i>Ireland's National Reform Programme 2011 set an employment rate target range for Ireland of 69%-71% for 2020.  The NRP also stated that the target level of ambition would be reviewed in 2014 in the context of the mid-term review of the Europe 2020 strategy.  Ireland's employment rate for 20-64yrs rose from 66.4% in 1998 to a peak of 73.8% in 2007.  This growth was underpinned by rapid increases in employment, particularly in sectors such as construction, financial services, health and education, and was assisted by long term positive increases in educational attainment and higher female participation.  Moreover, this increase in the employment rate occurred while the 20-64 years population was itself growing rapidly - from 2.12 million in 1998 to 2.74 million on 2007.</p><p>  Ireland's employment rate 20-64yrs averaged 63.8% in 2011.  The rate at Q3 2012 was also 63.8%.  The main factors underpinning the decline since 2007 are the decrease in the construction sector, agriculture, industry (traditional manufacturing) and locally traded services.  In contrast to the period of strong labour market performance up to mid-2008, labour markets throughout the EU experienced a sharp setback in 2009.  After several years of relatively strong labour market performance, the economic crisis led to a sudden reversal of employment growth which threatened to sweep away much of the success of previous years.  Labour market performance worsened across all Member States, but most notably in the Baltic States, Ireland and Spain.  Most Member States have since recorded an employment level below that of four years ago.  The EU Employment Guidelines and the EU employment targets, which are non-binding, have remained unchanged since 2010 and the European Council has declined to make small changes in the targets in order to 'engineer' or 'fine-tune' them given the high degree of uncertainty in labour market projections.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs is the Government's main policy response to supporting job creation.  The Action Plan is a multi-annual process that commenced in 2012, with 270 specific commitments across all Government Departments and 36 agencies that will help to support jobs growth.</p><p>  In spite of a very difficult domestic and external economic environment, we are beginning to see the positive impact of the Government's policies.  2012 saw significant net job creation by EI and IDA-supported companies, building on the positive results of 2011 and following successive years of significant net job losses.   In spite of continued job losses in more traditional sectors such as Construction, and Financial, Insurance and Administrative activities, we have seen an increase in employment in sectors targeted by the Action Plan for Jobs, for example Tourism Agri-food, ICT and Digital Gaming.  I am currently coordinating the preparation of the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government and this Plan will be published in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

For the period 2011-2013 maximum aid rates available for large firms are 15%; for medium and small firms the rates they are 25% and 35% respectively.</p><p>  The reason for the higher rates in the BMW region is due to it being classified under the Regional Aid Guidelines at the time of designation in 2006 as an &ldquo;economic development region&rdquo;.

The aid intensity thresholds for each category of region are predetermined in the Guidelines by the Commission.  The purpose of regional aid is to support investment and job creation and encourage firms to set up new establishments in Europe's most disadvantaged regions.  As a result, the thresholds reduce on a sliding scale basis, with the highest rates available to the most severely disadvantaged or geographically isolated regions of the EU.</p><p>Under the Guidelines, the Mid-West NUTS 3 sub-region lost the right to grant investment aid to large firms at the end of 2008.  Following a Mid-term Review in 2010, the Commission accepted a case for the restoration of regional investment aid to the Mid-West sub region on the basis of the rapid increase in unemployment, exacerbated by the job losses in Dell and also the lower GDP per capita figures when compared to the national average and other comparable regions.  This means that aid for large investment projects is again allowed for the counties in the Mid-West sub region (Clare, Limerick, North Tipperary) at an aid rate of 10%.</p><p>The details of the support in terms of aid intensity currently available for each county are available on my Department's website, and are also listed in the following tables.</p><p><b>Regional Aid Map 2007-2013 &ndash; IRELAND</b>  <b> (as reviewed by Commission Decision</b></p><p><b>N130/2010 &ndash; Official Journal c 226/5 21.8.2010)</b></p><p><b>BORDER, MIDLANDS and WEST REGION</b></p><p><b> </b>LARGE FIRMS</p><p><table><tr><th><div><b><font face="Times New Roman">Period</font></b></div></th><th><div><b><font face="Times New Roman">2007-2010</font></b></div></th><th><div><b><font face="Times New Roman">2011-2013</font></b></div></th></tr><tr><td><div><font face="Times New Roman">Aid Rate</font><font face="Times New Roman">(Gross Grant Equivalent)</font></div></td><td><div><font face="Times New Roman"> </font><font face="Times New Roman">30%</font></div></td><td><div><font face="Times New Roman"> </font><font face="Times New Roman">15%</font></div></td></tr></table></p><p><bu>MEDIUM FIRMS</bu></p><p><table><tr><th><div><b><font face="Times New Roman">Period</font></b></div></th><th><div><b><font face="Times New Roman">2007-2010</font></b></div></th><th><div><b><font face="Times New Roman">2011-2013</font></b></div></th></tr><tr><td><div><font face="Times New Roman">Aid Rate</font><font face="Times New Roman">(Gross Grant Equivalent)</font></div></td><td><div><font face="Times New Roman"> </font><font face="Times New Roman">40%</font></div></td><td><div><font face="Times New Roman"> </font><font face="Times New Roman">25%</font></div></td></tr></table></p><p><bu>SMALL FIRMS</bu></p><p><table><tr><th><div><b><font face="Times New Roman">Period</font></b></div></th><th><div><b><font face="Times New Roman">2007- 2010</font></b></div></th><th><div><b><font face="Times New Roman">2011-2013</font></b></div></th></tr><tr><td><div><font face="Times New Roman">Aid Rate</font><font face="Times New Roman">(Gross Grant Equivalent)</font></div></td><td><div><font face="Times New Roman"> </font><font face="Times New Roman">50%</font></div></td><td><div><font face="Times New Roman"> </font><font face="Times New Roman">35%</font></div></td></tr></table></p><p><b>SOUTHERN &amp;amp; EASTERN REGION</b></p><p><bu>LARGE FIRMS</bu></p><p><table><tr><th><div><b><font face="Times New Roman">Area</font></b></div></th><th><div><b><font face="Times New Roman">Period</font></b></div></th><th><div><b><font face="Times New Roman">Aid Rate</font></b><b><font face="Times New Roman">(Gross Grant Equivalent)</font></b></div></th></tr><tr><td><b><font face="Times New Roman">South East sub-Region </font></b><br /><br /><font face="Times New Roman">(Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, Waterford, South Tipperary) and designated islands</font><sup>1</sup></td><td><div><font face="Times New Roman">2007-2013</font></div></td><td><div><font face="Times New Roman">10%</font></div></td></tr><tr><td><b><font face="Times New Roman">Mid West</font></b><br /><br /><font face="Times New Roman">(Clare, Limerick, North Tipperary</font><sup>2</sup><b><font face="Times New Roman"> </font></b><font face="Times New Roman">)</font><b><font face="Times New Roman"> </font></b></td><td><div><font face="Times New Roman">2007-2013</font><sup>3</sup></div></td><td><div><font face="Times New Roman">10%</font></div></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Times New Roman">Kerry, Cork (entire county)</font></td><td><div><font face="Times New Roman">2007-2008</font></div></td><td><div><font face="Times New Roman">10%</font></div></td></tr><tr><td><br /><font face="Times New Roman">-</font></td><td><div><font face="Times New Roman">2009-2013</font></div></td><td><div><font face="Times New Roman">0%</font></div></td></tr></table></p><p><pcenter>Lower aid rates apply to Large Investment Projects (i.e. &amp;gt; &euro;50 million)</pcenter></p><p>1Bear, Cleire, Dursey, Heir, Long, Sherkin, Whiddy</p><p>2As a result of Commission Decision N 130/2010, large investment aid and aid for investment projects with eligible expenditure exceeding EUR 25 million is once again permitted for these three counties.

During 2012, with IDA&rsquo;s support, a number of companies made significant investments in locations outside of Dublin and Cork.  Paypal announced 1,000 jobs in Dundalk, Abbott announced 175 jobs in Sligo, Mylan announced 200 jobs in Galway, Allergan announced 200 jobs in Westport and Northern Trust announced 400 jobs in Limerick.  Last week Visticon announced that it was investing over &euro;100million in the expansion of its manufacturing operations in Limerick with the creation of 100 new highly skilled manufacturing jobs and 200 temporary construction jobs. All of these announcements augur well for regional economic development throughout Ireland.</p><p>  IDA Ireland has indicated that, in seeking to attract FDI to Ireland, it recognises that leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world class physical and digital infrastructure in addition to the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services.  Accordingly, in order to achieve regional economic development, IDA prioritises the marketing of Gateway locations within each Region as the locations of critical mass and highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.  During 2012, as part of its marketing activities, IDA Ireland began an online marketing initiative, &ldquo;Connect &amp;amp; Invest&rdquo;, to showcase the unique attributes of each region to international clients.  In addition, IDA also promotes other locations as part of its marketing efforts in response to specific client requirements.</p><p>  A key component of a Gateway Economic Region&rsquo;s value proposition are the existing industry clusters which originated with the arrival of several large multinational companies through the support of IDA Ireland and which, in turn, create the development of an indigenous sub-supply base assisted, in some cases, by Enterprise Ireland.  A number of these Irish-owned companies, particularly in the Life Sciences Sector, have since become significant international players in their own right.  These clusters are primarily located in Gateway locations.</p><p>  IDA Ireland has also explained that, typically, a company is shown three or four locations within a Gateway Economic Region that can meet its requirements.  In certain cases other locations are visited on an opportunistic basis.  In selecting locations to market to client companies, IDA Ireland also endeavours to include locations which have been affected by closures/job losses.  Whilst IDA Ireland seeks to influence the selection of a location, the final decision on where to locate is taken in all cases by the client company based on its business requirements.</p></reply>

The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 was particularly focused in relation to assisting the small business sector to cope with the current economic crisis and to prepare businesses for future growth and job creation.  Various initiatives were introduced during 2012 such as:</p><p>- Legislation to reform statutory wage setting mechanisms;</p><p>- A reduction or freezing of charges levied on business by Government across a large range of Government Departments and Agencies;</p><p>- The enactment of the Legal Services Bill which will place downward pressure on insurance costs;</p><p>- The &euro;90m Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme;</p><p>- The &euro;450m Credit Guarantee Scheme;</p><p>- The &euro;120m second call under Innovation Fund Ireland;</p><p>- The &euro;150m Development Capital Scheme;</p><p>- The development of a new Small and Micro Business Division within Enterprise Ireland (EI) as a centre of excellence in the provision of supports to the small and micro-enterprise sectors; and</p><p>- The establishment of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) to provide a &ldquo;First-stop-shop&rdquo; for small businesses with Local Authorities.</p><p>  In December 2012, I published the Companies Bill which will result in substantial improvements to the ease of doing business in Ireland and will implement a series of major reforms to reduce red tape and make it easier and cheaper to run a company.  It will save businesses across Ireland many millions of euro in reduced professional fees, compliance costs and red tape, and will ultimately make it easier to create jobs.  Furthermore, small companies will be able to apply to the Circuit Court for Examinership which means that it will be cheaper and easier for businesses to restructure their debts.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2013, which will be published shortly, will continue to support SMEs by way of a whole of Government approach to taking action and implementing reform, to ensure that the business environment is conducive to business survival through the current difficulties, growing and expanding business and providing fresh job opportunities.</p></reply>

For those customers with Electric Ireland and BGE, this amount will appear as a cash credit of &euro;35 on their bill.  Other customers will continue to receive a cash allowance as before.</p><p>  Between 2005 and 2011 the number in receipt of the electricity/gas allowance rose by 20% and there are now 405,000 recipients in receipt of an allowance.  The cost of the electricity and gas allowances has risen from &euro;110 million in 2005 to an estimated outturn of &euro;201 million in 2012, an increase of 83% over seven years.  In the current economic climate these increases were unsustainable.</p><p>  This change to the electricity and gas elements of the household benefits package will bring significant savings, with estimated expenditure in 2013 of &euro;176 million, while aiming to encourage customers to achieve better savings through greater mobility.  The Affordable Energy Strategy drew attention to the fact that customers in receipt of household benefits were much less likely than other customers to switch energy supplier to obtain better value.  Only 16% of social welfare customers have switched companies compared to 42% nationally.  There will also be some administrative efficiency through simplification of the scheme with one payment rate instead of five.</p><p>  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), following discussions with officials from my Department, has been liaising with the National Consumer Agency with a view to ensuring that information is available for our customers to help with switching companies.  In August 2011 the CER published a paper which set out a framework for accreditation for price comparison websites (CER/11/144) following which a website  was accredited.  This website presents comparison data which can greatly assist those wishing to switch companies and achieve the best value.</p></reply>

In the case of contributory pensions this involves commencing payment of contributions 10 years before pension age, payment of a minimum number of contributions at an appropriate rate and reaching a minimum average annual contribution rate.  The State pension (contributory) is a valuable benefit and the conditions are designed to ensure that those qualifying have had a sufficient and on-going attachment to the social insurance system. </p><p>  The qualification conditions for State pension for the self-employed are as follows:</p><p>  The person must:-</p><p>- Have entered insurance before 56<sup>th</sup> birthday;</p><p>- Have a minimum of 520 full-rate paid contributions;</p><p>- Have paid a minimum of 1 year of self-employment contributions prior to 66th birthday;</p><p>- Have a yearly-average of at least 48 (for maximum SPC rate award) from the date of first payment of social insurance to the end of the last complete tax year prior to 66th birthday;</p><p>- Have a yearly average of at least 10 (for minimum SPC entitlement) (5 possible rate bands between 10-48);</p><p>- (Only) where the applicant commenced paying self-employment PRSI from 6/4/1988, in calculating their yearly-average, that date can be taken as the commencement date, if more advantageous.</p><p>  A special pension for the self-employed was introduced in 1999 to enable people who were over age 56 at the time of the introduction of PRSI for the self-employed in 1988, and who could not therefore meet the standard qualifying conditions, to receive a contributory pension.</p><p>  To qualify for the half rate pension a person must:-</p><p>- Have reached their  56<sup>th</sup> birthday before 6/4/1988;</p><p>- Have commenced paying self-employment PRSI on/after 6/4/1988;</p><p>- Have a minimum of 520 full-rate contributions paid since starting to pay self-employment contributions.</p><p>  It is worth noting that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund found that in terms of value for money, that the self-employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed - when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.</p></reply>

Increasing the amount of means from self-employment, which is assessed against the claimant from 85% to 100%; and</p><p>- b.

(For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 4.25%).  </p><p>  In 2011 I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare to meet the commitment made in the Programme for Government.  The Advisory Group is charged with, inter alia, examining and reporting on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.</p><p>  The Advisory Group&rsquo;s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the Terms of Reference.  Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support.  The Group has been considering the issue of social insurance coverage for the self-employed and will submit its report once its examination of the various questions has been completed.</p><p>  The third Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, as at 31 December 2010, was completed by consultants KPMG in June 2012 and laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 24 August 2012.  The Review covers a 55 year period from 2011&ndash;2066 and builds on the findings of the 2000 and 2005 Actuarial Reviews of the Fund.</p><p>  One of the issues examined in the 2010 Review was the long-term cost implications to the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and the break-even contributions rates required to provide invalidity pensions to the self-employed and to provide jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for self-employed workers.  The report found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), which is the benefit currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  An incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in addition to core State pension (contributory) is provided.  The average contribution rate required for the core State pension (contributory) plus jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the invalidity pension is estimated to be in the region of 17.3%.</p><p>  Any proposals to revise the social insurance system for self-employed persons by extending social insurance entitlements will have to be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of the finding of the Actuarial Review that the self-employed achieve very good value for money compared with the employed &ndash; when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.</p><p>  Self-employed workers may access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p></reply>

Age of retirement is determined by the employment contract. </p><p>  Changes in demographics and increasing longevity as well as a need to ensure the sustainability of pensions into the future has been a key focus of pensions policy. This is compounded by the wider need for sustainable public finances.</p><p>  As provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 State pension age will be standardised at 66 years.  This will result in the State pension (transition) which applies for one year for persons at age 65 ceasing from 2014.  Thereafter, State pension age will increase to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028. </p><p>  The changes to the age at which people qualify for the State pension now and in the future are essential reform measures if we are to continue to provide the financial support that people expect in retirement. The central objective is to reform the system of social protection so that it is viable into the future and the pension reform measures underway address some of these issues. </p><p>  The Department of Social Protection will always continue to provide the normal supports to those who can&rsquo;t, for whatever reason, continue working or find themselves in financial difficulty.  For those with an income need social welfare schemes will continue to be available, for those who fulfil the eligibility criteria.</p><p>  Longer working will be a key feature of future pensions systems worldwide and Ireland is no different.

It provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals on the Live Register, in organisations in the private, public and community voluntary sectors and at present is limited to individuals who are in receipt of a live claim (jobseeker's allowance jobseeker's benefit/one parent family payment/disability allowance) or are signing on for credits for at least 3 of the last 6 months (78 Days).</p><p>The JobBridge Scheme has made significant progress since it came into operation on the 1st July 2011.  Some 13,770 internships have commenced to date with 5,548 participants currently on an internship as at 17th January 2013 and over 1,900 internship opportunities presently advertised on www.jobbridge.ie.</p><p>  The eligibility to access the National Internship Scheme is based on the overall objective of labour market policy to provide a pathway to paid employment for people who are unemployed.</p><p>  At present an eligible participant can avail of a placement on an internship work experience opportunity under the National Internship Scheme (NIS) for a 6 month (26 weeks) period or a 9 month (39 weeks) period. A six month internship may be extended , at the conclusion of the period, to nine months. An individual may avail of up to two placements on the National Internship Scheme, the total cumulative time not exceeding 9 months (39 weeks) over the two year period. The duration of any individual internship is determined, within these guidelines,  by the host organisations </p><p>  The time limits set for the duration of internships are designed to minimise the potential displacement of &lsquo;real&rsquo; jobs by subsidised internship opportunities.  The Department of Social Protection does not allow for any exceptions in relation to the eligibility criteria for JobBridge internship placements.</p><p>  An independent evaluation of the Scheme is currently being undertaken by Indecon International Economic Consultants and is anticipated that a final report will be published in the coming weeks. As part of its remit Indecon has been asked to include recommendations on how the Scheme might be improved or expanded. I will consider any such recommendations carefully.</p><p>  It is not possible to comment on the specific case raised by the Deputy without greater details on the circumstances of the participants or internships concerned. If the Deputy wishes to provide such details, officials in my Department will pursue the matter further.</p></reply>

There was a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals from 2009 to date which has placed extraordinary pressure on the SWAO. Significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, improving business processes and implementing a new operating model.  The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012 (There were 33,129 appeals finalised in 2012).  There is a major programme of process redesign and modernisation currently underway in relation to many scheme areas which will reduce backlogs and will also reduce the time taken for the Department to respond to requests from the SWAO for submissions in relation to appeals.  It is planned to recruit 8 additional Medical Assessors in 2013.  All these measures together will reduce the waiting time for appellants.  However, by its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial process, the processing of appeals takes time even at the best of times and reflects the fact that while every effort is made to deal with appeals as fast as possible this cannot be at the expense of fairness of due process.</p></reply>

Those elements of service supported by the CSP are required to be in line with the business plan agreed with the Department and Pobal for the contracting period which is generally three years in duration.  It is entirely a matter for the company to develop its services and examine the feasibility of expanding its service to include new areas of operation or coverage.  A feature of the CSP is the requirement of the contract holder to generate a substantial level of its resources from the fees charged for services or other traded income.  The value of the contract with Vantastic in 2012 was some &euro;835,700 which includes a consolidated grant previously paid by the Department of Justice and Equality.  I expect the same level of resources will be available to the company in 2013.</p></reply>

However, in 2012 there were 2,690 IQAs in payment on State pension transition (SPT).  If one uses CSO and this administrative data for 2012, it is estimated that some 6.5% of those aged over 65 year olds were awarded  an IQA on SPT.

Employers who pay statutory redundancy payments to their employees are entitled to a rebate of a portion of that payment from the State if the date of dismissal by reason of redundancy is before 1 January 2013.  </p><p>  In Budget 2012 I reduced the level of the rebate from 60% to 15% and in Budget 2013 the Government decided to remove the redundancy rebate to employers in respect of redundancies where the date of dismissal is on or after 1 January 2013.</p><p>  Where an employer can prove that he/she cannot afford to pay a statutory redundancy payment, the State makes a lump sum payment directly to the individual and a debt is raised against the employer which the State will endeavour to recover.  The Budget change will have no impact on the level of these payments.</p><p>  Rebates to employers and lump sums paid directly to employees are paid from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF).</p><p>  I am very concerned about the deficit in the SIF.  One of the factors which influenced the Government&rsquo;s decision to reduce the level of the rebate initially and to remove it in Budget 2013 was the increasing cost of rebates in recent years.</p><p>  In term of redundancy rebate payments to employers, &euro;152.2 million was paid out in 2006; &euro;167.4 million in 2007; &euro;161.8 million in 2008; &euro;247.9 million in 2009; &euro;373.2 million in 2010 and &euro;185.3 million in 2011.  The amounts paid out in lump sums to employees have also increased.  While the SIF is constituted primarily from employer contributions, the taxpayers&rsquo; contribution is also significant.  </p><p>  I do not see why this country should continue to borrow money to plug the hole in the Social Insurance Fund in order to compensate often profitable companies for the cost of making their employees redundant in Ireland and, in some cases, transferring their employment abroad.</p><p>  The continuation of the rebate payment is not sustainable in the current economic climate.  While this may cause difficulties for employers it should be noted that redundancy rebate payments to employers are not common in many EU and other jurisdictions.  The new arrangements bring Ireland more closely into line with practice in other countries.   </p><p>  It is not proposed to introduce a tiered system of redundancy rebate rates or to make exceptions for small businesses.</p></reply>

Child benefit is paid to around 600,000 families in respect of some 1.15 million children. The Government is conscious that child benefit, as a universal payment, can be an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment.  </p><p>  Given the universal nature of child benefit, claimants are not asked to make a declaration of their income or that of other members in their family.  It is not therefore possible to make a reliable estimate on the basis of available data of the percentages of households with children receiving child benefit in the income categories detailed.  A detailed estimate of this nature would not only require current household income data but also detailed specifications of the definition of income, whose income was to be included, what time period was to be considered etc.</p></reply>

The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated and there is free entry to the market.</p><p>  The taxation of oil products is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance.</p><p>  The upward trend in global oil prices arises primarily from the increases in the international commodity prices over which Ireland has no control.  For example, the spot price of a barrel of Brent Crude Oil has risen from a low of US$90 in June 2012 to US$111 in January 2013.  This has inevitably resulted in an increase in retail oil prices.</p><p>  Against this background my focus, and that of the Government, is on interventions that can assist in mitigating to some degree, increases in energy prices. </p><p>  At a general policy level this involves measures to improve energy efficiency and increase the penetration of renewable energy resources in the areas of electricity and transport.</p><p>  I am very aware that many households are experiencing financial hardship due to the current economic difficulties.  As such, the Government is taking a range of actions to address the challenge of affordable energy for vulnerable households.  Over the last ten years &euro;2 billion has been distributed in energy supports under the National Fuel Scheme and the Household Benefits Package administered by the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>  In addition, &euro;100 million has been spent, from my own Department&rsquo;s Vote, on energy efficiency improvements in vulnerable homes.  Permanent improvements to the thermal efficiency of houses are the most cost-effective means of addressing energy poverty.</p><p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) administers on behalf of my Department, the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme, which is free-of-charge to eligible applicants.  With over 93,000 homes refurbished to date, 2013 will see approximately 10,000 low-income households benefit from energy efficiency upgrades.  I have allocated approximately &euro;20 million to the Warmer Homes Scheme in 2013.</p><p>  More generally, the Government&rsquo;s Strategy for Affordable Energy in Ireland was launched by me in November 2011.  The Strategy sets out our plans for enhancing the affordability of energy for low-income households.  The strategy includes 48 actions that will be implemented over the life of the Strategy.</p><p>  The Inter-Departmental Group on Affordable Energy has established subgroups to work on particular dimensions of the Strategy.  These include the implementation of revised eligibility criteria for the Warmer Homes scheme and a pilot programme to assess the feasibility of an area-based approach to delivery of the Scheme.</p><p>  In the area of transport the development of electric vehicles offers potential for Ireland, not just in terms of energy efficiency but also because of the ability to use cheaper grid sourced electricity, an increasing amount of which will be sourced from renewable resources as we progressively deliver on our ambitious target of 40% renewable electricity generation by 2020.  The Government has introduced a grant scheme for electric vehicles to provide an incentive to encourage their uptake.</p><p>  In addition, the Biofuel Obligation Scheme incentivises and enables the sustainable growth of an Irish biofuels market affording opportunities for indigenous biofuel producers and allowing for the displacement of traditional oil products in the transport sector.</p><p>  The Statutory Biofuel Obligation Scheme was introduced in July 2010 and currently requires that the amount of biofuel brought to the market is not less than 6.38% of the relevant disposal of petroleum road transport fuels.  The Scheme ensured that 144.5 million litres of biofuel were brought to the Irish market in 2011.  The Better Energy programme provides Exchequer supported incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy upgrades, as well as bringing on board energy suppliers as partners to directly offer upgrade services to consumers.</p><p>  Delivery on these commitments will progressively reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels, while supporting energy competitiveness and security.  </p></reply>

Responsibility for the regulation of the retail electricity market is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  Since 4 April 2011 prices in the electricity retail market have been fully deregulated and business and domestic customers can as a result avail of competitive offerings from a number of electricity supply companies.  Price setting by electricity suppliers is a commercial and operational matter for the companies operating in the retail market.</p><p>  With regard to the regulation of gas prices the position is that up until 1 October 2011 the CER regulated Bord G&aacute;is Energy tariffs for its residential and smaller business customers but price regulation for the latter group ended at that point.  The CER still regulates the Bord G&aacute;is Energy tariffs for its residential customers.  I have no function in the matter.  The timing for complete deregulation of the residential segment of the gas market, as has taken place in the electricity market, is an issue under active review by the CER.</p><p>  In making its decision, the CER takes account of the need to protect consumers from unnecessary price increases by ensuring that only reasonable legitimate costs are recovered by BGE.  Full deregulation leading to further competition will keep downward pressure on prices for consumers.  In particular, Ireland is a price taker for gas.</p><p>  The Government is most concerned at the impact of higher energy prices on residential and commercial consumers.  It is the case however, that Ireland in the main, is at the mercy of international fossil fuel prices which dictate the retail price of electricity and gas, which is the key factor in the retail price of both electricity and gas.  My focus is on those elements of energy costs over which policy can exercise some control.</p><p>  The long term policy responses for Ireland to combat vulnerability to high and volatile gas prices continue to be increasing the use of renewables, better energy efficiencies and reducing the reliance on gas in the fuel mix.</p><p>Implementation of the measures set out in the Government's Affordable<font color="#0000FF"> </font>Energy Strategy is also key to protecting the interests of vulnerable customers.  The Affordable Energy Strategy was published in November 2011 and developed by the Inter-Departmental/Agency Group on Affordable Energy (IDGAE) as part of the Department's commitment in the Programme for Government to help mitigate energy poverty.</p><p>  There are forty-eight actions identified in the strategy to be implemented over the lifetime of the report (3 years).  Five priority measures are identified including: a commitment to review the National Fuel Scheme in the context of examining the feasibility of aligning income supports with the energy efficiency and income of the home; the phased introduction of minimal thermal efficiency standards for rental accommodation; ensuring greater access to energy efficiency measures; reforming the eligibility criteria for energy efficiency schemes; and the introduction of an area based approach.</p><p>  The Affordable Energy Strategy provides a framework for building upon the many measures already in place to protect households at risk from the effects of energy poverty, which include the thermal efficiency based measures delivered through the Better Energy Warmer Homes programme.  Exchequer funding of over &euro;101 million has been allocated to the programme since 2000 and has successfully delivered energy efficiency measures to 92,563 homes through a combination of community based organisations, private contractors and via an area-based approach.  The Government will continue to support the delivery of energy efficiency measures to vulnerable households in 2013.  Better Energy Warmer Homes has been allocated &euro;20 million for this purpose.</p><p>  There are also a number of avenues open to consumers to try to mitigate rising electricity prices, and measures are also in place to assist them.  Accordingly, consumers can and should shop around to get the best possible price and service deal from suppliers, and switch supplier if necessary bearing in mind that all suppliers can and do offer competitive prices and products.  Consumers can also take steps to improve the efficiency of their electricity usage which delivers demonstrable savings including availing of Government funded measures as already referred to above.  The CER is also working with energy suppliers to ensure that vulnerable customers are protected through, inter alia, the installation of Pay As You Go meters.</p></reply>

In terms of telecommunications policy, my Department plays a key role in providing a supportive legislative and regulatory environment within which competition can flourish and private sector investment can take place.</p><p>  The provision of electronic communications services is, in the first instance, a matter for private sector service providers operating in Ireland&rsquo;s fully liberalised telecommunications market, regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  Broadband services are provided by a number of private service providers over various platforms including wired, fixed wireless and mobile technologies.</p><p>  The Government can intervene in the case of clear market failure.  It has, in the past, undertaken, following EU State aid clearance, a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where operators have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.  State investment in the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) and the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) are examples of such interventions.  In Counties Longford and Westmeath, broadband services under the NBS are available in 11 and 26 Electoral Divisions respectively.</p><p>  With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>  The National Broadband Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country &ndash; specifically: </p><p>-   70Mbps &ndash; 100Mbps will be available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015;</p><p>-   At least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% (and potentially as much as 35%) of the population during the lifetime of the Government; and </p><p>-   A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country, also during the lifetime of the Government.</p><p>  During the preparation of the National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.</p><p>  One of the first steps in delivering on the commitments in the National Broadband Plan will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&rsquo; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country, including Counties Longford and Westmeath.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.</p><p>  Until that process is complete, the precise areas of the country which may require State intervention will not be known.  I would reiterate however, that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including Counties Longford and Westmeath, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.</p></reply>

The producing Kinsale, Ballycotton and Seven Heads (Kinsale area) gas fields off the coast of Cork and the Corrib gas field off the coast of Mayo.  The three Kinsale area gas fields are nearing depletion and currently supply approximately 5% of Ireland&rsquo;s gas requirements.  The Corrib gas field is under development and first gas is not anticipated before end 2014.  There have been no commercial discoveries of oil to date.</p><p>In terms of the direct financial contribution to the State from petroleum production, profits from the three Kinsale area gas fields are taxed at a rate of 25%.  In addition, royalties from the Kinsale and Ballycotton fields are payable to the State at a rate of 12.5% of the fair market value of the gas at the well head.  The combination of tax, royalties and rental fees currently provides for a State take of 40% of net income from these two fields  .</p><p>Royalties are not payable on production from the Seven Heads Gas field and will not apply to future production from the Corrib gas field as Ireland, following the lead of countries such as the UK and Norway, moved away from a royalty based payments system to a tax based system in 1987.  Profits from the Corrib gas field will be taxed at 25% when the field goes into production.</p><p>While the amount paid in tax is a matter between the companies concerned and the Revenue Commissioners, I can advise that the amount received in royalties from the Kinsale and Ballycotton gas fields over the past 20 years amounted to just over &euro;136 million.

The Charge is set at &euro;200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.  It is a matter for an owner to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge.</p><p>  Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect the Non-Principal Private Residence Charge; application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.  Guidelines have also been issued to local authorities in relation to the provisions of the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, which address matters including suitability for occupation.  The fact that a property has never been lived in does not necessarily mean that a property is not liable. However, a property which is not suitable for occupation as a dwelling should not be regarded as residential property for the purposes of the Act.  A determination of the habitability of a property is a matter for the relevant local authority.  I urge all liable persons who have not paid the Charge to contact their local au thority as a matter of urgency.</p></reply>

I am making provision for the scheme in my Department&rsquo;s Vote for 2013.  The scheme will apply to treatment systems which have been registered by the due date of 1 February 2013 and which are deemed to require remediation having failed an inspection carried out under the 2012 Act.  The grant payable will depend on the cost of the work necessary and the income of the household concerned, and the scheme will provide a higher level of support to households on lower incomes.  Full details of the scheme will be set out in regulations which I will make in advance of inspections commencing this year.  The Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012 provides that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will make a National Inspection Plan for domestic wastewater treatment systems.  The judgment of the European Court of Justice highlighted in particular that the National Inspection Plan has not yet been developed.  I understand that the Plan is very close to being finalised by the Agency .  My Department will continue to liaise with the European Commission to ensure full compliance with our obligations.</p></reply>

Separately in June 2012, in advance of the publication of <i>Putting People First</i>, my Department requested that CPLN Local Development Company, Dodder Valley Local Development Company and South Dublin County Council (SDCC) develop a plan to establish a single structure for Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP) delivery in the two areas in question.  The new structure will operate within the SDCC boundary and will facilitate the generation of efficiencies.  In the longer term it will allow a more effective sharing of resources, reducing overall administration and operating costs, while at the same time preserving the core, front-line element of the LCDP.  Following consultations between my Department, the Chairpersons, CEOs and Boards of Management of both companies and SDCC, an agreement was reached.  This involved the establishment of a single Company by the end of 2012 to promote and deliver Local and Community Development Programmes in the South County Dublin Area.  In advancing this work and the broader alignment initiative, I am concerned that the integrity of the local development model is protected as outlined in the Alignment Report, while bearing in mind our fiscal constraints.</p></reply>

However, as the system is based on a self-declaration format it permits a person to set up several accounts, each in respect of separate properties or sets of properties, and therefore such figures should be treated with appropriate caution.</p><p><table><tr><th>County/City Council</th><th><div>Properties registered and paid</div></th><th><div>Properties registered for waiver  </div></th><th><div>Total </div></th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td><div>12,408</div></td><td><div>325</div></td><td><div>12,733 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td><div>16,592</div></td><td><div>1,145</div></td><td><div>17,737 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td><div>33,496</div></td><td><div>435</div></td><td><div>33,931 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td><td><div>28,463</div></td><td><div>176</div></td><td><div>28,639 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork County</td><td><div>94,496</div></td><td><div>2,636</div></td><td><div>97,132 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td><div>37,480</div></td><td><div>540</div></td><td><div>38,020 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City</td><td><div>139,793</div></td><td><div>1,207</div></td><td><div>141,000 </div></td></tr><tr><td>D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown</td><td><div>63,894</div></td><td><div>405</div></td><td><div>64,299 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td><div>61,480</div></td><td><div>2,302</div></td><td><div>63,782 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway City</td><td><div>21,156</div></td><td><div>59</div></td><td><div>21,215 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway County</td><td><div>42,101</div></td><td><div>739</div></td><td><div>42,840 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td><div>43,937</div></td><td><div>329</div></td><td><div>44,266 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td><div>45,400</div></td><td><div>1,781</div></td><td><div>47,181 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td><div>21,728</div></td><td><div>529</div></td><td><div>22,257 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td><div>16,600</div></td><td><div>377</div></td><td><div>16,977 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td><div>9,162</div></td><td><div>203</div></td><td><div>9,365 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City</td><td><div>14,168</div></td><td><div>227</div></td><td><div>14,395 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick County</td><td><div>31,870</div></td><td><div>690</div></td><td><div>32,560 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td><div>8,653</div></td><td><div>596</div></td><td><div>9,249 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td><div>25,180</div></td><td><div>1,018</div></td><td><div>26,198 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td><div>39,476</div></td><td><div>995</div></td><td><div>40,471 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td><div>38,727</div></td><td><div>988</div></td><td><div>39,715 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td><div>13,869</div></td><td><div>292</div></td><td><div>14,161 </div></td></tr><tr><td>North Tipperary</td><td><div>17,925</div></td><td><div>535</div></td><td><div>18,460 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td><div>15,540</div></td><td><div>412</div></td><td><div>15,952 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td><div>16,822</div></td><td><div>422</div></td><td><div>17,244 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td><div>18,410</div></td><td><div>283</div></td><td><div>18,693 </div></td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin</td><td><div>53,397</div></td><td><div>414</div></td><td><div>53,811 </div></td></tr><tr><td>South Tipperary</td><td><div>20,967</div></td><td><div>326</div></td><td><div>21,293 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City</td><td><div>10,716</div></td><td><div>169</div></td><td><div>10,885 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford County</td><td><div>16,732</div></td><td><div>156</div></td><td><div>16,888 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td><div>20,498</div></td><td><div>364</div></td><td><div>20,862 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td><div>36,454</div></td><td><div>1,253</div></td><td><div>37,707 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>                     32,208</td><td>                         494</td><td>                    32,702</td></tr><tr><td>National</td><td><div>1,119,798</div></td><td><div>22,822</div></td><td><div>1,142,620</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

My Department has provided over &euro;700 million to support the Ballymun regeneration programme to date.  This has facilitated the demolition of all but one of the towers and nearly all the flat blocks as well as the construction of over 2,900 social, voluntary, private and affordable residential units, new local parks and playgrounds, neighbourhood centres and a new traditional style main street.  The programme has also provided state of the art community facilities, such as the Axis theatre, the Leisure Centre and Civic Centre.  The Ballymun regeneration project has now moved into the completion phase and my Department&rsquo;s priority is to ensure that the remaining housing need is met while the investment provided to date is fully protected.  All demolition and construction projects are expected to be substantially completed by end 2014.</p><p>  In 2012, my Department committed to providing some &euro;51 million over the period 2012 &ndash; 2014 to ensure that outstanding housing need in Ballymun would be met in full and that infrastructure projects needed to protect the substantial investment in regeneration to date would be provided.  In 2012 funding of &euro;30 million was provided to BRL to meet the costs of construction and demolition projects underway, ongoing social regeneration programme costs and the BRL administrative overhead.  The 2012 outturn represented an increase of 20% on the initial 2012 allocation and demonstrates my ongoing commitment to supporting this important project.  In August 2012 my Department issued approval in principle to Ballymun Regeneration Ltd (BRL) for the inclusion of a number of sites in Ballymun as part of an overall site reinstatement strategy and sought further information in relation to a number of additional sites.  The overall objective is to protect the investment to date and concentrate on at-risk open spaces and areas which have the potential to become the focus of anti-social behaviour. A submission in this regard has recently been received from BRL and is currently under examination in my Department.  In October 2012, my Department approved BRL&rsquo;s tender   recommendation for Demolition Contract 8, which provides for the demolition of the flat complexes on Shangan Road and Sillogue Road.  It is now a matter for BRL to progress this contract.  I understand, however, that the demolition of these units will be completed towards the middle of this year.</p><p>  In terms of the consultation and communications process, given that this project is now moving towards completion, the emphasis has changed from the initial strategic level consultation with stakeholders, local community groups and residents associations in relation to the development and implementation of the regeneration masterplan to the local level of one-to-one engagement with residents in relation to relocation.  Consultation and communication on matters relating to regeneration policy and practice is also facilitated by having local community and public representatives on the Board of BRL.  BRL&rsquo;s offices are located at the Civic Centre on Main Street and are open to the public from Monday to Friday between the hours of 9.00 and 17.00. BRL have a dedicated Communications Team available at their offices to deal with telephone and email queries and also to deal with queries and complaints from members of the public in relation to any matter within its remit.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the constraints on capital expenditure across the public sector, my Department will continue to support the National Regeneration Programme, including the completion strategy for Ballymun.  I intend to announce details of the capital allocations for 2013 as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The statement clearly recognises the economic consequences of an over reliance on the property sector. It signalled a shift to a tenure neutral high level objective, and a clear commitment to restoring balance to the housing sector generally through a lesser reliance on home ownership. The statement also announced the standing down of all affordable housing schemes on the basis that these had been symptoms of, rather than solutions to, an overheated property market.  The policy statement reaffirms the State's commitment to supporting access to home ownership for lower to middle income households and the current range of paths to home ownership will remain in place in that regard. Two types of house purchase loan are available from local authorities: standard annuity loans targeted at lower income first time buyers and those under the Home Choice Loan scheme which are available to qualifying middle income first time buyers affected by the &#8220;credit crunch&#8221;. </p><p>  The terms and conditions governing the operation, including eligibility terms, of annuity mortgages and the Home Choice Loan are set out under the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2009 and the Housing (Home Choice Loan) Regulations 2009 respectively. These are available on my Department's website: </p><p>  The Government is also committed to supporting local authority mortgage holders experiencing arrears difficulties, particularly through the updated guidance issued to local authorities in July 2012. This guidance will further enable local authorities to provide a range of flexible repayment of options for households in difficulties. </p><p>  In particular, the introduction of a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) will closely mirror the suite of options available in the commercial sector. This process will feature a standard set of options including, in cases of certain unsustainable mortgages, the facility of mortgage-to-rent.  I expect that the adoption of these revised guidelines will serve simultaneously to help resolve mortgage difficulties for both local authorities and their borrowers, and ensure that, where possible, households will be facilitated to continue to live in their own homes.</p></reply>

On foot of correspondence received in 2011 regarding a possible governance issue at Mayo North East LEADER Partnership Company, a comprehensive investigation in to the issues outlined was instigated . This proved to be a very complex investigation and, on foot of its initial findings and in the context of the Department's responsibility to ensure that RDP funding is delivered in an efficient and effective way, a decision was made to suspend project approvals by MNELP on the 7 March 2012. However, it should also be noted that the issuing of payments to eligible approved applications is progressing as normal.   </p><p>  The Final Report, which has recently been made available to me, has been provided to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) (Managing Authority for the RDP) which has subsequently reported the findings to the European Commission and the external accreditation auditors (Deloitte). The findings of the investigation have also been reported to both the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Standards in Public Office Commission and consideration of these findings will be subject to the relevant processes in these bodies. The Report is also under consideration in my own Department.  It is critical that the funds delivered through the LEADER elements of the RDP are managed in an efficient and effective way , and the suspension of project approvals in MNELP will remain in place until I am satisfied that such approvals can  proceed. </p><p>  While we must ensure correct and proper management and implementation of the LEADER elements of the RDP from both a regulatory and value for money perspective, my Department's objective is to conclude the processes associated with this investigation with a view to reinstating access to RDP funds to the citizens of Mayo North East at the earliest possible opportunity, while ensuring regulatory compliance, value for money and maximum impact for the people of North Mayo. On foot of recent meetings with DAFM, my Department is currently developing an Action Plan that will provide the necessary assurances in these regards.</p></reply>

MNELP were originally allocated &euro;10,751,894.00 for the delivery of Axis 3 and 4 (LEADER) of the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2007-2013 in the Mayo North East area. Implementation of the LEADER elements of the RDP commenced in 2009 and to 31 December 2012 MNELP has registered overall expenditure of &euro;4,388,947.92 which includes both project and administration expenditure. </p><p>  On the 31 December 2012, MNELP also had overall project activity of &euro;5,764,242.40 which includes project pipeline activity or projects at the early stages of development. Full contractual commitments in MNELP amounted to &euro;4,728,325.24, inclusive of expenditure.  In  late 2011 the European Commission approved a change in co-funding rates from 55% to 85% for Rural Development Programmes for countries that were part of the Financial Stabilisation Mechanism. Prior to this RDP measures were co-funded at a rate of 55% by the EU, with the remaining 45% coming from national exchequer sources. </p><p>  The 2011 agreement reduces the national exchequer input to 15% for 2012 and 2013 without a concomitant increase in the amount of funding to be provided by the EU. This has resulted in a reduction in the overall Programme complement from &euro;427m to &euro;314m. </p><p>In this context the original funding allocations given to each Local Development Company contracted to deliver the LEADER elements of the RDP are no longer definitive and depend on the capacity of both the groups and their local areas to absorb the available funding within the required timeframes. However, in this context my Department is working closely with Local Development Companies to ensure that any community or individual in any geographical area who is eligible for funding under the RDP will have their applications dealt with in an efficient and effective manner and applications from all geographic areas will be considered equally as long as funding is available. </p></reply>

In a number of situations, only some appointments to the body concerned are made by the nister, or appointments are made with the consent of other nisters.as appropriate. </p><p>  The Boards of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and An Bord Pleanala are executive in nature and members are employed on a full time salaried basis. The appointments as Chairperson of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and Director General of the EPA are made by Government following competitions held by the Public Appointments Service.</p><p>  My Department has put in place procedures whereby the Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht will be notified of nominations as chair of State Bodies under the aegis of my Department prior to their appointment.

There was a substantial concern that any legislative scheme involving interference in the contractual relationships of private parties would find it extremely difficult to survive a Constitutional challenge.  In addition, the Government was advised that any model proposed would require the payment of compensation to landlords whose rights were infringed in order to ensure that the proposal would be compatible with the Constitution and with the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Government was strongly of the view that payment of compensation to landlords in such circumstances could not be justified in the current economic climate.</p><p>  Although legislative intervention may not be feasible, NAMA is playing a role in dealing with problems caused by upward only rent reviews applying to NAMA properties.  I have been advised that, by the end of 2012, the Agency had granted 212 applications for rent abatement with an aggregate annual value of &euro;13.5 million. A further 56 applications are currently under review. Of the 276 eligible applications received to date only 8 have been refused representing a 97% approval rate by NAMA.</p><p>  I would also mention that the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 provides for the establishment and maintenance of a Commercial Leases Database by the Property Services Regulatory Authority.  This Database will assist in providing readily accessible, accurate information in order to determine the market rent payable in respect of comparable commercial properties.  Work is underway to ensure that the Database will be operational at an early date.</p><p>  Finally, I wish to highlight the existence of a rent review arbitration code which was drawn up by a group of experts whose membership was drawn from all stakeholders in the commercial property arena.  The code, which can be found on www.justice.ie,  provides a mechanism to deal with the resolution of rent review disputes in the commercial property sector.</p></reply>

For example, persons may be refused permission to land in the State and subsequently permitted to enter the State having made an application pursuant to the Immigration Acts or the Refugee Act,1996.   In that regard the latest available statistics indicate that 2,239 persons were refused permission to land in the State last year taking into account those who were subsequently permitted to enter.   </p><p>  I might add that in all cases, removals from the State, whether in respect of those who are removed on arrival at ports of entry or those already in the State, are conducted in accordance with the law with removals at the Port of Entry being, essentially, an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau. </p><p>  The removal of illegal immigrants from the State is a necessary feature of the enforcement of immigration legislation with the purpose of upholding the integrity of the immigration system. In enforcing the law in this respect, Ireland is no different from other countries who also remove individuals who have no lawful right to remain within their territory.     </p></reply>

Full details are available from the Central Statistics Office or on their website (www.cso.ie).</p><p>  These latest figures show a welcome reduction in 12 of the 14 crime groups for which figures are given, compared with the previous 12 months and reflect well on the impact the Garda&iacute; are having on crime.</p><p>  In particular, crimes against the person are down including homicide offences (down 17.9%), sexual offences (down 0.7%) and assault and related offences (down 9.5%).  Public order and damage to property offences are also down (by 12% and 9.3% respectively), as are drug offences (down 7.1%) and weapons and explosives offences (down 17.4%).</p><p>  The position with respect to some property offences remains a concern, however.  Robbery is down (by 5.9%) but burglary is up 7.9% and fraud offences up by 6.2%.  While the overall category of theft offences are down by 1.2% there is a worrying increase in the level of theft from the person and this is continuing to receive attention through targeted Garda operations.  While the burglary figures reflect a twelve month trend seen earlier in 2012, the rate of increase has reduced from 10.3% to 7.9% and the figures for the most recent quarter reflect the impact Operation Fiacla is having, when compared to periods prior to its introduction.  As can be seen from the 3,538 persons arrested and 1,924 charged under Operation Fiacla in the period form April up to the end of December 2012,  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is clearly tackling the problem of burglary and the prolific offenders involved head&ndash;on.   </p></reply>

A targeted approach to speed enforcement is being undertaken in order to significantly reduce the incidence of fatal and serious injuries and improve road safety.

To a large extent this estimate relates to heating and lighting costs and it does not take account of specific repair bills, which will vary from premises to premises.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the closure of the stations has been proposed by the Garda Commissioner in his Policing Plan for 2013 and I would stress that the key objective involved is to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources rather than to secure modest cash savings.  In this context the Commissioner has concluded in relation to certain stations that Garda resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if the stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.  In making his recommendations on the closure of Garda stations, the Commissioner reviewed all aspects of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.  In addition, the Commissioner has given a commitment that where a station is to be closed local Garda management will consult with local communities on the alternative policing arrangements to be put in place in their area.</p><p>  Furthermore, the Garda Commissioner has indicated he is confident that the implementation of the restructuring proposals contained in the 2013 Policing Plan will not lead to any diminution in the service provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In that regard he has stated that the revised structures will continue to support the Garda community philosophy through the clustering of services at policing hubs. This centralisation of services will facilitate the introduction of enhanced patrolling arrangements which, in turn, will provide increased Garda visibility as well as maintaining existing Garda links with communities throughout the country. </p></reply>

We believe that higher standards will serve to increase consumer trust and confidence in the digital environment and help to promote innovation, increase economic growth and deliver jobs for Europe. Advancing the Commission's proposals for reform of the data protection regime is, therefore, one of the Irish Presidency&rsquo;s priorities in the justice field. </p><p>  I am pleased to say that aspects of the Commission's reform package, including the proposed imposition of sanctions for breaches of data protection standards, were discussed by the justice ministers of Member States during last week's Informal Justice and Home Affairs Council which I hosted here in Dublin. These discussions indicate that while there is broad support in principle for the imposition of financial penalties in the case of serious and repeated infringements of data protection rules, the supervisory authorities of Member States should have a margin of discretion and a wider range of powers available to them, including the issuing of warnings, reprimands and directives that corrective action be taken, to deal with less serious breaches. I expect that the future work of the relevant Working Group of experts in relation to the proposed sanctions regime will be guided by these discussions. </p></reply>

Section 4(3) of the 1998 Act provides that the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions, which includes the provision of statistics.</p><p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that significant improvements have been made in recent years to the fines collection process for court imposed fines. This includes timely and frequent issue of reminders, together with provision of an on-line facility for the payment of fines and general improvement in management of the fines collection process.  The length of time within which a fine can be paid can vary considerably and is determined amongst other things by the discretion of the judge and value of the fine.  Currently if the fine remains outstanding within 6 months of the due payment date, a warrant is issued to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to pursue the outstanding fine. Once a warrant is issued, the Courts Service has no further function in pursuing unpaid fines.</p><p>  The Courts Service has informed me that, under the current system, and taking account of the above, the value of fines outstanding is assessed on a rolling 12 month period.  For the 12 months to the end of December 2012, the total value of fines imposed was &euro;31.5m (95,500 fines).  The total value of fines collectable after adjusting for appeals and cancellation of warrants by a court was &euro;17.3m (60,000).  In 2012 a total of &euro;15.3m was received. While this gives a collection rate of 89% based on value, it should be noted that some of the payments received in 2012 would relate to fines imposed prior to 2012.   At the end of 2011, the average collection rate was 69%. The Courts Service considers that this rate is a truer reflection of the actual collection rate as a number of other factors impacted on the compliance rate for 2012, including a decline in the value and volumes of court fines imposed in 2012 compared with 2011. </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the General Scheme of a Fines (Amendment) Bill has been published with a view to enactment this year if possible.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

Under Section 7(3) of the Act, I am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which the Legal Aid Board is or may be concerned.</p><p>  The Deputy might further wish to note that the solicitor/client relationship is protected by privilege in accordance with the terms of Section 32 of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 and therefore the Board does not provide information to third parties regarding a person who may or may not be a client of the Board.</p><p>  However, I am informed that the Legal Aid Board provides a priority service in cases where it considers that an immediate, or near immediate, service was needed.

In general, it is not an offence to purchase sex either. (The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 made it an offence to knowingly solicit or importune a trafficked person, in any place, for the purpose of prostitution.) Consequently, neither party to the transaction is currently criminalised. Calls to criminalise the purchase of sex require very careful consideration. While there is already a consensus on the evils of child prostitution and human trafficking for sexual exploitation, I am aware there are differing and genuinely held views on the approach the criminal law should take to other aspects of prostitution. </p><p>  Our legislative approach to prostitution is aimed at protecting society from the more intrusive aspects of such activity from a public order perspective, while also seeking to protect prostitutes from exploitation.  For that reason, solicitation in a public place is an offence. The offence can be committed by the prostitute, the client or a third party - a pimp, for example. It is also an offence to organise prostitution, coerce or compel a person to be a prostitute, knowingly live on the earnings of a prostitute, or keep or manage a brothel.   A person found guilty of compelling or coercing a person (which would include a homeless person) to be a prostitute is liable, on conviction on indictment, to a fine or imprisonment for up to 5 years, or both.    </p><p>  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 criminalises the trafficking of persons for sexual exploitation, including prostitution. A person found guilty of this offence is liable to life imprisonment. </p><p>  Our legislation on prostitution is currently being reviewed. As part of that review, in June 2012, I published a discussion document on the future direction of legislation on prostitution.  The purpose of the discussion document is to facilitate a public consultation process.  It sets out four potential legislative models for discussion but does not favour any particular approach. On its publication, I referred the discussion document to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  The joint committee is conducting the consultation process and will report back to me when it has completed its work.  </p><p>  In addition, my Department hosted a conference in October to discuss the consultation paper.  The report of the joint committee and the views expressed at the October conference will be fully considered in the framing of any necessary legislative proposals to be submitted to Government in due course. </p><p>  For further background, I am appending the text of my statement of 22 June last when publishing the discussion document.</p><p><b>Shatter Announces Publication of Discussion Document on the Future Direction of Legislation on Prostitution</b></p><p>  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence today published a discussion document on the future direction of legislation on prostitution. Publication of the discussion document follows the Minister's announcement that he would be arranging a public consultation process as part of the current review of prostitution legislation. Announcing publication of the discussion document, Minister Shatter said:</p><p><b>&quot;The criminal law in this area is being reviewed primarily because of the changed nature of prostitution in Ireland. Prostitution was once mainly a street-based phenomenon. That is no longer the case. The organisation of prostitution is now much more sophisticated, highly mobile and is easily facilitated by the use of mobile phones and the internet.</b></p><p><b>  There is, of course, already a clear consensus on the great evils of child prostitution and trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation. However, I am aware that there are differing and genuinely held views on the approach the criminal law should take to other aspects of prostitution. While there is a significant amount of criminal legislation in this area already, there is always scope for change and improvement. It is important to review the law periodically to ensure it is up to date and comprehensively responds to altered circumstances.&quot;</b></p><p>  The Minister added that:   <b>&quot;Prostitution is an issue which affects individuals, communities and society as a whole. It is important that I facilitate the expression of all views on this subject and that those views are examined in due course. Public debate should therefore, be open to the widest possible audience and I want to ensure that everyone who wishes to make a contribution to this important debate is given the opportunity to do so. It is for that reason I have decided on a consultation process before charting the way forward.</b></p><p><b>  My Department will hold a conference in the autumn to discuss the document. The widest possible participation will be encouraged in order that we have an open and transparent discussion on all aspects of this very important issue.</b></p><p><b>  This discussion document will now be referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence. Interested groups and members of the public, I expect, will be invited to make submissions to the Committee which will hold such hearings as it deems appropriate. I am asking Mr. David Stanton T.D., Chairman of the Joint Committee, that it publish its report and recommendations by the 30th November 2012 and that the report be furnished to me together with any submissions received. I expect it is likely that the Committee's report will also be lodged in the Oireachtas Library and that a debate on it will subsequently take place in both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad. The report received by me from the Joint Oireachtas Committee will be fully considered in the framing of any necessary new legislative proposals to be submitted to Government in due course.</b></p><p><b>  I look forward to the results of the consultation process.&quot;</b></p><p>  The discussion document is attached below and will be made available on the Department's website, </p><p>  This discussion document does not favour any particular approach but simply tries to assist reflection. The arguments contained in the document are not exhaustive and the questions posed are not intended to limit in any way the range of questions readers might want to consider.</p></reply>

It is important to remember that while some Garda stations are listed for revised opening hours from 24 hour stations, they will remain as functioning Garda stations on a 24 hour basis. The full list of these details is available in the Policing Plan which is available in the Oireachtas Library and on the Garda web site.</p><p>  There are no plans to change these decisions. </p><p>  The Commissioner has concluded that resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front-line if particular stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained or if the public opening hours of other stations could be reduced at off-peak times. He has given a commitment that where a station is to be closed local Garda management will consult with local communities on the alternative policing arrangements to be put in place in their area. </p><p>  Furthermore, the Garda Commissioner has indicated he is confident that the implementation of the restructuring proposals contained in the 2013 Policing Plan will not lead to any diminution in the service provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In that regard he has stated that the revised structures will continue to support the Garda community philosophy through the clustering of services at policing hubs. This centralisation of services will facilitate the introduction of enhanced patrolling arrangements which, in turn, will provide increased Garda visibility as well as maintaining existing Garda links with communities throughout the country.   <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b></p><p>  The Commissioner has also informed me that the personnel strength of the Kerry Garda Division on 31 December 2012, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 298. There were also 26 Garda Reservists and 32 Civilians attached to the Kerry Garda Division on that date. </p></reply>

Rule 77 of the Prison Rules 2007 sets out that " The Governor shall make daily inspections of the prison including those areas of the prison where prisoners are accommodated or congregate or are otherwise held".  </p><p>  I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that the Governor of Mountjoy Prison, accompanied by the Chief Officer, visits and inspects all areas of the prison on a daily basis. In addition, a Governor is also assigned responsibility for each division of the prison and that Governor attends the relevant division each morning to meet with prisoners. </p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Inspector of Prisons has been established on a statutory basis since 2007 by virtue of Part 5 of the Prisons Act, 2007 and is independent. The key role assigned to the Inspector is to carry out regular inspections of the 14 Prisons and Places of Detention in the State and to present his report(s) on each institution visited as well as an Annual Report to me. In addition, the Inspector has also produced a number of reports in relation to general prison policies including the duties and obligations owed to prisoners by the Irish Prison Service. The Inspector's most recent Report on Mountjoy Prison was completed in March 2011. </p><p>  The  Prisons (Visiting Committees) Act 1925 requires a visiting committee to be constituted for every prison in the State and the duties of the Visiting Committee include  visiting  the prison in respect of which they are appointed and to hear any complaints which may be made to them by any prisoner. They also report to me on any abuses observed or found by them in such prison; and any repairs to such prison which may appear to them to be urgently needed. </p><p>  I announced plans some time ago to strengthen the independent oversight of our prisons. Under new legislation to be prepared, I intend to make Visiting Committees more effective while they continue their role of visiting prisons, meeting with prisoners, and liaising on their behalf with prison authorities. A link will be established between the Visiting Committees and the Inspector of Prisons.  Visiting Committees will report every two months to the Inspector on any issue that they wish to bring to his attention.  They will be able to report any urgent or major issue to him at any time.  They will continue their role of visiting prisons.  They will continue to meet with prisoners and liaise on their behalf with prison authorities.  But they will be more effective.  </p><p>  Additional independent prisons monitoring is also provided by international bodies such as the Irish Human Rights Commission, the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) and , is also provided by the regular visits by the Council of Europe Committee on the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.</p></reply>

The grant of representation gives legal authority to a person or persons to access the estate and administer it in accordance with the law.  The Probate Office is an office of the High Court and management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions under the Courts Service Act 1998.</p><p>  In order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that approximately 90% of persons seeking grants of representation are represented by solicitors who prepare the necessary legal documentation.  Mandatory legal requirements must be met in respect of the applications and the Probate Office or District Registry examines such documentation to ensure compliance with legal and procedural requirements.  The Courts Service has confirmed that documentation in over 70% of these cases is non-compliant and applications cannot be accepted until the various enquiries have been addressed.  This inevitably contributes to delays for applicants and is a matter that can best be addressed by the persons submitting probate applications taking the time to ensure that documentation submitted complies with the requirements.</p><p>  Examples of the reasons for rejection of papers include:</p><p>  - 	legal entitlement to grant not established in the oath which the applicant swears to ground the application,</p><p>  - 	documents not correctly exhibited in the oath</p><p>   - 	documents not properly sworn,</p><p>  - 	incorrect documents sworn to ground the application, and</p><p>  - 	pertinent information omitted from the documents.</p><p>  I have no plans at present to review the present system.  However, the Courts Service has confirmed to me that the quality of initial applications has repeatedly been brought to the attention of legal practitioners.  In order to promote higher quality, the Probate Office has:</p><p>  - 	prepared checklists for practitioners, </p><p>  - 	published guidance for completion of documentation on the Courts Service website, </p><p>  - 	given lectures and tutorials to practitioners in the Law Society and to various Solicitors' Bar Associations,</p><p>  - 	provided a facility whereby the Probate Officer will meet with Solicitors who are handling complex Probate cases, and</p><p>  - 	held user group meetings where problems are highlighted.</p></reply>

The Bill will codify the procedures to apply in relation to the exchange of criminal records data with other states. Currently, the Garda&iacute; routinely request records of criminal convictions of citizens from other states who are appearing before the courts in relation to offences in this State. They can also request records of convictions in other states of Irish citizens who are of interest to the Garda&iacute;. The impact of the Framework Decision will be to ensure that all member states of the EU are automatically notified in regard to criminal convictions of their nationals or persons resident in their state. The Bill is currently being drafted and I expect to publish the Bill towards the end of 2013.</p></reply>

At that time there were approximately 22,000 citizenship applications awaiting decision, some 17,000 of which had been awaiting decision for in excess of 6 months and many of which had been waiting for 2-3 years or longer.</p><p>  Over the past 22 months there has been a major improvement in the position, despite a significant increase in the volume of valid applications received from 12,500 in 2010 to 19,900 in 2012. More than 43,000 decisions on naturalisation applications have been made since I came into office.  It is my intention that we will continue to build on this success over the coming year.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that alongside the improvements in processing, in June 2011, I introduced formal citizenship ceremonies for the first time since the foundation of the State. The ceremonies, which are being met with universal approval, allow candidates for citizenship make their declaration of fidelity to the Irish nation and loyalty to the State and receive their certificate of naturalisation in a meaningful and dignified manner which befits the importance and solemnity of the occasion.</p></reply>

There is a long standing wish of many Travellers that they be granted recognition as an ethnic group but also there are some divergent views within the Traveller community.</p><p>  The previous Government was of the view that Travellers are not an ethnic minority. Dialogue between staff of the Department of Justice and Equality and representatives of Traveller organisations has taken place in the past on the issue, for example, during the course of a seminar on the third State report under the Council of Europe Convention on National Minorities.   In addition, the National Traveller Monitoring and Advisory Committee, on which sit representatives of all the national Traveller organisations as well as officials of the Department of Justice and Equality, earlier last year established a sub-group specifically to consider the issue of Traveller ethnicity.  Arising from the work of this group, among other things, a conference was held in Dublin Castle, supported by the Department of Justice and Equality.  At this conference various aspects of the ethnicity subject were considered from a wide spectrum of opinion.</p><p>  I would like to remind the Deputy that Travellers in Ireland have the same civil and political rights as other citizens under the Constitution. The key anti-discrimination measures, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977, the Employment Equality Acts and the Equal Status Acts specifically identify Travellers by name as a group protected. The Equality Act 2004, which transposed the EU Racial Equality Directive, applied all the protections of that Directive across all of the nine grounds contained in the legislation, including the Traveller community ground.<b></b>  All the protections afforded to ethnic minorities in EU directives and international conventions apply to Travellers because the Irish legislation giving effect to those international instruments explicitly protects Travellers.</p><p>Consideration of this issue remains ongoing with a view to ensuring that full analysis of  all aspects of the granting of ethnic status to Travellers is available to Government when coming to a decision on the matter.</p></reply>

The 84 staff of the Property Registration Authority (PRA) currently located in that accommodation will be re-located before the expiry of the lease.  The Office of Public Works has identified accommodation in the Irish Life Centre, Dublin 1. However, it is unlikely that the proposed location will be sufficient to accommodate all PRA staff currently in the Setanta Centre and some staff will have to be re-located to Chancery Street.</p><p>  Furthermore, as indicated in the previous reply, it was decided, following the Government Review on the viability of all decentralisation projects that the PRA should remain in situ in the new premises located at the Golf Links Road, Roscommon.  The building was originally designed to accommodate 230. Given the on-going moratorium on recruitment, redeployment programmes and the ongoing reduction in staff numbers required under the Employment Control Framework (ECF), it is unlikely that the PRA will be in a position to locate the planned number of staff in Roscommon in the foreseeable future.</p><p>  In view of these circumstances, the PRA continues to work with the Office of Public Works to <font color="#2F2F2F">ensure the optimum utilisation of the accommodation by other suitable public sector occupants.  A</font> small number of staff from the Roscommon Enterprise Board has been occupying part of the accommodation for some months now.  In early February, approximately 50 staff from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine will re-locate to the Golf Links Road building. The PRA will continue to work with the Office of Public Works to seek opportunities to fully maximise the occupancy in this building by other State bodies.</p></reply>

The Civil Defence Board was identified in the Public Service Reform Plan as a body to be abolished.  I appointed an interim Board as a temporary measure from 2011 and in this context none of the positions were advertised, nor was the Chairman interviewed by an Oireachtas Committee.  Legislation was passed by the Oireachtas in December 2012 for the dissolution of the Board and the transfer of its functions back to the Department of Defence.</p><p>  The Army Pensions Board is an independent statutory body established under the Army Pensions Act, 1927.  The Act specifies that the Board shall consist of a chairman and two ordinary members.  The two ordinary members must be qualified medical practitioners of whom one must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps.  The chairman and the non-military ordinary member are appointed by the Minister   for Defence with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  The Army Medical Corps ordinary member is appointed by the Minister for Defence on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces.</p><p>  The position of Army Medical Corps ordinary member became vacant due to retirement in 2011, and I appointed Commandant Adam Lagun to the Board on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff.  As the Army Pensions Act 1927 specifies that one of the ordinary members must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps, this position was not publicly advertised.  Details of Commandant Lagun&rsquo;s appointment to the Army Pensions Board were published in the Iris Oifigi&uacute;l on 13 January 2012.</p><p>  In the context of settling the Estimates for the Department of Defence for 2010, the Government decided that the national sail training scheme operated by Coiste an Asgard would be discontinued as recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure. No appointments have been made since that decision was taken and the Board will be dissolved shortly.</p><p>  All appointments to Boards under the aegis of my Department are in accordance with the relevant legislation or regulations.</p></reply>

He is now taking work forward and is consulting informally before bringing the matter back to the European Council, which I understand is planned for the meeting of 7 and 8 February. As Presidency, we will give whatever assistance we can to President Van Rompuy, who retains responsibility for, and control of, the process. </p><p>  As Presidency and nationally, Ireland wants an EU with sufficient funds to carry out its work, and a budget that can support growth and jobs. Agriculture has a particularly important role to play in the maintenance and creation of growth and jobs, so it is vital that a fully funded CAP continues to support the development of the sector. Indeed, the protection of the budget allocation for CAP is Ireland&rsquo;s number one financial priority, given its importance to our national agri-food development strategy and the importance of the sector to our economic recovery. The Government is therefore determined to protect the CAP to the maximum extent possible, and to defend Ireland&rsquo;s share of it. </p><p>  As to whether a deal on CAP reform can be finalised before the end of the Irish Presidency, I believe it can be. However, three things must happen:</p><p>- there must be agreement on the MFF early in 2013,</p><p>- there must be rapid progress on outstanding technical and political issues,</p><p>- all three institutions - the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission - need to engage actively in the negotiating process. </p><p>  The latter point is particularly important given the tight timescales we are facing, and the need to agree Council and Parliament positions before the trilogue process begins. </p><p>  I am optimistic about the prospects for agreement, but I am also keenly aware that we need real determination from all of the protagonists across all three institutions to commit to the process and to do what is necessary if we are to successfully conclude the reform of the CAP. I look forward to seeing that determination, and I will not be found wanting in providing the necessary leadership. </p></reply>

Its objective is to improve the productivity and profitability of participants&rsquo; beef enterprises by focusing on five areas: financial management, grassland management, herd health, animal breeding/welfare and producing animals to market specifications. Under the BTAP, participants engage in peer-to-peer learning by joining discussion groups which are facilitated by professional agricultural advisors drawn from Teagasc and the private sector. </p><p>  Payments to producers in 2012, which were limited to a maximum of &euro;1,000 per participant and subject to EU state aid rules, were contingent on compliance with Programme requirements, i.e. attendance at a prescribed number of discussion group meetings or approved national events plus completion of two technology adoption tasks from a menu of eight designed to enhance on-farm efficiency. The broad range of available task options allowed participants to choose those best suited to the business needs and particular characteristics of their beef enterprises.</p><p>  I understand that the individual concerned did not obtain a payment because he failed to satisfactorily complete one of two selected tasks which related to the completion of a herd health plan in consultation with a veterinary surgeon. Participants who chose that task were required to join the voluntary Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) eradication programme, a condition of which was that herd owners had to submit tissue samples from all calves born on their holdings in 2012 to one of a number of designated laboratories. Task completion was verified by the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) which maintains a database of laboratory results on behalf of Animal Health Ireland. </p><p>  The rationale for this approach is that the BTAP thus recognised and rewarded producers who tested their herds during the initial voluntary phase of a national programme to eradicate a highly contagious and costly cattle disease. Information received from ICBF indicated that the herd owner in question did not sample any animals born in 2012. Given that it is now mandatory for herd owners to take a tissue tag sample from all calves born after 1 January 2013, a producer should not entertain a legitimate expectation of receiving a BTAP payment for complying with a statutory requirement. </p><p>  It is the responsibility of participants and their facilitators to familiarise themselves with the Programme Terms and Conditions and with the consequences for breaches of the rules. In applying for the BTAP, farmers undertook to comply with the Terms and Conditions of the Programme and accepted that failure to abide by the rules could result in a loss of payment. It was determined following appeal that the individual concerned failed to fully comply with the BTAP Terms and Conditions and, accordingly, no Programme payment was possible in this case. However, subject to satisfying eligibility criteria, the producer concerned is free to participate in year two of the Programme, the opening of which I announced last week. </p></reply>

This generally involved trace or minute amounts of porcine or equine DNA with the exception of one burger in respect of which a high level of equine DNA (29% of meat content) was indicated. While the FSAI has given assurances that no food safety issues arise in this instance there are clearly very significant issues in respect of confidence in the quality of the products concerned and these are being addressed in the Department's investigation. Affected product has been withdrawn from the markets by the food business operators involved.</p><p>  Further preliminary results relating to samples taken by the Department on Tuesday 15<sup>th</sup> January, from product manufactured in Silvercrest Foods in the period 3<sup>rd</sup> to 14<sup>th</sup> January, were published on Thursday 17<sup>th</sup> January.  These tests indicate the presence of equine DNA in samples of burgers, which were already withdrawn by the company concerned from the market.  Samples of raw ingredients were also tested.  Thirteen samples of finished burgers were tested for the presence of equine DNA.  Nine tested positive for traces of equine DNA and four tested negative.  Seven samples of raw ingredients were tested, one of which, sourced from another Member State, tested positive.  Samples of ingredients in burgers sourced from Irish suppliers tested negative for equine DNA.  My Department informed the company of these further laboratory test results and the company has suspended all production at the plant until it completes its investigation.  These results were fully assessed jointly by Department officials and the FSAI; and arrangements have been made to have the positive samples further analysed with a view to quantifying the percentage of non beef DNA present.</p><p>  The latest results from tests on burgers from Liffey Meats Ltd., published on 21<sup>st</sup> January, have shown that there was no presence of horse DNA in the product, which was manufactured between January 10<sup>th</sup> and January 16<sup>th</sup>.  These results are welcome and support the company's claims that it has addressed concerns raised by the FSAI survey findings.  Primary responsibility for both the safety and quality of food placed on the market place lies with food business operators. This is subject to a series of official controls to verify compliance by the food business operators with their food safety management system - these controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain.<b></b>  The Department has permanent veterinary presence at all its export approved slaughtering plants. Controls at standalone processing plants are based on audits and inspections carried out by DAFM staff, based on risk assessment. In addition under the Department's National Residue Programme, some 30,000 samples taken at farm and factory level and covering a wide range of food stuffs are tested annually. These tests normally relate to microbiological and chemical standards, focused on food safety and in accordance with EU testing requirements. DNA testing is not required under EU legislation and is not generally in use in relation to food production and safety. It has however been deployed in recent times as part of the FSAI's food fraud control activities and these results arose from that control programme.</p><p>  Intensive investigations are continuing with a view to identifying the source of the equine DNA in the Silvercrest Foods processing facility.  This includes further analysis of a range of samples from both burgers and ingredients. Detailed analysis of records held by the company relating to the sourcing of ingredients and the incorporation of these ingredients is also being conducted.</p></reply>

The current Irish regulation in relation to the approval of ships for livestock transport is set higher than that which applies in other EU Member States. Detailed inspections are required before approval is given to ships transporting animals. The requirements for approval of dedicated vessels for the carriage of cattle by sea are contained in the Diseases of Animals (Carriage of Cattle by Sea) Orders, 1996 and 1998. </p><p>  My Department has no jurisdiction in relation to standards of slaughter plants in other countries.  However, it does support ongoing efforts by International Organisation, such as the OIE, to improve welfare standards at slaughter plants worldwide.</p><p>  The live export trade provides alternative market outlets for certain categories of livestock, thereby serving a market demand and providing increased competition in the market place for cattle.  While my Department is conscious of the need to balance this trade with the requirements of the indigenous meat processing industry, it cannot interfere with such legitimate trade and legitimate competition, but it does seek to ensure that any such trade is carried out to a high standard. </p></reply>

Specifically in regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators must have systems in place to be able to identify any person from whom they have been supplied with a food. They must also have a system in place to identify the other businesses to which their product has been supplied. In other words a food business operator at each and every stage in the food chain must be able to identify the source of its inputs as well as having details of the first recipient of its output. This is commonly referred to as the &#8220;one step forward one step backward&#8221; traceability system.     </p><p>  The Department implements official controls on horse identification at marts and other sales venues, in abattoirs and at points of entry to the country. Where forged or tampered passports accompanying horses to slaughter are detected, it is Department policy that such animals are destroyed and removed from the food chain.</p><p>The Department maintains ongoing vigilance in relation to official controls on the identification of horses through national and EU legislation. In this connection, the European Communities (Equine) (Amendment) Regulations, S.I. No. 371/2012,<b></b>  introduced recently, provide for the updating of S.I. No. 357/2011 (European Communities (Equine) Regulations 2011) to strengthen the powers of the Minister in relation to approval of an issuing body for equine passports, authorised officers and prosecutions in relation to equine identification.</p><p>  The Department is also developing a central database (traceability system) of horses which will involve migration of selected data from passport issuing organisations to the Department. The database will be populated by information provided from the databases maintained by the passport issuing organisations; by the Department from records obtained from sources such as slaughter plants and knackeries; and by Local Authority Veterinary Inspectors in respect of records maintained at appropriate slaughter plants.</p></reply>

This funding has been allocated.  A capital allocation of &euro;3.25m for childcare facilities is available to my Department in 2013, and I am currently considering how this allocation can best be utilised for the benefit of the childcare sector. </p><p>  My Department does however continue to provide support to parents to assist them with the daily cost of childcare.  This support is provided through the provision of two targeted childcare support programmes - the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme - and the universal Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.</p><p>  The CCS programme provides funding to community-based childcare services to enable them to provide childcare at reduced rates to parents in receipt of social welfare payments.  For the purpose of the CCS programme, eligibility is determined by reference to a range of means-tested allowances and payments including receipt of a social welfare payment, Family Income Supplement (FIS) and qualification for a medical or GP visit card.  Eligibility for a GP visit card is based on net income and takes account of outgoings such as rent and mortgage repayments and other expenses including childcare costs and travelling expenses.  As a result, middle and low income working parents may also qualify for support.  Parents who qualify for the top rate of subvention under the programme receive &euro;95 per week towards full-day childcare costs. </p><p>The CETS<b></b>programme provides &euro;145 towards the weekly cost of full time childcare places for trainees and students whose children are enrolled in a participating service and who are deemed qualified by F&Aacute;S or the VEC to qualify for childcare support under the programme.    Students on part-time courses are funded on a pro-rata basis.    </p><p>  The ECCE programme provides one free  preschool year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.   Children aged between 3 years 2 months and 4 years 6 months at 1 September in the relevant year qualify for a maximum of 15 hours per week free preschool provision over a 38 week period.  This is a universal programme to which all children have access.</p><p>  In 2012, the total expenditure by my Department on these three programmes was in the region of &euro;240 million.  These programmes have been maintained despite the ongoing need to reduce Government expenditure and they represent a significant investment in supporting parents with the cost of childcare.</p><p>  You may also be aware that, as part of Budget 2013, I and my colleague the Minister for Social Protection announced a joint school-age childcare initiative which will provide further support to both the community and the private childcare sector. This initiative, which represents a full year investment of &euro;14 million, will provide important support to parents in low income families wishing to take up employment, along with ensuring that quality after-school care is in place to support children's development.  </p><p>  Future developments relating to early years care and education will be considered during preparation of the new National Early Years Strategy which is currently being developed by my Department and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2013.  This Strategy will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as health, family support, learning and development and care and education and will identify the structures and policies needed to improve early year's experience in Ireland.</p></reply>

In these circumstances, future adoptions from Ethiopia would require a bilateral agreement between Ireland and Ethiopia. The negotiation of bilateral agreements on intercountry adoption with states who have not ratified the Hague Convention is governed by Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010 which states that &quot;the Authority, with the prior consent of the Minister, may enter into discussions with any non-contracting state concerning the possibility of the Government entering into a bilateral agreement with that State.&quot;</p><p>  The Adoption Authority delegation visit to Ethiopia in April of 2012 was an initial part of the Authority's deliberations on the feasibility and suitability of entering into discussions with Ethiopia on a bilateral adoption agreement. The Authority forwarded a report of their visit to me in May 2012. The Authority is awaiting legal advice regarding the compatibility of  the Irish and Ethiopian adoption legislation. The Authority has also informed me that it has asked the Irish Embassy to make the appropriate contacts in the Ministry of Women's Affairs in Ethiopia with a view to verifying the stance of the Ethiopian authorities to entering into exploratory talks in relation to a bilateral agreement. I await the AAI advice in this regard. </p><p>  According to information provided by the Adoption Authority, there have been no applications for registration of foreign adoptions from Belarus since 2007, when one application relating to an adoption effected in 2002 was made.</p><p>  Belarus has ratified the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.  However, the National Central Authority of Belarus has not indicated that it will accept applications from persons resident in Ireland. Legal issues exist including the monitoring of post placement reports, registration of the adopted child at the Belarussian embassy in London and consular visits to the homes of adoptive parents.</p><p>  Prospective adoptive parents with a valid Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability to Adopt who are undertaking an intercountry adoption should ensure the adoption complies fully with the Adoption Act, 2010 and the Hague Convention. Further information in this regard can be found on the Adoption Authority website (www.aai.gov.ie).</p></reply>

The work of the Task Force informed the development of detailed legislative proposals to Government, covering a range of areas including the function and services to be overseen by the Agency, governance structures and implementation arrangements. Arising out of these proposals, the Government approved the Heads of the Child and Family Support Agency Bill and has also agreed to the priority drafting of this Bill. The Agency will encompass services which are currently the responsibility of three separate agencies; namely the HSE, the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board. The necessary legislative and organisational preparations are being prioritised so that the Agency can be established as a priority. Drafting of the Child and Family Support Agency Bill is under way, in line with the policy decisions of Government. This legislation will be published, presented to the Oireachtas and debated at the earliest opportunity. The precise mechanism for this will be determined shortly.  A target date for the establishment of the new Agency will be set when consideration of the legislation is advanced.   </p><p>  While the legislative process is under way, all necessary organisational preparations are continuing in parallel. These preparations are being overseen by a high level group chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and involving representatives of the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE and the incoming management team of the new Agency.</p><p>  When established, the Agency will constitute one of the largest public agencies in the State with staff of over 4,000 employees. It represents one of the largest and most ambitious areas of public sector reform currently underway. The milestones already achieved are considerable: a dedicated management structure for child welfare and protection services has been established under the leadership of Gordon Jeyes with a reduction in management units and reporting levels; a dedicated budget has been established and publicly reported upon, to ensure budgetary transparency and accountability; there has been successful recruitment to five of the six top management posts with candidates now in place; and very significant progress has been made in addressing issues for staff by means of intensive engagement in an agreed industrial relations framework. From the outset I set a demanding timetable for the establishment of the new Agency. It is important that the pace of change is maintained, while appreciating the nature of this large scale change requires much advance preparation and reliance on the best standards of public administration. </p><p>  I am satisfied that very considerable progress has already been achieved in the reform of Ireland&rsquo;s child protection and welfare services. I am confident that the establishment of the Agency will bring a dedicated focus to child protection, family support and other key children&rsquo;s services for the first time in the history of the State and will in time contribute to the transformation of what are essential services for families and communities.</p></reply>

One of the policy issues which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the new Strategy is the development of the childminding sector as a fully-integrated component of early childhood care and education, in particular for under-one age group.</p><p>  At present, preschool services are regulated under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No.2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991.  Services providing care for children who have not yet commenced primary school are required to notify their service to the Preschool Inspectorate of the Health Service Executive (HSE) and are subject to inspection and report by the Inspectorate on a regular basis.  Services covered by the Regulations include full-time, part-time and sessional services as well as childminders taking care of more than three preschool children from different families in the childminder&rsquo;s home.  </p><p>  Childminders taking care of not more than three preschool children from different families are not covered by the Regulations.  Decisions on how best to regulate the childminding sector will continue to form part of the ongoing work on the Early Years Strategy.</p><p>  The Children First National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children, which I published in 2011, provides clarity and guidance for individuals and organisations in identifying and responding appropriately to child abuse and neglect. It also sets out what organisations that care for or work with children should do to ensure those children are safe whilst in the care of the organisation. The Government has committed, as a priority, to the introduction of legislation to underpin Children First.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that I published the Heads of the Children First Bill   in April 2012. The purpose of publishing the Heads was to allow for a full consultation at an early stage in developing the Bill.</p><p>  I asked the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children to consider the Heads of the Children First Bill and make recommendations.  I received their comprehensive Report and my Department is currently considering the broad range of submissions to, and recommendations of, the Joint Committee,  including those submissions pertaining to the issue of childminders.</p></reply>

However, there was a recognition at the time of the difficulties of regulating the childminding sector, given its scale and the strong view that women should not be subject to regulation if they minded a small number of additional children.  As a result, the majority of childminders are exempt from the Regulations currently in place.</p><p>  The 2000 Expert Working Group on Childcare set out a plan for integrating the various strands of child care and education, including childminding.  It made a number of recommendations aimed at overcoming the barriers preventing childminders from moving into the formal economy, most of which have been implemented.  These included the introduction of a system for voluntary notification of childminders, and the introduction of Childcare Services Relief, which allows a voluntarily-notified childminder to mind up to three children without paying tax on the earnings and to make a PRSI contribution.</p><p>  In 2002, the Health Service Executive (HSE) agreed to fund a Childminding Advisory Officer post in each county, who would work with the 33 City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) funded under the Childcare Programme, implemented by the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The role included notifying childminders of training opportunities, providing networking opportunities and supporting the voluntary notification system which was being developed by the CCCs.  While Childminding Advisory Officers were established in most county areas, this was not always the case and they were not always located with the local CCC.  Despite their presence and the additional supports including training, a small capital grant scheme and the introduction of a tax relief for childminding in 2006, the increase in the number of voluntarily-notified childminders since 2004, when the number was 500, has been relatively small and levelled off at 1,250</p><p>  In recent years, HSE funding for the Childminding Advisory Officer posts has gradually decreased, and is no longer in place in some areas.  I understand that this is due to pressure on HSE resources and the need to prioritise funding to other areas of front-line services.  While this is not a welcome development, I would point to the fact that the CCCs are now well-established and effective bodies at local level, and that supporting the childminding sector is an integral part of their work.  As a result, childminders continue to have access to support, training and advice.</p><p>  My Department provides annual funding to each CCC to enable them to support and advise all childcare providers at local level.  In 2012, the total amount allocated to the CCCs was &euro;11.3m.  In addition, in 2012 my Department provided &euro;220,000 to the CCCs for Childminding Development Grants.  My Department also provides annual funding, totalling &euro;2.85m in 2012, to seven National Voluntary Childcare Organisations to provide support at a local level to their members.  This included &euro;358,000 for Childminding Ireland, the representative body for childminders.</p><p>  In 2007, the then Office of the Minister for Children published National Guidelines for Childminders which had been developed by its National Childcare Co-ordinating Committee.  The Guidelines provide information to childminders on whether they are subject to the Child Care Regulations, the voluntary notification system, the tax relief for childminders, as well as guidance on good practice and other useful information on the role of the childminder in the provision of childcare services.</p><p>  My Department has commenced work on Ireland's first Early Years Strategy.  I have received Government approval for the approach I am taking in developing this Strategy as an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of our Early Years sector, aimed at providing a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from bith to the age of six.  One of the policy issues which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the Early Years Strategy is the development of the childminding sector as a fully-integrated component of early childhood care and education, in particular for the under-one age group.</p><p>  Under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No 2) Regulations 2006, services providing care for children who have not yet commenced primary school are required to notify their service to the Pre-School Inspectorate of the HSE, and are subject to inspection and report by the Inspectorate on a regular basis.  Services covered by the Regulations include full-time, part-time and sessional services, as well as childminders taking care of more than three pre-school children from different families in the childminder's home.</p><p>  Childminders taking care of not more than three pre-school children from different families are not covered by the Regulations.   Decisions on how best to regulate and support the childminding sector will continue to form part of the ongoing work on the Early Years Strategy.</p></reply>

The necessary legislative and organisational preparations are being prioritised so that the Agency can be established as a priority. </p><p>  From its establishment the Child and Family Support Agency will have service responsibility for a range of services, including child welfare and protection services currently operated by the HSE; domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services. The functions of the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board will transfer into the Child and Family Support Agency upon its establishment. </p><p>  The Government's consideration of these matters was informed, by the content and recommendations of the Report of the Task Force on the Child and Family Support Agency which I published in July 2012.  The Task Force considered that the Agency needs to be as broadly based as possible and should include a range of prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic care interventions.  </p><p>  It is my intention that the agency will have a role in supporting families and communities. It will have the benefit in this role of 106 Family Resource Centres which have been developed across the country with funding from the Family Support Agency.

While the composition of the Board will reflect the component organisations which are being amalgamated into the Child and Family Support Agency. The criteria for Board membership will be focused on ensuring that Board members have the requisite mix of experience and competencies needed to steer such a large organisation providing a diverse range of personal services.  The new Agency and the wider transformation of children's services represents the largest, and most ambitious, areas of public sector of reform embarked upon by this Government.</p></reply>

These are the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI); the Family Support Agency (FSA); the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) and the Ombudsman for Children.    With effect from 1 January 2012, I have taken responsibility for the Children Detention Schools as provided in Part 10 of the Children Act 2001. </p><p>  Apart from the Ombudsman for Children's Office which does not have a board, I am responsible for all Board of Management appointments.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, in line with the Government decision of April 2011, new arrangements were put in place for the making of appointments to State Boards and bodies.  Following this Government Decision, on my Department's website I have invited expressions of interest from persons interested in being appointed to the boards of State Bodies and Agencies operating under the Department's aegis. The notice indicates the vacancies in the boards of the respective bodies. My officials acknowledge all expressions of interest received and maintain a database of those expressions. My Department&rsquo;s website is monitored and updated on a regular basis to reflect the number of vacancies as they arise.  </p><p>  Those who are being proposed for appointment as Chairpersons of State Boards are now required to make themselves available to the appropriate Oireachtas Committee to discuss the approach they will take as Chairperson and their views about the future contribution of the body or board in question.  Following that discussion, decisions would then be taken by the Minister or the Government, as appropriate, to confirm the nominee as Chairperson.Since my appointment as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs on 9th   March 2011, I have made 35 appointments including 3 Chairpersons to the Boards of Management under the aegis of my Department.  </p><p>Mr. Joe Horan, Chairperson designate for the Board of Management of the Children Detention Schools appeared before the Joint Committee on Health and Children on 8th March, 2012.  I subsequently appointed Mr. Horan as Chairperson to the Board on 26th   March, 2012.  There is a fee of &euro;5,985 per annum attached to the position of Chairperson.  Mr. Horan agreed to waive this fee for his position as Chairperson to the Board.   </p><p>Ms. Sharon Foley, Chairperson designate of the Board of Management of the Family Support Agency also appeared before the same Committee on 8th March, 2012. I subsequently appointed Ms Foley as Chairperson to the Board on 26th   March, 2012.  Ms. Foley is in receipt of remuneration of &euro;8,978 per annum.  </p><p>Ms. Nuala Doherty, Chairperson designate of the National Educational Welfare Board appeared before the Committee on 26th July, 2012.  I subsequently appointed Ms. Doherty as Chairperson on 30th   July, 2012.  Ms. Doherty is not in receipt of any remuneration for her position as Chairperson to the Board. </p><p>  In making my decisions on appointments to Boards, subject to the governing legislation, I consider the most suitable persons for the positions available with due regard to the body or agency in question and its particular responsibilities and I seek to ensure that the appropriate mix of skills and experience is in place to achieve the best result.</p></reply>

Its <i>National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years</i>  ), established since 2010, seeks to bring consistency in service delivery and a clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need, regardless of where they live, which pre-school or school they attend or the nature of their disability. In practical terms this means that health professionals and parents will know exactly where a child should be referred and how to refer them. Services may be provided at primary care level or by early intervention and school age disability teams, with access to specialist services, according to the child's needs.   </p><p>  The Deputy's question relates to the provision of therapy supports by Beechpark services to a particular school. As this is a service matter I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

In recent years, a number of changes to the pricing and reimbursement system have been successfully introduced in Ireland. These have resulted in reductions in the prices of thousands of medicines.</p><p>  The Department and the HSE have successfully finalised discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic industry, on a new agreement to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs. Under this Agreement, from 1 November 2012, the HSE will only reimburse generic products which have been priced at 50% or less of the initial price of an originator medicine. In the event that an originator medicine is priced at less than 50% of its initial price the HSE will require a generic price to be priced below the originator price. This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate. In addition, the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which is currently before the House, provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing for prescribed drugs and medicines. These reforms will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for taxpayers and patients. </p></reply>

No. 494 of 2004 European Communities (Organisation of Working Time) (Activities of Doctors in Training) Regulations 2004, which transposed the EU Working Time Directive for doctors in training, provides for:</p><p>- A maximum 48 hour average working week;</p><p>- 11 hours rest every 24 hours or equivalent compensatory rest before return to work; and</p><p>- 35 hours continuous rest per week or twice a fortnight or 59 hours continuous rest per fortnight.</p><p>  There has been a significant reduction in the weekly hours worked by NCHDs in recent years.  Typically NCHDs work approximately 55 hours per week.  Further work is therefore required to achieve compliance with the requirements of the Directive.</p><p>  In January 2012, Ireland submitted to the EU Commission a detailed Plan for the achievement of compliance by NCHDs with the Working Time Directive.  The plan affirmed Ireland's commitment to achieving compliance with the Directive over a three-year time period.  It committed to implementing measures to compliance, including:-</p><p>a. The implementation of new work patterns for medical staff;</p><p>b. Transfer of work undertaken by NCHDs to other grades;</p><p>c. Organisation of hospital services to support EWTD compliance.   </p><p>  Compliance is being progressed in the context of the Government&rsquo;s programme for health reform and at the level of each hospital and through strategic measures in relation to how hospital services are organised and managed.</p><p>  The Health Service Executive&rsquo;s Service Plan for 2013 specifically recognises the need to address the issue as a priority, stating that there will be a particular focus in the acute hospital service on the achievement of compliance with the European Working Time Directive amongst the non-consultant hospital doctor (NCHD) workforce, in line with the Implementation Plan submitted to the Commission in 2012.</p></reply>

Consequently, the HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) has developed a range of initiatives aimed specifically at supporting young people who are suicidal and also supporting their peers in recognising and responding appropriately to signs of emotional distress and suicidal thoughts.   </p><p>  A wide range of awareness and training programmes are available in the area of mental health promotion and suicide prevention.  These include SafeTALK which trains participants to become more alert to the possibility of suicide in their community and other training programmes such as Reaching Out, ASIST, Taking Control, MindOut and STOP.  </p><p>A number of media awareness campaigns have been run in recent years including the <i>Let someone know </i>campaign which focused specifically on young people and delivered the message that it is important to reach out and seek the support of others.  Other awareness programmes include the <i>The Please Talk </i>  initiative, running in third level colleges since 2007, which encourages young people experiencing problems to talk to others and identifies the supports available to those in need.  </p><p><i>Jigsaw,</i>  an innovative community-based support service for young people, has been developed by Headstrong and is designed to promote systems of care that are accessible, youth-friendly, integrated, and engaging for young people.  Through additional Innovation Funding, this service is now available or in development in 11 sites around the country.  </p><p>Schools are one of the key settings for the promotion of mental health and well-being of young people and they are also in the position to identify young people experiencing emotional difficulties.  The Departments of Health and Education and Skills have been working closely with the HSE and the NOSP to develop <i>Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention </i>  in post-primary schools.    These Guidelines will be launched in the very near future.</p><p>  The special provision of &euro;35m for mental health in 2012 was allocated primarily for measures  to further strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both adult and children's mental health services, to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention and to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care, specifically for people with mental health problems. 150 additional posts were allocated to Child and Adolescent Community Mental Health Teams in 2012.  It is envisaged that the completion of the multidisciplinary profile of current teams will help progress the expansion of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services to all young people up to 18 years and reduce the waiting lists for this service.  Budget 2013 provides a further additional &euro;35m for the continued development of our mental health services.  The HSE National Service Plan, which was recently approved by the Minister for Health, commits to the further development of suicide prevention initiatives, forensics and community mental health teams for adults, children, older persons and mental health intellectual disability and to the recruitment of over 470 additional staff to implement these measures.  I expect to see substantive progress in 2013 in relation to the strengthening of Community Mental Health Teams.  </p><p>  The fourth Annual Report on Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), published by the HSE in December 2012 provides a detailed picture of the current stage of development of the HSE's Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services.  Progress in a number of key areas includes a 10% increase in the number of new cases seen by CAMHS in the period October 2011 - September 2012, the introduction of new access protocols for 16 and 17 year olds and the continued reduction in the number of children and adolescents admitted to adult units.</p></reply>

By the end of December 2012, the number of adults having to wait more than 9 months for inpatient and day case surgery  was down to 86 from 3,706 in December 2011, a 98% decrease.  The number of children waiting over 20 weeks for inpatient or daycase surgery was down to 89 from 1,759 in December 2011, a 95% decrease.  The number of patients waiting over 13 weeks for a routine endoscopy procedure went down from 4,590 in December 2011 to 36 at the end of December 2012, a 99% decrease.</p><p>  These are significant achievements that show what can be done to tackle access to inpatient and daycase services. The progress made in 2012 does not mean the problem is solved, and 2013 will remain very challenging. However, these improvements reflect my commitment, and that of this Government, to ensuring patients can access the acute hospital services they need, when they need them.</p><p>  Improving access to outpatient services is also a priority for the Government and for the Special Delivery Unit Scheduled Care Team.  Building on work already undertaken by the HSE, the NTPF has now taken over the reporting of outpatient waiting time data. For the first time, clear and comprehensive data on this problem is being reported.  In the first instance, the data now being collected will allow the SDU and NTPF to target their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  A maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment by 30 November 2013.</p><p>  In relation to the specific query raised in relation to the Galway group of hospitals, as this is a service issue, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

Significant resources have been invested in recent years in the health sector in these services and the HSE provides a range of community and residential services including therapeutic services and respite.  The HSE is currently engaged in a reconfiguration of existing therapy resources to geographic based teams for children and young people with disabilities under its Progressing Disabilities Programme for Children and Young People (0-18 years).  This aims to increase the level of consistency and standardisation in the way both early intervention services and services for school-aged children with disabilities are delivered.  A detailed action plan is being implemented with the following objectives:</p><p>-  One clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need</p><p>-  Resources used to the greatest benefit for all children and families</p><p>-  Health and education working together to support children to achieve their potential.</p><p>  The health and education sectors co-operate on a regular basis with a view to integrating their services for these children as much as possible and targeting them to areas of greatest need. At the same time there is a need to strengthen this co-operation and I am personally committed to this issue. I have established the Children, Adolescents and Young People with Complex Disabilities Unit in my Department led by a Principal Officer. This important development aims to foster greater collaboration between my Department, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on children&rsquo;s disability issues including autism and to build on the cross-sectoral working arrangements that are already in place.</p><p>  In relation to the specific queries raised by the Deputy, as these are service issues they have been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government contains a commitment to put a permanent scheme of risk equalisation in place, which is a key requirement for the existing private health insurance market and is designed to keep health insurance affordable for older persons and to maintain the stability of the market.  The Health Insurance (Amendment) Act, 2012 gave effect to a new Risk Equalisation Scheme (RES) with effect from 1 January 2013.  An effective and robust RES is required in the Irish private health insurance market in order to protect affordability for those who need it most.</p><p>  Last year I announced the rates of risk equalisation credits to apply from 31 March 2013 under this Act.  The rates are funded by a stamp duty payable by all insurers in respect of each insured person.  The credit is provided at source &ndash; that is, the cost of the policy is reduced by the amount of the risk equalisation credit.  The measures are designed to result in no overall increase of premiums paid in the market and to spread the risk more evenly between the healthy and the less healthy, as well as the old and the young.  This action is in line with plans to move to Universal Health Insurance, under which everyone will be insured for health care.</p><p>  I am concerned at the increasing cost of health care.  Last year I established the Health Insurance Consultative Forum which comprises representatives from the country's main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) and the Department of Health.  This Forum was established to generate ideas which would help address health insurance costs, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law.  The Forum will also give a voice to the insurers in the development of the new Universal Health Insurance model.  I have also made it clear to the health insurers that I believe that significant savings can still be made, the effect of which can be to minimise the need for increases in premiums.</p><p>  I would also strongly advise consumers to contact a number of health insurance companies to find the plan that best suits their needs.  Consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and to reduce their premium costs.  The HIA provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits. The HIA's website www.hia.ie has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.</p><p>  In relation to the 16% of the insured population who currently have a lower level of cover, I am confident that when the new rates applicable under the Risk Equalisation come into effect on 31 March, there will continue to be a significant number of such policies available to consumers.</p></reply>

It delivers on the Government commitment to introduce a new Risk Equalisation Scheme from 1 January 2013.  Under Section 11E of the Act, the Health Insurance Authority (HIA), as market regulator, is charged with evaluating and analysing all types of relevant contracts to be made available in the market.  Where it is satisfied that a type of relevant contract does not provide for &quot;advanced cover&quot;, the Authority shall specify by regulations, that the Authority is satisfied that this type of contract does not provide for such cover.  After making such regulations, the Authority will enter the particulars of the relevant contract in the Register of Health Insurance Contracts.</p><p>  Following consultation with the industry under the auspices of the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance, I introduced a number of amendments to the proposed Bill at D&aacute;il Committee Stage.  In order to allow the industry time to trade into the new Scheme, the legislation provided that the two stamp duty rates (and corresponding risk equalisation credits) would take effect from 31 March 2013.  In addition, at the industry&rsquo;s request, I made provision for an objective delineation between non-advanced and advanced cover.  In relation to lower level products (providing cover mainly for public hospitals), in November last year, the HIA considered that there were 47 products that provided cover mainly in public hospitals.  However, as then written, those products also provide some additional cover (e.g. full cover for some procedures or day case cover) which meant they did not comply with the definition of non-advanced cover.</p><p>  The HIA had significant dialogue with all four health insurers in December 2012 in the run up to its determination at 1 January 2013 as to whether the products on sale at that time provided cover at advanced /non advanced level.  These conversations included enquiries as to how it arrived at its decisions in December.  I understand that the HIA has had further discussions with the industry and that it will continue to do so.  Under the legislation a registered undertaking can: i, introduce new products at any time (subject to 30 days notice to the market regulator) or ii alter the benefits payable under an existing product (subject to 30 days notice, where the product has been available on the market for 60 days) with effect from 31 March in 2013 and 1 January of any subsequent year.  By 31 March (when the split level of cover takes effect), the HIA expect a significant number of products will be at non-advanced level.</p></reply>

Under these  Regulations, the HSE must apply charges (subject to certain exemptions) to all those who receive in-patient services for longer than 30 days over a rolling 12 month period. <b></b>Charges apply whether or not the person has full or limited eligibility. The level of the charges is based on income and cannot exceed 80% of the weekly non-contributory State pension. The Regulations currently provide for a maximum charge of &euro;175 per week where in-patient care is provided in a setting with 24-hour nursing care or a maximum of &euro;130 per week where in-patient care is provided in other settings.

Performance in relation to this target it is currently being met and will continue to be monitored closely.  The Executive introduced a new I.T. system in the last quarter of 2011 and this has  led to a significant improvement in its overall response time to referred questions. </p><p>  In 2012, 4,045 questions were referred to the Executive for direct reply to Deputies.

Taking into account questions which took longer than the 15 day timeframe to answer, the figures show that 3,981 (98%) of referred questions have now been answered. 64 questions (2%) remain open and it is expected that these questions will be finalised in the near future.  My Department holds regular meetings with the HSE's Parliamentary Affairs Division to monitor response times and to emphasise the importance of issuing timely and comprehensive replies to Deputies.</p></reply>

This was a comprehensive study of the health and social status of the Traveller community in Ireland and was carried out by the School of Public Health, Physiotherapy and Population Science, University College Dublin on behalf of Travellers, with the direct involvement of Travellers.  The findings of the Study provide a strong evidence base for assessing existing and future service delivery and allowed the identification of a range priorities and means of addressing these.  The key findings of the study were that Travellers experienced higher levels of morbidity and mortality.  Life expectancy for Travellers was over 11 years lower for women and over 15 years lower for men &ndash; the same as in 1987.  Priority areas for action were identified, including mental health &amp;amp; suicide; men&rsquo;s health; addiction/alcohol; domestic violence; diabetes and cardiovascular health.  The forthcoming Health and Wellbeing Framework will put in place new structures which will focus on the cross sectoral social determinants of health and will incorporate actions relating to addressing health inequalities among marginalised groups such as Travellers.  </p><p>  Traveller Health Units (THUs) operate in each HSE area and work in partnership with local Traveller organisations.  Peer led healthcare projects known as Primary Healthcare Projects play an invaluable role.  They began in 1994 and now there are over 40 projects involving over 450 participants.  In addition the HSE&rsquo;s National Traveller Health Advisory Forum (NTHAF) is a governance body comprising THUs and Traveller representation as well as HSE personnel working together to address key priorities.  These structures are accountable to the National Social Inclusion Governance Group in the Health Service Executive.</p><p>  An amount of &euro;10,546,230 was spent on Traveller health via Traveller Health Units during 2011.  This amount excludes the costs of core/mainstream services accessed by members of the Travelling community e.g. GP services, foster care etc.  Efforts have continued to ensure that funding for all vulnerable groups remains protected as far as possible.  New initiatives in the form of health awareness programmes and health screening will be delivered via the Traveller Health Units/Primary Care Projects in each HSE region and will target those most at risk in the Traveller community.</p></reply>

The scheme is founded on the basis that long-term care should be affordable and that a person should receive the same level of State support whether they choose a public, voluntary or private nursing home. Nursing home residents in receipt of financial support under the Scheme contribute towards the cost of their care according to their means. </p><p>  In 2012, the HSE's total gross budget for long-term residential care was &euro;994.7m. At the end of November there were 22,223 people  in receipt of financial support towards the cost of long-term nursing home care. The HSE's 2013 Service Plan sets a target of 22,761 people to be in receipt of financial support at end-2013. Increasing the level of the asset contribution  from 5% to 7.5% will contribute to the sustainability of the Scheme and will enable additional applicants to be supported in 2013.  It has to be borne in mind that, during 2013, the HSE is required to achieve &euro;721m of savings from its overall budget.</p><p>  The Scheme contains several important safeguards which ensure that both the person in the nursing home and their spouse/partner, if applicable, are adequately provided for:<ol type="1"><li>  Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care.</li><li>  The first &euro;36,000 for a person's assets, or &euro;72,000 for a couple, is not taken into account during the financial assessment.</li><li>  The principal residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of a person's time in care.</li><li>  Where an individual's assets include land and property in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from their estate. This is the optional Nursing Home Loan element of the scheme.</li><li>  Individuals keep a personal allowance of 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.</li><li>  If there is a spouse/partner remaining at home, s/he will retain 50% of the couples income, or the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.  Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account during the financial assessment. These allowable deductions include health expenses. </li><li>  There is a financial review mechanism which takes account of the fluctuating value of assets and the fact that cash assets will naturally deplete over time as payments are made to the nursing home etc.</li></ol>  Finally, the Terms of Reference for the review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme include an examination of the sustainability of the Scheme. A public consultation to inform the review was concluded in July 2012. A summary report of the submissions received was published on the Department's website in December. The Department will shortly be seeking tenders through the public procurement process for the carrying out of the review. It will progress within the constraints of available staff and other priorities.  It is envisaged that the review will be completed in 2013. </p></reply>

The intention is to publish a draft policy paper before the end of the year, with the final policy paper available in early 2014.  </p><p>  Today, the aviation sector contributes &euro;4.1 billion to our economy or 2.6% of our GDP and provides direct employment for over 20,000 people. Hence the importance of having a clear policy framework to facilitate continued growth of the sector. The policy will cover all aspects of the industry including airports, airlines, the aircraft maintenance sector, finance, leasing and regulation. </p><p>  In terms of connectivity, I will continue to act as a champion for improved air access to Ireland, be it increased capacity on existing routes or the development of new routes. Already there is significant success in this area with recent announcements by a number of airlines of additional services and routes into Ireland next summer.  This  is very welcome in the context of 'The Gathering Ireland 2013' .</p><p>  Another key priority for me in the aviation sphere will be the successful restructuring of Shannon Airport and a return of passenger growth at the airport. The airport has already been established as an independent company and legislation to merge the airport with a restructured Shannon Development will be advanced in 2013. A key initiative for the future will be the development of an international aviation services centre in and around the airport building on a range of aviation-related activities already undertaken in Shannon such as aircraft maintenance and leasing. In this regard, the report of November last by the Aviation Business Development Task Force states that such an aviation centre could create up to 3,000-3,500 new jobs within five years.</p></reply>

The new system involves three outsourced elements, a card production facility, a front office for engaging with the customer, and a back office to process applications.  All three are overseen by a &lsquo;centre of excellence&rsquo; based in the RSA itself.  For the first few months of 2013, the driver licence service will continue to be available to the public through local authorities.  </p><p>  The fees for driver licences increased with effect from 1 January 2013. This represents the first increase in these fees since 1989 and remains low by international standards.  The increased fee will ensure that the service into the future will be less dependent on Exchequer funding.  </p><p>  I understand from the RSA, that, when the new system comes into operation later this year, the photograph will be digital and will not be stuck on to the card in the way it is to the old paper licence.  The capture of the photograph will be included in the fee for the licence.  As the system develops, the SAFE2 ID standard will be implemented, at which point the only option will be the digital photo taken at the Front Office Network.</p><p>  It should be noted that members of the public will now only have to make one journey to get their photograph taken and license application processed. Furthermore, the &euro;55 fee for a ten year licence includes the cost of the photograph as well as the licence.</p></reply>

This includes funding for replacement  and refurbishment of PSO buses.</p><p>  In the light of the NTA's responsibility in the matter, I have referred the Deputy's question to the Authority for direct reply in relation to the specific queries raised.  Please advise my private office if there is no reply within ten working days.</p></reply>

Therefore, at the NSMC Plenary meeting, on 8 November 2011, Ministers noted that the provision of further funding by the Irish Government for the A5 road was being deferred but that the Irish Government will provide &pound;25 million per annum in 2015 and 2016 towards the project.  At the subsequent June 2012 NSMC Plenary meeting, it was noted that the NI Executive had announced an investment package of major roads including two sections of the A5 project.</p><p>  In addition, it was noted that the Irish Government remains committed to the completion of the co-funded A5 project which is of strategic importance to the North West Region and the island as a whole, but that the Government is not in a position to make funding commitments for the period post-2016 in advance of its consideration of the next capital review framework.  The NSMC plenary approved a funding implementation plan for the A5 project to the end of 2016 which incorporated the &pound;50 million committed by the Irish Government.  The implementation of the project is a matter for the Northern Ireland Road Service.</p></reply>

However there will be no separate allocation for this grant category.  Under the new arrangements local authorities may use up to 7% of their Discretionary Grant towards local improvement schemes should they wish to do so.  The local contribution for these schemes has been increased to 20% of the total cost of the project.  Apart from this amendment the same eligibility rules apply for these schemes. </p><p>  Details of the 2013 regional and local roads grants, which will include details of this, will be communicated to local authorities in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

It outlined long distance routes that had been flagged at a national level that could contribute significantly to cycling tourism in Europe, but not necessarily with any commitment to deliver the routes.</p><p>  With regard to the Atlantic Coast Route concept, whilst there is no specific plan to deliver the route in its entirety, recent funding for the on-road Donegal to Newtowncunningham route aligns with the Atlantic Coast Route concept, and indeed the very successful Great Western Greenway also has a very significant coastal route element.  With regard to Dublin-Galway, again recent funding initiatives have delivered route sections that align with this concept, in particular significant route development along the canal in and around Mullingar.  The NRA is now undertaking detailed route alignment and design work for the route with a view to delivering the  route as a cycling corridor in sections as funding allows. </p></reply>
