CE participants should have a learning plan to identify their development needs, their posts should be supernumerary and they should work under supervision. </p><p>  Private providers may not participate in CE schemes. The CE schemes operate only in community creches, some of which cater for particularly disadvantaged children.  It is therefore essential that these creches employ suitable staff with the capacity to develop skills that will help them support the children in their care.  At the same time, I recognise the importance of ensuring that CE staff receive the training and support they need to follow a career path in childcare.</p><p>  Up to this year, CE workers could continue to claim their previous benefit while being paid to be on the Scheme.  In Budget 2012, and as part of the overall move to standardise welfare payments, a decision was made that workers on a CE scheme would get a single payment.  </p><p>  A number of issues have arisen in relation to the Community Employment Scheme which are under discussion between my Department and the Department of Social Protection.  </p><p>  My priority focus is on ensuring that the interests of children are kept to the forefront and that a focus is maintained on the suitability of CE applicants to work with children. </p><p>  In July following some discussions with County &amp; City Childcare Committees, my Department commenced a new phase of engagement with the Department of Social Protection to seek to reform the Childcare CE Scheme with a view to improving the quality of care in community cr&egrave;ches and to providing a proper career structure that would benefit the participants.  Work is ongoing in this regard.          </p><p>  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) recently discussed this issue with my Department and the Department of Social Protection. A positive meeting was held covering a range of areas and both Departments updated ICTU on the consideration being given to employment and training of CE workers within the childcare sector.</p></reply>

Issues relating to funding of alcohol and drug services provided by this centre are a matter for the Department  of Health.</p><p>  My Department provides funding for the provision of early childhood care and education through three support programmes - the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme,  Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme.  The funding provided under all three programmes is targeted directly at parents who satisfy the qualifying criteria for the particular programme.  There is no other funding available to my Department to support pre-school services over and above that provided under these programmes.  The creche that is attached to the drugs and alcohol centre only applied to become part of the ECCE Programme for the first time for the year 2012-13.  The Centre is in contract with my Department to provide childcare places under the CETS programmes. </p><p>  The Deputy might note that in addition to these funding programmes my Department also administers the application based National Lottery Funding Scheme under which grants are made available to support groups and organisations with an involvement in the provision of supports and services for children and young people. Full particulars of the funding scheme, which has an overall resource allocation of just &euro;500,000 this year, are available on my Department's website - www.dcya.gov.ie</p><p>  I understand that the Centre may be considering the submission of an application to my Department for funding from this Scheme and in this regard it might be noted that the closing date for the submission of completed applications is Friday, 28th September 2012. </p></reply>

One of the recommendations was to extend the remit of the Ombudsman for Children to complaints in respect of boys detained in St. Patrick's Institution. Having consulted with Minister Shatter in this regard, I made an Order by Statutory Instrument No. 210 of 2012 with effect from 1st July 2012 that removed this exclusion. In relation to other recommendations I wrote to a number of my Ministerial colleagues in July seeking their preliminary views on the recommendations which impact on their respective Departments.</p><p>  In parallel with these developments my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr. Brendan Howlin, is reactivating the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill 2008.   While this Bill relates in the main to the Office of the Ombudsman, rather than the Ombudsman for Children, there are common issues being addressed which have potential applicability to the Ombudsman for Children.   Accordingly, my officials have engaged constructively with their colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and other Departments and with the Ombudsman for Children's office to consider the changes being proposed in the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill 2008 and their applicability to the comparable provisions of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002. </p><p>  I understand that Minister Howlin will be advancing his proposals for Committee Stage amendments to the 2008 Bill shortly. I do not want to anticipate the parliamentary process in relation to Minister Howlin's Bill but I am confident that these proposals will address certain recommendations contained in the Report of March 2012 relating to the remit of the Ombudsman for Children. </p><p>  I will consider the remaining recommendations of Ms. Logan's Report in consultation with my colleagues in Government and bring forward proposals for legislation, if appropriate, in due course.</p></reply>

The Donegal project started mid-year and the Cork project started in the third quarter.  Both projects were internally evaluated by the HSE, which then commissioned an independent external assessment, undertaken by Trinity College Dublin. This external assessment has been completed and examined by the HSE which is now developing a national out of hours service model. The HSE has also commenced negotiations with the unions involved.  </p><p>  What is important is that children in crisis, no matter where they are, have access to 24 hour social work assistance, and this is what the HSE's National Director for Children and Family Services and I are working towards. Clearly whatever model emerges will need to address the challenges of varying demographic demands in both rural and urban settings. I have discussed this issue with Gordon Jeyes, National Director for Children and Family Services in the HSE and I expect the HSE to bring forward an implementation plan for the roll out of a national service model, later this year, for implementation by the new Child and Family Support Agency.</p><p>  It should be noted that at present the Health Service Executive provides out-of-hours emergency services for children at risk in the greater Dublin area through the Crisis Intervention Service, and outside the greater Dublin area through the Emergency Place of Safety Service.</p><p>  The Crisis Intervention Service provides out-of-hours emergency social work assistance to young people aged under 18 years. The service operates across the greater Dublin area (Counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow). Referrals are made by service providers outside of normal working hours i.e. Gardai, hospital and ambulance service personnel. </p><p>  The Emergency Place of Safety Service, operates outside the greater Dublin area,  whereby Gardai can access an emergency placement for children found to be at risk out-of-hours. This service involves the placement of a child in a family setting until the next working day, when the local social work service assumes responsibility for the case. As part of this service Gardai have access to advice and information from a non-HSE social work off-site resource which is provided on a contract basis.</p></reply>

The Report served to highlight the need to strengthen the organisation and delivery of child welfare and protection services nationally. </p><p>  Following the publication of the Report a detailed Implementation Plan was prepared and published in July 2009. The Plan sets out a series of 99 actions designed to address the effects of past abuse, reform  and strengthen service provision and ensure that children and young people have a stronger voice. </p><p>  Implementation of the Plan is being overseen by a high level group which I personally chair. The group includes representatives from my Department, the HSE, HIQA, the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS), the Department of Education and Skills and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I also invited the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance to join the group. The next meeting of the high level group is scheduled on 15th October to consider the third annual progress report, which I hope to present to Government and the Oireachtas shortly thereafter.</p></reply>

Preparations for Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency programme are well in hand. </p><p>  We are working closely with our trio Presidency partners - Lithuania and Greece- and the EU Commission to coordinate our respective national policy priorities for youth under the broad headline theme of &lsquo;Social Inclusion&rsquo;. This theme will inform the work of the Youth Council over the 18 months period commencing with the Irish Presidency in 2013.   </p><p>  My aim is to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of Ministers with responsibility for Youth Affairs is relevant and responsive to current issues affecting young people in the EU and that our Presidency makes a substantial contribution to the development of both national and EU youth policy for the coming years.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s priority for our Presidency term will focus on the contribution of quality youth work to young people&rsquo;s development and wellbeing.</p><p>  I consider that youth work has a particular relevance and potential when it comes to seeking to support those young people, who may not be in formalised education, in employment or training, the so-called NEET cohort. This group of young people is a significant concern across all Member States. </p><p>  Our national priority will be build on Ireland&rsquo;s work in the area of quality standards, via the National Quality Standards Framework for youth work and the Standards for Local Volunteer-led Youth Groups, developed by my Department. This work programme  is well regarded by European institutions and member states. The Irish Presidency provides an important opportunity for Ireland to share its knowledge and learning in this area.</p><p>  The flagship event of Ireland&rsquo;s Youth Presidency will be the EU Youth Conference which I will host in Dublin in March 2013. It is anticipated that over 220 participants, young people together with senior officials from all Members States and the EU institutions will participate in the event. I will bring the findings and recommendations of the youth conference to the Council of Youth Ministers in May 2013. </p><p>  Our Presidency will also provide an opportunity to respond to the recently published joint Council/ Commission report the EU Youth Strategy (2010 to 2018) which calls for a greater youth policy focus on achieving the objective of the Europe 2020 growth agenda, including in relation to youth employment. This report will be considered at the upcoming Council of Youth Minister&rsquo;s meeting in November 2012, which I will attend. As part of Ireland's Presidency I plan to host a high-level roundtable event in Dublin which will explore youth work&rsquo;s contribution to achieving the goals of Europe 2020, including issues relating to youth employment.</p></reply>

Some 600 organisations are funded each year. These services aim to support people to deal with difficulties they are experiencing in their relationships, to help children whose lives have been affected by parental separation and to support families who have experienced the death of a family member. Over 20,000, individual counselling sessions were delivered within Family Resource Centres in 2010. </p><p>  In 2011, the Family Support Agency, which is under the remit of my Department, provided &euro;10,000 to fund a scoping study on the feasibility and necessity of a bereavement network. I subsequently launched the Irish Childhood Bereavement Network in July 2012. The Network is a hub for those working with bereaved children, young people and their families, which improves access to bereavement information, allow for the sharing of expertise, knowledge and experience, and improve the range and quality of bereavement support available to children, young people, and crucially, those caring for them. In this respect it is very welcome. The Network is being hosted for an initial period by the Irish Hospice Foundation. It will be the subject of an interim review after 2 years and an evaluation after 5 years. </p><p>  The Network is in the early stages of development and is currently inviting members, with a target of seventy members set for the first year. I am advised by the Family Support Agency that it provides funding to many of the members of the Network, and that any collaboration which improves efficiencies is to be welcomed .</p></reply>

The service operates across the greater Dublin area (Counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow). Referrals are made by service providers outside of normal working hours i.e. Gardai, hospital and ambulance service personnel.  The service was established in 1992 and originally responded to young people between the ages of 12 and 18 years. Since 2005 the CIS was expanded to include all children up to the age of 18 years. </p><p>  The remit of the Crisis Intervention Service is to respond to crisis situations whereby a child or young person requires immediate placement, either due to child protection concerns, where there is a breakdown in family relationships, placement breakdowns or due to accommodation issues. CIS aims to prevent children or young people from having to access emergency care unnecessarily. Where it is appropriate, CIS tries to place children or young people with alternative family members or friends or mediate between children/young people and parents where there is a breakdown in family relations. The Crisis Intervention Service put a significant amount of effort into ensuring that placing a child or young person within emergency residential units or foster care is a last resort. </p><p>  Referrals are received to the Crisis Intervention Service by telephone from service providers working at night, for example An Garda Siochana, Hospitals, Ambulance Services. Referrals are accepted in relation to: concerns regarding the immediate welfare of children; young people in crisis seeking emergency accommodation; young people who are identified by the Garda National Immigration Bureau as separated children seeking asylum.</p><p>  All details of contacts with children are passed to the local social work team by the start of the working day. The local social work team are the case managers and will follow up on any further assessments or interventions necessary. </p><p>  The precise information requested by the Deputy is not routinely collected by the HSE.   However during 2011, the total number of children who were accommodated in CIS emergency placements was 288.  During the 1st and 2nd quarter of 2012, a total of 141 children/young people were referred to the CIS for emergency accommodation.</p></reply>

Funding of some &#8364;56.626m is available from my Department in 2012 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country through a number of schemes.  These schemes include the Youth Service Grant Scheme, the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People&#8217;s Facilities and Services Fund and certain other provisions including the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme, Youth Information Centres, the European Youth in Action Programme (administered by L&eacute;argas &#8211; the Exchange Bureau) and Gaisce &#8211; the President&#8217;s Award.</p><p>  The main objective of my Department, in the provision of support for youth services, is to develop and implement coherent, coordinated and relevant youth policies to support the youth sector in providing effective non-formal education and developmental opportunities for young people through which they can enhance and develop their personal and social skills and competencies. Quality youth services can enhance young people&#8217;s social and personal development and their physical, emotional and mental wellbeing.  The opportunities youth services provide also equip young people with applicable and transferable skills and experiences which can prove highly-valuable for young people and can help them address the various challenges, including socio and economic challenges that they may  face in life.</p><p>  My Department is developing a new Youth Policy Framework for publication in 2013. The new Youth Policy Framework will seek to ensure that youth work structures, services and supports are optimised to help young people acquire the skills and competences they need, achieve their goals and assist them in accessing education, training, employment and entrepreneurial opportunities. Expert opinion, the views of young people themselves and of those who work with them are highly important to the way the framework is being developed. I have set up an expert reference group, comprising youth practitioners, managers of young people's services, youth leaders, academics, researchers and other experts and they are actively contributing their knowledge and experience to my Department&#8217;s work. The outcomes from a symposium on Exploring Outcomes in Youth Work which I hosted in July are also feeding into the Youth Policy Framework<b>. </b>Youth policy developments at European level during Ireland&#8217;s Presidency of the EU Council of Ministers in 2013, along with the experience of youth service providers, experts and young people themselves and the findings from a review of the international evidence on  outcomes in youth work carried out by the Institute of Education, London on behalf of the Department, will also inform Ireland&#8217;s national policy for young people.</p><p>  Furthermore, I am in the process of appointing a new National Youth Work Advisory Committee (NYWAC) under the terms of the Youth Work Act, 2001.  This Advisory Committee which comprises equal representation from the voluntary youth work sector and Government departments and statutory agencies will contribute to the development of the Youth Policy Framework. These experts will advise and assist me in the development of a coherent and responsive youth policy which will direct and support the provision of relevant services and programmes that will meet the needs of young people in the years ahead.</p></reply>

This will involve the delivery within two years of sufficient new facilities at Oberstown to accommodate all children that are subject to detention by the courts, ending the requirement for anyone under 18 years to be sent to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.   In addition to this I announced interim measures which included a pledge that the age range for the detention schools would be extended to include 16 year old boys.  This was given effect from 1 May 2012 and I am happy to report that there are no longer any 16 year olds being detained in St. Patrick's Institution.</p><p>  Work is progressing well on the project to develop the Oberstown campus with a pre-qualification process for contractors for the specialist areas, such as fire safety, security, mechanical and electrical, and for the main contractor near completion.  Tenders will issue later this year with a view to having construction commence on site in May 2013.  On 13 August 2012 the required planning notice was published in the national media and documentation was made available for consultation by the public.  Prior to this notice being published, officials from my Department organised a question and answers meeting with members of the local community and held an open day with staff on the campus to brief them on the project to date.   I have been informed that the period for making observations for the planning process has closed and that the final determination is expected to be made shortly.</p></reply>

Both organisations have been working collaboratively at my request to promote improved safeguarding practices across the Church. I acknowledge the advances being made by the National Board in terms of increasing awareness of Church safeguarding practices. I also welcome the willingness of the various Church bodies thus far reviewed to engage with this review process and publish the results. However, the recent review reports shed further light on poor historic practices within the Catholic Church, and while efforts have been made to address poor practice, this is in some cases a very recent development.</p><p>  My colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence Alan Shatter TD also recently discussed the publication of the National Board&#8217;s reports with the Garda Commissioner and was informed that the Garda Sexual Crime Management Unit is examining those reports in the context of establishing what further action may be necessary on the part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to them.  Given that much of the reported abuse highlighted in the reviews published into three Religious Congregations took place in schools, the findings will be of particular interest to my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills, Ruairi Quinn TD.</p><p>  The work of the National Safeguarding Board, together with a national audit which is being conducted by the HSE, is designed to provide a comprehensive national picture of how child protection is being promulgated and practiced by the Church dioceses and Congregations. I recently received the report of the HSE Audit of Catholic Church dioceses, and it is intended that this will be published shortly. The HSE is also conducting a review of safeguarding practices across Religious Congregations.</p><p>  The Government has committed to, and is putting in place as a priority, a range of legislative provisions which, when taken together, will help to better safeguard children. These include:</p><p>  (i) the planned introduction of legislation to place the <i>Children First</i>   guidance on a statutory footing;</p><p>  (ii) the introduction of the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Adults) Act, 2012, which was brought into force on 1 August last by my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, Alan Shatter TD, and which introduced a very important measure designed to deal with the problem of people failing to report abuse;</p><p>  (iii) the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill, 2012, which is currently progressing through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p><p>  In parallel, an extensive reform programme relating to children&#8217;s services is ongoing within the HSE and in consultation with my Department, which will lead to the establishment of a dedicated Child and Family Support Agency. I have also in the last week published the Constitutional amendment on children&#8217;s rights, which I believe will further heighten our awareness of the need to protect children.  Finally, I would encourage all Church authorities, who have not yet been reviewed, to cooperate with the review processes of both the National Board and the HSE. It is only through assessment, publication and analysis that we can fully establish the national picture on the reporting and handling of abuse allegations by these authorities.</p></reply>

These include recommendations on a range of services, including Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, which, in the opinion of the Task Force, should fall within the remit of the new Agency.   The Task Force recommendations are being given detailed consideration in preparing for the establishment of the new Agency, and I will bring proposals to Government in this regard. It is my intention that the Child and Family Support Agency will assume statutory responsibility for services for children and families in early 2013. The necessary legislation is being prepared by my Department as a priority.  I share with the view of the Task Force that in order to achieve genuine improvements for children and families, the Agency must have a broader focus than child protection. Prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic &amp; care interventions are all key to the provision of integrated multi-disciplinary services for children and families based on identified need.</p></reply>

This issue is being addressed in the context of the Reform Programme in the HSE with a single, national, service delivery model in development.</p><p>  Since taking office last year, it has been evident to me that there is a particular need to improve the quality and accuracy of information available from the HSE in relation to child protection services, together with a need to provide more timely and  meaningful information.  The introduction of the National Child Care Information System will help to greatly improve performance in this area.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that good progress is being made by the HSE with regard to the introduction of this system.  </p><p>  The NCCIS will be the central system supporting Social Work services.  As a social work case management system, it will be used to record and store the case history of every child and other clients of the service.  Management information will be derived automatically from the case management system. </p><p>  A first step was to develop agreed and consistent definitions and business processes across all social work offices.  In this regard, a national standardised business process has been implemented in each Integrated Service Area to ensure that data and systems are unified.  This process of standardisation will ensure that definitions used are consistent, for example to ensure the number of recorded  referrals relates to  individual children and not families. </p><p>  The introduction of the NCCIS is a high priority and will help to significantly improve the level, quality and accessibility of information in respect of Children and Family Services.</p></reply>

This was in accordance with the terms of reference for the Group.  The Group did not interview staff and did not make specific findings regarding individual staff members.  Consequently right of reply or opportunity was not afforded to the HSE, or indeed any of the service providers engaged with the deceased, to respond to the report&rsquo;s findings in relation to matters reported on.  The purpose of the review was to establish how these children and young adults died and to focus on the strengths and weaknesses of the State&rsquo;s involvement.  Its purpose was to see how systems can be strengthened, rather than to establish culpability.</p><p>  I will revert to the Deputy when matters have been clarified.</p></reply>

My Department established and is leading a cross-sectoral Project Team, including representatives of my own Department, the Department of Justice and Equality, ComReg and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to advance this matter. Following cross departmental consultation and an examination of the issues involved by the Project Team, ComReg, which has responsibility for the allocation of this number in Ireland, has now allocated the number to the ISPCC. The ISPCC has been successful in securing EU Daphne funding to support the establishment of the line. </p><p>  Officials of my Department are liaising with the ISPCC in relation to the implementation of the 116 hotline.  It is envisaged that a phased implementation of the 116000 line will commence in 2012. In the interim, a holding response is currently heard if an individual rings the 116000 number. The number advises callers wishing to report a missing child to contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and advises children seeking assistance to contact the ISPCC. </p><p>  Once operational, the line will;</p><p>  1) Provide emotional support to children who are missing, their family and others responsible for the missing child</p><p>  2) Offer guidance and advice to the callers regarding a missing child; </p><p>  3) Report risk cases (where identifying information has been received) to the Garda/HSE as per Children First Guidance;</p><p>  4) Support the Garda Investigation, where appropriate;</p><p>  5) Redirect calls outside the scope of the line.</p><p>  It is important to note that the 116000 number is not an emergency number. Emergency calls should always be directed to the 999/112 number in the first instance, where the relevant emergency responses, including the recently launched Garda Missing Children Amber Alert mechanism, may be activated. The establishment of the 116000 line will, however, be of valuable support and assistance to families of missing children and to missing children themselves.</p></reply>

In that regard, I would refer to the fact that the Guidelines on Information and Tracing services first issued by the Adoption Board in 2004 included acknowledgement of historical existence of a practice of illegal birth registrations and offered the Board&rsquo;s assistance in efforts to obtain any records that might still exist.</p><p>  I am aware from the Adoption Authority that, in mid 2010, the Adoption Board conducted a review of information it retained of contact received from persons who had been told or believed themselves to be adopted, but where no adoption records existed.  This exercise indicated that 99 people who had identified themselves to the Board as adopted, did not have a corresponding adoption file.  Around 45 of these cases related to people born after 1953 and the balance related to persons born pre-1953.</p><p>  I am advised that, at the specific request of the persons making a complaint, the Adoption Board did report a number of such cases to the Garda, the Registrar General, and the Director of Public Prosecutions by reference to possible offences under the Birth Registration Acts.  It is my understanding that further action did not ensue having regard to available proof and the lapse of time since the events in question.</p><p>  I have also made enquiries concerning the Deputy&rsquo;s question about the number of such records held by the Health Service Executive.  I have been informed that the HSE has not carried out a review similar to that done by the Adoption Board in 2010.  I have asked the HSE to establish any relevant information in its possession and examine the matter. I am happy to further correspond directly with the Deputy on this.</p><p>  Work is underway in relation to the preparation of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill, in consultation with the Adoption Authority, to provide for a structured and regulated way of providing access to adoption information and contact,  including where the adoption was not effected. It is intended that the Bill will provide for the Adoption Authority to have access to and control over records currently held by a wide range of information sources including the HSE, giving  the Authority an oversight role with regard to the maintenance of adoption records.</p><p>  In addition the National Contact Preference Register will be put on a statutory basis.  The proposed Bill will provide for pro-active tracing and reunion services by appropriate bodies with the Adoption Authority having the overarching responsibility for the service.</p></reply>

The Donegal project started mid-year and the Cork project started in the third quarter.  Both projects were internally evaluated by the HSE, which then commissioned an independent external assessment, undertaken by Trinity College Dublin. This external assessment has been completed and examined by the HSE which is now developing a national out of hours service model. It was never intended that the assessment of the pilot projects was to be published. Rather, the purpose of the assessment was internally focussed with a view to informing the development of a proposal for a national model of service delivery outside normal hours.</p><p>What is important is that children in crisis, no matter where they are, have access to 24 hour social work assistance, and this is what the HSE's National Director for Children and Family Services and I are working towards. Clearly whatever model emerges will need to address the challenges of varying demographic demands in both rural and urban settings.

The policy which was finalised in April 2011, commits to promoting and achieving the best outcomes for young people leaving care and in ensuring consistency of support to these young people. The HSE has established an intra-agency National Aftercare Implementation Group to monitor progress in implementing the national policy and to identify gaps in current resources. The work of this group is ongoing and I have asked Gordon Jeyes, National Director for Children and Family Services in the HSE to prepare a  report on aftercare. This report will include inter-alia the key findings of the group, examples of best practice, assessment criteria  and effective aftercare supports.  This will guide the policy on strengthening the legislation for services in this important area, to which I am committed.</p></reply>

An effective scrutiny system is central to the task of bringing EU issues closer to ordinary people.   Under the terms of the EU Scrutiny Act 2002, as soon as practicable after a proposed measure is published by the European Commission, the relevant Minister should submit to the Oireachtas a copy of the text concerned along with an information note outlining the content, purpose and likely implications for Ireland of the proposed measure to the Oireachtas. Under guidelines for Departments, which were updated in January 2012 in consultation with the Oireachtas, this should be done within 20 working days of publication by the Commission.</p><p>  To this end, EU Division of the Department of the Taoiseach alerts Departments of new proposals as they arise. Nearly all information notes are supplied by Departments within deadline. Where it may not be possible, perhaps due to the complexity of an issue, it is the responsibility of the lead Department concerned to notify the Oireachtas in good time of any possible delays. As EU proposals are rarely published during the month of August the summer recess should not impact unduly on the provision by Departments of information notes to the Oireachtas.</p><p>In the 31st   D&aacute;il, the Houses decided to delegate responsibility for scrutiny and detailed consideration of EU documents and related matters to the relevant Oireachtas Committee. This mainstreaming to sectoral Committees allows members with specialist knowledge of the relevant sector to apply their knowledge and expertise to scrutiny of EU legislative proposals relating to that sector. The 2002 Scrutiny Act provides that Ministers shall have regard to any recommendations made in relation to a proposed EU measure.</p><p>  The scheduling for scrutiny of EU documents and information notes provided by Departments is a matter for the Oireachtas Committees themselves.</p></reply>

The SIF will channel commercial investment from the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) towards productive investment in the Irish economy.  The amount of the fund earmarked for potential projects requires an amendment of the investment policy of the NPRF, which is set out in the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000.  Officials of my Department are liaising with the National Treasury Management Agency, which is the Manager of the NPRF, in identifying and drafting the necessary amendments to the legislation.    I am informed by the National Treasury Management Agency, that the NPRF announced in November 2011 a commitment of &euro;250 million to a new Irish infrastructure investment fund which is seeking up to &euro;1 billion from institutional investors in Ireland and overseas and which will invest in infrastructure assets in Ireland, including assets designated for disposal by the Government and commercial State enterprises and also new infrastructure projects. Marketing of this fund commenced in the first quarter of 2012 (in Ireland by Irish Life Investment Managers and abroad by AMP Capital). Normally the period from commencement of marketing of an investment fund targeting illiquid assets to closure of financial commitments by investors in such a fund can extend up to one year.</p><p>  The NPRF has also committed, subject to certain pre-conditions, &euro;450 million to finance the national roll out of domestic water meters.  </p><p>  In July 2012 Minister Howlin announced the &euro;2.25 billion Government Infrastructure Stimulus comprising a number of PPP projects in Education, Health, Transport and Justice.

The 30% rate of mortgage interest relief for those who took out their first qualifying home loan between 2004 and 2008 came into effect with the enactment of the Finance Bill at the end of March. The regulations provide for the granting of the relief due to the borrower by the lender within the tax year.   The mortgage lenders provide mortgage interest relief at source to relevant mortgage holders, which is facilitated by on-going electronic data file transfers between Revenue and each of the 132 individual qualifying lenders. To apply the new 30% rate, specific technology developments were required to Revenue&rsquo;s and to each of the lenders&rsquo; computer systems. Revenue's systems were upgraded to implement the 30% rate last December and Revenue has since been communicating with the various lenders in regard to their IT enhancements, but the speed of upgrading has not been uniform across all lenders. To date, the IT upgrades required to give effect to the 30% rate have been completed by all but one of the lenders and these lenders have either implemented the rate or will do so with effect from next month.  </p><p>  Revenue is currently in direct contact with the remaining lender to ensure that the additional 5% due to borrowers is paid within the current year and applied retrospectively. Revenue has received commitment from the lender that the rate will be implemented within the current tax year.   </p><p>  In January, as an interim relieving measure, Revenue advised lenders to grant tax relief at the rate of 25% to those entitled to the new 30% rate of relief, given that the 25% rate was already a feature of the first time buyer mortgage interest relief regime and was not dependent on new IT upgrades taking place.	</p></reply>

A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits and profits from certain petroleum, mining or land dealing activities. Companies&rsquo; capital gains are effectively chargeable at the capital gains tax rate and the rate was increased:</p><p>- from 20% to 22% for disposals on or after 15 October 2008,</p><p>- to 25% for disposals on or after 8 April 2009 and</p><p>- to 30% for disposals on or after 7 December 2011.</p><p>The 10% corporation tax rate for profits from manufacturing expired at the end of 2010 and the 12.5% rate now applies to such profits.</p><p>There are different ways of measuring the effective rate of corporation tax depending on the variables that are used. As there is no single internationally agreed comparative measure in place, I am not in a position to provide such a measure for the period referred to by the Deputy. However, I mentioned previously that an effective rate of corporation tax of 11.9% was estimated for Ireland in a <i>Paying Taxes</i> study produced by the World Bank and PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2011 as part of an annual <i>Doing Business</i>   report. The study includes a measurement of effective tax rates across 183 countries based on the tax obligations of a standardised company operating in each country and using standard assumptions regarding exemptions, deductions and allowances.</p><p>As regards the amount of corporation tax paid over the past five years, the following table shows the net receipt of corporation tax from 2007 to 2011:</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Calendar Year </div></th><th><div>Net Receipt of Corporation Tax </div></th></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td><div>&#8364;6,393m</div></td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td><div>&#8364;5,072m</div></td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td><div>&#8364;3,890m</div></td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td><div>&#8364;3,944m</div></td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td><div>&#8364;3,500m</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

Open membership insurers can provide insurance to all individuals on request while restricted membership insurers only provide insurance to members of specific organisations.

The age related credit is only available to clients of open membership insurers. </p><p>  The age related credit is part of the current interim scheme of risk equalization in the health insurance market.  The credit is funded by a Stamp Duty, the health insurance levy.  The scheme is intended to be Exchequer neutral.  The age related credit is due to be phased out at the end of 2012, to be replaced by credits under a permanent risk equalization scheme, which will also be funded by the health insurance levy.</p><p>Revenue does not require a breakdown of costs by band for its administration of the scheme and therefore is not in a position to provide figures broken down according to the various policy bands  .</p></reply>

The Bank received a response from Mr Fingleton dated 10 September 2011. Subsequent to this the Bank issued a further letter to Mr Fingleton dated 27 September 2011. The Bank has not yet received a response to this letter.    Subsequent to writing to Mr Fingleton, the Bank sought and obtained Senior Counsel's advice in connection not only with these matters but with the management of the former INBS by Mr Fingleton and a number of former directors and officers of the former INBS.  Having done so, the Bank sought and obtained Ministerial consent to the issue of protective proceedings against Mr Fingleton and certain former officers and issued those proceedings on 29 March 2012.  As the proceedings have been issued and the Bank continues to actively investigate all legacy matters, including those related to the proceedings, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the status of the proceedings at this time.</p></reply>

The NTMA does not maintain an internal press office.  Instead, its internal communications resources are supported by an external service provider (appointed following a public procurement process) - currently Gordon MRM - in order to offer a full press office and communications service (including out-of-hours contacts for the media) across all the NTMA&rsquo;s business areas: Debt Management, NAMA, NPRF, NDFA, SCA, NewERA and during 2010 and 2011 the Banking Unit. </p><p>  These arrangements were put in place during 2010 in light of a significant increase in the volume of domestic and international media queries being received by the NTMA and associated bodies. </p><p>  That contract is now coming to an end and the NTMA is retendering the contract in accordance with public procurement procedures. </p><p>  In view of the tender process, I do not propose to publish details of the costs of the outsourced press office function at the current time.

Extensive guidance in this regard is available from the office of the Data Protection Commissioner or on their website <i>www.dataprotection.ie</i>.</p><p>  Under the Education Act 1998, the Board of Management has responsibility for the day-to-day management of the school.  There is no requirement for school authorities to report incidents or allegations of bullying to my Department. Responsibility for tackling bullying falls to the level of the individual school, as it is at local level that an effective anti-bullying climate must be established and at that level that actions should be taken to address bullying. </p><p>  Under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, all schools are required to have in place a Code of Behaviour and this code must be drawn up in accordance with the guidelines of the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB). The NEWB guidelines were issued to schools in 2008 and make it clear that each school must have policies to prevent or address bullying and harassment and schools must make clear in their code of behaviour that bullying is unacceptable. The guidelines further state that as well as making explicit that bullying is prohibited in the school, and having an anti-bullying policy, the code of behaviour should indicate what action the school will take in relation to alleged breaches of the school's bullying policy. </p><p>  Every school therefore must have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of the school's overall school code of behaviour. Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.</p></reply>

A project to measure the burden imposed by regulation under the responsibility of seven Departments and Revenue was initiated in September 2011. The project is being carried out in two phases or clusters.  Cluster A consists of Revenue and the Departments of Social Protection, and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Cluster B consists of the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport; Health; Environment, Community and Local Government; Agriculture, Food &amp; Marine, and Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  Each participating Department has responsibility for measuring the relevant administrative burdens arising from the legislation under its responsibility. It must then plan how it will achieve the remaining reductions to reach the target and report to Government with its Simplification Plan. My Department engaged consultants to provide training for Departments in the Standard Cost Model, an internationally recognized method of measuring administrative burdens on business. In addition, my Department provides operational support to Departments as they carry out the measurement exercise.</p><p>  The Revenue&rsquo;s report on its administrative burden reductions, which have reached the 25% target, has been published on its website.  The Department of Social Protection intend to publish its report shortly.  The remaining participating Departments are expected to report by end 2012.</p><p>  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has already achieved a 24.5% reduction in the areas of Company Law, Employment Law and Health and Safety Law.  This has been achieved, in particular, due to the modernisation work of the Companies Registration Office and the Health and Safety Authority.</p><p>  The Central Statistics Office has achieved a 30% reduction in measured burdens, significantly beyond the target.</p></reply>

As a direct result of the work of the action team for Ireland, &#8364;25 million of funding was re-allocated to the integrated Youthreach programme which provides education, training and work experience to young people who have left school early without any qualification or vocational training. This will ensure that 3,700 training places for early school leavers are maintained until end 2013. Another initiative arising directly from the Commissions' proposals, has been the inclusion of youth unemployment as one of the four thematic themes eligible for funding under the &#8364;20m Labour Market Education &amp; Training Fund (LMETF).</p><p>  More generally, the Government&#8217;s primary strategy to tackle youth (and overall) unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery.</p><p>  In addition to promoting economic recovery, the Government recognises the need for interim measures to support the young unemployed and keep young jobseekers close to the labour market. The main initiative in this regard is Pathways to Work which is the main policy focus for getting the long-term unemployed (including those aged under 25) back into employment by providing job search assistance, work experience and training.</p><p>  In terms of <b>job search assistance</b>, some 17,000 young people registered with Employment Services this year up until September 2012, representing 37% of all registrants.  Registering with Employment Services gives job-seekers access to guidance interviews, job search assistance, and training courses, as well as self-service job-seeking options.</p><p>  In terms of <b>work experience,</b> JobBridge (the National Internship Scheme), has seen 2,600 placements  of young people aged under 25 during its first year of operation.</p><p>  In addition, over 18,000 persons aged 25 and under completed a <b>training</b> course with F&Aacute;S in 2011 (excluding evening courses). Training allowances on eligible courses exceed what a young person would receive in jobseekers&#8217; payments, providing an incentive to take up training programmes.</p><p>  The European Commission is currently reviewing &quot;youth guarantee&quot; policies across the Member States with a view to making proposals for a European-wide approach. There is considerable variation among Member States with regards to the possible implementation of any such guarantee, in terms of the target groups covered and the extent and nature of the policy commitments made. My Department is also reviewing arrangements here in the light of these various approaches. The Commission&#8217;s proposals are expected to be published in December, and achieving political agreement on these proposals in the Council will be a major objective of Ireland&#8217;s Presidency in the first half of 2013.</p></reply>

The scheme which was introduced in and took effect from 1994 allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.</p><p>  The scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a pension.  The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.</p><p>  There are a number of significant challenges currently facing the Irish pension system.  At present, there are six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately two to one by 2050.  In addition, those aged over 65 will account for a greater proportion of the population while the proportion who are of working age is expected to decline.  Therefore, the task of financing increasing pensions will fall to a diminishing share of the population. With increases in life expectancy, more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement and the period for which a pension will be paid will be greater than the period for which a pension is paid at present.  This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision and for the sustainability of pension provision into the future. In addition to this, spending on social protection accounts for nearly 40% of current Government expenditure and in the context of the current fiscal crisis savings have to be found in the social welfare system.</p><p>  For this reason there are no plans to extend the homemakers scheme as outlined by the Deputy.</p><p>  People who do not qualify for the homemakers scheme as they had caring duties prior to the introduction of the scheme in 1994 may qualify for a reduced rate of SPC as a yearly average of only 10 along with 10 years' paid contributions over a working career is sufficient to qualify for a minimum SPC.  Alternatively, they may qualify, depending on their means, for a higher rate of State pension (non-contributory).</p></reply>

The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community. The CE programme is one of a range of training and employment programmes available for unemployed persons. All of these programmes have specific objectives and eligibility criteria that address the specific needs of a wide range of participants.</p><p>  The criteria for participating on the Community Employment (CE) programme are based on age and length of time in receipt of various social welfare payments. The core eligibility criterion for CE is that the person is in receipt of a qualifying Social Welfare payment, as defined on the Department&#8217;s public website. This requirement is based on Government policy and Departmental guidelines and has been the rule since CE commenced in 1994.</p><p>There are 2 options on Community Employment, a one-year version of CE and a three-year version of CE. Eligibility to participate on either option is determined by the length of time in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment, i.e. 1 year in receipt to qualify for 1 year on CE and 3 years in receipt to qualify for the 3-year option (based on annually renewable contracts). There is no <i>entitlement</i>   to 3 years under this latter option, only the flexibility to avail of up to 3 years on CE based on the participants progression levels and assessed personal needs at the end of each year.  All CE participants are subject to participation caps: 3 years total participation for those below 55 years of age and 6 years total participation for those of 55 to 65 years of age (inclusive of any time spent on CE before reaching 55) &#8211; only counting CE participation since 3<sup>rd</sup>   April 2000. Persons qualifying for CE via a disability-related payment can qualify for 1 further year on top of these caps if they are on the 3-year version.</p><p>  The Citizen Information Centres (CIC) provide a vital service to the public, providing free, impartial information to the public. It is understandable that the CICs would want to retain staff they have spent time training, but staff employed under Community Employment are subject to the terms and conditions of the programme, including the requirement that they leave when their allotted time has expired.  If a person was eligible for one year but was retained for three, that would deny two more eligible persons the opportunity of a year&#8217;s placement on CE. To reiterate, the aim of CE is to progress unemployed and other disadvantages persons off the scheme into employment and/or further education and training.</p></reply>

The number of contribution weeks in any year is relevant for determining the individual&#8217;s future entitlement to social insurance benefits and in particular entitlement to short-term benefits.  Any proposal to alter the basis for establishing future entitlement to social insurance benefits from contribution weeks to overall annual income would represent a fundamental change to the existing social insurance system and would have significant cost implications which could only be considered in a budgetary context.</p><p>  With reference to the impact of seasonal working on a person&#8217;s entitlement to Jobseekers Benefit it should be noted that Jobseekers Benefit is a short-term insurance-based payment which is designed to provide income support to insured workers during periods of involuntary unemployment.  In order to qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit, a claimant must be unemployed for at least 3 days in 6, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have suffered a substantial loss of employment.  Jobseekers Benefit is not subject to a means-test and, therefore, income earned during an employment spell would not disqualify a seasonal worker from claiming Jobseekers Benefit during a subsequent period of unemployment, even if both the employment and unemployment episodes were to occur in the same year.  Hence, Jobseeker&#8217;s Benefit is available to seasonal workers who suffer a substantial loss of employment, subject to satisfaction of the scheme criteria.  So in the specific example cited by Deputy McHugh, the school caretaker who had worked eight months in the year would be entitled to claim Jobseekers Benefit provided <i>inter alia </i> that s/he is available for and genuinely seeking work and that s/he made sufficient PRSI contributions.</p><p>  In relation to the scale of seasonal working, CSO data suggest that employment in the accommodation and food sector rises by between 5,000 and 6,000 between the first and third quarters of each year as a result of seasonal factors<b>.</b></p></reply>

Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory).  Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 4.25%).</p><p>  Any changes to the PRSI system to extend the full range of social insurance benefits to self-employed persons would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of a much more significant rise in the rate of contribution payable.</p><p>  The third Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, as at 31 December 2010, was completed by consultants KPMG in June 2012 and laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 24 August 2012.</p><p>  The Review covers a 55 year period from 2011&ndash;2066 and builds on the findings of the 2000 and 2005 Actuarial Reviews of the Fund.</p><p>  The scope of the 2010 Review was to update the results of the 2005 Review, taking account of the policy, economic and demographic changes with particular reference to income and expenditure projections as well as break-even contribution rates.  The Review also considered the effects of the various policy options, existing Government commitments and planned reforms.  One of the issues examined in the 2010 Review was the long-term cost implications to the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and the break-even contributions rates required to provide invalidity pensions to the self-employed and to provide jobseekers benefit for self-employed workers.</p><p>  KPMG modelled the costs associated with the introduction of these benefits by increasing the incidence by 12% in their models reflecting the increase in potential beneficiaries.  This uplift is based on the distribution of PRSI contributors at 31 December 2010.  The implicit assumption in this calculation is that the proportion of self-employed accessing these benefits is the same as the existing population with entitlement to access these benefits.  For illustrative purposes KPMG costed the extension of these benefits by assuming the extended scheme reaches full &ldquo;maturity&rdquo; in terms of the numbers of additional beneficiaries with immediate effect.  You will be aware that contributors must satisfy the requirement to have a minimum number of paid contributions before they can qualify for these benefits.</p><p>  In the absence of statistics pertaining specifically to the self-employed, KPMG assumed the incidence rates to be the same as for the overall labour force.  This may or may not be  appropriate depending on whether or not the self-employed may be expected to behave atypically.  KPMG therefore, indicated sensitivities to the incidence rates chosen setting out the range of costs involved where the self-employed numbers accessing jobseekers benefit and invalidity pension are 20% higher or 20% lower than the base-case scenario.</p><p>  Assuming the incidence rates are the same as for the overall population, KPMG found that the cost of extending jobseekers benefit to the self-employed in 2013 would be &euro;87m.  If the incidence rate is 20% lower than the norm the estimated cost would be &euro;73m in 2013 and if the incidence rate is 20% higher than the norm the cost in 2013 would be &euro;105m.  In the case of invalidity pension KPMG&rsquo;s analysis predicted a 2013 cost of &euro;78m where the incidence rate is the same as for the overall population.  Where the incidence rate is 20% lower the cost is estimated at &euro;65m and where the incidence rate is 20% higher than the norm the cost would be &euro;94m.</p><p>  The accumulated cost over the full period up to 2066 of extending jobseekers benefit and invalidity pension to the self-employed is &euro;2,320m and &euro;4,074m respectively, expressed in current terms.</p><p>  The 2010 Review also looked at the break-even contribution rates required to provide invalidity pensions and jobseekers benefit for self-employed workers.  The report found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), which is the benefit currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  An incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if jobseekers benefit in addition to core State pension (contributory) is provided.  The average contribution rate required for the core State pension (contributory) plus the invalidity pension is estimated to be in the region of 17%.</p><p>  The scope of the review did not extend to costing the provision of illness benefit for self-employed workers or to the provision of these benefits on an opt out or voluntary basis.</p><p>  I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year and one of the issues that the Group is currently considering is the issue of providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.</p><p>  The Advisory Group&rsquo;s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the Terms of Reference.  Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support.  The Group has been considering the issue of social insurance coverage for the self-employed and will submit its report once its examination of the various questions has been completed.

Currently the average time taken to award a carer&rsquo;s allowance application is 28 weeks.  I acknowledge that the time taken to process carer&rsquo;s allowance claims at present is not satisfactory but I am satisfied that the Department is taking appropriate action to resolve the situation.</p><p>  Carer&rsquo;s allowance section has recently completed a major service delivery modernisation project to improve the efficiency with which it processes applications from clients for carer&rsquo;s allowance. The project involved the development of IT functionality and associated business process re-organisation.  Full deployment of the new system for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance was completed in June 2012.</p><p>  Following the completion of the modernisation project, an in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project commenced for the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme.  This project focused on optimising output and customer service and the reduction of backlogs. The outcome of the review is the division of work into two streams. One concentrates on dealing with new claim intake and processes these without delay and the other on the backlog which is ring-fenced with a clear and targeted plan for its elimination.  Implementation of the plan commenced on Monday 3 September and will be closely monitored and managed to ensure it achieves its objectives. However, it will take a number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level. The allocation of available resources to this task continues to be monitored. </p></reply>

These progression rates compare favourably with European averages in this area. However, it is important to note that this does not take into account interns who may have secured employment in the subsequent weeks or months after completing their internship.</p><p>As part of the on-going process of development and review for the JobBridge Scheme, it is intended that monitoring visits will be conducted across a range of operational Internships. To that end we have completed the process of training in excess of 140 regional employment services staff to undertake these monitoring visits as part of their broader range of duties.</p><p>This activity is a priority in relation to assessing the quality of the internships being undertaken; the experience and skills being gained and that the Internship is operating in accordance with the Standard Agreement. Furthermore, this process facilitates an opportunity for both the Intern and Host Organisation to reflect on the internship to-date; provide feedback on the internship and JobBridge in general; raise any concerns and provide a forum for assistance and support to both parties by the JobBridge team. I am delighted to advise that 293 of the 305 monitoring visits conducted to date have been satisfactory in nature. In short, 96% of monitoring visits conducted to-date were of a satisfactory nature.  Remedial action has been taken in cases where the visit was deemed not to be of a satisfactory nature.</p><p>In the context of these and other questions raised by the Deputy, I wish to advise that I have commissioned an independent evaluation of the Scheme.  Indecon International Economic Consultants have been engaged to undertake this work.</p><p>The Department requires this Project to be undertaken to assess the design, delivery and impact of the JobBridge scheme on the unemployed.  It should also assist the Department in making further policy decisions on the benefit of work placement programmes in the overall context of the Government&rsquo;s activation policy which is to engage with every unemployed individual to provide them with a pathway to employment and to prevent and reduce long term unemployment.</p><p>The evaluation should include the following key outcomes:</p><p>- Socio economic profile of the participants on the scheme;</p><p>- Information on the host organisations that have used the scheme including, size, sector and reason for participating;</p><p>- Details of the progression of those on the scheme into education, training or job placement.  In the case of job placement this should detail if placement is with the same company, in the same sector and the sustainability of that placement;</p><p>- Details of the nature of the work experience of the participants and a measurement of the relevance of that experience to the labour market and to progression into employment;</p><p>- An assessment of the displacement effect of the scheme;</p><p>- An assessment of the level of deadweight in the scheme;</p><p>- Information on the satisfaction of participants with their experience of the scheme;</p><p>- Information on the satisfaction of host organisations with their experience of the scheme;</p><p>- An assessment of the process and procedures used by the Department in running the scheme;</p><p>- Recommendations on how the scheme might be improved.</p><p>It is anticipated that this report will be available at year end 2012 and full details of this report will be made publicly available.</p></reply>

This programme of work, which is known as the Standard Authentication Framework Environment or SAFE for short, also provided for the introduction of a Public Services Card (PSC) to enable individuals to gain access to public services more efficiently and with a minimum of duplication of effort, while at the same time preserving their privacy to the maximum extent possible.  The PSC is designed to replace current insecure cards such as the Social Services Card and the Free Travel Pass.</p><p>  A PSC is currently issued following a &ldquo;face-to-face&rdquo; registration process which involves the capture of an individual&rsquo;s photograph and signature, the verification of identity and current address as well as the capture of additional data such as answers to security questions to be used in ensuring the future integrity of customers&rsquo; data.  </p><p>  Letters which are issuing from the Department to a number of customers in relation to registration for their PSC ask them to bring proof of identity and evidence of current address with them.   </p><p>  The invite letter lists a number of alternative documents that provide acceptable evidence of address including a utility bill in the person&rsquo;s own name, property lease or tenancy agreement or receipt for payment of the Household Charge.  Only one piece of evidence of address per customer is required.  The Department has recently clarified that receipt for payment of the Household Charge is not a pre-condition to secure a Social Welfare payment.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the NBS contract, 3 is obliged to provide contractually-agreed services to any fixed residence or fixed business wishing to avail of broadband services.  </p><p>The current minimum speeds available to NBS customers will be increased next month free of charge to 2.3mbps download and 1.4mbps upload.</p><p>As a result of these areas being part of the NBS, residents were not eligible for inclusion in the current Rural Broadband Scheme. </p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s recently-published National Broadband Plan aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses well in advance of the EU's target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  </p><p>  The Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country &ndash; specifically:</p><p>  70Mbps &ndash; 100Mbps will be available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015;</p><p>  At least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% (and potentially as much as 35%) of the population during the lifetime of the Government; and </p><p>  A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country, also during the lifetime of the Government.</p><p>  During the preparation of the National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.  </p><p>  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30Mbps and 40Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers' existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  Preparatory work has commenced within my Department to expedite this mapping exercise.</p><p>  The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  Until that process is complete, (it is expected to take a number of months) the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention will not be known.  </p><p>  I would reiterate however, that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including areas such as Fontstown and Ballyshannon County Kildare will have at least 30Mbps connectivity. </p></reply>

I set a deadline of the end of September for them to come back to me with credible proposals. In setting this tight deadline I was conscious of the need to make progress as quickly as possible having regard to the difficult situation faced by affected homeowners. I have recently written to the stakeholders reaffirming my position as outlined in earlier discussions with them and impressing on them the need to achieve positive outcomes for homeowners.</p><p>  I believe the recommendation in the pyrite report that it would be unreasonable to expect dwellings not exhibiting damage to be remediated simply because there is pyrite in the hardcore is a sensible approach and this position is supported in the High Court judgement of Mr Justice Charleton in the case of JEC-v-Irish Asphalt, on appeal to the Supreme Court. The pyrite report details the basis for arriving at this decision. I believe the approach suggested by the Pyrite Panel to classify the dwellings concerned into red, amber and green is a practical solution to prioritise the remediation of affected dwellings.</p></reply>

The results of the national radon survey identified certain parts of the country which are prone to high levels of radon. Approximately one third of the country is classified as a High Radon Area. A map showing the High Radon Areas is published on the RPII&#8217;s website. </p><p>The Government&#8217;s approach to radon, which is similar to that of the majority of EU Member States, is to concentrate efforts on increasing public awareness of the ri sks posed by radon in the home. Through support for the RPII&#8217;s radon advice and awareness work, my Department is supporting efforts to raise public awareness of the risks posed by radon, particularly in the home. Householders, particularly those in known high radon areas, have been strongly encouraged to have their homes tested for radon and to undertake re mediation works where necessary .   </p><p>Since 1998 the Building Regulations require all new buildings to incorporate radon protection measures at the time of construction. In October 2004 an updated edition of Technical Guidance Document C on Part C of the Building Regulations (Site Preparation and Resistance to Moisture) was published incorporating enhanced radon prevention measures for new buildings commencing on or after 1 April 2005. This guidance document is aimed at ensuring that radon protection measures are carried out more effectively. Copies of the guidance documents are available on my Department&#8217;s website &#8211; <i> .</i></p><p>If a dwelling is found to have a high radon level, remediation work may be recommended. Technical guidance on radon remediation techniques is available in a booklet issued by my Department, <i>Radon in Buildings - Corrective Options</i> , which is also available on my Department&#8217;s website. The RPII has also issued guidance, <i>Understanding Radon Remediation - A Householders Guide</i> , which is available on the Institute&#8217;s website at <i> ,</i> together with a list of companies who can provide a radon remediation service and offer specific advice and recommendations. In addition, the RPII can be contacted for radon advice on freephone 1800 300 600.   </p><p>An Inter-Agency Group , established in September 2011 under the leadership of my Department , has been tasked to develop a National Integrated Strategy for Radon Control. Further measures to address radon in residential properties will be considered by this Group as part of its overall remit. The Group will submit an Interi m Report to Government by the end of 2012 and a final   Report by the end of 2013. </p></reply>

The Central Bank of Ireland is the competent Authority in this jurisdiction with regard to licensed moneylending and in overseeing and regulating such activity.  </p><p>  Legislative provisions relating to the regulation of moneylending are contained in the Consumer Credit Act 1995 which is the responsibility of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and unlicensed moneylending is an offence under that Act.  My Department&#8217;s responsibility relates to the involvement of the criminal justice system in dealing with allegations of criminal activity.  Persons who engage in money lending and who do not hold the necessary licence granted by the Central Bank are committing an offence under section 98 of the Act, which provides for a prohibition on engaging in the business of money lending without a licence.  </p><p>  Complaints may be made to the Garda&iacute; who have power to bring prosecutions against unlicensed operators.  The powers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling illegal moneylending are principally contained in sections 105 to 109 of the Act, which make provision for a number of matters including Garda powers of entry and arrest. </p><p>  A person who is found guilty of an offence under the Act is liable, on summary conviction, to  a fine not exceeding &#8364;3,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, or on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &#8364;100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both. </p><p>  I am informed that the latest available figures provided by the Courts Service indicate that no prosecutions for such an offence have been recorded over the past five years.</p><p>  There are also a number of provisions in the criminal law which may be of relevance in particular circumstances, for example, section 10 and section 11 of the Non-fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 and section 17 the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 which provide for a range of offences including offences relating to harassment, extortion and demanding money with menaces.  While these criminal law measures are being utilised, it should be noted that these offences have wider implications than money lending and there is no information available as to their use specifically with regard to money lending activities.</p><p>  With regard to these matters I am assured by the Garda authorities that where offences under section 98 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 are disclosed, and are reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the matter will be the subject of investigation under the direction of the local District Officer, with relevant expert assistance available from the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation.</p><p>  As I stated before, I would, therefore, encourage those who may have information concerning the operation of unlicensed money lenders in particular circumstances to make that information available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who will take all measures open to them to enforce the law in this area.  <b><font color="#000080">    </font></b></p></reply>

I am further informed that the area is subject to regular patrols, by uniform and plain clothes units, supplemented as required by local Detective and Traffic Corps personnel from Navan Garda Station.</p><p>  Local Garda management closely monitors such patrols, and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the communities in these areas to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and provide the best possible Garda service to the public. While the situation is being kept under review, Garda management is satisfied that a full and comprehensive policing service is being delivered to the communities in the area concerned and that the current structures in place deliver an effective and efficient policing service.</p><p>  In addition, the Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner has put Operation Fiacla in place in order to address incidents of burglary, aggravated burglaries and related offences throughout the country. Specific burglary operations have been implemented in each Garda region, in support of Operation Fiacla, to target suspected offenders, disrupt their activities and secure their attendance before the courts.</p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also places great emphasis on the importance of the partnership between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the community in preventing and detecting crime, and maintaining a safe environment for everyone. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to invest time and energy in these partnerships and relationships to the benefit of all.</p><p>  Insofar as the number of arrests made in the specific area referred to are concerned, I am informed that this would require a disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources to compile due to the fact that persons arrested in the area referred to will, in general, be brought to Navan Garda Station, the District Headquarters, where full custody facilities exist.</p><p>  I am however informed that Navan Garda Station recorded 686 persons arrested and in their custody in 2010, 660 in 2011 and 486 in 2012 up to 20 September. These figures include arrests made in areas other than Navan sub-district, including those made in Slane and Nobber sub-districts, and brought to Navan Garda Station for custody purposes.</p></reply>

As a consequence, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not practicable to provide details of permanent allocations of Garda vehicles. </p><p>  However, I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are currently 32 Garda cars allocated to the Cavan/Monaghan Division.</p><p>  I am further advised by the Garda authorities that a new contract for the provision of Garda cars has recently been put in place following a tender process organised by the National Procurement Service.

As the Deputy is aware, the conduct of any case before a court is a matter for the presiding judge.  I am, however, informed that the Courts Service has communicated with the judiciary to facilitate an arrangement that defendants who appear before the court are requested in court to produce their driving licence and a copy thereof to the court registrar for the purpose of having the driving licence number recorded.  Registrars have been requested to record whether or not the licence or a copy thereof was produced to the Court.  </p><p>  As I have stated previously these summons cases are appearing in court from this month.

Such a disclosure is made to the individual to whom the data relates. <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>Data Protection disclosures are issued from the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) to individuals for their own personal use.  These disclosures cannot be construed as Garda Vetting, Security Clearance, Character Check or Character Reference and this is clearly stated on each such disclosure issued from that office. </p><p>  The electronic signature of the Superintendent based at the GCVU, who is in charge of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&#8217;s Data Protection Processing Unit, is utilised as the issuing authority on Data Protection disclosures issued from that office.

Accordingly, there is no specific protocol in place for the management of vetting applications pertaining to T&Uacute;S Programme participants.  Any vetting process will take a certain minimum period of time to complete.  Seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can, however, result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.  The current processing time for vetting applications is 8 weeks.  I am acutely aware of the need to keep processing times to a minimum.  An improvement in these processing times is expected in the near future.</p></reply>

Persons who engage in money lending and who do not hold the necessary licence granted by the Central Bank are committing an offence under section 98 of the Act, which provides for a prohibition on engaging in the business of money lending without a licence.  A person who is found guilty of an offence under the Act is liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, or on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &euro;100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.</p><p>  I am informed that the latest available figures provided by the Courts Service indicate that no prosecutions for such an offence have been recorded over the past five years and that information is not readily available as to when the most recent conviction for such activity took place.  There are also a number of provisions in the criminal law which may be of relevance in particular circumstances, for example, section 10 and section 11 of the Non-fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 and section 17 the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 which provide for a range of offences including offences relating to harassment, extortion and demanding money with menaces.  While these criminal law measures are being utilised, it should be noted that these offences have wider implications than money lending and there is no information available as to their use specifically with regard to money lending activities.</p><p>  With regard to these matters I am assured by the Garda authorities that where offences under section 98 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 are disclosed, and are reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the matter will be the subject of investigation under the direction of the local District Officer, with relevant expert assistance available from the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation.  As I stated before, I would, therefore, strongly encourage those who may have information concerning the operation of unlicensed money lenders in particular circumstances to make that information available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who will take all measures open to them to enforce the law in this area.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-09-26a.404.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600080#WRT01500"><p>The pig sector remains the third largest individual component of the agri-food sector, with production, prices and exports all growing significantly during 2011.  Prices have continued to increase during 2012 and are currently at record levels, some 12.53% ahead year on year, or 18c per kilo higher.</p><p>  I am aware of the concerns currently being expressed by the sector, particularly with regard to producer returns and the loose sow housing welfare requirements applicable from 1 January 2013.  On the latter point, European legislation requires the change in sow housing.  To facilitate compliance, an on-farm investment aid scheme (TAMS) &#8211; the Sow Housing Welfare Scheme was introduced under Ireland&#8217;s Rural Development Programme 2007 &#8211; 2013. &#8364;13 million has been made available under this scheme.  Following discussions with producers and the evidence of the initial stages of the scheme, my Department modified and improved some elements of the scheme.  Grant-aid is now available at a rate of 40% to eligible producers with a maximum investment ceiling of &#8364;500,000 for the first sow house, with further amounts of &#8364;300,000 for each of the next three houses.  The closing date for applications has being extended to 31 October 2012 in order to alleviate pressures arising from delays in obtaining planning permission.  This scheme is in addition to earlier Sow Welfare Schemes which delivered over &#8364;6 million to successful applicants.  A number of applications have already been approved and I strongly encourage pig producers who have not yet done so to submit their applications to my Department as soon as possible.</p><p>  While prices, production and export volumes have grown in recent years, high feed costs, most notably cereals and compound feed remain an issue.  Pig producers are especially affected by the increase in cereal prices since June 2009, given that cereals account for 75% of feed.  From a National perspective, the &#8216;<i>Food Harvest 2020 Report</i>  &#8217;, which was published in July 2010, sets out the vision for the future of the food industry including the pig sector.  The Report targets a 50% increase in the value of output by 2020.  This is a target set by the industry for itself.  I am personally chairing a High Level Group to ensure that the steps necessary to facilitate the development of the sector are taken.  My Department and its agencies will, along with industry, play a central role in this regard.  For example Teagasc, through its Moorepark pig research facility and the provision of FETAC courses in pig production and benchmarking pig herd performance, plays a critically important role in improving productive capacity at farm level.</p><p>  In so far as international trade in Irish pigmeat is concerned, I have been extremely active in developing relationships in new and expanding markets in order to build the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long term trading relationships in the future.  Furthermore, we have hosted inspection visits from a number of other countries and negotiations are continuing with a view to opening new markets and expanding the presence of Irish pigmeat in existing markets.  In addition Bord Bia continues, through its marketing and promotional activities, and through the pigmeat quality assurance scheme, to consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat on the domestic market and to expand its presence on EU and third country markets.</p><p>  Pigmeat remains the most consumed meat internationally and indeed in 2011, exports of Irish pigmeat to non-EU markets increased by 25% to 43,000 tonnes. International markets continue to present considerable prospects for Irish pigmeat and I am confident that we are positioning ourselves to benefit from these opportunities.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department and its agencies will continue to work closely with the industry to ensure that it can continue to develop and grow in accordance with the targets in the Food Harvest 2020 Report.</p></reply>

Buoyant European cattle prices in 2011 and 2012 are attributable to a supply deficit throughout the EU and to strong global demand.  In fact, Irish cattle prices have exceeded the EU average level for most of the year to date, with the Irish price for the benchmark grade only dipping below the EU producer price in August when countries such as Germany and Italy experienced supply shortfalls which had the effect of driving up prices substantially in those markets.</p><p>  I am cognisant of the export dependence of the Irish beef industry which means that external market developments largely determine Irish cattle prices.  Ireland is a small, peripheral market producing an average of 570,000 tonnes annually, of which some 90,000 tonnes is destined for domestic consumption.  Over the past decade, the profile of Irish beef exports has changed from a reliance on volatile international markets to a focus on higher value consumer markets in the UK and Continental Europe.  Irish beef is now listed with more than 75 high-end retail chains across Europe.  Securing and retaining such a wide portfolio of customers has contributed significantly to higher returns for Irish beef in recent years.</p><p>  The UK is approximately 80% self sufficient and is, by a significant margin, the main market of Irish beef accounting for around 50% of exports in volume terms.  Irish beef comprises over 70% of total UK beef imports on account of our close proximity to the market and our strong customer profile which includes most of the leading retail, manufacturing and foodservice companies.  In terms of sensory attributes, Irish beef tends to closely resemble the UK's domestic offering because of similarities in our production systems (i.e. grass-fed steer and heifer cattle with moderate carcase weights, fat cover and marbling).  Trade with the UK is impacted by fluctuations in the euro/sterling exchange rate and the extent of Britain's import requirement which is forecast to increase in the short run consequent on a continuing decline in domestic beef production.  With consumption expected to remain stable and a continuing reduction in the size of national cattle herd, British beef imports are predicted to grow from 381,000 tonnes in 2011 to 417,000 tonnes in 2013. </p><p>  A number of factors have been identified to account for the differential between Irish and UK cattle prices.  These include a British consumer preference for indigenous beef product.  In any analysis of comparative prices, it must also be recognised that UK cattle prices are currently among the highest in the EU.  Moreover, a price differential makes Irish beef products competitive in the UK market such that Ireland supplies the bulk of the UK's import demand notwithstanding additional logistical and processing costs incurred in shipping to that market.  When comparing Irish and UK cattle prices, it be noted too that there is a significant exchange rate effect making the UK price appear even higher.  For instance, the current GB R4L grade steer price, averaging Stg &pound;350.9 pence/kg (deadweight), is equivalent to 439 cent/kg (deadweight).  If converted at the rate prevailing a year ago, there would be a reduction in euro terms of almost 40 cents.</p><p>  In the longer term, the industry aims to maximise returns for Irish beef through its Repositioning and Differentiation strategy that focuses on the key attributes of Irish beef: environmentally sustainable, grass-based production systems, full traceability, Quality-Assurance at all stages and superior eating quality.</p></reply>

The Citywise service involves the provision of a programme to children who are not participating in school.  I have been advised by officials of my Department that this provision is not a recognised school within the meaning of the Education Act, 1998.  The Minister for Education and Skills has overall responsibility under the Education Act, 1998 for the funding of recognised schools and education providers within the formal education system. </p><p>  The Citywise education provision has not been funded by my Department.  Furthermore, as a standalone project it does not come within the School Completion Programme funded by my Department which aims to support school attendance and retain children in the recognised school system.  Some 31 recognised schools in Dublin 24 are involved in 6 local School Completion projects which are coordinated by the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB).  The basis of the Citywise proposal is complex and its consideration requires a collaborative approach by a number of my Department's key partners, including the Department of Education and Skills and the NEWB.  </p><p>  In July,  officials of my Department arranged a meeting with Citywise  which was attended by officials of the Department of Education and Skills and Officers of the NEWB including the Chief Executive.  At that meeting, the model of education provision, the target group of children for whom the service would be provided and the resourcing and funding requirements were discussed.  The need for compliance with the statutory obligations to ensure that children are registered with the NEWB as being in receipt of an education in a place other than a recognised school was discussed with Citywise management.  The registration process will initiate an assessment of the education provision in question, which is an important requirement in line with NEWB's responsibility to ensure a child's right to an education.  I am advised that the officers of the NEWB are available to advise Citywise on the application process in this regard.  The NEWB is also examining the educational support services in Dublin 24 under its remit with a view to enhancing integration and collaboration between these established services and Citywise. </p><p>  My officials continue to engage on this matter with the Department of Education and Skills, while drawing upon the expertise of the NEWB, with a view to exploring how the services provided by Citywise to children might be supported through the formal education system.  I will advise the Deputy of the outcome of the case in due course.</p></reply>

The Task Force emphasised the importance of identifying problems and providing supports at an early stage.

The NEWB is a statutory agency under the remit of my Department.  It has responsibility to ensure that every child attends school regularly, or otherwise receives a certain minimum education, to support regular school attendance, tackle problems of absenteeism and to provide an educational welfare service.  The NEWB receives information and referrals from, amongst others, school authorities relating to concerns for the educational welfare of individual children.  The NEWB advises that when a young person is referred to the Board by a school, parent or another agency the initial work of the Education Welfare Officer is to assess the nature, scope and depth of the problem.</p><p>  This action taken then falls into two distinct categories.  The first is a brief intervention whereby low level intervention proportionate to the need of the individual and the family can often effectively resolve the issue, thus preventing attendance problems escalating.  For example, this work includes assistance with finding a school place and advice and support around Section 29 Appeals, suspensions and expulsions.  In 2011, the Board reports that it worked with 12,062 children and families in providing assistance at this level.  Problems of poor school attendance that are the manifestation of more complex and deep rooted difficulties can take significant time, expert help and on-going support from the NEWB to make progress.  Such work can involve developing a plan with the family, young person and school to address the various barriers identified.  These intensive interventions are used when brief interventions have not been successful, or are not appropriate in the circumstances.

Funding of some &#8364;56.806m is available from my Department in 2012 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country through a number of schemes.  These schemes include the Youth Service Grant Scheme, the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund and certain other provisions including the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme, Youth Information Centres, the European Youth in Action Programme (administered by L&eacute;argas &#8211; the Exchange Bureau) and Gaisce &#8211; the President's Award. </p><p>  The main objectives of the Youth Affairs area of my Department are to develop and implement coherent, coordinated and relevant youth policies and strategies to support the youth sector in providing effective non-formal education and developmental opportunities for young people through which they can enhance and develop their personal and social skills and competencies.  These opportunities also equip young people with applicable and transferable skills and competences which can prove highly-valuable for young people and can help them address the various challenges, including socio and economic challenges, faced by them.</p><p>  Under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme grant-aid is made available to organisations and groups for specific projects which seek to address the needs of young people who are disadvantaged due to a combination of factors e.g., social isolation, substance misuse, homelessness, early school leaving and unemployment.  Projects focus on the personal and social development of participants to enable them to realise their potential.  There are currently 181 projects funded under this scheme and funding of &#8364;17.042m has been allocated for 2012.  The  Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund (Rounds 1 and 2)<b><i></i></b>assists in the development of preventative strategies in a targeted manner through the development of youth facilities, including sports and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.  Funding of &#8364;21.332m has been allocated to these schemes in 2012. </p><p>Other support services for young people include the Local Drug Task Force projects and the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme.  Local Drug Task Force projects provide a range of supports for young people by way of targeted drug prevention and awareness programmes as well as referrals.  Funding of &#8364;1.34m has been allocated for this purpose in 2012.  The Local Youth Club Grant Scheme<b><i></i></b>supports youth work activities at a local level.  These grants are made available to all youth clubs and groups through local Vocational Education Committees.  &#8364;1.035m has been made available for youth clubs in 2012. </p><p>  My Department is developing a new youth policy framework which my Department for publication in 2013 to enhance the development, participation and support of young people in youth services.  The policy framework will facilitate and promote co-ordination and coherence across departments and front line youth services.  It will set out the priorities to be achieved for effective and responsive support services for young people in the years ahead.</p></reply>

All relevant Government Departments and Agencies, including my own, have a role.</p><p>  My Department has a key leadership role to play in this area through overseeing the on-going implementation of the national play and recreation polices; and over the past few years, my Department has made significant investments in play and recreational facilities and, as part of this ongoing commitment, I recently launched the Local Authority Play and Recreation Network. This Network brings together relevant staff from the local authority sector who are involved in the provision of play and recreation services to local communities to share best practice information and to encourage mutual cooperation where relevant.</p><p>  The Department of Health has established Special Action Group on Obesity, which includes a range of relevant stakeholders, including an official from my Department.

The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that organisations and professionals who work with children have a statutory responsibility to report reasonable concerns about the abuse or neglect of children in their care to the HSE Child and Family Services.</p><p>  Children First has operated on the basis of voluntary compliance since it was first published by the then Department of Health and Children in 1999. Significant resources have been put in place to support the implementation of Children First and in the case of the HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Children First has formed an integral part of their existing operations and practices. </p><p>  The HSE has provided training, information and advice on the implementation of Children First   throughout the HSE, voluntary and community sector.</p><p>  In addition to the existing structures in place to support Children First, significant additional resources have been provided to the HSE over the past three years to increase the number of social workers in the child welfare and protection area. The recruitment of these additional social workers was included in the Ryan Report Implementation Plan, as was the commitment to place Children First on a statutory basis.  An additional 260 social workers have now been recruited on foot of the Ryan Report.</p><p>  The recruitment of the additional 260 social workers is one element of a wider reform agenda within the HSE, through which I believe we can deliver better outcomes for children and families. This reform agenda will lead to the establishment of a new Child and Family Support Agency in early 2013 which will provide a dedicated focus on child protection and will support families in need. </p></reply>

This programme is a partnership between my Department, the National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI) and the Health Service Executive  </p><p>  The aim of the programme is to provide a broad-based, flexible health promotion / education support and training service to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in out-of-school settings. The programme has sought to develop the capacity of the sector and organisations to advocate on issues that affect young people and develop evidenced based resources and training to support that work.  The advantage of this training is evident in the fact that Youth Work often acts as the first point of contact and referral in the interface with other youth-related services spanning the realms of care, health and welfare.</p><p>  The Family Support Agency under the remit of my Department administers a programme of grants for voluntary organisations that provide marriage and relationships, child and bereavement counselling services. Some 600 organisations are funded each year. In 2012, an amount of &euro;9.413m has been allocated to this programme. These services aim to support people deal with difficulties they are experiencing in their relationships, to help children whose lives have been affected by parental separation and to support families who have experienced the death of a family member. </p><p>  The Health Service Executive also provides counselling services to young people.</p><p>  The HSE National Director, Mr. Gordon Jeyes, is leading a programme of reform in order to ensure that there is:</p><p>- a closer integration across family support, child protection, and child and adult mental heath services;</p><p>- better integration of services and information;</p><p>- a model of managing referrals to ensure rapid response to welfare as well as child protection concerns, known as the differential response model. </p><p>  Looking to the future, the Family Support Agency will, along with the HSE&rsquo;s Children and Family Services, form an integral part of the new Child and Family Support Agency, due to be established in 2013. Plans for the transition to this new entity are well under way. I believe this will provide for greater integration of these complementary services, with their shared aims of supporting parents and families and ensuring the welfare and protection of children are adequately safeguarded.</p></reply>

One of the aims of the study is to provide evidence for the creation of effective and responsive policies and services for children and families.</p><p>Since 2006, Growing Up in Ireland   has been following the development of almost 20,000 children in Ireland across two cohorts: an infant cohort recruited at nine-months; and a child cohort recruited at nine years. The infant cohort children (with their families) have been interviewed at 9 months, 3 years of age and further interviews are planned in 2013 when these children make the critical transition to primary schooling (at 5 years of age). The child cohort children (also with their families) have been interviewed at 9 and 13 years of age. </p><p>  It is generally accepted that many causes of poor psychological outcomes in both adolescence and adulthood can be traced back to early childhood. By capturing data on these children in early childhood and following their development over time, we will have a better understanding how, why and when these children experience and/or overcome psychological difficulties.</p><p>A series of Growing Up in Ireland   reports have already been published, one of which focuses specifically on children&rsquo;s psychological development. This report shows that the majority of nine-year-olds in Ireland are developing well without any significant problems in this area of their lives.  It also found that however, one in five nine-year-olds have been classified as showing significant levels of emotional or behavioural difficulties and that certain characteristics of the child (e.g. the presence of a chronic illness) and other factors (e.g. economic deprivation, maternal depression, neglectful parenting style and conflict in the home) make children more vulnerable than others.  Clearly these data have the potential to inform policy and practice regarding children and their families thus ensuring that policies, services and interventions are targeted, practical and effective.</p></reply>

The Department was set up in June 2011 with a mandate to put in place a unified framework of policy, legislation and provision across Government in respect of children and young people.</p><p>  The Programme for Government commitments include:</p><p>- The holding of a Referendum in relation to the rights of children under the Constitution.</p><p>- The establishment of a Child and Family Support Agency on a statutory basis in order to fundamentally reform the delivery of child protection services and remove responsibility for these from the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p><p>- Implementing the recommendations of the Ryan Report, including putting the Children First: National Guidance on a statutory footing and legislating for the use of &lsquo;soft information&rsquo;.</p><p>- Maintaining the free pre-school year and improving its quality as resources allow.</p><p>- Enacting legislation to consolidate and reform the law on adoption.</p><p>- Investing in a targeted early childhood education programme for disadvantaged children, building on existing targeted pre-school supports for 	families most in need of assistance, such as the &lsquo;young Ballymun&rsquo; project.</p><p>- Ending the practice of sending children to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.</p><p>  In this context, the high-level objectives of my Department for the period to 2014, as set out in the Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy are:</p><p>1. Develop, strengthen and align policies, legislation and resources in order to achieve better outcomes for children and young people and provide support for parents and families.</p><p>2. Monitor and evaluate performance through strong governance and accountability systems in respect of the responsibilities of the Department and its agencies.</p><p> 3. Support the Department and key stakeholders in accessing better evidence and facilitating the active participation of children and young people in decisions that affect 	their individual and collective lives.</p><p>4. Improve systems for supporting families, safeguarding and protecting children, providing alternative care and assisting those young people whose behaviour poses a risk to themselves or others.</p><p> 5. Support children and young people so that they can fully engage in active learning, including through the provision of high-quality early childhood care and education, youth services and addressing issues of school attendance and participation.</p><p>6. Collaborate with stakeholders, including across Government, in monitoring and promoting the physical, emotional and economic well-being of 	children and young people and reducing inequalities.</p><p>7. Be recognised as an organisation where, on an ongoing basis, high performance is achieved and personal development is supported  .</p><p>  In this context the Deputy will wish to be aware that a new Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework is being developed in a holistic way to comprehend the continuum of the lifecourse from infancy, through early and middle childhood, to adolescence through to early adulthood, in keeping with my Department&rsquo;s responsibilities for children and young people.

Generic competencies needed to be developed and agreed and these are then customised as necessary for specific Boards, depending on their requirements. The suitability of applicants is assessed against these criteria and a short-list is compiled from which I may make appointments. Appointments may not necessarily be from one of the applications received through the advertising process, which is also in line with the Government Decisions. </p><p>  While I am not in a position to comment on the appointments made by administrations heretofore, I can say that I am confident that the appointments made by me are contributing in a meaningful way to the important work undertaken by the various State bodies under the aegis of this Department.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-09-26a.528.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600080#WRY01700"><p>In July of last year I announced the establishment of the Special Delivery Unit as a key part of my plans to radically reform the health system in Ireland.  The Unit&rsquo;s purpose is to improve access to the emergency and elective care system.  Since it was established last year, it has been working to unblock access to acute services by improving patient journeys through the system and by streamlining waiting lists, including GP referrals. I am pleased to be able to say that very significant progress has been made to date by the SDU in relation to both emergency departments and waiting lists.</p><p>  A major priority has been to improve access to emergency care and I welcome the fact that for significant numbers of patients, the experience in our EDs has been markedly improved. From January to September, the number of patients waiting on trolleys fell by 22.9% compared to the same period last year - that equates to 14,795 fewer patients. The 30 day moving average (average number of trolleys over 30 days) has fallen by 37.5% in 12 months, from 328 on 19 September 2011 to 205 on 21 September 2012.</p><p>  In regard to scheduled care, the other important priority so far has been to tackle waiting times for in-patient and daycase treatment and there has been significant progress in this area also. Since the SDU was formed in July 2011:</p><p>- overall waiting list numbers have fallen by 7%</p><p>- the number of adults having to wait more than 12 months is down 85%</p><p>- the number of adults having to wait more than 9 months is down by 63%</p><p>- the number of children having to wait more than 20 weeks has fallen by 61%</p><p>In regard to waiting times for routine GI endoscopy services (i.e. scopes), which the SDU began to tackle in May 2012, I am pleased to say that the overall</p><p>waiting lists have fallen from 13,349 people to 8, 904, a drop of 33%. In addition, the numbers waiting more than three months have fallen by 66% from</p><p>5,062 people to 1,711 people. </p><p>  In relation to waiting lists, the next priority for the SDU will be to focus on outpatients. Together with the NPTF, it will take over the collection and analysis of outpatient waiting list data from the HSE from October. This will involve the systematic collection of waiting time data at an individual patient level in a standardised format from all hospitals providing a consultant-led outpatient service.  The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in this standardised format will enable the SDU and NTPF to target resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  Until then, data on outpatient waiting times are not available by specialty. </p><p>  The SDU&rsquo;s focus in relation to unscheduled care is now moving to patient journey time (attendance to admission/discharge) with the aim that 95% of ED attendees are discharged or admitted within 6 hours of registration and nobody waits more than 9 hours. The SDU is also working intensively to develop best practice hospital sites for patient pathways through unscheduled care. </p></reply>

It should be noted that the Disability Act does not create an office which exists independently of the person who holds office and, accordingly, the ODAO is not a corporate body. Since 2007, the ODAO has successfully supported the DAO in providing the appeals service envisaged under the Disability Act. From 2007 staff from the Department of Health were assigned to the ODAO to assist the DAO in the performance of her functions.</p><p>  Following the decision in October 2008 to defer further roll-out of Part 2 of the Disability Act for other cohorts, it became apparent that the ODAO did not have the volume of work originally envisaged and by 2011 there was an insufficient quantum of work to justify a full-time DAO position. </p><p>  The existing Disability Appeals Officer resigned her position with effect from 31/12/2011 and my Department has been in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the filling of this post. </p><p>  As an interim measure, a Principal Officer on my Department&rsquo;s staff has been designated to discharge the duties of the Disability Appeals Officer and is independent in the performance of this function. A longer term arrangement will be put in place as soon as possible. </p><p>  The provisions for parents wishing to make an appeal have not changed and appeals will continue to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Disability Act. As part of its service the ODAO operates a Lo-Call phone line. Because of the reduced volume of work a decision was made to monitor the Lo-Call number for one hour per day as the volume of calls averages five per week. The person monitoring the calls is an official from my Department, who has worked in the ODAO since 2007 and is now assigned to these duties on a part-time basis.</p></reply>

The Food Safety Promotion Board (FSPB) commissioned independent, scientific research into the effects of stimulant 'energy' drinks in 2002. One of the main issues to arise out of the report was the need for labelling of stimulant drinks, especially for groups with special considerations.  The groups identified were women who are pregnant <font color="#2F2F2F">and</font> children under 16 years of age<font color="#2F2F2F">.  </font>The report also recommended that labels should contain warnings that the drink was unsuitable for consumption with alcohol and as a re-hydration agent during sport and exercise.</p><p>  Following this report, my Department wrote to the EU Commission proposing that 'taurine' (an ingredient found in stimulant drinks) be made subject to Community scrutiny. Following a request from the Commission, the Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources in the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) carried out an evaluation on the safety-in-use of taurine and d-glucurononolactone as constituents of the so-called &#8220;energy&#8221; drinks.  In 2009 they adopted a scientific opinion concluding that exposure to these ingredients through regular consumption of energy drinks was not a safety concern.    These constituents occur naturally at much lower levels as natural ingredients in food, and are also normal human metabolites. They are used at much higher levels and in combination with different ingredients in energy drinks. </p><p>  My Department has contacted the EU Commission and they are unaware of any proposal to ban the sale of such products in either Denmark or Turkey.</p><p>  Labelling legislation is harmonised throughout Europe and it is not open to individual Member States to unilaterally change the labelling of drinks products. However, I should point out that many of the recommendations in the FSPB report regarding labelling have been addressed by changes to the  EU Labelling Regulations which now require the mandatory labelling of high caffeine content and suitability warnings for children and pregnant women for foods and beverages exceeding specified caffeine thresholds.</p></reply>

If no action is taken, it is projected to have a deficit of &euro;500 million at the end of the year.  The HSE is facing a serious challenge and has to make very significant savings in the current year.  There is intensive engagement between my Department and the Health Service Executive to address the overrun in health expenditure.  In the short term, in order to address the 2012 position it has been agreed that cash limits will be imposed on agency and overtime and there will be more intensive management of absenteeism.  In addition, travel and subsistence will be limited and there will be more intensive management of stocks in order to better manage cash.  Other measures are also being undertaken in order to achieve a balanced budget.  These include reductions in services, the use of capital to fund revenue on a once-off basis and the transfer of Department funds to the HSE on a once-off basis.  I have instructed the Executive to provide fortnightly reports on the cash situation.  The Regional Directors are being required to more intensively manage the cash so as to achieve a balanced vote.  On a strategic level, my Department has undertaken a number of initiatives to address concerns about financial control in the HSE.  These include engaging an expert from the UK NHS to examine the financial management of the HSE and make recommendations regarding strengthening and improving the management of its finances.  PA Consultancy has been engaged to prepare an action plan for implementation of these recommendations.  A new director general designate has taken up a position in the HSE, with a clear mandate to control expenditure this year and make proposals that deal with the challenge in 2013 and beyond.  My Department is working intensively with the HSE on proposals for submission to the Government to address structural expenditure issues in the context of the 2013 Estimates.</p></reply>

In 2011, there were 399 births registered to mothers under the age of 18 years while in 2010 the figure was 483.  In overall terms, the number of births to teenagers (i.e. those aged less than 20 years) has actually declined from 3,087 in 2001 to 1,720 in 2011. Overall, this represents a 44% decrease in births to teenagers since 2001.</p><p>  The HSE Crisis Pregnancy Programme (formerly the Crisis Pregnancy Agency) is the national programme in charge of developing and implementing a national strategy to address the issue of crisis pregnancy in Ireland.   The Programme has implemented two national strategies to date and is currently implementing its third Strategy 2012-2016 (to be published). Research carried out by the Programme indicates that the birth rate for teenagers has declined mainly due to improvements in sex education and awareness of contraception. The research has found that the vast majority of young people are using contraception the first time they have sex and every time they have sex.As part of its mandate to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies, the HSE Crisis Pregnancy Programme supports a number of teenage health initiatives that work with young people to enhance their knowledge and awareness of sexual health and relationships in both formal and non-formal education settings. For example, the Programme developed <i>www.b4udecide.ie</i>, a website for teenagers and their parents, teachers and youth workers which provides information on relationships and sex, as well as dealing with peer pressure and improving self-esteem. The Programme also oversees the delivery of targeted communication campaigns, customised information and educational programmes, and other initiatives across a range of settings and across the life cycle. </p><p>  In terms of services dealing with the impact of crisis pregnancy, State funded Crisis Pregnancy Counselling services are available at over 50 locations nationwide. They are open to young people experiencing a crisis pregnancy who may attend along with their parents/guardian. A full list of these services is available at <i>www.positiveoptions.ie</i>. All of services are available free of charge. The HSE also funds the Teen Parents Support Programme, available in 11 locations nationwide, which offers practical and emotional supports to teen parents and their families. Support is available from the beginning of the pregnancy right through until the resulting child is 2 years of age. CURA, funded by the HSE Crisis Pregnancy Programme, also provides a post natal support service for new parents of all ages. </p><p>  In relation to social security, I have been advised by officials in the Department of Social Protection that the One Parent Family Payment (OFP) is available to all teenage mothers who qualify for it. Figures indicate that there are currently 202 recipients of the payment who are under the age of 18 years. Officials in the Department of Social Protection estimate that some &#8364;43,995 per week or &#8364;2,287,771 per annum is currently spent on OFP recipients who are aged under 18 years. Parents are also eligible for Child Benefit, and may qualify for Family Income Support, and Rent Supplement, depending on their circumstances.  If the Deputy requires more details on these matters, I would advise him to contact the Department of Social Protection.</p></reply>

F&aacute;ilte Ireland are currently working on the development of a single brand for the Wild Atlantic Way and will partner with local authorities along the coast to identify the precise route.</p><p>I further understand that the route plan will be delivered through four regional steering groups, comprised of F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Local Authorities, the National Roads Authority and other key stakeholders. There will be extensive trade and public consultation as part of this process. Work will then begin on the detailed planning of the various sections of the route. Interpretation and infrastructure plans, like the pilot plan recently launched for Connemara, will be prepared for each section along the Wild Atlantic Way.</p></reply>
