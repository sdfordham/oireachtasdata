    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-26a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013022600053#WRB00400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 112 together.  </p><p>  I assume the Deputies are referring to the Barryroe oil discovery off the coast of Cork and to recent media reports relating to the potential of the Rathlin Basin offshore Northern Ireland.</p><p>  The results from the appraisal well drilled last year on the Barryroe discovery were encouraging and are the first significant flows of oil on test offshore Ireland in thirteen years.  However, more work, including additional appraisal drilling, will be necessary to determine if the discovery, which was originally made by Esso in 1973, can be declared commercial and progress to a petroleum production project.</p><p>  In relation to recent media reports on the potential of the Rathlin Basin, I understand that these reports relate to an initial resource assessment of a prospect that has yet to be drilled.  As this area is outside the jurisdiction of this State I have no function in the matter.</p><p>  While there has been a modest but welcome upturn in the level of interest in exploration off our coast in recent years, the reality is that the only commercial discoveries of hydrocarbons made in the Irish offshore to date are the three producing gas fields in the Kinsale area, along with the Corrib gas field, which was discovered in 1996.  There have been no commercial discoveries of oil.</p><p>  Despite the low level of commercial discoveries to date, working petroleum systems are known to exist in many of Ireland&rsquo;s offshore basins, as demonstrated by a number of non-commercial discoveries as well as other oil and gas indicators such as hydrocarbon shows in wells.  Nevertheless, the oil and gas potential of the Irish offshore is largely unproven and is likely to remain so until there is a significant and sustained increase in the number of exploration wells being drilled from the current levels of 1 to 2 wells per year.</p><p>  To this end my Department encourages exploration investment through an active and targeted promotion campaign, regular licensing rounds and by supporting petroleum research projects that deepen knowledge of the petroleum potential of the Irish offshore.  Maintaining an appropriate fiscal regime is also critical to attracting this much needed exploration investment to Ireland.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s tax terms for oil and gas production are deliberately aimed at attracting new investment and are set at a level comparable to countries such as France, Portugal and Spain, who, like Ireland, have limited petroleum production and with whom we compete for exploration investment.</p><p>  The Deputies will be aware that I welcomed the publication by the former Joint Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture of its report on Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration.  The report will contribute to the debate on how best to maximise the benefits to Ireland from the exploration and production of our indigenous oil and gas resources.  I have already had the opportunity to discuss the report in the Seanad and I look forward to discussing the report in the D&aacute;il in the not too distant future,</p></reply>

There is no price control and it is Government policy to encourage price competition and consumer choice.</p><p>  The upward trend in petrol and diesel prices arises primarily from increases in international commodity prices over which Ireland has no control.  For example, the benchmark spot price of a barrel of Brent Crude Oil has risen from an average of US$58 in February 2007 to an average of US$117 in February 2013.  This has inevitably resulted in an increase in retail petrol and diesel prices.</p><p>  Previous surveys have shown that prices charged by Irish retailers for oil products relate to the refinery price rather than to the price of crude oil.  Prices at the pump reflect volatile market prices, transportation costs, trends in euro/dollar exchange rates and other operating costs, together with the impact of taxation on oil products.</p><p>  The EU Market Observatory publishes an Oil Bulletin with current and historical oil product prices for all EU countries.  As of February 11th 2013, the price of petrol in Ireland was marginally below the EU average; while the price of diesel was 4.8% higher than the EU average.</p><p>  If duties and taxes are stripped out then the price of petrol in Ireland was 98.5% of the EU average; and the price of diesel was less than 1% higher than the EU average.</p><p>  Against the background of high world oil prices my focus is on measures that will increase the penetration of renewable energy resources in the area of transport.</p><p>  The Biofuel Obligation Scheme incentivises and enables the sustainable growth of an Irish biofuels market.  The Scheme currently requires that the amount of biofuel brought to the market is not less than 6.38% of petroleum road transport fuels.  In 2011 some 145 million litres of biofuel were brought to the Irish market.</p><p>  The development of electric vehicles offers potential for Ireland to use cheaper grid sourced electricity, an increasing amount of which is sourced from renewable resources.</p><p>  These opportunities will progressively reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels for transport, while supporting energy competitiveness and security.</p></reply>

Issues such as identifying the most appropriate collection method, exemptions and enforcement mechanics require detailed consideration and all have a bearing on the timeframe for implementation.</p><p>  As I have previously indicated to the House, my Department is currently carrying out a Value for Money Policy Review conducted by an independently chaired group on the proposed policy.  I expect to receive a copy of the group&rsquo;s recommendations and report for my consideration by the end of March.</p><p>  It should be noted that although subject to a degree of evasion, the existing TV licence fee system has provided a stable funding base for our public service broadcasters.  The rationale for providing State funding for public service broadcasting is to provide an independent and reliable income flow that allows these corporations to attain their public service objects while ensuring they can maintain editorial independence.  This is especially important in the context of news and current affairs.</p><p>  The overall aim of Public Service Broadcasting is to provide services and content which cater for all interests in society, while ensuring that the varied elements of Irish culture and its intrinsic values are protected.</p><p>  Through the statutory obligations placed on the Public Service Broadcasters and the criteria set for the funding of content through the Sound &amp; Vision Scheme, which is funded from licence fee revenue, the production of quality indigenous programming and the production of minority interest programming is strongly promoted via the current funding regime.</p><p>  Whatever the system of funding, the rationale for providing funding will continue to apply and any changes that may be implemented must continue to provide a secure funding base for public service broadcasting and content.</p><p>  It is also important that any changes to the system of funding should take account of the reality of new mechanisms to access such content and services and the pervasiveness of such content in today&rsquo;s society. </p><p>  Publicly-funded public service broadcasting and content are now available to everyone on an ever-increasing range of platforms and devices and, in fact, access is not dependent on the ownership of a device.  In short, everyone benefits from the availability of these services, regardless of how content is accessed or relayed to the public, and, therefore, it is my view that the cost should be borne by society as a whole.  This underlines the rationale for a household based broadcasting charge.  I will advance proposals in this regard after receipt of the Value for Money Report, which I referred to earlier.</p></reply>

Therefore operational matters are a matter for the Board and management of An Post.  These are areas in which I have no statutory function.</p><p>  As shareholder, however, I do have a strong concern in relation to the ongoing commercial position of the Company and I regularly liaise with the Company in this regard.</p><p>  It is my strong objective that An Post remains a strong and viable State company, providing high quality services on a nationwide basis through a network of economically viable post offices.  I know that this objective is shared on all sides of the House.  I must, however, stress that the Company must be in a sustainable and viable financial position to ensure this.  I would also remind Deputies that An Post is a Commercial State Company and their strategy and decision-making must be formulated in this context.</p><p>  I firmly believe An Post has many strengths.  It is a trusted brand and it also has the largest retail presence in the country.  I have impressed on the Company the need to further exploit its unique position in this regard and have been supportive of its attempts to diversify its income streams and to win a wider range of commercial contracts offering higher margins.</p><p>  I welcome the progress An Post has made towards diversification including the announcement that following the decision of AIB to close a number of branches, an extended range of AIB services is available through Post Offices in the locality of the closures.  This is beneficial not only to An Post as a commercial body but also to the local communities.</p><p>  I, and my Department, will maintain ongoing contact with the Board and Management of the Company to work with them on our shared objectives in light of the challenging environment which they face. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-26a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013022600053#WRB01200"><p>The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>  Specifically, it commits to:</p><p>- 70Mbps to 100Mbps available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015,</p><p>- At least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% and potentially as much as 35% of the population, and </p><p>- A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country.</p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The commercial sector is already committed to approximately &euro;1bn investment, which will deliver broadband speeds of 30Mbps to 150Mbps per second to homes and businesses.</p><p>  For example:</p><p>- Eircom is currently investing up to &euro;500m in a phased deployment of fibre to the cabinet infrastructure, which is planned to make high-speed broadband available to 1.2m premises.  The network has already reached more than 200,000 premises and is expected to be launched in 2013.</p><p>- UPC is investing &euro;500m in its cable and fibre network, which is delivering speeds of up to 150Mbps.  UPC aims to have this service available to 700,000 homes by 2015.</p><p>- Mobile telecommunications operators will be rolling out advanced mobile broadband products in 2013, following the recent multi-band spectrum auction.  Arising from the huge increase in the use of smart phones and tablet devices, advanced mobile broadband is of increasing significance.  It is expected that fibre connections will be required to service many of the base stations that transmit mobile signals.</p><p>  A key element of the Plan is the Government&rsquo;s commitment to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.</p><p>  The Plan also sets out a wide range of actions aimed at supporting and accelerating commercial sector investment in next generation broadband.  It includes measures aimed at stimulating increased rates of digital adoption among citizens and businesses, the removal of barriers to make the various planning and consent approval systems more efficient and cost effective, a review of spectrum policy and legislation, as well as the potential contribution that State entities can make in infrastructure deployment.</p><p>  A High Level Group has been established to oversee implementation of the Plan.  Any legislative requirements that emerge as part of the implementation of the Plan, including the specific commitment to revise and update the spectrum legislation in the 1926 Wireless Telegraphy Act, will be progressed accordingly.</p><p>  Earlier this month, my Department launched a tender for experts to assist in the design, planning and procurement of the State-led investment.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.</p><p>  The combination of these actions are designed to ensure the Government commitment that all parts of Ireland will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.</p></reply>

Research by Boston Consulting Group cited in the recent UPC report on Ireland&rsquo;s Digital Future, estimates it will grow from a current rate of about 3% of GDP to 6% by 2016.</p><p>  Research currently underway in the context of the forthcoming National Digital Strategy will look further at this value and ways it might be enhanced.  That research will be concluded shortly and I propose to publish it in parallel with the National Digital Strategy.</p><p>  As Deputies are aware there is substantial employment in Ireland in the ICT and digital sectors arising from the presence of world leading companies in these areas based in Ireland.  In addition, smaller indigenous companies are also making an important contribution.  For example, the Digital Hub currently caters for 66 digital enterprises, which between them, employ some 800 people.  More than three-quarters (78%) of these companies expanded their business operations last year, with 44% hiring additional staff.</p><p>  Two-thirds are planning to expand their workforce this year.  In addition the National Digital Research Centre (NDRC) has helped to create 155 full-time jobs and 66 part-time jobs by the end of 2012 as a direct result of the projects it has supported.</p><p>  Following on from last year&rsquo;s National Broadband I will shortly publish Phase 1 of a new National Digital Strategy.  This strategy will focus on how we can maximise the benefits of the digital technology that is available to us and will also target approaches to stimulating demand for broadband services and connectivity.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs published last week contains details of a specific initiative aimed at incentivising Irish micro-enterprises to begin trading online.</p><p>  The National Digital Strategy will set out in detail the rationale and overall objectives of this important intervention, which will operate initially on a pilot basis in 2013.</p><p>  According to CSO statistics, less than 1 in 4 SMEs in Ireland is trading online. It is not simply that firms should embrace digital to create new jobs; it needs to be done in order to preserve existing ones.  This is what is happening on a global scale and Irish enterprise must keep pace if it is to survive.</p><p>  Enhancement of digital skills in our education system and more generally is also of vital importance.  In this context my Department is also working in partnership with the Department of Education and Skills to roll out high speed broadband connectivity to all second level schools.  I believe that this scheme will assist in equipping schools and students with the digital skills, which are so important in a modern society and labour force.</p><p>  The commercial sector also has a strong role to play in stimulating demand for Internet services.</p><p>  The huge increase in the use of smart phones and tablet devices, increased availability of applications such as video-on-demand, and initiatives by Internet services providers to make technology more accessible to targeted segments of society, will continue to impact on the level of take up.</p><p>  As part of the National Digital Strategy, my Department will work closely with the commercial sector to build on these initiatives, with a view to ensuring that citizens, business and communities realise more fully the potential of a digitally enabled society.</p><p>  The evidence shows that digital engagement continues to grow steadily &ndash; as evidenced by Ireland&rsquo;s performance in the Digital Agenda for Europe Scoreboard. The most recent EU Scoreboard for Ireland published in 2012 shows 71% of the population are regular internet users &ndash; this is up considerably on the 63% score for the previous year &ndash; and above the EU average of 68%.  The proportion of people who have never used the internet has also noticeably decreased to 21% (from 27% the previous year).</p><p>  Deputies will be aware that Ireland has performed extremely well in terms of EU benchmarking of eGovernment services.  Through the eGovernment strategy published last year my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will be building on achievements to date to further improve citizens&rsquo; and businesses&rsquo; access to, and experience of eGovernment services.  Attractive online services will also serve as a further driver of internet engagement.</p><p>  Deputies will also be aware of my recent appointment of David Puttnam, the distinguished Film Director as Ireland&rsquo;s Digital Champion.  He is strongly committed to the promotion of the digital society.  I am confident that in this role he can contribute significantly to raising awareness levels of the many benefits of digital, particularly in the critical sphere of education and learning.</p><p>  Overall the Deputies can be assured of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to proactive promotion of the Digital Economy.  Much progress has already been made in this regard.  The forthcoming publication of the National Digital Strategy will underpin the Government&rsquo;s commitment and signal specific areas for further development.</p></reply>

Ireland has a rich ocean resource and has significant potential in this area. In order to take forward the ocean energy strategy, an Ocean Energy Development Unit (OEDU) was established in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) in 2009.</p><p>  The OEDU has been taking forward the development of the sector through administration of a Prototype Development Fund of grants for industry. SEAI has also been progressing the development of a full scale grid connected wave test site near Belmullet off County Mayo, which would complement existing wave testing facilities i.e. the wave tank in Cork and the quarter scale wave testing site in Galway Bay.</p><p>  The cumulative amount of expenditure on Ocean Energy in the period 2009 &ndash; 2013, including the estimated 2013 allocation, is &euro;20.659m.</p><p>  Ireland also has an opportunity to become a leader in ocean energy industries and technologies. Accordingly, other supports for the sector include the development of the Beaufort Laboratory as part of the IMERC facility in Cork.  This will see a re-housing of the wave tank facility and will bring together researchers in the area currently based in the Hydraulics and Maritime Research Centre (HMRC) and the Coastal and Marine Research Centre (CMRC).  The whole process is part of a broader campus approach with the Naval College, UCC and Cork Institute of Technology, aimed at maximising on marine industrial opportunities.</p><p>  Research in the ocean energy area is ongoing in most universities across the country and ocean energy was recently identified as of 1 of 14 priority research areas by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in their Research Prioritisation Exercise.</p><p>  The primary rationale for the Ocean Energy Programme, of which the Atlantic Marine Energy Test Site (AMETS) in Belmullet is but one component, is to develop and maximise the employment and wealth-generating industry activities that could potentially be associated with ocean energy as it evolves into a fully commercially viable sector. Various studies carried out to date have illustrated that there is considerable potential to create a range of long term jobs and viable indigenous industry.</p><p>  Work is continuing in the development of the AMETS facilities off Belmullet and SEAI has been responsible for the co-ordination of the work programme.  SEAI has applied to the Department of Environment for a foreshore lease in respect of the project and is the latter stages of the consenting process.  Additionally a grid connection offer from ESB Networks has been accepted.  A comprehensive data collection project to provide wave and seabed information for device developers is also underway.</p><p>  The Government recognises the potential of our indigenous wave energy resource and the Research and Development and job potential in this area.  In the context of overall reducing budgets, the capital allocation for the Ocean Energy Programme was increased to &euro;5 million for 2013.</p><p>  One of the priorities to be pursued is the further development of the Atlantic Marine Energy Test Site (AMETS).  The potential for private sector involvement is being explored and the strategy as to how to bring this forward will be further considered.</p></reply>

In preparing the National Renewable Energy Action Plan as required pursuant to the Directive, it was estimated that at least 8.4% of the energy in transport in Ireland in 2020 will come from the use of biofuels with the remainder achieved by the increased deployment of electric vehicles.  In common with other Member States the uptake of electric vehicles is likely to be lower than originally anticipated in the context of 2020 and therefore biofuels will likely be required to play a more significant role in meeting the 10% target.</p><p>  The Biofuel Obligation Scheme works by obligating large road transport fuel suppliers to bring a certain amount of sustainable biofuels to the market.  The scheme was introduced with an obligation on fuel suppliers to include at least 4% by volume biofuels in their overall disposal of road transport fuels.  In order to maintain progress towards achieving the 2020 targets, I increased the obligation to 6% by volume with effect from 1 January 2013.  It should be noted that strict sustainability criteria must be met in respect of biofuels to be counted under the scheme and towards our renewable energy targets.</p><p>  Recently, the European Commission circulated a proposal to amend sections of the Renewable Energy Directive.  This proposal is currently being progressed and is one of the major agenda items for the Irish presidency of the EU.  One of the amendments proposed is that no more than 5% of the energy in the transport sector should come from biofuels produced from certain crops.  My Department is currently examining the proposal and its implications for meeting the target of 10% renewable energy by 2020.  However, there are no implications for the current obligation rate of 6% as the overall energy content delivered by the obligation will not breach the proposed 5%.  The obligation rate of 6% will remain the same until the end of 2014.  Decisions on further increases after 2014 will be taken after any amendments to the Renewable Energy Directive have been finalised.</p><p>  The Biofuel Obligation has successfully delivered increased amounts of biofuel in Ireland resulting in 145 million litres being placed on the Irish market in 2011.  Of this, approximately 18.5 million litres was produced indigenously from waste material such as used cooking oil.  Though figures for 2012 are not yet available, I understand that the amount of indigenous biofuel on the market increased last year.  The recent increase in the obligation rate along with future increases will see the biofuel market grow to an estimated 500 million litres by 2020.  This will continue to create opportunities for indigenous industry to produce biofuels here in Ireland.</p></reply>

The commercial sector is already committed to making investments of the order of &euro;1bn which will deliver broadband speeds of 30Mbps to 150Mbps to homes and businesses.</p><p>  For example:</p><p>-  Eircom is currently investing up to &euro;500m in a phased deployment of fibre to the cabinet infrastructure, which is planned to make high-speed broadband available to 1.2m premises.  The network has already reached more than 230,000 premises and is expected to be launched in the coming months.</p><p>-  UPC is investing &euro;500m in its cable and fibre network, which is delivering speeds of up to 150Mbps.  UPC aims to have this service available to 700,000 homes by 2015.</p><p>-  Mobile telecommunications operators will be rolling out advanced mobile broadband products in 2013, following the recent multi-band spectrum auction.  With the explosion in the use of smart phones and tablet devices, the use of advanced mobile broadband is of increasing significance and it is expected that fibre connections will be required to service many of the base stations that transmit mobile signals.</p><p>  A key element of the National Broadband Plan is the Government&rsquo;s commitment to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.  It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aid application in respect of any State-led intervention.</p><p>  Earlier this month, my Department launched a tender for experts to assist in the design, planning and procurement of the State-led investment.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be on-going throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.</p><p>  Any contract subsequently awarded to service provider(s) to implement the roll out of broadband in areas which require direct Government intervention will be monitored and measured in terms of performance and quality of service.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and business have a broadband connection which meets their needs to interact effectively with society and business.</p><p>  A High Level Group chaired by my Department has been established to oversee progress on a wide range of actions outlined in the Plan aimed at supporting and accelerating investment in next generation broadband.  These include measures aimed at stimulating increased rates of digital adoption among citizens and businesses, the removal of barriers to make the various planning and consent approval systems more efficient and cost effective, a review spectrum policy and legislation, as well as the potential contribution that State entities can make in infrastructure deployment.</p><p>  The combination of these actions are designed to ensure that the Government commitment that all parts of Ireland, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.</p></reply>

To date, these media have not been subject to a formal regulatory regime akin to that used to &lsquo;regulate&rsquo; traditional radio and television broadcast media, either in Ireland or in other jurisdictions.  There is a range of reasons for this, not least the rapidly evolving nature of the technologies involved, the sensitivities around regulating media and the multi-jurisdictional nature of the Internet.</p><p>  It is important to acknowledge the economic and social benefits that the widespread use of social media have brought to people, communities and to business.  However, some of the issues that have arisen as a consequence of this bear consideration.  These challenges include dealing with harassment and bullying online, as well as issues around defamation, data protection and even copyright.</p><p>  There has been a very considerable amount of discussion on these matters in the recent past at EU and Council of Europe level, in which my Department has been involved.  Indeed this matter is also the subject of a fundamental debate at EU and national level at present, a fact reflected by the recent decision of the Joint Oireachtas Committee to examine the issue.</p><p>  As Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, I have policy responsibility for providing a supportive legislative and regulatory environment to facilitate the development of high quality communications infrastructure and services.  However, I should highlight that I do not have sole responsibility for addressing as to how that infrastructure is used.  Responsibility, in the context of abuse over the Internet in particular, also sits with the Minister for Justice and Equality, and the executive agency of his Department, the Office for Internet Safety.</p><p>  It is clear that there are no simple answers to the challenges posed by the development and abuse of social media, not least because of the international basis of the services and because any possible policy responses fall across a range of Government Departments.  In recognition of this complexity my Department maintains open and regular contact with all Departments and State Agencies with responsibilities in this area.</p><p>  My Department also monitors international developments with a view to ensuring that domestic policy within its remit reflects best practice and that the regulatory framework is amended as necessary. In that regard, I look forward to the deliberations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications, and I also look forward to meeting the Committee on this subject.</p></reply>

That panel was mandated to consider and comment on data and report on Electro Magnetic Field (EMF) emissions in relation to the East West Interconnector (EWIC) electricity cables.  The independent panel comprises three experts; an expert in epidemiology (appointed by the Minister for Health); an electrical engineering expert (appointed by me as Minster for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources); and a third member (chosen jointly by both Ministers) who is an acknowledged international expert in high-voltage electricity grid systems.  I would emphasise that these are three independent highly qualified experts who will report on and publish their findings on EMF emissions in relation to the EWIC.</p><p>  The independent panel met for the first time on Friday, 23 November 2012.  The work programme of the panel is being progressed and further meetings are planned throughout the course of 2013.  It is anticipated that once the panel has considered and commented on the first sets of data, those datasets and commentary will be made publicly available.</p><p>  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, arising out of the High Court proceedings taken in respect of the EWIC, Mr Justice Peart, held in July 2012 that the Interconnector was not operating outside its planning approval<font color="#004080"> </font>and dismissed the action.

This investment will provide significant choice to the consumer.</p><p>  While fibre to the home (FTTH) is currently not widely available to householders in Ireland, broadband networks which are serviced by fibre are increasingly providing high speed services to the home.  For example:</p><p>-  Eircom is currently investing up to &euro;500m in a phased deployment of fibre to the cabinet infrastructure, which is planned to make high-speed broadband available to some 1.2m premises by December 2014.  The network has already reached more than 230,000 premises and is expected to be launched over the coming months.</p><p>-  UPC is investing &euro;500m in its cable and fibre network, which is delivering speeds of up to 150Mbps to homes and multi dwelling units (MDUs).  UPC aims to have this service available to 700,000 homes by 2015.</p><p>-  BT is trialling Fibre to the Cabinet technologies that will deliver broadband at up to 80Mbps.  BT provides this infrastructure to Vodafone and Sky.</p><p>-  Mobile telecommunications operators will be rolling out advanced mobile broadband products in 2013, following the recent multi-band spectrum auction.  With the explosion in the use of smart phones and tablet devices, the use of advanced mobile broadband is of increasing significance and it is expected that fibre connections will be required to service many of the base stations that transmit mobile signals.</p><p>  Many of these developments were signalled in the Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last.  The commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.</p><p>  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  This will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.  It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aid application in respect of any State-led intervention. </p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and business have a broadband connection which meets their needs to interact effectively with society and business.</p><p>  In this context, the Government is committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to in the Plan, to ensure that all parts of Ireland will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.</p></reply>

An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) entails consideration of the potential impacts of a project on population, fauna, flora, soil, water, air, climatic factors, material assets, including the architectural and archaeological heritage, landscape and the inter-relationship between the above factors.  Under the EIA Directive, it is not possible to permit a project unless it can be determined following assessment that it would not have an unacceptable environmental or social impact.</p><p>  In this context, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has commenced a process to issue a public call inviting interested parties to tender for the offer of funding from both the EPA Strive Programme and my Department to conduct detailed research on the use of Unconventional Gas Exploration and Extraction in Ireland, in particular with regard to the use of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) technology.  The study follows on from the preliminary research into the environmental aspects of shale gas extraction, conducted by the University of Aberdeen, which was published by the EPA in May 2012.</p><p>The proposed terms of reference for this study have been developed and are currently the subject of a Public Consultation Process which was launched on 11 January 2013.  Interested parties have been invited to submit written comments by 8 March 2013.  Further details are available from the EPA website (  ).  The final results of this study are expected in early 2015.</p><p>  As I have confirmed to the House on a number of previous occasions, no decision will be made on any proposal for the use of hydraulic fracturing in exploration drilling in Ireland until there has been time to consider the outcome of this further EPA research.</p></reply>

The Commission is expected to publish its report in May and the Irish Presidency will facilitate discussions on it.</p><p>  In May, Dublin will host the 2013 SET-Plan Conference in Dublin.  The Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan is the EU strategy to accelerate the development and market roll-out of low carbon energy technologies.  The conference will run over two days and focus on Energy, Research and Industrial policies at European and National levels.</p><p>  The Energy Council in June will deliver Council conclusions on the Internal Energy Market Communication.  This communication sets out actions to drive towards the achievement of the internal market for energy.  The aim of achieving this internal market is to benefit customers, promote competition, achieve sustainability of supply and to decarbonise the electricity industry through increased renewable energy penetration and the improvement of infrastructure.</p><p>  The Irish Presidency is also progressing discussions on the proposal to amend the Renewable Energy Directive and the Fuel Quality Directive to take into account the indirect land use change impacts of biofuels.  These proposals include measures which would incentivise the production and use of next generation biofuels.  There will be orientation debates at the February Energy Council and March Environment Council and it is the Presidency&rsquo;s aim to produce a Progress Report for both Councils in June. </p><p>Finally, last month the Commission published a draft Directive on the Deployment of Alternative Fuels Infrastructure.  The aim of this proposed directive is to reduce dependency on oil throughout the EU by ensuring that adequate infrastructure is available in Member States both for the supply of alternative fuels such as compressed natural gas, hydrogen and biofuels and for the charging of Electric Vehicles.  The Commission will present on its proposal at the Transport Council on 11 March and there will be a first exchange of views by Member States.</p></reply>

An SEA of the Celtic and Irish Seas was also undertaken prior to the award of the exploration licence in the Kish Bank Basin.  An SEA, which includes both public consultation and consultation with prescribed bodies, is the process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of Plans and Programmes and prior to their final adoption.

This has generally been implemented in cooperation with private service providers on foot of a competitive process.  Prices for these services would reflect market norms.</p><p>  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013, and the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.

The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and the Marine Institute established an Ocean Energy Test Site for quarter scale prototypes of wave energy devices in Galway Bay in 2006. The Galway Bay wave energy test site facilitates the open sea deployment of scaled prototypes of Wave Energy Converters during the early stages of the development of their concept.</p><p>  Ancillary power and communications are also available on site. Wave energy devices that have been successfully deployed at the test-site since its inception include Wavebob and the Ocean Energy buoy.  Also incorporated within the test site area is the SmartBay project, run by the Marine Institute. This is a national research infrastructure project for oceanographic monitoring.</p><p>  The Galway Bay test site has been co-funded by the Marine Institute and Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland i.e. from state funds. Free access to the Galway site for developers is however available through Marinet.  Marinet is an EC-funded network of research centres and organisations that are working together to accelerate the development of marine renewable energy - wave, tidal and offshore-wind - by offering periods of free access to their world-class testing facilities, standardising testing, coordinating research, providing focused training and industry networking.  Marinet can be accessed by contacting the Hydraulics and Maritime Research Centre at Beaufort, University College Cork. </p><p>  The Ocean Energy Development Unit in SEAI was established to progress the ocean energy sector in Ireland.  SEAI has also been taking forward the development of a full scale grid connected wave test site off Annagh Head, County Mayo. This site is not yet operational.  SEAI has applied to the Department of Environment for a foreshore lease in respect of the project and is in the latter stages of the consenting process.  Additionally a grid connection offer from ESB Networks has been accepted. A comprehensive data collection project to provide wave and seabed information for device developers is also underway.</p><p>  The cumulative amount of expenditure on Ocean Energy by SEAI in the period 2009 &ndash; 2013, including the estimated 2013 allocation, is &euro;20.659m.  Some of this funding has also been allocated under a grant scheme for industry known as the Prototype Development Fund.  SEAI has been allocated an ocean energy budget this year and has several current applications from ocean energy companies for funding under this scheme.  Applications are being assessed with a view to the distribution of funds to eligible applicants within the budget available. </p><p>  Other supports for the sector include the development of the Beaufort Laboratory as part of the IMERC facility in Cork, which will see a re-housing of the wave tank facility and will bring together researchers in the area currently based in the Hydraulics and Maritime Research Centre (HMRC) and the Coastal and Marine Research Centre (CMRC), as part of a broader campus approach with the Naval College, UCC and Cork Institute of Technology, aimed at maximising on marine industrial opportunities. </p><p>  The Government recognises the potential of our indigenous wave energy resource and the Research and Development and job potential in this area.  In the context of overall reducing budgets, the capital allocation for the Ocean Energy Programme was increased to &euro;5 million for 2013. One of the priorities to be pursued is the further development of the Atlantic Marine Energy Test Site (AMETS) at Annagh Head.  The potential for private sector involvement in this regard is being explored. </p></reply>

The Plan is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>  The National Broadband Plan will deliver on these targets by leveraging investment from both private and public sectors.  The Plan envisages that industry will be the key driver of investment with State intervention only where there is market failure.</p><p>  Approximately &euro;1bn is being invested in Ireland by existing companies in fibre infrastructure which will deliver broadband speeds of 30Mbps to 150Mbps to most homes and businesses by 2015.  Mobile telecommunications operators will be rolling out advanced mobile broadband products in 2013, following the recent multi-band spectrum auction.</p><p>  The Government is committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  The total funding involved for any State intervention has been indicatively estimated in the Plan at &euro;350 million, &euro;175 million of which will come from public funding sources with the other &euro;175 million from the successful commercial service provider(s) emerging from a public procurement process.  The actual cost to the State will be determined by the structure and outcome of the procurement process which will be designed to ensure value for money.</p><p>The precise source of funding of the necessary State investment will be decided at the appropriate time by Government.   I anticipate that in advance of this decision my Department will discuss the matter with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and NewERA.  In any event I wish to underline the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the Plan and to the securing of the necessary funding.</p></reply>

Energy is consumed across the transport, heating and electricity sectors.  The intention is to reach Ireland&rsquo;s overall target through 40% renewable electricity, 10% renewable heating and 12% renewable transport, which together amount to 16% of all energy consumption.</p><p>  This is set out in our National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) and First Progress Report on the NREAP, which are both available on my Department&rsquo;s website. At end 2011, 6.4% of overall energy consumption from renewable sources had been achieved, so a further increase of 9.6% across the three sectors is required in the years to 2020 if Ireland&rsquo;s target is to be achieved.</p><p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) published a report entitled &ldquo;Energy in Ireland&rdquo; in November 2012.  That report gives an estimated figure of approximately &euro;300 million in avoided national gas imports from the use of all renewable energies in the generation of electricity in 2011.  For wind generation alone this would account for approximately an estimated &euro;240 million of the &euro;300 million in avoided gas imports.</p><p>  The SEAI Modelling Unit estimate, subject to a variety of assumptions, that fossil fuel dependency in Ireland may be reduced by up to 14% due to the energy efficiency measures and by a further 15% by renewable energy policy in the year 2020.  They have, however, also noted that a significant portion of biofuels and biomass may be imported in that period. </p><p>  With regard to potential energy exports, the Memorandum of Understanding on energy cooperation that UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Edward Davey and I signed on 24 January will result in completion of consideration of how Irish renewable energy resources, onshore and offshore, might be developed to the mutual benefit of Ireland and the United Kingdom.  This will determine whether it is beneficial for both countries to enter into an Inter-Governmental Agreement under the Renewable Energy Directive to provide for renewable energy trading.</p><p>  If an Inter-Governmental Agreement is entered into, there are potential significant employment opportunities.  As an example, employment creation arising from a 3,000MW project would be expected to be in the order of 3,000 to 6,000 job years in the construction phase, with the actual number dependent on the construction schedule to 2020.  There would also be additional jobs created in the ongoing maintenance of turbines over a 20-year operating life.  Further employment opportunities could arise if turbines or components were to be manufactured in Ireland.  All relevant State agencies, particularly in the enterprise area, would have to coordinate their activities early in the process to ensure employment potential of export projects is maximised.  This opportunity has already been identified by the Industrial Development Authority and Enterprise Ireland in their clean technology growth strategies.</p></reply>

A resolution of the situation for undocumented Irish migrants will continue to be an important priority for the Government in our ongoing contacts with the US Administration and Congress.  This issue will remain a central feature of the Government&rsquo;s engagement with the US authorities over the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period, and my programme and that of other members of the Government, while not yet finalised, will include meetings with key political figures and the Irish community groups that provide assistance to the undocumented. </p><p>  The advice of Ireland&rsquo;s friends and contacts within the US Administration and Congress has long been that comprehensive reform of the US immigration system and procedures is likely to be the only manner by which such a resolution can be achieved.  The prospects for such reform have advanced in the wake of President Obama&rsquo;s re-election.  The emphasis he placed on immigration reform in his inauguration address as well as in subsequent speeches, including the State of the Union address, sent a very positive signal in this regard.  The indications of emerging bipartisan support for reform in Congress is also encouraging.  Much further debate and discussion is likely to be required within the US political system before the shape of any legislative deal is clear.  It is therefore not possible at this stage to identify an exact timescale in which these may become clear but the area will continue to receive the Government&rsquo;s close attention over the period ahead.</p><p>  To reinforce the Irish government&rsquo;s interest in the issue I am currently undertaking a round of contacts with key Senators.  Most recently, I spoke with Senator John McCain to express the Government&rsquo;s appreciation for the efforts he and others are making in developing bi-partisan Senate proposals and to underline our ongoing interest in the issue, and with Senator Pat Leahy who is chair of the Judiciary Committee in the Senate.  I look forward to continuing my contacts with other Senators in the coming weeks</p></reply>

The camp had been set up by Sahrawi people protesting against their perceived marginalisation, and demanding jobs and adequate housing.   According to reports, eleven members of the security forces and two Sahrawis were killed during the violence.  </p><p>Over 200 Sahrawis were subsequently arrested by Moroccan security forces, of whom most were released but 25 were put on trial before the military court in Rabat as a result of their involvement.  On Sunday 17th   February, the military court handed down nine life sentences and sentenced 14 other defendants to between 20-30 years imprisonment each.  Two other defendants were released. It is believed the verdicts will now be appealed to the Moroccan Court of Cassation.  </p><p>  The accused have already spent two years in pre-trial detention prison and there have been allegations of torture during their imprisonment.  Concerns have also been expressed regarding the fact that the defendants have been tried in a military rather than a civilian court.  The UN Committee against Torture and the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture has sought to investigate and report on the situation. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has also expressed concerns over the case.  </p><p>  I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern regarding this case and my officials will continue to closely monitor the situation and the process regarding the appeal of the sentences.  The Government will continue to raise concerns about human rights abuses in Western Sahara, in particular reports of the arbitrary arrest, detention and mistreatment of human rights defenders, with Morocco in our ongoing bilateral dialogue.   Ireland has consistently called for the mandate of MINURSO, the United Nations Mission in Western Sahara monitoring the ceasefire with Western Sahara, to include a human rights monitoring element.  We believe this would provide invaluable independent and impartial information on the status of human rights in Western Sahara.</p></reply>

On 11 July 2012, Minister N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n launched a consultation process which concluded on 27 November on strategies for the Irish language and Ulster Scots.  Inputs from the consultation process are now being considered.</p><p>  Last November I visited An Chult&uacute;rlann in Belfast which is a very impressive Irish language and cultural centre.  I had the opportunity to meet with some of the city&rsquo;s leading Irish language activists and to hear their concerns regarding the promotion of the Irish language including their views on an Irish language act for Northern Ireland.  Officials in my Department maintain regular and ongoing contact with the Irish language community in Northern Ireland, most recently when they attended the official opening of Gael&aacute;ras Mhic Ardghail in Newry on Monday 18 February.</p><p>  The Government continues to follow developments closely in relation to the proposed Act, as well as the overall enhancement and protection of the Irish Language in Northern Ireland. We remain fully committed to the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the St Andrews Agreement, including the provisions relating to the Irish language.</p></reply>

This declaration was issued with the support of Member States, including Ireland.  The declaration conveyed our concern at the restrictions on expressions of Tibetan identity, which appear to be giving rise to a surge of discontent in the region. While respecting China&rsquo;s territorial integrity, the EU called upon the Chinese authorities to address the deep-rooted causes of the frustration of the Tibetan people to ensure that their civil, political, economic and social and cultural rights are respected, including their right to enjoy their own culture, to practise their own religion and to use their own language.</p><p>  This declaration also called on Tibetan community and religious leaders to use their influence to help stop this tragic loss of life.  </p><p>  Ireland together with our EU partners believes that constructive dialogue between the Chinese Government and the representatives of the Dalai Lama is the best way to address differences and tensions in Tibet and to reach a solution that respects Tibetan culture, language, religion and identity.  It is important for the long-term peace and stability of the region that the two sides come to an agreement on the future of Tibet.  To this end, we continue to encourage a resumption of meaningful dialogue.  </p><p>  The promotion of human rights is an important dimension of European foreign policy, as enshrined in the Treaty of the European Union. Constructive dialogue remains the EU&rsquo;s preferred channel for working to improve the human rights situation in China. Human rights are discussed as part of regular political dialogue as well as during specific human rights dialogues with China which have taken place since 1995. </p><p>  Bilaterally, Ireland continues to convey its concerns about the situation in Tibet directly to the Chinese authorities through regular contacts in both Dublin and Beijing.</p></reply>

Agreement by the British government to hold such an inquiry would fulfil its commitment in the Weston Park Agreement; on the basis of the findings of Judge Cory on the likelihood of state collusion. The work undertaken by Desmond De Silva QC can facilitate this, in my opinion, by helping ensure that an independent public inquiry need not be lengthy, open-ended and inordinately expensive.  As I said at the time, we must build on the progress made thus far.   In my contacts with Secretary of State Villiers following the publication, I made clear that the Irish Government will continue to seek an independent public inquiry.

The Revenue Commissioners are preparing valuation guidance which, together with a liable person&rsquo;s own knowledge of their property, will assist them in choosing the correct value band for their property.

The Dormant Accounts Fund consists of a &lsquo;&lsquo;reserve account&rsquo;&rsquo;, moneys in which are applied to meet repayments to claimants, as well as to fees, costs and expenses of the National Treasury Management Agency which is responsible for the management of the Fund, and an &lsquo;&lsquo;investment and disbursements account&rsquo;&rsquo;. It also provides that should the reserve account be depleted at any time, moneys will be paid into that account from the investment and disbursements account. If the investment account is also depleted, so that it cannot be used to service the reserve,  advances will be made from the Central Fund, to the reserve account, such advances being repayable once there are surplus moneys in the Fund again.</p><p>  Under Section 17(4) of the Dormant Accounts Act, 2001, the NTMA has determined, with the approval of the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government, given with the consent of the Minister for Finance, that 15% of the total moneys received by the Fund and not yet reclaimed should be paid into the Reserve Account. The value of the Reserve Account at end 2012 was &euro;58 million.</p><p>  The level of the Reserve Account is reviewed annually as part of the investment plan for the Dormant Accounts Fund to ensure that it is sufficient to meet any anticipated claims by dormant account holders to re-activate their dormant accounts.</p></reply>

The recently published Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2013 provides for additional exemptions, including an exemption for residential properties that have been certified as having significant pyritic damage.  However, this exemption does not apply if the pyritic damage has already been repaired. </p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that Local Property Tax (LPT) is a self-assessed tax so in the first instance it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property.  The Revenue Commissioners are preparing valuation guidance which, taken together with the owner&rsquo;s own knowledge of the property, will assist him or her in assessing its value.  The guidance will include an on-line guide that will provide indicative property valuation bands depending on the property type, age and location and it will be available on the Revenue website prior to the issue of Returns to property owners.  The guidance will also draw property owners&rsquo; attention to the publicly available property price register produced by the Property Services Regulatory Authority which provides an actual sales price for all properties sold since January 2010.  </p><p>  When using Revenue&rsquo;s valuation guidelines, the property owner should consider the specifics of his or her own property, for example, if the property has certain features such as a conservatory or is larger than the average property in the area, and these factors should be taken into account in the owner&rsquo;s assessment of the valuation of the property.  As I have previously advised the House, where the Revenue guidance is used in an honest manner, the property valuation made by a property owner will not be challenged by Revenue in accordance with its normal Customer Service Charter.  </p><p>  I am further advised by the Commissioners that the initial valuation of a property on 1 May 2013 will be valid up to and including 2016 and will not be affected by any improvements made to the property during this period.  From the information provided by the Deputy it is unclear whether the building work will be completed prior to 1 May 2013. Where this is the case, the property owner should take this into account in assessing the value of the property.  Any improvements or enhancements made to the property after the 1 May 2013 will only affect the valuation of the property on the next valuation date, which will be 1 November 2016. </p></reply>

For example, the liquidator is in the process of overseeing a valuation and sales process for the assets of IBRC, while the final payments made under the ELG Scheme have not yet been determined. Nevertheless, as referred to by the Deputy, simulation based assessment by my Department estimate that the General Government deficit will improve by approximately &euro;1 billion per annum over the coming years, which will bring us &euro;1bn closer to attaining our 3% deficit target by 2015. This means that the expenditure reductions and tax increases will be of the order of &euro;1 billion less to meet the 3% deficit (there will be negligible impact in 2013 as a result of the payout under ELG).  However, this has to be seen in the light of the most recently published General Government projected deficits of &euro;8.9bn and &euro;5.3bn for 2014 and 2015, respectively.</p><p>  While this agreement is a significant step forward in restoring sustainability to our public finances, the Government is well aware that there remains a considerable gap between what we get in revenue and what we spend. This situation is not sustainable over the longer term. In addition to the requirement under the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) to bring our deficit to under 3% of GDP by 2015, it makes sense that we bring balance back to the public finances and stabilise and reduce our debt burden.  </p><p>  As we are less than two months into the year, I will not be drawn into speculation on the composition of the next Budget and the impact that this deal will have on it.  There are a lot of other moving parts to be considered such as economic growth, tax take and expenditure performance.

This showed that the ECB held &euro;14.2 billion nominal value of Irish bonds at 31st December 2012 with an average remaining maturity of 4.6 years. The Annual Accounts of the ECB, which were also published on 21st February, show that the ECB received net interest income of &euro;1.1 billion in 2012 from Greek, Portuguese, Italian, Spanish and Irish securities purchased under the Securities Market Programme, with &euro;555 million of that arising from the SMP holdings of Greek government bonds.    The precise information you seek in relation to the ECB holdings of Irish Government bonds maturing within the next twelve months is not available. </p><p>  The package of measures for Greece agreed on November 26th 2012 by euro zone finance ministers is designed to help put the Greek economy on a path to sustainable growth and its domestic finances on a sound footing.

Member States under a full financial assistance programme, such as Ireland, are not required to participate in this scheme for the period in which they receive financial assistance. </p><p>  It is important to note that the concessions that have been agreed are specific to Greece and are accompanied by significant additional conditionality. </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s needs, as a country exiting a programme, are very different to those of Greece.

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a significant number of multiple property owners are already obliged, by virtue of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, to pay and file their tax returns electronically, and section 44 is in keeping with Revenue&rsquo;s strategic objective to encourage the use of electronic channels.    Revenue has developed a secure on-line system for filing LPT Returns that is user friendly and easily accessible on the Revenue website.  From the taxpayer&rsquo;s perspective, using the on-line system is the quickest and most straightforward way to complete and submit their LPT Returns, particularly so where there are multiple properties involved, as the system automatically calculates the LPT due for the individual properties, makes it easy to select a payment method from the wide range of options available, and provides immediate access to Revenue&rsquo;s on-line valuation guide.  In addition, property owners who file their LPT Returns on-line will also benefit from a three-week extended filing deadline to 28 May 2013.  </p><p>  I am further advised that, from the results of the 2011 Census, produced by the CSO, internet penetration levels in households in the State are at 75%, and for those property owners who do not have internet access, they can use the internet facilities available in Revenue offices or in their local library.  </p><p>  Furthermore, section 36 of the Act allows a Return to be made by any person authorised to do so by a liable person.  For example, a property owner may authorise a relative such as their son or daughter to complete and submit their Returns on-line and confirm the method of payment.  I am informed that from their discussions with the Local Government Management Agency in connection with customer preferences regarding the Household Charge, the Revenue Commissioners understand that this latter approach was favoured in a significant number of cases.</p><p>  Finally, the decision not to have to issue multiple LPT Returns to these owners will help achieve certain efficiencies and cost savings.</p></reply>

Accordingly, when the Department publishes the <i>Stability Programme Update</i>   in April it will contain official fiscal and macroeconomic forecasts until 2016.  </p><p>  Looking at the fiscal impact of the promissory note deal, there are some aspects of the deal which are yet to be finalised.  For example, the liquidator is in the process of overseeing a valuation and sales process for the assets of IBRC, while the final payments made under the ELG Scheme have not yet been determined.</p><p>  Nevertheless, simulations ran by my Department estimate that the General Government deficit will improve by approximately &#8364;1 billion per annum over the medium term and this should be instructive to the Deputy.</p><p>  The Government&#8217;s focus is on stabilising the General Government debt to GDP ratio and beginning the process of reducing it to a lower, safer level over time. The latest official forecast  of General Government Debt was contained in Budget 2013, which projected General Government Debt peaking in 2013 before falling gradually though the forecast horizon.   The debt rule in the Fiscal Compact, which implements the Stability &amp; Growth Pact provisions, requires us to reduce that part of the debt ratio which is above the threshold rate of 60 per cent annually by at least one-twentieth of the difference between the actual rate and the threshold rate.   </p><p>  A transition period will apply for all countries, including Ireland, that are currently subject to the excessive deficit procedure. During this transition period, which would last for three years following the correction of the excessive deficit, the requirement under the debt correction rule is deemed to be fulfilled if we are making &#8220;sufficient progress&#8221; towards compliance. </p><p>  In terms of the fiscal implications of this debt correction rule, it is important to remember that it is the debt to GDP debt ratio that is important, not the overall nominal level of General Government debt. In other words, on the basis of reasonable assumptions over the medium-term, we can expect economic growth to do much of the work in this regard. </p><p>  Obviously, the reduced borrowing requirement over the medium term arising from the promissory note deal will help us to achieve our debt targets more quickly.</p><p>  Additionally, the terms of the Fiscal Compact Treaty require us to converge towards our Medium Term Budgetary Objective once we are out of the EU/IMF Programme. It should be noted that the MTO is a structural balance target, net of one-offs and cyclical factors. For Ireland, the conversion of our structural budget position into nominal figures is a complex process. It is too early to try and do this in respect of the period 2018-2025 sought by the Deputy. </p><p>  I would emphasise the point that while the agreement on the promissory note is a significant step forward in restoring sustainability to our public finances, this Government is well aware that there remains a considerable gap between what we get in revenue and what we spend. This situation is not sustainable over the longer term. In addition to the requirements to bring our deficit to under 3% of GDP by 2015 as per the EDP, it makes sense that we bring balance back to the public finances and stabilise and reduce our debt burden.</p></reply>

To be exempt from payment of Local Property Tax, a residential property must be acquired or adapted to make it suitable for occupation by an incapacitated individual. In the case of adaptations to a property, the exemption will not apply unless the cost of the adaptations exceeds 25% of the market value of the property before completion of the adaptations.  The exemption ends if the property is sold and the incapacitated individual no longer occupies it as his or her sole or main residence.   The new Bill also includes provision for relief by way of a reduction in the chargeable value of a relevant residential property that has been adapted for occupation by a disabled person where the adaptation has been grant-aided by a local authority.  The reduction is limited to the lesser of the chargeable value attributable to the adaptation work carried out on the property and the maximum grant payable under the relevant local authority scheme.  The relief ends on the sale or transfer of a property that has been adapted, unless the person with the disability continues to reside in the property. </p><p>  Therefore, in cases where an exemption does not apply, relief may be available by way of reduction of the chargeable value of the residential property.</p></reply>

As a consequence, the surviving individual would have the following entitlements under the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 that are specific to a widowed or bereaved person:</p><p>- basic personal tax credit of &#8364;3,300 under section 461 &#8211; available only in the year of bereavement;</p><p>- widowed persons tax credit of &#8364;540 under section 461A &#8211; available in addition to the basic personal tax credit of &#8364;1,650 from the year following the year of bereavement and where the individual has not remarried;</p><p>- one-parent family tax credit of &#8364;1,650 under section 462 - available where a qualifying child resides with the claimant and he or she has not remarried or entered a cohabiting relationship;</p><p>- widowed parent tax credit reducing from &#8364;3,600 to &#8364;1,800 over the five years following the year of bereavement under section 463 &#8211; available where a qualifying child resides with the claimant and he or she has not remarried or entered a cohabiting relationship. </p><p>  In relation to persons who were married and that marriage was annulled or dissolved, or if the parties were formally divorced, then each has reverted to single status without any link to the status of the other party to the former marriage.

Paragraph 10 of Section 14 provides that relevant employers must submit an annual return to the Revenue Commissioners detailing, inter alia, the number of employees and the amounts of exempt income claimed under the programme.  This return was not sought until after the end of the tax year 2012 in order to ensure that an accurate picture of take up levels over a full tax year could be provided.

It refers to &euro;123m as being the estimated level of deposits eligible under Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS).  The remaining deposits are considered as ineligible under DGS; a portion of these deposits will be covered by the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee (ELG) Scheme.  As payments under the ELG Scheme are on the basis of claims submitted to the NTMA as operators of the Scheme it is too early for me to confirm how much will eventually be paid out under the Scheme as a result of the liquidation.</p><p>  In relation to Irish Credit Unions, I am advised by the Central Bank of Ireland that certain tracker bonds sold to Credit Unions which were liabilities of IBRC at the time of the liquidation have a structured deposit element which is covered by the Deposit Guarantee Scheme but fall outside the eligibility criteria for the ELG Scheme due to the nature of the investment product concerned.  Unfortunately, if a deposit is not eligible under the ELG scheme the depositor will rank as an unsecured creditor in the liquidation.  I am advised that this may impact a small number of Credit Unions.</p><p>  The individual Credit Unions affected and the Irish League of Credit Unions have been in contact with the Special Liquidator in relation to this matter.  It should be noted that the Government has already provided &euro;500 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money to support the stability of credit unions through resolution and restructuring.  In addition, the Credit Union movement has its own stabilisation fund.	</p></reply>

The total cost of the liquidation is dependent on the value ascribed to the assets in the valuation process currently being conducted by the Special Liquidators. While claims of c.&#8364;1 billion are expected under the ELG Scheme it is too early to estimate what further costs are likely to be incurred until that process has been completed.</p><p>  At this early stage of the special liquidation the Special Liquidators are engaged in intensive processes which involve, <i>inter alia</i>, asserting control over the businesses, processes, systems and personnel of IBRC. It is important that focus is placed on assessing, reorganising and restructuring the day&#8211;to-day activities of the Bank to meet the primary objective of ensuring the purpose of the special liquidation is achieved, as this is key to ensuring that maximum value is extracted from the liquidation.</p></reply>

The sale of Irish Life, while benefiting the Exchequer by an estimated &euro;1.3 billion, has a negligible impact on the General Government Balance (GGB) and I would like to make it clear that it is in GGB terms that our annual fiscal targets under the EU/IMF Programme are set. </p><p>  Accordingly, directing a large amount of funds for expenditure on a stimulus package, equivalent to the amount of proceeds raised through the Irish Life sale, would have a severe negative impact on the 2013 GGB. This would most likely result in the State missing its annual deficit target and would endanger the economic recovery experienced to date.</p><p>  The Government recognises that improving labour market conditions represents its biggest challenge, and, accordingly, is giving priority to job protection, job creation and supporting the unemployed.  In this regard, the Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation recently published the 2013 Action Plan on Jobs, which seeks to address this important challenge.</p></reply>

As I have previously informed the House, I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that following receipt of data from the DSP in late 2011 containing details of DSP pension payments, it emerged that some pensioners with significant other income had not previously declared their DSP pension for tax purposes. Revenue&rsquo;s approach was, firstly, to ensure that the record was correct for 2012 and thereafter to examine in detail the largest cases where there was a mismatch between their records and the DSP record, beginning with cases where annual non-DSP income exceeded &euro;50,000.  The information obtained from the initial examination would inform Revenue on how they would proceed with other higher risk cases. This follow-up project has been ongoing and Revenue is now corresponding with taxpayers who did not declare their DSP pension where they have annual non-DSP income of between &euro;30,000 and &euro;40,000.</p><p>  This correspondence, which gives the taxpayer in question an opportunity to engage with Revenue, and, for example, to claim any unclaimed tax reliefs such as medical expenses etc., is in keeping with Revenue&rsquo;s normal practice.  It also provides an opportunity to address the question of ability to pay which can only be determined when the actual liability outstanding has been established on foot of the submission of completed tax returns for the relevant years.</p></reply>

Any claims over and above that described above will rank as an unsecured claim in the liquidation process. </p><p>  There are standard rules which apply to the distribution of the assets of companies in liquidation and it would not be appropriate for me to interfere with these rules. However the State does intervene to ensure that statutory redundancy is available through the Social Insurance Fund and that arrears of pay, sick pay, holiday pay or pay in lieu of statutory notice (limited to &euro;600 per week up to a maximum of eight weeks) are payable from the Insolvency Payments Scheme. The Minister for Social Protection will rank as a preferential creditor of IBRC in respect of any payments made to employees of IBRC from the Social Insurance Fund or the Insolvency Payments Scheme. </p><p>  Any action taken by the Minister which might divert the assets from IBRC creditors to employees, could be challenged in the Courts.  I have been advised by the Special Liquidators that any voluntary severance scheme, that was in place prior to liquidation, is no longer operational.</p><p>  The Special Liquidators were promptly in contact with staff on Thursday, 7 February and, unlike in other liquidations, the majority of employees have been re-hired by the special liquidators, for a minimum period of 3 months, to ensure an orderly wind-down of the business. In addition some staff may in time be re-hired by NAMA or other purchasers of the assets. This should provide some reassurance to employees. </p></reply>

The &quot;two-pack&quot; will be a significant and welcome enhancement of the euro area&#8217;s economic governance regime. It is, to a great extent, a natural extension of the measures contained in the &#8216;six-pack&#8217; which was introduced on 13 December, 2011. The &#8216;six-pack&#8217; - comprising five regulations and one directive - reformed and strengthened fiscal surveillance under the <i>Stability and Growth Pact</i>   and introduced new macroeconomic surveillance. </p><p>  The &#8216;two-pack&#8217; is applicable to euro area member countries only. </p><p>  The proposed surveillance regulation provides for surveillance under a number of circumstances, specifically, where a member state is experiencing severe difficulties with regard to its financial stability and where this is likely to have adverse spillover effect on other Member States, where a member state is in a macroeconomic adjustment programme, and also post-programme surveillance. There are specific features attaching to each of these.  However, in the case of enhanced surveillance, it is a matter for the Commission to decide every six months whether to prolong the enhanced surveillance.  Under the regulation, a post-programme surveillance process will be put in place and maintained for a member country until the balance outstanding under EU-sourced financial assistance falls below 25% of the total. This covers all EU funding sources, including bilateral loans.  It also provides that the Commission shall conduct, in liaison with the ECB, regular review missions in the Member State under post-programme surveillance to assess its economic, fiscal and financial situation. </p><p>The reports generated following such missions shall be considered by the European Council which - acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission - may recommend to the Member State concerned to adopt corrective measures.  The regulation provides that the duration of post-programme surveillance may be extended by the Council on a proposal from the Commission <i>&#8220;in the case of persistent risks to the financial or fiscal sustainability of the Member State concerned.</i>   Post-programme surveillance is a normal feature of IMF assistance programmes, and this regulation provides for a similar arrangement for the EU.  </p><p>The other proposed regulation concerns <i>&#8216;the monitoring and assessment of draft budgetary plans and on ensuring the correction of excessive deficits&#8217;</i>   in euro area Member States. It will apply to all countries in the euro area, with special provisions including in relation to reporting requirements being made for those which are subject to an excessive deficit procedure.   This draft regulation specifies that all euro area Member States, not in a macroeconomic adjustment programme, will be required to submit to the Commission and the Eurogroup and make public a draft budgetary plan no later than 15 October each year.  The draft budgetary plan will be assessed by the Commission, which shall adopt an opinion on it by the end of November.  The draft regulation also provides that the Commission may request a revised draft budgetary plan in exceptional circumstances where it identifies particularly serious non-compliance with the budgetary obligations laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact.</p><p>  This Government is firmly committed to reducing the deficit to below 3% by 2015 and to achieve a structural balance thereafter in line with the stability treaty.  These regulations make no changes to these rules.</p></reply>

They can also be made by direct debit from current accounts in banks and other financial institutions including credit unions and can also be made in cash or by debit/credit card through approved payment service providers.  I am advised that the Revenue Commissioners will shortly publish details of these approved payment service providers and they advise that they are currently negotiating with a number of organisations to provide cash payment facilities, including An Post.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners also advise that there is no additional administration or interest charge imposed by Revenue where the phased payment options are adhered to.

There is no charge where the payment is deducted at source.</p><p>  Finally, I am satisfied that the range of payment options available to facilitate phased payment will allow liable persons choose whatever option suits their own particular circumstances.</p></reply>

This legislation provides the Financial Services Ombudsman with various powers in order to determine jurisdiction on a complaint. Included in this is a statutory timeframe, Section 57BX (3)(<i>b</i>) provides:-</p><p>  &quot;A consumer is not entitled to make a complaint if the conduct complained of - occurred more than 6 years before the complaint is made.&quot;</p><p>  The legislation prohibits the Financial Services Ombudsman from examining any aspect of a complaint where the conduct being complained of occurred more than 6 years from receipt of the Complaint in his Office.  If the conduct being complained of occurred 6 year before the complaint is submitted to the Financial Services Ombudsman, the Ombudsman has no discretion in examining such a case.</p><p>  I understand from the Central bank that where the proceeds of an endowment policy are insufficient to repay the capital element of an endowment mortgage, borrowers should be given ample time to make alternative repayment arrangements. Borrowers are afforded the protections of the 'Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears' in cases where the mortgage is in arrears or in pre-arrears and is secured by the borrower&#8217;s primary residence.</p><p>  When the risks associated with endowment mortgage products were highlighted in the 1990s, specific provisions were incorporated into the Consumer Credit Act 1995 which require warnings to the effect that the proceeds of a policy may not be sufficient to repay a mortgage. Under the provisions of the Act, endowment mortgage savings plans must be reviewed by the life company at least every five years to check if the plan is on track to repay the mortgage. A statement setting out the estimated revised valuation of the endowment policy at maturity must be issued by the insurer to the borrower. If the policy is not on track to repay the mortgage, the life company will recommend an increase in the premium.</p></reply>

In addition to the payment of the local authority grant, two other conditions must be met, to qualify for the reduction.  Firstly, the person with the disability must occupy the property as his or her sole or main residence after the adaptation is completed.  Secondly, the liable person in relation to the property must notify the Revenue Commissioners in writing of the amount of the chargeable value that is attributable to the adaptation along with any relevant documentation.  The reduction in value is limited to the lesser of the chargeable value attributable to the adaptation work carried out on the property and the maximum grant payable under the relevant local authority scheme.  This chargeable value is to be used in relation to subsequent valuations of the property, unless additional grant-aided work is carried out.  The relief ends on the sale or transfer of a property that has been adapted, unless the person with the disability continues to reside in the property.  Guidance on how to avail of this relief, together with any additional information will be available on the Revenue website, <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>   shortly.</p><p>  In accordance with Section 2 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2013, an exemption from the charge to LPT will apply to a residential property purchased, built or adapted to make it suitable for occupation by a permanently and totally incapacitated individual as their sole or main residence, where an award has been made by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board or a court, or where a trust has been established, specifically for the benefit of such individuals.  In the case of adaptations to a property, the exemption will only apply where the cost of the adaptations exceeds 25% of the chargeable value of the property before it is adapted.  The exemption ends if the property is sold and the incapacitated individual no longer occupies it as his or her sole or main residence.</p><p>For individuals on low incomes or those whose only income source is from the Department of Social Protection, the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 and the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2013 provide for the possibility of deferring the charge in certain cases of inability to pay. Details of the existing deferral arrangements are available on Revenue&#8217;s website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>  , where the Commissioners have recently published a useful Guide to Local Property Tax.  This will be revised shortly to take account of the provisions of the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2013.</p><p>  It should be noted, however, that the provisions in the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2013 to which I refer are subject to its enactment.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that LPT is a self-assessment tax, so in the first instance, it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the chargeable value of the property.  I would like to clarify that the Revenue Commissioners will not be involved, as a matter of routine, in valuing individual properties.    As part of the general issue of Returns, beginning in March 2013, property owners will also receive an information booklet and a Revenue Estimate of LPT.  The Revenue Estimate is not based on a valuation of each owner&rsquo;s individual property, nor should it be regarded as an accurate calculation of the amount of LPT that they should pay.  Once the property owner meets his or her obligations by valuing the property, submitting the Return and advising Revenue of his or her payment method within the relevant time limits, the Revenue Estimate of LPT notified to the owner is no longer relevant. However, if the property owner considers that the amount shown on the Notice of Estimate accurately reflects his or her self-assessment, he or she should complete the Return on that basis, select a payment option and submit the Return.</p><p>  The Commissioners are actively preparing valuation guidance which, taken together with the owner&rsquo;s own knowledge of the property, will assist him or her in assessing its value.  The guidance will include an on-line guide that will provide indicative property valuation bands depending on the property type, age and location, and it will be available on the Revenue website prior to the issue of Returns to property owners.  The guidance will also draw property owners&rsquo; attention to the publicly available property price register produced by the Property Services Regulatory Authority which provides an actual sales price for all properties sold in the State since January 2010.  As I have previously advised the House, where the Revenue guidance is used in an honest manner, the property valuation made by a property owner will not be challenged by Revenue in accordance with its normal Customer Service Charter.</p></reply>

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. In that regard, during the past two years my Department has provided funding towards additional accommodation and refurbishment works to both of the schools referred to by the Deputy. These projects have now been completed.</p><p>  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act 1998. In this regard a board of management may deem it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular age group or to children living in a particular area or on the basis of some other criterion. Some schools use parish or other boundaries for this purpose.</p><p>  The selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based is matter for the individual school authority. In formulating an enrolment policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful and applied fairly to all applicants.</p><p>  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the rights of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.</p><p>  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department.</p><p>  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.

It is important to note that schools themselves employ teachers and not the Department of Education and Skills. Ultimately, the decision lies with the principal or board of management of the school. </p><p>  Under the current Circulars, each principal must report to his or her board of management on a regular basis on the fact that a list of unemployed registered teachers is being maintained, and the circumstances in which he or she has had to engage a registered teacher in receipt of a pension under a public service pension scheme or an unregistered person. </p><p>  From January 2011 teachers who are in receipt of a pension and who return to teaching are remunerated at the first point of the relevant salary scales applicable to new entrants. This represents a significant financial disincentive for teachers who retired at the top of their salary scale, often with a post of responsibility allowance, to return to teaching.</p></reply>

Since its establishment, the Appeals Board sittings have taken place at intervals varying from 2 to 4 weeks: the frequency of sittings is determined by the volume of appeals submitted and the requirement that the Appeals Board make a determination on the appeal within the 60 day timeframe specified in the Student Support Act 2011.</p><p>  Since its establishment in 2011, the following amounts have issued to the Appeals Board members:-</p><p>- Allowances - &euro;15,450.00;</p><p>- Travel and Subsistence - &euro;6,591.61.

This fund is a successor to the Labour Market Activation Fund and the aim of the Fund is to provide a range of quality, relevant education &amp; training interventions for up to 6,500 individuals who are long-term unemployed.</p><p>  Training will be provided within the context of four themes, three of which will support occupational clusters where demand and vacancies exist within certain Labour Market sectors.  A fourth theme will focus on the specific needs of people under 25 who are unemployed, assisting them to access and/or return to the Labour Market.</p><p>  The Department of Social Protection now has responsibility for Labour Market Activation programmes and policy.</p></reply>

The Board is being established to use the cash contributions of up to &euro;110 million pledged by the religious congregations to support the needs of some 15,000 survivors of residential institutional child abuse.  This support will involve the provision of a range of approved services, including health and personal social services, education services and housing services.</p><p>  Those eligible to apply for assistance from the Fund are those former residents who received awards from the Residential Institutions Redress Board or who received an award or settlement in court proceedings and who would otherwise have received an award from the Redress Board.</p><p>  Arrangements to establish the Fund are being pursued.  I have nominated Sylda Langford to become Chairperson of the Board and in accordance with Government procedures, Ms Langford met with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection on February 20th to discuss the approach she will take as Chairperson and her views about the future contribution of the new organisation.  I intend to appoint the remaining members to the Board shortly.

Separately under the provisions of the Companies Acts, once a company is restored to the Register of Companies, it becomes entitled to its property as if it had never lost it.  The total value of the personal property held by the Minister arising from the proceeds of bank accounts of dissolved companies, as represented by the balance in the State Property Miscellaneous Deposits Account, is of the order of &euro;2.5m.

Also in 2009, the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Acts of 2009 abolished the payment of long service increments (LSIs) to members from the formation of the current Oireachtas.  As LSIs are no longer payable, current Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad will not have LSIs included in their pension calculations, regardless of whether or not they had been at one time in receipt of those increments.</p><p>  Under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010, a further reduction in pay was imposed on the remuneration of members of the then Cabinet.  This Government itself imposed a policy of strong pay reduction and restraint since taking office in March 2011 with the pay of all members of the Government voluntarily reduced from its first day in Office.  Section 6 (c) of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Amendment) Act, 2011 provided the legislative basis for these pay reductions from 1 January 2012.  The effect of these reductions is that the gross annual salary of An Taoiseach has been reduced by nearly 30% since December 2009, and that of the T&aacute;naiste and Ministers by nearly 25% from December 2009, excluding the impact of the pension related deduction.</p><p>  In relation to allowances in the nature of pay, following reductions and abolitions by the previous Government to a number of allowances related to Committees, the system of allowances paid to Members was substantially overhauled by this Government in 2011 upon taking office.  The rate of allowances paid to Chairpersons of Oireachtas Committees and to Commission Members were reduced further, representing reductions in the region of 50% on the June 2009 rates.  The total estimated cost of the current measures in respect of these allowances is now less than &euro;400,000, compared to a cost in 2008 of &euro;1.436 million.</p><p>  In the context of the Expenditure Estimates for 2013, I announced that a 10% reduction will be applied to the Party Leaders&rsquo; Allowance rates payable to qualifying leaders of political parties and to qualifying independent members.  I also announced that severance payments payable to Ministers and other Officeholders upon cessation of Office are to be abolished.  My Department has already commenced preparations on the changes to primary legislation necessary to effect those changes.</p><p>  Prior to the introduction of the new Parliamentary Standard Allowance expenses regime from 1 March 2010, the previous expenses regime had been reduced by 10%, except for mileage which had been reduced by 25% in the case of mileage. </p><p>  Since 1 May 2011, Cabinet Ministers with the exception of Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Law Reform now use their own cars on official business.  Ministers of State have used their own cars on official business since 1984.  It was estimated at the time that the saving to be achieved in not supplying State cars to Cabinet Ministers was of the order of &euro;4m per annum.</p><p>  In December 2012, I announced further cuts to the Oireachtas expense allowance regime as follows: </p><p>(i)   reduced the rates of the Travel and Accommodation [TAA] element of the allowance by 25% for Dublin (less than 25km) and by 10% for the other bands,</p><p>(ii)  eliminated the unvouched element of the Public Representational Allowance [PRA], subject to permitting monthly expenditure in the nature of &ldquo;petty cash&rdquo; for incidental expenses per month of &euro;100 for each Deputy and &euro;75 for each Senator [and subject to limits in (iii) below], and</p><p>(iii) reduced the vouched expenditure limits under the PRA to &euro;20,350 for Deputies, &euro;16,000 for Minister and Minister of Sate, and &euro;12,225 for Senators.</p><p>  It also reduced the monthly pre-paid envelope allowance for Deputies and Senators by 50%, to 625 for Deputies and 375 for Senators, and to eliminate the unvouched options of the secretarial support allowances.</p><p>  All of these changes have resulted in, and will generate future, significant financial savings to the Exchequer.  It is my intention to continue to ensure that the greatest value for money can be achieved in relation to payments made to members of the Houses of the Oireachtas on an ongoing basis. </p></reply>

In this regard, I would refer the Deputy to my reply on this issue (PQ 3066/13 - answered 23/01/13).</p><p>  The inclusion of a social clause in all public procurement contracts requiring that a quota young unemployed people or long-term unemployed be employed in the delivery of the contract poses a number of risks. Firstly, it is against EU Treaty principles to discriminate between people on the basis of age. Secondly, in the current economic climate, and in particular bearing in mind the difficulties in the construction sector, businesses have for obvious reasons been reducing their existing workforce rather than taking on new employees. Consequently, it would be expected that, where a business is awarded a public contract, the work would be carried out by the existing employees of that business. In such circumstances a social clause requiring that a number of long-term unemployed be employed in delivering a public contract could either impose an additional cost on SMEs that they may not be able to afford, or result in an employee of the supplier being let go in favour of a long-term unemployed person. </p><p>  The Government has a wide range of measures that it is deploying to facilitate job creation and support labour activation, with particular emphasis on assisting long term unemployed people.  Obviously, the main purpose of the public procurement process is to ensure that goods, services and works are purchased by the State in a manner that is legal, transparent and of high probity, and our key requirement is the achievement of value for money.  Within this context, my Department and the National Procurement Service are examining the use of social clauses as an additional means of supporting activation and we are seeking to identify the scope for the use of social clauses in parts of the capital area in particular.</p></reply>

In July 2012, the Government agreed a range of actions aimed at achieving a focused and integrated approach to external service delivery of non-core processes with the objective of reducing costs and focusing staff resources on priority areas.   </p><p>  As part of this approach, the Government has decided that all proposed new services across the Public Service will be tested for external service delivery before any approval to provide the service internally will be granted. External service delivery leads have been appointed in every Department and Sector and the three major sectors of Health, Justice and Local Government have prepared external service delivery plans. My Department is also examining a number of potential cross-Departmental major projects for external service delivery.  </p><p>  While my Department is overseeing the development and implementation of external service delivery policy for the Public Service, the testing and ultimate decision with regard to the outsourcing of any particular service is a matter for the individual public bodies concerned in each case.

Under the CER, multi-annual current expenditure ceilings are fixed for each Department in order to make clear, in advance, the resources available for each area and the level of savings required. The intention of this reform measure is to improve the focus on medium-term, structural and strategic planning of expenditure within each area and to prevent spending overruns where possible. </p><p>  Good progress has been made to advance reforms in the area of evidence-based expenditure policy. This includes actions taken in relation to the Public Spending Code to consolidate existing procedures in this area and modernise them in line with best national and international practice. These reforms are supported by the establishment of a Public Service Evaluation Network, reforms to the Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Review process and the introduction of new Focused Policy Assessments designed to answer specific issues of policy configuration and delivery.</p><p>  With regard to the specific areas referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) are key enablers to delivering improved public services. In 2012, my Department published the eGovernment Strategy 2012-2015 and the Cloud Commuting Strategy, which identified necessary actions to enhance the delivery of public services using ICT. While these strategies were developed by my Department in conjunction with the Public Service Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council, the specific responsibility for implementation of actions arising from these strategies and for assessing the efficiencies that arise, including enhancing ICT capability, is a matter for each individual Department and Office.</p><p>  The Reform Plan has given an added impetus to the OPW&rsquo;s on-going drive to reduce rental outgoings.  Through a programme of lease surrenders and rent reviews, The OPW has reduced the annual rental cost of Civil Service accommodation by approximately &euro;25 million. The Reform Plan has been given further support by a specific Government decision mandating the OPW to further rationalise Civil Service accommodation and produce more space efficient accommodation standards. This will facilitate the surrender of the maximum feasible number of leases as lease breaks arise thus further reducing the Government's rental costs. As part of this process, the OPW has been asked to work with the various sectors within the Public Service, e.g., Local Authorities, HSE, etc., to develop standards and protocols that will facilitate the sharing of buildings and the transfer of property, thus reducing the State's overall property costs.</p><p>  A decision-making model for Shared Services has been established to evaluate value for money to the taxpayer for all Shared Services programmes under my Department&rsquo;s remit. A cost-benefit analysis to assess the potential efficiencies that a Shared Services Centre can deliver, of both pay and non-payroll expenditure, is carried out in respect of each proposed Shared Service programme. This analysis is assessed with comparable benchmarks elsewhere to identify the opportunity for improving cost efficiencies and effectiveness for a specific function. These make up a significant part of the overall business case. The business case also considers a number of possible options and assesses the financial and non-financial value of each of those options. Each Shared Service programme has a business case submitted for peer review to the Shared Service Transformation Unit and the Central Economic Evaluation Unit (for evaluation of the financial and non-financial assumptions against the Public Spending Code). </p><p>  The methodology I have described above allows me to report that the Human Resources and Pensions Shared Services Centre for the Civil Service, PeoplePoint, is expected to yield combined pay and non-pay savings in the region of an annual net saving of &euro;12.5 million by 2014 while the number of staff involved in delivering these services will reduce by a minimum of 17%. The first transitions to PeoplePoint are expected at the end of March 2013, with all 40 in scope bodies to be transitioned by the end of 2014. A similar approach has been taken to develop a business case for Payroll Shared Services and to assess the baseline performance of Banking and Financial Management for consideration for Shared Services. A cost-benefit analysis for Shared Services projects notified to my Department is also being undertaken across the Public Service sectors of Health and Local Government.</p><p>  I would also point out that the Progress Reports published by the Implementation Body overseeing progress on the Public Service Agreement have identified significant non-pay administrative efficiency savings. Two reports have been issued to date &ndash; the first in June 2011 and the second in June 2012. </p><p>  Overall, good progress has been made on delivering savings and implementing the Public Service Reform Plan. Of course, it remains a matter for each Minister and their Departments to ensure that the Vote-level allocations are adhered to and at the same time ensure that they continue to provide essential front-line services and respond to increasing demands.</p></reply>

The planning process for a possible successor Programme for PEACE III was initiated in April 2012, with my Department and the Department of Finance and Personnel asking the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) to commence preparation of detailed programme proposals in close consultation with the relevant Government Departments.  </p><p>  The development of the new programme proposals is being overseen by a Programme Development Steering Group chaired by SEUPB and consisting of representatives of Government Departments, local Government, and the trade union, business, rural and community and voluntary sectors.    A public consultation process on potential priorities and content of the Programme ran from 28 August to 20 November 2012.  Following consideration of the consultation responses, a draft Operational Programme for PEACE IV will be prepared and a further public consultation on the draft Programme will be held in early to mid 2013.</p><p>  It is intended that both Operational Programmes for PEACE IV and INTERREG V will be presented to the Northern Ireland Executive, the Irish Government and the Scottish Government during 2013.  Formal submission to the European Commission for approval will take place following agreement of the three Governments.</p></reply>

The overall Irish success rate at 22.7%, is above the European Member State average of 22.1%, and a very positive indication of the prospects for Irish participation over the lifetime of FP7 and broadly in line with our national targets.   Ireland&rsquo;s involvement in the 2013 work programme is expected to reflect participation to date, i.e. demonstrating an application success rate above the EU average. </p><p>  In July 2012, the European Commission launched its final and largest ever package of FP7 calls, an &euro;8.1 billion work programme for 2013.  This work programme is currently underway, with closing dates for proposals spanning September 2012 to year end 2013. Funding will be awarded in 2013 &ndash; 2014.   </p><p>  The limited budget attached to the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP) means that it is not an expenditure-orientated programme like FP7 or the Cohesion Policy Funds, but one that seeks to achieve its ambitions and broadly defined objects by leveraging its ideas, products and partnerships into other policies and programmes. Enterprise Ireland will be engaging with CIP funding for 2013 through the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN) which is the primary instrument for the CIP programme.  As suitable calls arise, the EEN will be engaging with its client base.   One very concrete benefit to Ireland and SMEs from this programme is its joint funding of the Enterprise Europe Network, which is in the region of &euro;450,000 per year.</p><p>  In relation to Pre-Commercial Procurement,  there is Irish involvement in two pilot programmes in the CIP ICT Policy Support Programme. These pilot programmes mainly address interoperability of public service pilots on a large scale across Europe, with the ultimate objective of wide-scale service uptake eventually by all 27 member states.  Under this year&rsquo;s 2013 call for this work programme, PPI (Public Procurement of Innovative solutions) instruments will be used for the first time, in anticipation of their wide-scale use in Horizon 2020 to fund innovation procurement.</p><p>  While there has been no Irish participation to date in FP7 ICT PCP projects, there are some PCP topics within the current ICT call and there is evidence of some interest by Irish academia in exploring the feasibility of involvement with a PCP in the technology-enhanced learning area.</p></reply>

During the same period, there were two Enterprise Ireland investment announcements with the potential to create 41 jobs and nine High Potential Start Up (HPSU) projects announced for county Kerry.  For reasons of commercial sensitivity, it is not possible to give details of the job potential of these HPSU projects.  </p><p>  At the end of 2012 there were 12 IDA Ireland supported companies in Kerry employing 1,600 people, while Enterprise Ireland had 132 client companies in the county employing 3,318 people. </p><p>  In relation to the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to County Kerry, IDA Ireland has indicated that the challenge it faces is to continue to win top quality investment for Ireland in a very challenging global environment. International competition for FDI has become extremely intense and continues to increase.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world class physical and digital infrastructure as well as the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services.  IDA Ireland, however, tries to influence these choices by prioritising the marketing of Gateway locations within each Region as the locations of critical mass with sufficient scale of population, skills, infrastructure, companies, business services, etc. and highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.  With continuing enhancement and improvements in physical and digital infrastructure, an FDI project secured for one Gateway can have a positive impact on other Gateways and their surrounding areas. It must be acknowledged, however, that the decision on where a client company will locate a new FDI investment is ultimately made by the senior managers of the companies involved.</p><p>  I am mindful of the concerns that have been expressed by Deputies on all sides of the House about the relatively low level of site visits to certain regional locations and have raised this matter with the CEO of IDA Ireland with a view to exploring what further initiatives can be taken to influence potential investors to invest in such locations. </p><p>  I am mindful, also, that in order to ensure that Ireland can continue to compete globally for foreign direct investment, it will be necessary to undertake an in depth analysis of our FDI strategy with a view to informing the formulation of an appropriate strategy for the period post 2014, when IDA Ireland&rsquo;s current strategy is implemented. This analysis, which will be undertaken later this year, will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI, any changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid rules that may be introduced in the near future and our agreed approach to regional development. </p><p>  Notwithstanding these challenges, IDA Ireland has assured me that it will in 2013, in accordance with the Government&rsquo;s 2013 Action Plan for Jobs, seek to target more than 130 new investments, secure &euro;500 million of R&amp;D expenditure and create 13,000 new jobs in its client companies.</p></reply>

Ireland, in common with 12 other Member States including Germany and the United Kingdom, chose not to give effect to this option.  Accordingly, it is not unlawful per se for traders in Ireland to impose charges on consumers for the use of a particular method of payment.</p><p>  Article 19 of Directive 2011/83/EU provides that Member States &lsquo;shall prohibit traders from charging consumers in respect of the use of a given means of payment, fees that exceed the cost borne by the trader for the use of such means.&rsquo; Though this Article does not prohibit payment charges as such, it aims to ensure that such charges reflect the real cost of payment instruments to the trader and are not used as a source of additional revenue.  </p><p>  Shortly after the adoption of the Directive, I stated my intention to give early effect to the provisions of Article 19 and Article 22. To this end, my Department issued the consultation paper on the implementation of the two Articles referred to above. One of the issues raised by the consultation has required my Department to seek legal advice from the Attorney General's Office and the European Commission. My Department has recently received the opinion of the European Commission and expects to receive the advice of the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office in the near future. On receipt of this advice, I will assess, and decide upon, the options relating to the transposition and application of Articles 19 and 22.   </p></reply>

The closing date for receipt of submissions was originally 19th December 2012 but this was extended to 18th January 2013, because of the level of interest. A total of 88 submissions were received and these responses will inform and influence the final shape of the LEOs and the services that the LEOs will provide. Many of the submissions make positive suggestions on how the reform could be rolled out effectively across a range of issues. These responses are currently being examined, including the positive response from the Crafts Council of Ireland, and will be factored into shaping the operational scope of the LEOs.  </p><p>  All submissions received will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website on completion of the review and distillation of the huge response.</p><p>  The Crafts sector plays an important role in sustainable job creation across the country.  Taken nationally the crafts industry is a significant employer and it is estimated that the sector employs over 5,770 people.  Both Minister Perry and I view the reform as an important opportunity to get a combined effort in behind start-ups and small business and we shall vigorously work to harness the potential of the new model.</p></reply>

I have made enquiries of IDA Ireland and I have been informed that, during 2010, a Business Process Transformation Initiative was conducted by the Agency.  This initiative examined every role in the organisation for the purpose of highlighting operational changes that could be implemented to enhance delivery of key objectives; identifying areas of duplication that could be addressed by improved processes; as well as identifying areas where there was scope to introduce enhanced IT systems, thus giving the agency greater flexibility to relocate staff to client facing functions.</p><p>  Following that process, I understand that IDA Ireland retains two offices in the North East Region &ndash; an office in Cavan, with one full time role concentrating on client facing activities and an office in Dundalk, with one client facing role and one part time support role.  In 2011 and 2012 there has been a net gain of 378 jobs in IDA companies in the North East, compared to a net loss of 733 in the period 2008 - 2010.</p><p>  At the end of 2012 there were 34 IDA Ireland supported companies employing 3,211 people in IDA&rsquo;s North East Region, which consists of the counties of Cavan, Monaghan and Louth.  In addition, there have been some very significant investments announced for the region in the last 12 months.  In February 2012 Pay Pal announced the creation of 1,000 jobs in Dundalk over a four year period.  This was followed in October with the announcement by Yapstone of the creation of 120 new jobs at its new EMEA HQ in Drogheda, while earlier this month, EBay announced its intention to create 450 jobs in its operating centre in Dundalk.  These investments, along with the existing base of overseas companies located in the Region, will contribute to the economic development of the Region as a whole.</p></reply>

I am not in a position to reverse this decision.  While the Comprehensive Expenditure Review, 2012 to 2014, published in December 2011, provided for a reduction of a further &euro;540 million in expenditure by my Department in 2013, the Government was able to reduce the net savings required for this year to &euro;390 million.  This was &euro;150 million less than originally indicated.  This enabled the Government to ensure, for the second year in a row, that there was no reduction in primary weekly rates of payment.</p><p>  In 2013, the Department will spend almost &euro;20.3 billion on the wide range of schemes and services it operates.  Carers receive significant income supports from the Department, among the highest rates of income support in Europe.  Carers receive additional support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care), and the annual respite care grant in respect of each person for whom they care.  Such an annual payment, in a single lump sum with no requirement to satisfy a means test, is not available for any other group nor is there an equivalent payment for carers in any other country in Europe.  If a person is getting certain qualifying social welfare payments and also providing full time care and attention to another person, they can keep their main social welfare payment and get the half-rate carer's allowance as well.  They can also receive an extra half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance if they care for more than one person.</p><p>  The current rate of the respite care grant (&euro;1,375) remains significantly higher, and still more than double what it was in 2002 (&euro;635).  Expenditure on the grant has increased by 290% since 2005 from &euro;34.3 million to &euro;135 million in 2012.</p><p>  In relation to the next budget, the Deputy will be aware that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's Expenditure Report 2013 published by Government last December provides for additional new expenditure reduction measures of &euro;440 million to be achieved in 2014 in the Department of Social Protection budget.  Reducing overall expenditure in 2014 in line with this target will be very challenging.  No decisions have been made at this stage as to how these targets will be met.  The Government will consider this having regard to all of its commitments.</p></reply>

The scheme was closed to new applications with effect from 2 January, 1997, when the one-parent family payment (OFP) scheme was introduced.  Thereafter, both lone parents and deserted wives came to be supported under the OFP scheme.  Some women have continued to get the DWA because they qualified for the payment before the 2 January 1997 cut-off date and because they have continued to satisfy the following conditions to retain entitlement to the payment: be aged over 40 years with no qualified children; satisfy a means test; be inadequately maintained by their husband; not be co-habiting with any person; continue to make appropriate efforts to obtain financial maintenance from their husband; and have not resumed living with, or re-married, their husband.</p><p>  328 recipients are in receipt of the DWA as of January, 2013 &ndash; down from 1,523 recipients in 2003.  Given that this payment is no longer available to new applicants, there are no plans to review these arrangements on the grounds that recipients of DWA are a decreasing cohort within the social welfare system and the payment will cease to exist over time.</p></reply>

The package is generally available to people living in the State who are over age 70, carers who live with the person for whom they care and those under age 70 who are in receipt of certain qualifying social welfare payments and who live alone or only with certain excepted people.  &ldquo;Excepted people&rdquo; include, inter alia, dependent children, carers or people in need of full time care and attention.</p><p>  The package is currently paid to over 415,000 customers and will cost an estimated &euro;284 million in 2013.  The objective of the scheme is to provide additional support for those who are elderly or live alone.  Where a number of people in a household are receiving social welfare payments it is considered that it may not be appropriate to provide additional supports through the household benefits scheme.  I would not regard this as an anomaly but as a targeting of a scheme to particularly vulnerable groups.  I have no plans to amend the qualifying conditions for this scheme.</p></reply>

Humanitarian Aid payments were made, both in the immediate aftermath of the flooding and subsequently to enable eligible households to resume living at their home.  Subject to certain conditions the Government also decided to provide support to a small number of families who are continuing to experience significant housing problems as a result of the November 2009 flooding and are considering the possibility of relocating rather than resuming living at their original home.  The legal agreement necessary for the purpose of this scheme was the subject of much detailed discussion and negotiations between this Department, the Office of Public Works (OPW)  and the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office (CSSO).  The agreement was finalised and issued to the householders on 5 December 2012.</p><p>  In view of the legal obligations attaching to the payment of monies in respect of relocation assistance, householders have been advised to seek legal advice prior to signing the agreements.  A number of documents, including signed legal agreements, have recently been received from the person concerned and are being considered in the Department in consultation with the Department&rsquo;s legal advisors.  The Department will be in further contact with the person concerned when these matters have been finalised.

The sustainability of the pension system is a particular concern because of the demographic challenges Ireland faces, the associated increases in pension (and other age related) costs, and the deterioration in the public finances.  This means that, in the future, the task of financing increased pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the population as demographic projections indicate the ratio of working age to older people will decrease from 5.3 to 1 at present to 2.1 to 1 by 2060.  Life expectancy in Ireland is also increasing and whilst this is very welcome development, it also presents very real and obvious public policy challenges. </p><p>  Discussions on long term pension policy identified the need for a short and focussed examination on the direction of policy to ensure a modern, sustainable, and adequate pension system taking into account the impact of the economic downturn.  It was in this regard that the OECD was commissioned to review long term pension policy in Ireland.  </p><p>  The particular aspects being considered by the OECD include:</p><p>- the sustainability of the pension system in the light of demographic and investment challenges;</p><p>- the adequacy and coverage levels, in order to ensure adequate income in retirement with a particular focus on the lower and middle income group;</p><p>- the modernity of pension systems to ensure flexibility in the labour market and supporting mechanisms for longer working;</p><p>- equity within the pension system.</p><p>  The review was initiated in April 2012. Since then, the OECD has engaged extensively with a range of Government departments, the social partners, older groups and representatives from the pensions industry.  A consultation forum including a wide range of stakeholders was held in Farmleigh House in September 2012. </p><p>  It is anticipated that the final OECD report, which will be used to inform government decisions in this area, will be presented to me in the coming weeks. Following consideration, I will then bring the report to Government before publishing it.</p></reply>

To this end, the Department&#8217;s commitments under the Government strategy document <i>eGovernment 2012-2015 </i>were published by the Department of Public Expenditure &amp; Reform on 23<sup>rd</sup> January 2013 on the eGovernment reporting website .</p><p>  The Department&#8217;s eGovernment plans reflect the major programme of business, organisational and technological change underway as it transforms from a passive transaction focused model of income support to a proactive model which is customer centric and progressive.  Fundamental to this is developing customer contact channels that maximise customer service and minimise cost of delivery, including online services. </p><p>  Visits to the Department&#8217;s website have increased from 3.2 million visits in 2010 to 4 million visits in 2011, and some 5 million visits in 2012.

The new website reflects the extended role and functions of the Department which now includes the Rural Social Scheme and Community Services programme, the Redundancy and Insolvency Payments schemes, the Community Welfare Service and, most notably, the Employment Service programmes.  Extensive information on social protection schemes and services is provided on  and the website will continue to be updated as schemes and services change. </p><p>  There are a range of online services available on .

There is no automatic entitlement to a payment.  ENPs are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  The Government has provided &euro;47.6m for the scheme in 2013.  </p><p>  A review of the guidelines on exceptional needs payments was carried out by the Department by a working group made up of former community welfare service staff.  One of the recommendations emanating from this review is to address the different approaches taken, in different areas, in relation to the payment of ENPs in respect of religious ceremonies, mainly Communions and Confirmations and to ensure that the SWA scheme is responding to financial need and not occasions.</p><p>  For 2013, the Department has recommended that payment of the allowance specifically in respect of religious ceremonies will cease.  Applications can continue to be made under the scheme for assistance with child clothing. </p><p>  I have no plans to reverse this position as these measures will ensure that the ENP Scheme will continue to respond to specific need and not to the occasion.</p><p>  Persons who consider that they have an entitlement to an ENP under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme should contact the local officials administering the scheme.</p></reply>

VAT) have been awarded for Phase I and Phase II works.  These first two phases were required to safeguard the structural integrity and to create the optimal internal layout of the House in preparation for the full restoration works.  Phase I was completed early last year and Phase II is due to be completed this week.</p><p>  The next phases of works will include the full refurbishment of the main building; the construction of a new extension; the exhibition fit-out; and extensive landscaping and other works to the ornamental grounds and gardens.  Planning permission has already been granted for works to the ornamental grounds and gardens.  I am advised that a planning application for the major element of the House restoration project is being finalised by OPW at present.

In this regard, my Department conducted a critical examination of the structure and operation of the bodies included in the Public Service Reform Plan and developed a comprehensive and practical approach to the implementation of the various Government Decisions in this area, which was endorsed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  </p><p>  Summary documents which outline the main outcomes of this examination in relation to the relevant bodies and institutions have been published on my Department's website.</p><p>  The Deputy should note that savings of &euro;20 million in enhanced service efficiencies and value-for-money were targeted in the Public Service Reform Plan.  In this context, it is expected that savings in the region of approximately &euro;1m will be made initially across the institutions involved in the reform programme which are funded from my Department's Vote Group.    </p><p>  Savings are being made primarily in three key ways:</p><p>- Ending of payments to chairpersons and members of boards or advisory councils &ndash; it is expected that approximately &euro;300,000 will be saved in this regard.</p><p>- Implementation of a programme of shared services between institutions, including, for example, in retail, security, marketing, procurement and storage &ndash; it is expected that approximately &euro;150,000 per annum will be achieved.</p><p>- Provision of services by my Department to some institutions, including human resources services and financial services, thereby relieving those institutions of the need to incur a cost in accessing these services &ndash; creating estimated savings of &euro;550,000.</p><p>  My Department is working closely with the Directors of the relevant institutions and bodies to progress the reform programme and real progress is being made across all the bodies concerned.</p></reply>

The Government remains fully committed to the implementation of those Agreements, including the provisions relating to the Irish language.  All parties to the Good Friday Agreement recognised the importance of respect, understanding and tolerance in relation to linguistic diversity, including in Northern Ireland, the Irish language and the languages of the various ethnic communities, as part of the cultural wealth of the island of Ireland.  Under that Agreement, the British government committed to a range of measures to promote the Irish language and to facilitate and encourage its use in public and private life, where there is appropriate demand.  In the St. Andrews Agreement, the British Government committed to introducing an Irish Language Act reflecting on the experience of Wales and Ireland and to working with the Northern Ireland Executive to enhance and protect the development of the Irish language.  Since the restoration of the devolved institutions on 8 May 2007, the question of an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland is a devolved matter and is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive. </p><p>  In terms of recent developments, I should mention that my counterpart, the Northern Ireland Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Ms Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n, MLA, launched a public consultation process in 2012 on a draft <i>Strategy for protecting and enhancing the development of the Irish language</i> in Northern Ireland.  This public consultation process ended on 27 November 2012.  I understand that the development of such a Strategy is a commitment in the Northern Ireland Executive's <i>Programme for Government 2011-2015</i>  .</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that matters relating to the Irish language are discussed regularly at meetings with Minister N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n and her Department, and indeed within the context of the North South Ministerial Council meeting in language sectoral format.  The next such meeting of the Council is due to take place on 6 March 2013.</p></reply>

IFI actively promotes the potential of our inland fisheries resource, and on its establishment in 2010, set up a Business Development Division to further develop the potential of the inland fisheries sector with a special interest in promoting the tourism potential of the sector. IFI also works with Tourism Ireland to promote angling tourism.</p><p>  The following promotional activities are undertaken by IFI on a routine basis:</p><p>- Daily updates to the www.fishinginireland.info website with the latest information for anglers.  In 2012 80,000 referrals were made via the IFI website. Frequent updates to FACEBOOK and Twitter. FACEBOOK currently provides a reach to 750,000 individuals.</p><p>- Weekly publication and circulation of the IFI online magazine Angling Ezine in providing information on the best angling available in Ireland to a very wide group.</p><p>- Up to 15 Trade Shows are attended by IFI annually in Ireland, UK, Germany, France, Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and the US promoting Ireland as a prime angling tourism destination. </p><p>  In addition, IFI has produced a number of new angling guides, maps and leaflets, reprinted a number of guides and produced high quality promotional material. The most recent of these published are: </p><p>- Mayo Game Angling Guide</p><p>- Sligo Game Angling Guide</p><p>- Boyne Valley Angling Guide</p><p>- Lough O&rsquo;Flynn &amp; River Suck Angling Guide</p><p>- South West Angling Guide</p><p>  Guides are produced in hard copy and electronically and a number are available in French and or German. Staff in IFI support visiting angling journalists, up to 30 a year, in promoting the best of Irish angling through various articles and blogs in Irish, UK, European and US Press. </p><p>  In 2012 IFI commissioned a major survey of recreational angling in Ireland.  This important research focuses on domestic and overseas anglers, fish species of interest, estimates of expenditure and other data with a view to improving the quality of angling and to benchmark the Irish angling experience against competitor destinations. </p><p>  In addition IFI will shortly launch a revamped website and an angling App which will provide information on angling resources nationwide.  IFI also operates a pilot sponsorship programme and a large variety of events have been sponsored including major competitions such as the World Pairs, The Rosslare Small Boats Competition, The Dutch King of Clubs and the upcoming World Youth Fly Fishing Championship.  These events bring hundreds of visitors to Ireland. </p><p>  In addition to these direct measures, IFI is working with my Department on a major project to modernise, consolidate and simplify the law pertaining to inland fisheries, which is well advanced and which will serve the sector well into the future.  The review of legislation will go to public consultation in the near future.  A key overriding objective of this project is to put in place the legislative basis to allow IFI to develop the potential of the sector, mainly by increasing the number of anglers utilising the resource, empowering stakeholders to take an active role in the development of the resource and to maximise the returns from the inland fisheries resource to local communities and the State. </p></reply>

He is also understood to have indicated that there should be no further fracking until certain questions are answered and gaps in knowledge and legislation are addressed.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, as I have made it clear on a number of occasions, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has commenced a process to issue a public call inviting interested parties to tender for the offer of funding from both the EPA Strive Programme and my Department to conduct detailed research on the use of Unconventional Gas Exploration and Extraction in Ireland, in particular with regard to the use of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) technology.  The study follows on from the preliminary research into the environmental aspects of shale gas extraction, conducted by the University of Aberdeen, which was published by the EPA in May 2012.</p><p>  The proposed terms of reference for this study, which includes consideration of the regulatory approaches of other countries that have extensive experience with this activity, have been developed and are currently the subject of a Public Consultation Process, which was launched on 11 January 2013.  Interested parties have been invited to submit written comments by 8 March 2013.  Further details are available from the EPA website (www.epa.ie).  The final results of this study are expected in early 2015.</p><p>  As I have confirmed to the House on a number of previous occasions, no decision will be made on any proposal for the use of hydraulic fracturing in exploration drilling in Ireland until there has been time to consider the outcome of this further EPA research.</p></reply>

Details of broadband services available on a county-by-county basis can be found on the website of the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) at www.callcosts.ie.</p><p>  The Government has undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where operators have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.</p><p>  The State only becomes involved in the provision of services in instances of clear market failure, such as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS).  My Department entered into a contract in late 2008 with Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd (&ldquo;3&rdquo;) for the delivery of the NBS.  The Scheme offers a basic broadband service, in line with EU State aid clearance, to fixed residences and businesses located within certain designated Electoral Divisions.  In County Mayo, NBS services are available within 112 of its 154 Electoral Divisions.  The general area of Kilmovee was excluded from the NBS since at the time of mapping exercise carried out prior to the launch of the Scheme it was found to be served.  The NBS is prohibited under State Aid and competition rules from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.</p><p>  The RBS was launched in 2011 in recognition of the fact that despite the widespread availability of broadband throughout Ireland, there still remained individual premises that were unable to receive broadband provision.  This Scheme was aimed at making a basic broadband service available to un-served premises in rural areas, not already covered by the NBS.  Commercial service providers were in a position to offer services to all applicants from County Mayo under the Scheme who agreed to engage with them.</p><p>  In addition to consumer services, State-funded Metropolitan Area Networks which provide high capacity fibre connectivity for businesses and telecoms operators in the regions are located in Ballina, Ballinrobe, Belmullet, Claremorris, Kiltimagh and Knock in County Mayo.</p><p>  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013, and the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>  Specifically, it commits to:</p><p>- 70Mbps to 100Mbps available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015,</p><p>- At least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% and potentially as much as 35% of the population, and </p><p>- A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country.</p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The commercial sector is already making these investments in high speed services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.</p><p>  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.  It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aid application in respect of any State-led intervention. </p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and business can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p><p>  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including County Mayo, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity. </p></reply>

The Government endorses this major investment programme currently underway in the high voltage electricity transmission system.  Grid25 is the most important investment in Ireland&rsquo;s transmission system for several generations and will position our energy system for decades to come.</p><p>  The transmission system in Ireland, managed and operated by EirGrid, consists of three voltage levels of high capacity lines.  It is operated at 400 kV, 220 kV and 110 kV.</p><p>  In 2012 significant progress was made in a number of Grid25 regions in relation to construction, uprating and refurbishment of over 200km of existing circuits and there is currently 2000 megawatts of wind power installed on the Island of Ireland.</p><p>  Significant progress has been made on the Grid West project since it was launched in May 2012 and extensive public consultation has occurred over the last 9 months.  The project will be moving to a key stage in the coming weeks with the publication of the Stage 1 Report which will indicate a number of potential corridors that can accommodate this new transmission line following all the information on the study area gathered today. EirGrid is encouraging anyone with an interest in the project to participate in the upcoming consultation. </p><p>  The Grid West project will initially consist of a new high capacity power line, but based on the region&rsquo;s renewable potential, it is envisaged that in time, a second line will be required.  The pace of installation of the second line is dependent on a number of factors including the speed at which further renewable energy generation is developed in the region. </p><p>  EirGrid is also developing a West Galway project consisting of a new 110kV electricity substation to allow renewable generation to connect to the transmission grid. The project calls for a new electrical substation to connect into a planned 110kV distribution line running from Salthill to Screeb, County Galway.  The project will increase security of energy supply to the region and enable Galway to be a net exporter of renewable energy.  A planning application is expected to be submitted shortly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. </p><p>  From the south west to the north west of Ireland, to meet requirements of customers and generators, EirGrid is currently upgrading and developing new high capacity lines and stations, many of which have recently obtained planning permission.  Where possible, EirGrid aims to maximise existing network to accommodate increased line capacity. </p><p>  Jointly with NIE (Northern Ireland Electricity), EirGrid is progressing the RIDP project (Renewable Integration Development Project) aimed at facilitating the development of renewable energy in Donegal and Northern Ireland. </p><p>  EirGrid is constantly reviewing grid development requirements and produces information to inform market participants, customers, and policy makers regarding the generation capacity required to achieve an adequate supply and demand balance across Ireland. </p><p>EirGrid has published its plans to upgrade and develop extensively the transmission system in Ireland, and has recently undertaken a briefing for all Oireachtas members with regard to progress made on Grid25.  EirGrid would be happy to meet with any members of the Oireachtas in relation to any aspects of Grid25.  </p></reply>

This will determine whether it is beneficial for both countries to enter into an Inter-Governmental Agreement under the Renewable Energy Directive to provide for renewable energy trading.</p><p>  If an Inter-Governmental Agreement is entered into, there are potential significant employment opportunities.  As an example, employment creation arising from 3,000MW of new renewable wind generation would be expected to be in the order of 3,000 to 6,000 job years in the construction phase, with the actual number dependent on the construction schedule to 2020.  There would also be additional jobs created in the ongoing maintenance of turbines over a 20-year operating life.</p><p>  Further employment opportunities could arise if turbines or components were to be manufactured in Ireland.  Policy certainly is important in that regard.  Additionally, all relevant State agencies, particularly in the enterprise area, would have to coordinate their activities early in the process to ensure employment potential of export projects is maximised.  This opportunity has already been identified by the IDA and Enterprise Ireland in their clean technology growth strategies.  Accordingly it would be a matter in the first instance for these Agencies to pursue the potential enterprise opportunities arising for the State in the area of turbine or component manufacturing.</p></reply>

In Ireland and across Europe, the digital economy is considered to be a key enabler for stability, jobs, growth and social inclusion.  For this reason, as chair of the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council, I have prioritised a number of initiatives that support the implementation of the Digital Single Market and the Digital Agenda for Europe.</p><p>  An important goal in this regard is to progress the legislative proposal for a pan-European electronic ID, authentication and signature framework.  This is a key enabler for a properly functioning EU digital market.  The proposed regulation is technically complex and Ireland aims to comprehensively address the many important concerns raised by Member States during its Presidency with a view to producing a comprehensive Progress Report for Council next June.</p><p>  In tandem with this initiative, Ireland has prioritised the delivery of measures to enhance trust in online services.  Trust and security in online transactions is essential so that both consumers and businesses can make secure, simple and inexpensive online transactions.  As Presidency, Ireland is therefore seeking to deliver real progress on the recently published proposals for a comprehensive EU Cyber Security Strategy as well as legislation relating to network and information security.</p><p>  These cyber security proposals will build on earlier initiatives to enhance trust and security. Earlier this month, the Irish Presidency negotiated the first agreement under the Irish Presidency on a renewed mandate for the workings of the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA).</p><p>  The rollout of advanced high speed broadband is a key priority across Europe and another important pillar of the Digital Agenda for Europe. In Ireland, we have published a National Broadband Plan which aims to deliver early on some of the key targets under the Digital Agenda for Europe.  As Presidency we await with interest, proposals from the Commission in relation to reducing the cost of high speed broadband rollout which we believe will resonate with some of the actions identified in Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, and on which we hope to commence dialogue during our Presidency. </p><p>  All of these initiatives are designed to improve and encourage access for citizens, communities and business, thus enabling a more digitally empowered society and creating opportunities for growth.  The proposed Directive on the Re-use of Public Sector Information, is aimed at creating such opportunities and Ireland hopes to shortly conclude an agreement with the European Parliament on this issue.  The Directive allows for increased availability of public sector information which can be re-used for commercial and non-commercial purposes.</p><p>  Making information more widely accessible across society is also a key objective and under Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency, the Council has started examining legislative proposals on the accessibility of public sector websites.</p><p>  The recent MFF negotiations significantly impacted on the financial envelope available to the telecoms element of the Connecting Europe Facility.  The telecoms Working Party will consider the most appropriate way forward on this initiative once the vote of the European Parliament on the budget is known.</p><p>  Finally, the Digital Agenda Assembly will be held in Dublin next June.  My officials are working closely with the Commission to shape the event which will emphasise digital skills and entrepreneurship.  The theme of the event will be heavily influenced by the recently published mid-term review of the Digital Agenda which highlighted the fact that ICT can contribute to a paradigm shift in society and economic activity through more efficiency, new products and services and smarter public services.  </p></reply>

However, it should be borne in mind that these stations were founded as commercial operations, with the profit motive as their primary objective.</p><p>  Station owners sought and accepted licences on clear terms; terms which included a limited amount of &lsquo;public service&rsquo; type content.  Moreover, in many cases, their success in the licence application process was assisted by the voluntary commitments they gave in regard to the provision of public service type content, over and above that required by the relevant legislation.  The licences were accepted in full knowledge of the current system of public funding.  The fact that some of these stations are now undergoing an understandable degree of financial stress does not mean that the State should immediately step in and provide funding &ndash; they are and remain commercial enterprises.</p><p>  Moreover, it should also be noted that their very popularity in the communities they serve is, in many cases, as a distinct result of the local news content and current affairs type programming that they provide and which, in turn, gives them a strong advertising presence and thus earning potential.</p><p>  The rationale for providing State funding for the Public Service Broadcasters is to provide an independent and reliable income flow that allows these corporations to attain their public service objects while ensuring they can maintain editorial independence.  This is especially important in the context of news and current affairs.</p><p>  The overall aim of Public Service Broadcasting is to provide services and content which cater for all interests in society, while ensuring that the varied elements of Irish culture and its intrinsic values are protected.  Through the obligations placed on the Public Service Broadcasters, which are established in legislation passed by the Oireachtas, and the criteria set for the funding of content through the Sound &amp; Vision Scheme, the production of quality indigenous programming and the production of minority interest programming is strongly promoted.</p><p>  I am, of course, willing to consider proposals from other broadcasting organisations in relation to the future distribution of funding.  However, I have to be convinced that the distribution of public funds to independent commercial broadcasters represents a sound proposition in terms of policy for the sector.</p><p>  Also, I would like to clarify that, even if I were minded to provide public monies to private investors, as the Deputy seems to be suggesting, EU State Aid rules very definitely apply.</p><p>  It is categorically not possible for the State to simply decide to fund a set of incumbent licence holders during a licence period.  Such a move, quite apart from the reaction of the European authorities, would expose the State to the risk of prosecution from other operators who may have considered applying for a licence were the revenue stream available.</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the Programme for Government commits to review the funding of independent broadcasters to ensure a healthy broadcasting environment in Ireland and work is ongoing in this regard.  In line with its legislative obligations, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) is currently undertaking a review of the adequacy or otherwise of the public funding provided to the public service broadcasters.  In this context, I have asked the BAI to consider as part of this review the potential impacts to these broadcasters if television licence receipts were further distributed to the independent broadcasting sector.</p></reply>

The Government has undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where operators have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.  In this connection, my Department provides a range of information on its website in relation to the provision of broadband </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s telecommunications market has been liberalised since 1999 and since then has developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available on a County-by-County basis can be found on the website of the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) at www.callcosts.ie.</p><p>  The State only becomes involved in the provision of services in instances of clear market failure, such as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS).  Prior to the commencement of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) a detailed mapping exercise was carried out to determine those areas that would be included in the Scheme and those which, by virtue of being already substantially served by existing broadband suppliers, could not be included.  Under EU State aid and competition rules, the NBS is restricted to providing a basic service and is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.  In County Longford, NBS services are available within 11 of its 55 Electoral Divisions, details of which can be found are on my Department&rsquo;s website at .</p><p>  The Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS) was launched in 2011 in recognition of the fact that despite the widespread availability of broadband throughout Ireland, there still remained individual premises that were unable to receive broadband provision.  This Scheme, which is now closed, was aimed at making a basic broadband service available to un-served premises in rural areas, not already covered by the NBS.  Commercial service providers were in a position to offer services to all applicants from County Longford under the Scheme who agreed to engage with them.  Relevant details in relation to County Longford can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link </p><p>.</p><p>  In addition to consumer services, a State-funded Metropolitan Area Network, which provides high capacity fibre connectivity for businesses and telecoms operators in the region, is located in Longford town.  Under the 100Mbps broadband to post-primary schools project, which is jointly funded by my Department and the Department of Education and Skills (DES), the nine second level schools in County Longford have been connected.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  Ireland is now therefore moving to a new phase of public and private sector investment in broadband in Ireland which will see significantly improved speeds delivered across the country.</p><p>  The National Broadband Plan commits the Government to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  This will ensure that citizens or businesses, wherever they are located, have a broadband connection which meets their needs to interact effectively with society and business in a global digital environment.</p><p>I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to in the Plan, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including County Longford, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.</p></reply>

There is no price control and it is Government policy to encourage price competition and consumer choice. </p><p>  The upward trend in petrol and diesel prices arises primarily from increases in international commodity prices over which Ireland has no control.  For example, the benchmark spot price of a barrel of Brent Crude Oil has risen from an average of US$43 in February 2009 to an average of US$117 in February 2013.  This has inevitably resulted in an increase in retail petrol and diesel prices.</p><p>  Previous surveys have shown that prices charged by Irish retailers for oil products relate to the refinery price rather than to the price of crude oil.  Prices at the pump reflect volatile market prices, transportation costs, trends in euro/dollar exchange rates and other operating costs, together with the impact of taxation on oil products.</p><p>  The EU Market Observatory publishes an Oil Bulletin with current and historical oil product prices for all EU countries.</p><p>  As of February 11th 2013, the price of petrol in Ireland was marginally below the EU average; while the price of diesel was 4.8% higher than the EU average.</p><p>  If duties and taxes are stripped out then the price of petrol in Ireland was 98.5% of the EU average; and the price of diesel was less than 1% higher than the EU average.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about high oil prices are shared at EU level and fellow Member Countries of the International Energy Agency (IEA).  The EU and IEA agree that high fossil fuel prices, which pose a threat to economic recovery, underline the need to reduce dependence on fossil fuels by radically enhanced energy efficiency measures and the development of renewable energy.</p><p>  The Biofuel Obligation Scheme incentivises and enables the sustainable growth of an Irish biofuels market. The Scheme currently requires that the amount of biofuel brought to the market is not less than 6.38% of petroleum road transport fuels.  In 2011 some 145 million litres of biofuel were brought to the Irish market.</p><p>  The development of electric vehicles offers potential for Ireland to use cheaper grid sourced electricity, an increasing amount of which is sourced from renewable resources.</p><p>These opportunities will progressively reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels for transport, while supporting energy competitiveness and security.</p></reply>

The most recent telecommunications data report by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), reveals that the number of broadband subscribers has more than doubled to over 1.6 million between 2007 and  2012.  Similarly, in the case of speeds, the number of residential customers contracted in a range between 2 &ndash; 10 Mbps  increased from 41% of all subscribers in 2007 to 71% in 2012. The number of subscribers accessing speeds exceeding 10 Mbps increased from 0.2% to 24%.</p><p>  EU and international comparisons of broadband services are complex to measure and interpret. For example, OECD surveys calculate an average of all advertised broadband speeds. The average speed reduces if there is a significant choice of products advertised at these lower speeds. In addition OECD calculations do not differentiate between services that are available nationally and services which are available in selected areas. Similarly, EU Commission statistics published on its digital scoreboard website, compare advertised versus actual speeds and are based on 2011 data. Comparisons between countries do not take account of distinct geographical and demographic challenges that face countries such as Ireland where the population is highly dispersed. </p><p>  EU Commission statistics, published on its digital scoreboard website, which compare advertised broadband speeds across the EU notes that  84% of subscribers in Ireland access speeds in a range between 2-10 Mbps compared to the EU average of 87% in this range.  In the case of speeds at or exceeding 10 Mbps, the EU Commission reports 29% availability over fixed lines in Ireland compared to an EU average of 48%. In the most recently available OECD data, Ireland&rsquo;s penetration is ranked 13th in terms of wireless connections and 25th   in terms of fixed line connections. The average speed reported by OECD for Ireland is 23 Mbps compared to an OECD average closer to 45 Mbps. Other international studies rank Ireland well in terms of actual speeds experienced by users. </p><p>  The more recent ComReg report notes an overall trend of customers contracting at higher speeds.  The proportion of customers contracting at or below 2 Mbps fell from 7% - to 5% of all subscriptions between 2011 and 2012. Increasingly, subscribers are contracting at speeds in excess of 10Mbps. </p><p>  Recent market developments are dramatically changing the landscape of high speed broadband provision in Ireland. During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The commercial sector is already committed to investments of the order of some &euro;1bn and is accelerating its investment to deliver broadband speeds of 30Mbps to 150Mbps to homes and businesses.  For example:</p><p>- Eircom is currently investing up to &euro;500m in a phased deployment of fibre to the cabinet infrastructure, which is planned to make high-speed broadband available to some 1.2m premises.  The network has already reached more than 230,000 premises and is expected to be launched over the coming months;</p><p>- UPC is investing &euro;500m in its cable and fibre network, which is delivering speeds of up to 150Mbps.  UPC aims to have this service available to 700,000 homes by 2015;</p><p>- Mobile telecommunications operators will be rolling out advanced mobile broadband products in 2013, following the recent multi-band spectrum auction. </p><p>  The National Broadband Plan commits the Government to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.  It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aid application in respect of any State-led intervention. </p><p>  This will ensure that citizens or businesses, wherever they are located, have a broadband connection which meets their needs to interact effectively with society and business.</p></reply>

It is the case however, that Ireland in the main, is at the mercy of international fossil fuel prices which dictate the retail price of electricity and gas, which is the key factor in the retail price of both electricity and gas. In particular, Ireland is a price taker for gas.  Global gas and oil prices have risen sharply since the start of 2011 driven by events in the Middle East, North Africa and Japan and demand from emerging economies of China and India.  There are clear indications that international oil and gas prices will rise further over the coming months.  The Government remains firmly committed to increasing competition as the best means of exerting downward pressure on energy prices, and also towards ensuring diversity of energy supply to reduce our exposure to high and volatile external energy prices.  This dependence on imported gas also underlines the need to promote and invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency.</p><p>  Effective procurement of energy services can also lead to significant organisational savings. My Department is working closely with private and public stakeholders on a National Energy Performance Contracting Policy Framework (the Framework) to help companies procure energy-related services including energy efficiency retrofits, energy supply and behavioural improvements. Recent experience from programmes run by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland demonstrates the substantial monetary benefits that good procurement can deliver. I expect to be in a position to publish the draft Framework within the next two months.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s demand for gas is met almost entirely by imports across the gas interconnectors from Great Britain.  The vast bulk of UK gas demand is currently being met by indigenous North Sea production and imports from Norway.  Through the gas interconnectors Ireland has access to diverse sources of supply including UK indigenous production, Norwegian production and physical interconnection with mainland Europe.  It is prudent, in light of Ireland&rsquo;s dependence on gas imported from the UK, to work to reduce our reliance on this source.  Bringing Corrib gas production on stream will further reduce our reliance on imports. </p><p>  The European Commission recognises that Europe needs an internal energy market that is competitive and integrated with electricity and gas flowing where and when it is needed.  The EU aims to fully integrate national energy markets to give consumers and businesses more and better products and services, more competition, and more secure supplies.  In this regard I welcome the recent progress made on the SEM Market Integration Project, within the context that implementing the European Target Model is a positive development that will bring significant benefits to the consumers and producers of electricity on the island of Ireland.  Of course actual physical cross border trading of electricity is only possibe to the extent that interconnectors can accommodate it and accordingly I welcome the recent completion of construction by EirGrid of the East West Interconnector(EWIC) a strategically vital infrastructure project.</p><p>  I presided, last Friday, over the European Energy Council as part of Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency and among the issues on the agenda was the Commission Communication on completion of the Internal Energy Market.  This work will feed into the preparation of concrete and operational Council Conclusions on the further steps necessary for completion of the Internal Energy Market which I am aiming to bring for adoption to the June Energy Council.  </p></reply>

Of that, 3,521MW is estimated to be met from onshore wind, 75MW from wave and tidal, 234MW of hydro generation and 274MW of biomass.</p><p>The First Progress Report on the NREAP also acknowledged that there had been some changes as regards technology compared to the published NREAP.  This Plan indicated a particular expected breakdown in the trajectory between onshore and offshore wind. The Government has, however, decided since, that in meeting our legal obligation to deliver the 2020 renewables target, onshore rather than offshore wind should be pursued in the first instance, in order to minimise any support scheme costs borne by electricity consumers.</p><p>Wave and tidal energy are still at the RD&amp;D stage of development.</p><p>As can be seen above, the lowest support scheme reference rates are those relating to onshore wind and onshore wind is expected to provide the greatest contribution towards achieving 40% renewable electricity by 2020.</p></reply>

Each Member State was required to have at least 10% renewable transport consumption by 2020 and was required to produce a National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP), setting out how the overall target would be achieved across the electricity, transport and heating sectors.</p><p>  Ireland set out in its NREAP that it intended to reach its target by 40% renewable electricity, 10% renewable transport and 12% renewable heating, which together amount to 16% of overall energy consumption in 2020. </p><p>  At the end of 2012, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) estimates that almost 19% of electricity consumption was from renewable sources.  The first progress report on the NREAP estimates that approximately 4000MW of installed renewable capacity is required in order to achieve our target.  We need approximately 2100MW of additional new renewable capacity to be installed in the period to 2020 to achieve 40% renewable electricity. </p><p>  This is a large amount of new generation and will be challenging to achieve. Significant new grid build and grid upgrade work is required in order to connect this large volume of new generation.  In addition, significant operational changes are required to grid operation to ensure that the grid is capable of absorbing this significant amount of new intermittent asynchronous renewable generation while ensuring system security and stability. </p><p>  While this will be challenging, EirGrid has launched a programme of work known as DS3 in order to manage the operational changes necessary to achieve 40% renewable electricity by 2020.  This requires an ability for the system to securely cater for 75% instantaneous penetration of wind generation (i.e. that at least 75% of our electricity consumption can be from wind at times when wind is available).  Currently the system limits this to 50% for operational and security reasons. Several operational and system changes are required to make this step change and it will be challenging, but work is underway to ensure that it is achievable. </p><p>  There is still an enormous amount of work and effort required to ensure that Ireland achieves the challenging legally binding target assigned under Directive 2009/28/EC. There is no intention to revise this upwards in the current circumstances.   </p></reply>

To date, these media have not been subject to a formal regulatory regime akin to that used to &lsquo;regulate&rsquo; traditional radio and television broadcast media, either in Ireland or in other jurisdictions.  There is a range of reasons for this, not least the rapidly evolving nature of the technologies involved, the sensitivities around regulating media and the multi-jurisdictional nature of the Internet.</p><p>  It is important to acknowledge the economic and social benefits that the widespread use of social media have brought to people, communities and to business.  However, some of the issues that have arisen as a consequence of this bear consideration.  These challenges include dealing with harassment and bullying online, as well as issues around defamation, data protection and even copyright.</p><p>  There has been a very considerable amount of discussion on these matters in the recent past at EU and Council of Europe level, in which my Department has been involved.  Indeed this matter is also the subject of a fundamental debate at EU and national level at present, a fact reflected by the recent decision of the Joint Oireachtas Committee to examine the issue.</p><p>  As Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, I have policy responsibility for providing a supportive legislative and regulatory environment to facilitate the development of high quality communications infrastructure and services.  However, I should highlight that I do not have sole responsibility for addressing as to how that infrastructure is used.  Responsibility, in the context of abuse over the Internet in particular, also sits with the Minister for Justice and Equality, and the executive agency of his Department, the Office for Internet Safety.</p><p>  It is clear that there are no simple answers to the challenges posed by the development and abuse of social media, not least because of the international basis of the services and because any possible policy responses fall across a range of Government Departments.  In recognition of this complexity my Department maintains open and regular contact with all Departments and State Agencies with responsibilities in this area.</p><p>  My Department also monitors international developments with a view to ensuring that domestic policy within its remit reflects best practice and that the regulatory framework is amended as necessary. In that regard, I look forward to the deliberations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications, and I also look forward to meeting the Committee on this subject.  </p></reply>

The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation for each property determined by the Valuation Office to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.   </p><p>  However, in recent years local authorities have been urged by my Department to exercise restraint or, where possible, to reduce commercial rates. Local authorities have responded well to such requests. The latest available figures indicate that ARVs for 2013 have decreased nationwide on average by 0.33% compared to 2012. This follows a similar decrease of 0.31% in 2012, 0.64% in 2011 and 0.62% in 2010.   </p><p>  I recognise that these are difficult economic times for many businesses and I am continuing to keep all matters relating to rates under regular consideration in my Department.   </p></reply>

Persons who are on the registers of Architects and Building Surveyors established in accordance with the Building Control Act 2007 or who are Chartered Engineers may sign the statutory certificates of compliance for designers and for assigned certifiers that will be introduced under the new regulations. Depending on their background and experience   , members of the Architects Alliance may qualify for consideration for inclusion on the register of Architects or on the register of Building Surveyors which, as indicated, would also enable them to sign the statutory certificates being introduced under the new regulations. The new regulations will provide for a transition period of 12 months which will, among other things, give sufficient time for eligible persons who have not already done so to apply for registration. The transition period will also provide for a smooth transition to the new requirements in terms of projects currently on site. </p><p>  The arrangements for the registration of Architects and Building Surveyors under t he Building Control Act 2007 are open, transparent and fair for potential candidates from a variety of backgrounds including those who are practically trained and have limited or no academic training or qualifications. I am satisfied that the statutory arrangements for registration that are currently in place are appropriate and I have no proposals to amend the Act presently.   </p><p>  I understand that the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment, Arts and Culture has recently been giving some consideration to the arrangements that are in place for t the registration of practically trained architects under the Act of 2007. I look forward to considering the Committee&rsquo;s conclusions and recommendations in due course. My own view as outlined above is that the existing statutory position is fair and reasonable but that it may be opportune at this point to consider what practical steps can be taken to facilitate and support practically trained people who are interested in doing so to pursue the opportunities for registration that are open to them under the Act. </p><p>  I have asked my Department, in conjunction with the RIAI as registration body for the Register of Architects , to meet with members of the Architects Alliance to discuss further the concerns raised in the correspondence supplied.     </p></reply>

Regeneration seeks to rebuild these communities by addressing not just the physical environment in which they live but also by investing in the social and economic life of the areas.   </p><p>  My Department currently supports an ambitious programme of regeneration projects, including large-scale projects like Limerick City, Ballymun and the former PPP projects in Dublin City and smaller scale projects in Cork City, Tralee, Sligo and Dundalk.   </p><p>  Responsibility for the compilation of regeneration proposals rests with the relevant l ocal authority. Regeneration seeks to create sustainable communities through a combination of social, educational and economic initiatives and also by rejuv enating the built environment through a combination of demolition, construction and refurbishment of dwellings , having regard to urban design guidelines. Local authorities are required to adopt a holistic and strategic approach involving multiple local and national agencies in an integrated scheme designed to create sustainable communities and to address the underlying causes of deprivation in the area.

This was a historic meeting as it marked the first under new universal membership arrangements for UNEP agreed in &quot;The Future We Want&quot; document at the Rio +20 Conference held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in June 2012. Environment nisters attending the Session backed decisions designed to ensure a strengthened and upgraded institution that will be able to meet the environmental challenges of the 21st century. This  was the first major restructuring of UNEP since it was founded four decades ago. The negotiations in Nairobi were challenging, particularly in relation to the new institutional arrangements and it fell to the Irish Presidency to coordinate the EU&#8217;s input to these negotiations. </p><p>The Irish Presidency team&#8217;s co-ordination role involved managing multiple parallel tracks of meetings and participating in a number of bi-lateral meetings with other non-EU delegations during the Session.  Following agreement on all the major decisions tabled, the Irish Presidency on behalf of the EU and its Member States welcomed the outcome of the Session. </p><p>  The Ministerial segment took place over the first three days of the Session during which I and fellow nisters discussed a range of issues including the key priority of Institutional Reform of UNEP, Sustainable Development Goals, and the Green Economy . In addition, the Governing Council took a number of other decisions across a range of themes including on sustainable consumption and production, green economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication, chemicals and waste and UNEP&#8217;s Programme of Work and Budget. Further details on the negotiations and outcomes of the meeting are available at <i><i>.</i></i><i></i>On the eve of the Governing Council I addressed a High Level international meeting on the Rule of Law and the Environment which brought together nisters of the Environment and Government representatives with representatives of the judicial, legal and auditing professions.   </p><p>  I attended and spoke at round table discussions on emerging policy issues in the area of the environment and also attended lunchtime discussions, hosted by the Executive Director of UNEP, Mr. Achim Steiner, on the Green Economy. I also outlined, in my Presidency role, key EU priorities and concerns on the institutional arrangements for UNEP being discussed at the Session. In addition, I attended and spoke on behalf of the EU at a Ministerial Breakfast hosted by the German nistry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, for key players in the negotiations. I also attended a reception hosted by the Head of the EU delegation in Nairobi at which Sustainable Development Goals were discussed.   </p><p>  While at the Governing Council I also took the opportunity to have a number of bilateral meetings. I met with the Executive Director of UNEP to discuss a number of issues including the key issues before the Session, Ireland&#8217;s Presidency of the EU in the context of the Informal Environment Council which takes place in Dublin on 22/23 April next and issues relating to the GEMS Water Programme, which is the primary source for global water quality data and information. I had further discussions on this latter issue with UNEP at official level. </p><p>  I also met with Mr. Richard Beynon, the UK Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Natural Environment, Water and Rural Affairs, during which we discussed priorities for Ireland&#8217;s Presidency of the EU. I also met with Mr. Janez Potocnik, EU Commissioner for the Environment, to review EU priorities and the state of play in negotiations during the Governing Council and co-chaired, with Commissioner Potocnik, a meeting with representatives of major groups and civil society. During the negotiations, I also chaired two meetings of EU nisters and Heads of Delegations to agree EU priorities as discussions moved into a critical phase. Commissioner Potocnik and I also took the opportunity to meet, on a bilateral basis, with Environment Ministers from a number of Latin American countries - Columbia, Mexico, Bolivia and Brazil - to discuss key issues during the Session, principally in relation to sustainable development goals, the green economy and resource efficiency. </p><p>  In the margins of the Governing Council, and in accordance with normal practice, I attended a reception hosted by Ireland&#8217;s Honorary Consul at which I met members of the Irish Community in Kenya and Irish officials from UNEP involved in preparations for the 27th session.   </p></reply>

I stressed the need for owners to take responsibility for their dogs, as this is the most effective way of ensuring that such attacks are avoided.  These comments received significant nationwide media coverage.</p><p>  My Department is joining with the Irish Farmers Association in the development of a local radio advertising campaign to highlight the issue of dog attacks on sheep.

Section 22 of the Act already provides for the continued operation, as architects, of experienced persons by means of a technical assessment process which is open to individuals who had been performing duties commensurate with those of an architect for a period of ten years or more prior to the commencement of the Act.  Eight persons have to date successfully qualified for inclusion on the register of architects by means of the technical assessment process.  I am satisfied that the statutory arrangements for registration that are currently in place are appropriate, open and transparent and I have no plans to change these arrangements at present.  In relation to practically trained architects in particular, it is clear that the technical assessment process is a viable route to registration and I look forward to seeing more persons avail of this opportunity in time.  I have asked my Department to work in conjunction with the registration body to see if any practical steps can be taken to facilitate and support the relatively small number of practically trained persons who are interested in and eligible to pursue registration by means of technical assessment.     </p><p>  I am currently finalising the Building Control Amendment Regulations 2013 for signature into law following a comprehensive public consultation process undertaken in 2012.  Persons who are on the registers of Architects and Building Surveyors established in accordance with the Building Control Act 2007, or who are Chartered Engineers, may sign the statutory certificates of compliance for designers and for assigned certifiers that will be introduced under the new regulations.   Depending on their background and experience the persons of experience and long standing reputation referred to may also qualify for consideration for inclusion on the register of Building Surveyors which, as indicated, would also enable them to sign the statutory certificates being introduced under the new regulations.  The new regulations will provide for a transition period of 12 months which will, among other things, give sufficient time for eligible persons who have not already done so to apply for registration.</p></reply>

Local authorities are subject to a number of financial reporting requirements. Some of these requirements are statutory while others form part of the Department&rsquo;s general governance processes, the financial oversight function s of the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and also specific requirements relating to the EU/IMF programme of support.   </p><p>  Section 108 of the Local Government Act 2001 requires every local authority to prepare an Annual Financial Statement. The annual financial statements of local authorities are audited by the Local Government Audit Service, which provides independent scrutiny of the financial stewardship of local authorities.  The independence of the Audit Service is protected in legislation.   </p><p>  In addition, in line with best practice in corporate governance, audit committees have been established in all County and City Councils.  Audit committees have an i ndependent role in advising Council s on financial reporting processes, internal control, risk management and audit matters.</p></reply>

It serve s as a strategic context for spatial planning in Ireland by regional authorities in their regional planning guidelines role, for planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la in their statutory planning functions, and by influencing investment priorities particularly in transport, housing, water services, communications, energy, health and education infrastructure.    </p><p>The 2002 NSS remains in place, including its focus on developing the Gateway and Hub locations. However, together with nister Hogan, I will be bringing proposals to Government later this year for a road map to develop a successor strategy. This will take account of the report of the Mahon Tribunal which recommended that the NSS be given a statutory footing in both its preparation and implementation.   </p><p>I expect the successor to maintain the key principles of the current NSS but to be different in terms of focus and content given that the Regional Planning Guidelines now provide the well-established framework for articulating the NSS at regional level. The key principle of an evidence-based plan-led approach will remain in order to provide the foundation for proper planning and sustainable development, and maximising the role of a successor NSS in supporting overall economic recovery for our country, regions, counties, cities, towns and rural areas.   </p></reply>

Under section 10 of the Act, a fire authority is required to make provision for the delivery of fire services in its functional area, including the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of premises. </p><p>  The embargo on the filling of posts in the Local Government Service was introduced on 24 March 2009 following a Government Decision to implement savings measures across the wider public service.   </p><p>  My Department received a delegated sanction from the Department of Finance in August 2009 for implementation of this general moratorium on the filling of public sector posts across all local authorities.   </p><p>  Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each County and City Manager is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible. In this regard, it is a matter for County and City managers, in the first instance, to ensure that the reduction in staff numbers is managed so that the appropriate service level is maintained within budgetary and staffing constraints.   </p><p>  Where vacancies arise, local authorities must consider all options for reorganisation and reallocation of work to meet requirements.  Any exceptions to the moratorium require sanction from my Department. </p><p>  All staffing sanction requests are examined on a case by case basis having due regard to the continued delivery of key services and the need further to reduce overall staffing levels in the local authority sector. My Department works closely with local authorities to ensure that key posts are filled. In this regard, the majority of the sanctions granted are for the filling of posts in front line service areas such as fire and emergency services, water services, roads maintenance, housing, community and enterprise, and in relation to capital projects. Of the 585 requests received in respect of Fire and Emergency service posts since 2009, 480 have been sanctioned, 8 have been withdrawn, 3 have been refused and 94 are pending.   </p><p>  In view of the financial position facing local authorities, and the country as a whole, it is necessary to continue to focus on achieving the greatest possible savings. In this context, my Department and local authorities will continue to make every effort to ensure that further efficiencies and savings are attained by the sector while an appropriate level of service to the public is maintained.   </p></reply>

Axis 1 and 2 specifically support the agricultural aspects of the rural economy, and, accordingly, Axes 3 and 4 are prohibited from supporting activity that involves the production/growth of agricultural products. </p><p>  The harvesting of such products could also be considered agricultural activity.  In this context the operating rules for Axes 3 and 4 specifically state that support can only be considered for post-harvest activity when it relates to agricultural products. </p><p>The project referred to in the question involves the processing of miscanthus, a species of grass used as a renewable energy source. The production of such grass can be considered for support under a scheme already available in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) and it could therefore be considered an agricultural product.  Clarification is being sought from the European Commission to determine the appropriate distinction between production and processing, thereby potentially facilitating support under the L EADER elements of the RDP.  Pending this clarification, a final approval of the project in question will not be possible. However, my Department will be in contact with Carlow County Development Partnership as soon as possible in regard to this project.   </p></reply>

My approach to rates harmonisation will seek to ensure, on the one hand, that harmonisation does not lead to significant net loss of revenue in individual counties with consequential implications for services, and on the other hand, that increases in rates do not impact negatively on businesses and employment.   </p><p>Definitive details, arrangements and procedures in relation to the funding of district level functions, and financial relations between district and county levels, will be developed in the context of the new local government funding arrangements generally, implementation of the new sub-county system and preparation of the legislation in relation to the reform programme.   </p></reply>

Over the period 2008 &ndash; 2012, some &euro;953 million was recouped to local authorities in respect of projects completed under these measures.   </p><p>  Since the energy retrofitting measure was introduced in 2009, funding of almost &euro;100 million has been provided to local authorities for the retrofitting of older and substandard housing stock. Over that period, some 7,760 dwellings have been improved. </p><p>  I am currently reviewing the terms of the energy retrofitting measure for 2013 with a view to targeting grants at those older houses and apartments which lack adequate insulation and draught proofing.

My Department will issue revised guidelines to local authorities in the context of the capital allocations under the housing programme for 2013.

The Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI, who are responsible for operational policing co-operation, have repeatedly emphasised that the close and high quality co-operation between their forces has been instrumental in preventing attacks, combating criminality and saving lives.</p><p>  The two police forces operate a joint Cross-Border Policing Strategy which has as its aims to improve public safety throughout Ireland, to disrupt criminal activity and to enhance the policing capability of both police services on the island.  All of these are important elements in enabling the two forces to work more effectively together in tackling crime and promoting community safety for all communities on this island.</p><p>  Interagency co-operation is a key factor in combating the activities of organised criminal gangs operating on this island and the paramilitary groups who are inextricably linked to them.</p><p>  I would point the Deputy, for example, to the successful actions that have been taken against a number of groups involved in the laundering and distribution of illegal fuels.  These groups, operating in both jurisdictions, have been identified and disrupted, and are now being specifically targeted for investigation by all the enforcement agencies concerned.</p><p>  These actions have been underpinned by the Cross-Border Task Force on Fuel Laundering and Smuggling which comprises representatives from the two police forces, the two customs services, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Serious and Organised Crime Agency.  This group is in place to enhance joint efforts in tackling fuel laundering and smuggling.</p><p>  The Deputy will be interested to know that a similar group is in place to support the fight against the criminal activities of groups engaged in tobacco fraud.  The same interagency approach is deployed by the Cross Border Tobacco Enforcement Group in order to enhance the effectiveness of actions taken to disrupt this criminality.</p><p>  I would point out to the House that each year my Department and the Garda authorities, in conjunction with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, organise a Cross-Border Organised Crime Seminar.  This provides an opportunity to assess and address the ever changing trends in crime.  The fact that the Seminar is now in its eleventh year is testimony to the excellent co-operation that exists between the law enforcement agencies on the island in terms of exchanging knowledge and experience and seeking to further enhance and deepen co-operation and joint-working in the fight against crime.</p></reply>

The Government has approved, in principle my proposals for reforms to our courts structures which will, in due course, require the holding of a Constitutional referendum.</p><p>  I have initiated a consultation process with interested parties in relation to the establishment of family law courts and am hosting a seminar on 6 July next to discuss how such courts might operate.  I have invited an eminent judge from the Australian Family Court to share her experiences of their system.  The outcome of the seminar will feed into the process of designing the most appropriate model of family law courts for Ireland.</p><p>  I intend to bring forward, in the coming months, a Bill to promote mediation as a viable and cost effective alternative to court proceedings.  The main objective of the Bill is the reduction of legal costs, the speeding up of dispute resolution and the lessening of the stress involved in court proceedings.  These provisions are designed to ensure that the legal framework supports the parties in reaching an agreed and enduring resolution to their disputes where possible.</p><p>  This measure will further enhance a successful initiative between the Courts Service, the Legal Aid Board and the Family Mediation Service which has been operating in the Dublin District Family Law Courts in Dolphin House since March 2011.  The objective is to offer a robust alternative to a court determined outcome and a more appropriate means of resolving certain family disputes through mediation.  This project has resulted in a total of 570 agreements finalised without recourse to the courts up to end December 2012.  The project was extended further to Naas from September 2012 and to Cork with effect from January 2013.</p></reply>

However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion. </p><p>  The Garda Central Vetting Unit currently provides employment vetting for approximately 20,000 organisations in Ireland which employ personnel to work in a full time part time, voluntary or student capacity with children and or vulnerable adults and who are registered with the Unit for this purpose. All organisations are aware of the processing time frames for the receipt of vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection processes. T  he Unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012. To ensure equity and fairness all applications are dealt with in chronological order from date of receipt.</p><p>  It is my objective that processing times should be kept to a minimum, while maintaining the overall integrity of the vetting system. In that regard, following discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, I am pleased to announce that sanction was recently granted for an additional 25 staff to be re-deployed from the Department of Agriculture to the Unit in the near future.</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that Garda Central Vetting Unit will become the National Vetting Bureau under the provisions of   the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and will have a substantially expanded role under that legislation.

While good progress continues to be made in reducing the large volume of cases on hands, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that for a broad range of reasons some cases will take longer than others to process. It is a statutory requirement that, inter alia, applicants for naturalisation be of good character. In some instances that can be established relatively quickly and in other cases completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. I can, however, inform the Deputy that enormous progress has been made in dealing with the backlog and steps are being taken to process all outstanding applications as quickly as possible. </p><p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

That Regulation is a mutual recognition instrument and does not seek to harmonise EU insolvency laws. In determining an application for the opening of an insolvency proceeding, for which it would have exclusive power as the primary proceedings, of a company or of a natural person, the Regulation requires that a court should determine the centre of main interest (COMI) of the applicant in the context of  assuming jurisdiction.</p><p>  It is a matter for the court to satisfy itself that the provisions in its national law in this regard have been observed.  For example, the UK Courts can and have refused or revoked insolvency proceedings where an abuse has been detected. Indeed, this has occurred with certain individuals, who were subsequently subject to insolvency proceedings in this jurisdiction. </p><p>  A company or natural person is entitled to change a COMI and could do so for the purposes, <i>inter-alia</i>   of taking advantage of more favourable insolvency legislation. This entitlement arises under the broad rubric of freedom of movement in the Internal Market and such freedom has been enforced by decisions of the European Court of Justice. The country in which the debts are incurred is not necessarily material, but the relocation must not be artificial. The question of COMI is determined at the date the application for the insolvency proceeding is made and not at the time the debts were incurred. Orders made in insolvency proceedings in another EU jurisdiction, including an order discharging a person from bankruptcy, are enforceable against creditors elsewhere in the EU. </p><p>  In response to the economic downturn across Europe, the EU has published a proposal to modernise cross-border insolvency law which seeks to make cross-border insolvency proceedings more efficient, benefiting both debtors and creditors throughout the EU.  One of the primary aims of the new Regulation will be to give potentially viable companies and entrepreneurs a second chance before being declared insolvent. The proposal also addresses a range of other insolvency issues. </p><p>  I arranged that the initial discussion on the proposed Regulation took place at the informal Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting of EU Justice Ministers held in Dublin Castle on the 17 and 18 of January last. The Ministers, including my British colleague, engaged in a very detailed and constructive discussion on the proposals contained in the Regulation. I emphasised the importance of a more uniform approach across the EU in regard to the establishment of the centre of main interest so as to combat potential abuses in this regard which have given rise to allegations of &quot;bankruptcy tourism&quot;. </p><p>  Detailed consideration of the provisions contained in the new draft Regulation has now  commenced in a Working Group chaired by the Irish Presidency.</p></reply>

The Board prioritises certain categories of cases and these cases will receive an immediate or near immediate service.  The main categories of case types that are prioritised are public law child care cases, child abduction cases and domestic violence cases.  In addition, the Board has been piloting a triage approach to service delivery and this approach is operative in a number of law centres.  The pilot is in response to lengthening waiting times.  The aim of the triage approach is that every applicant gets to see a solicitor within a period of one month for the purpose of getting legal advice (consultations are broadly limited to 45 minutes).  If the applicant requires further services they remain on the waiting list.  There is or has been a backlog of applicants to be seen for triage purposes hence it is taking time to reduce the waiting time for such an appointment to one month.</p><p>  The Board is taking other steps in an effort to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery including introducing a new case management system in its law centres, integrating its mediation and legal services, integrating its Refugee Legal Service into the general law centre service delivery model and maintaining a high level of usage of private solicitors for family law cases in the District Court.  The reality is that the Board must live within its budget and is subject to the public service recruitment moratorium (there is a very limited derogation).  Demand for the Board's services has increased significantly since the downturn in the economy.  There was a 10% drop in demand at the general law centres in 2012 compared to 2011.  However, demand in 2011 was 93% greater than it was in 2006.  The capacity to provide a meaningful service is a priority for the Board.  In 2013, the Board will examine other options in an effort to enable legal services to be provided promptly to those most in need of them.</p><p>  In relation to Criminal Legal Aid, total expenditure for 2012 came to &#8364;50.5 million, a reduction of 10% over the 2011 figure of &#8364;56.1 million.  This reduction in the annual expenditure is the largest ever recorded and represents a fall of approximately &#8364;10 million, or 16%, over the peak recorded in 2009.  As the Scheme is demand led it is difficult to predict and control expenditure because it depends on the number of criminal cases coming before the courts.  The Task Force on Cost Reductions on Criminal Legal Aid identified a range of measures which could potentially contribute to costs reductions in this area.  As I stated in the Topical Issues debate referred to in the Deputy's question, a requirement on applicants to make an initial payment could give rise to constitutional difficulties and difficulties arising from the European Convention on Human Rights.  It would not be feasible to introduce arrangements which give rise to further administrative expense and demands on resources for no real benefit.  A new Criminal Legal Aid Bill is planned to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  Consideration is being given to including in the Bill provisions to, <i>inter alia</i>, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, allow the Board to verify the means of applicants and to prosecute cases of abuse.  Provision to give power to the Legal Aid Board to recover the costs of criminal legal aid or to make application to a court to revoke a criminal legal aid certificate are also under consideration.  These provisions must have regard to a person's rights to the presumption of innocence, to a fair trial and to be given legal aid, where appropriate.  I hope it will be possible to publish the Bill during the course of this year.</p></reply>

All States operate immigration controls for well established reasons of public policy, including considerations of an economic nature which in the case of Ireland remains extremely challenging with ongoing high levels of unemployment. There are also considerations based on maintaining the integrity of the Common Travel Area with the UK which must be taken into account.</p><p>  Legal and illegal migration are two sides of the same coin and a balanced policy needs to facilitate regular migration channels while at the same time take action against immigration abuse.  Many people from overseas have made Ireland their home in recent years.  In this context it is worth noting that many of the EU citizens who arrived here during times of economic prosperity have chosen to remain notwithstanding the change in economic circumstances.  In addition, many individuals have been granted citizenship in recent years.  Over the past two years alone, approximately 38,000 individuals have successfully applied for and been successful in their citizenship applications, approximately 13,000 in 2011 and approximately 25,000 in 2012. </p><p>  Of course, citizenship is not the only means of attaining lawful residence in the State.  For example, through an accrual of employment permits an individual may choose to apply for long term residence, or to continue to renew his or her status on an annual basis. Tens of thousands of immigrants have remained on in the State on foot of such provisions.</p><p>  Clearly, all illegal immigrant cases are not the same and must be dealt with on a case by case basis and on the basis of their individual circumstances.  At one end of the scale are those where the person's illegal status is through no fault of their own and indeed my Department has been dealing with cases of this nature on an ongoing basis.  However there are also much more egregious instances of immigration abuse, often at considerable expense to the State and it does not follow that such persons should profit from their conduct. </p><p>  At EU Level, the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008 made specific commitments &quot;to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons&quot;.  While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of those unlawfully present without first examining the merits of their individual cases.</p><p>  In looking at cases as they arise, among the issues that would be relevant to the outcome would be the circumstances in which the person became undocumented, the length of time they have been in that situation, their prospects of being able to gain lawful employment without being a drain on the financial resources of the State along with the more general considerations applicable to immigration decisions, including any family related rights they may have in the context of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p><p>  Sometimes case by case consideration will result in a positive outcome for the applicant.  However, in other cases this may result in a decision by the Irish authorities, subject to the oversight of our Courts, that the person has to go home.  That decision should be respected.</p></reply>

This is a reduction from the previous 12 years discharge period. </p><p>  I believe that the period of three years for automatic discharge is a reasonable one and represents a balance between the legitimate interests and expectations of creditors and debtors. The period is broadly in line with the European norm in regard to discharge from insolvency. The length of the discharge in other jurisdictions, including the UK, is not a matter over which I have control. However, as I indicated during the Oireachtas debates on the passage of the Personal Insolvency Act, I will keep all matters under review, including this particular issue.</p><p>  Under the provisions of the EU Regulation on insolvency proceedings of 2000, a company or natural person may apply to a court for the opening of insolvency proceedings in any Member State of the EU.  In determining an application for the opening of an insolvency proceeding, the Regulation requires that a court should determine the centre of main interest of the applicant in the context of  assuming jurisdiction. It is a matter for the court to satisfy itself that the provisions in its national law in this regard have been observed. For example, the UK Courts can and have refused or revoked insolvency proceedings where an abuse has been detected.</p></reply>

In accordance with this principle, the role of the Oireachtas has been to specify in law a maximum penalty and a court, having considered all the circumstances of the case, to impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.</p><p>  There are, of course, a small number of situations where statute has created exceptions to this approach most notably by providing for mandatory sentences for murder and presumptive minimum sentences in the case of certain firearms and drug trafficking offences.  Except for exceptional circumstances, I am of the view that the Oireachtas should be cautious in prescribing mandatory sentences.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient. The Law Reform Commission is currently examining the law in relation to mandatory sentences and I understand that this work will be completed this year.</p><p>  It would not be in keeping with the principles of judicial independence for the Executive to impose a Sentencing Council on the Judiciary. For similar reasons, the Deputy may be aware that the Law Reform Commission, after detailed study some years ago, recommended against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines but favoured non-statutory sentencing principles.  The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Information System (ISIS) website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  Information on over 1,000 cases is detailed on the website and I welcome the committee's recent announcement that two JobBridge interns are to be appointed shortly in order to recommence populating the online database with information on sentencing in the criminal courts. </p><p>  The Deputy may also be aware that the ISIS committee announced they are planning to recommence providing information on sentencing in relation to specific issues in which context an analysis has been published on rape sentencing prepared by the Judicial Researchers Office under the guidance of Mr. Justice Peter Charleton.  I understand that seminars are also planned, including one focusing on the work of the Sentencing Council in the UK.</p><p>Finally, in September 2012, I announced a strategic review of penal policy. I have established a working group to carry out this review which will examine all aspects of penal policy and I expect the Group to report later this year.</p></reply>

Surrender was refused in the High Court on the basis that the person concerned had not fled the state in question, which was a requirement of the European Arrest Warrant Act at that time.  The decision of the High Court was appealed to the Supreme Court which affirmed the original decision to refuse surrender. </p><p>  Legislation was subsequently amended to remove the 'fled' requirement in respect of persons sought to serve a sentence in the issuing state.  This amendment brought the Act into closer compliance with the relevant EU Framework Decision which referred to 'fleeing' in the Recital but did not include the term in the relevant Article.</p><p>  After the legislation was changed, the Hungarian authorities submitted a new warrant.  The High Court ordered the surrender of the person concerned and that Order was appealed to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court upheld the appeal and refused to surrender the person. </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their functions.  In the circumstances, I am not in a position to make any further comment in the matter other than to say that there are no further EAW proceedings pending in this jurisdiction.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that persons can be detained only in accordance with law and, while this case has been the subject of extensive contact between the Irish and Hungarian authorities, there is no action open to me by virtue of Ireland's current role as EU President in relation to this matter.  </p></reply>

In particular, the Garda authorities have emphasised that the Force will continue to support the relevant communities through the clustering of services in policing hubs.

Under these arrangements persons are generally accommodated in the committal facility for the area in which their case is processed.  The detention of non-nationals is subject to judicial oversight which includes recourse to the courts for all detainees.  Detention must also be in accordance with national and international law, in particular the European Convention on Human Rights which requires every organ of the State to perform its functions in a manner compatible with the State's obligations under the Convention. </p><p>  Places of detention are subject to rigorous inspection systems governed by both national and international oversight bodies.  The existing international system of inspection operates under the auspices of the Council of Europe Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment which Ireland has been a party to since 1989 while the Office of the Inspector of Prisons is responsible for national oversight arrangements.</p><p>  The Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture and All Forms of Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, signed by Ireland on 2nd October, 2007, establishes a national and international inspection system for places of detention which is modelled to a significant extent on the Council of Europe Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.</p><p>  The Government has approved the drafting of a General Scheme of an Inspection of Places of Detention Bill, which will include provisions to enable ratification of the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture.

While good progress continues to be made in reducing the large volume of cases on hands, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that for a broad range of reasons some cases will take longer than others to process.

The Bill, which has completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il and is awaiting Committee Stage, does not make any provision in relation to the role or status of &quot;legal executives&quot; nor is any such provision envisaged. </p><p>  The proposals being made by the Irish Institute of Legal Executives Ltd on behalf of its members, are far-reaching and relate <i>inter alia</i>  to &quot;a right of audience in the District and Circuit Courts, before tribunals and, subject to review, subsequently in all courts&quot;, and to the eligibility of members for quasi-judicial and judicial appointments (e.g as District Court judges or as members of Tribunals).  These proposals also draw heavily from the regulatory and practise models of England and Wales which do not always correspond to those of our jurisdiction nor to those set out under current Government policy in the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011.  Under Section 30 of the Bill, provision is already made for public consultation in relation to the creation of a new profession of conveyancer.  It also remains open to legal executives, who are so minded, to pursue the career of solicitor or barrister by way of capitalising on their acquired legal knowledge and experience.</p><p>  While recognising that there may be additional benefits and efficiencies to be found for consumers and for the legal services sector in a more developed role for &quot;legal executives&quot;, the far-reaching proposals being made on their behalf at this time lie beyond the scope of the Legal Services Regulation Bill impinging, as they do, on aspects of the courts and the judiciary.  Such matters will, therefore, need to be considered separately on their own merits, while others may come to be considered in due course by the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority. </p></reply>

There is no obligation on the Department to engage any retired medical officer of the Defence Forces to provide medical duties and I am informed that since 2009, newly retired medical officers were engaged to provide such services only in exceptional circumstances.  I should also add that against the background of the difficulty experienced in recruiting doctors to the Defence Forces, it has been necessary to identify alternative options for the provision of medical services to the Defence Forces, including the consideration of the outsourcing of some or all Defence Forces domestic medical services.  In this regard, an integrated model for the provision of the required medical services, involving both the Medical Corps and outsourced service provision, is being progressed. </p></reply>

It was this testing which first uncovered the issue relating to mislabelling of meat that has since become a matter of concern across Europe. </p><p>  In light of recent developments, officials from my Department and the FSAI met with the meat processing sector on 14<sup>th</sup> February to agree a national protocol for DNA testing of meat to be applied at retail, catering and processing level in Ireland. This testing will provide further reassurance to Irish consumers and consumers of Irish food abroad about the authenticity of ingredients in our meat based products. DNA testing will apply from now on as part of routine food testing across the country. The following categories of food are being tested &#8211; pre-packaged beef products on sale to the final consumer or to mass caterers, beef products offered for sale without pre-packaging to consumers or to mass caterers and meat ingredients used in processed beef products.   The results will be made known to the public.<b></b>  The industry has already been engaged in product testing and results received by the FSAI to date have all been negative for equine DNA (except for 5 positives which related to products previously identified as a problem and which had already been removed from the market). </p><p>  In addition, at the instigation of the EU Commission and with the strong support of the Irish Presidency, a coordinated EU plan was agreed on 15<sup>th</sup> February whereby the DNA testing of meat and meat products may commence immediately and will be co-funded by the Commission at a rate of 75 per cent for the first month.  Results from the first round of tests, to be carried out by the end of March, will have to be reported to the Commission by 15<sup>th</sup>   April. The number of DNA tests, which will be carried out on the basis of representative sampling, is expected to exceed 2,250 across the EU, and this will be supplemented by bute testing on the basis of one sample per 50 tonnes of horsemeat. This testing will contribute to a clearer understanding of the situation across Europe and may be extended for a further two months. As part of the EU-wide plan, 50 additional food samples will be checked for horse DNA during March in Ireland. These include products marketed or labelled as containing beef as a major ingredient such as minced meat, meat products and meat preparations. The results of these tests will also be published and will provide the basis for consideration of the need for any further action. </p></reply>

In addition, an additional payment of up to 20% may be paid, where justified, based on &ldquo;transaction costs&rdquo; which are the costs incurred by participants in engaging with the scheme. Traditionally, this additional payment has been paid under REPS.  </p><p>  Given the on-going difficulties in the public finances and budgetary constraints on my Department, I have had no option but to make difficult decisions in the allocation of the funding available to many competing demands. In finalising my Department&rsquo;s Estimates for 2012, I announced a 10% reduction in payments under REPS 4 from 2012 onwards. I decided that the reduction would be implemented by way of a cut to the transaction cost of participating farmers of from &euro;28.03 to &euro;5.60 on each hectare on which the a transaction cost was paid. The 2012 payment of the person named was adjusted accordingly. This resulted in a 2012 REPS 4 payment totalling &euro;5,211.52, which issued to the person named in January 2013. Because of the particular circumstances of the person named, this represents a 7.9% reduction when compared to the 2011 payment which totalled &euro;5,660.12. </p></reply>

It is one of 6 Fishery Harbour Centres operated by the State, each of whose primary purpose is to provide facilities and services for the fishing industry and fisheries-related activities.  </p><p>  There has been significant capital investment in the Fishery Harbour Centres in recent years, underpinning both the fisheries side and, in parallel, their expanding use for leisure and marine tourism and other maritime enterprises.  Howth in particular has a long tradition in both areas.  All of the users of the Fishery Harbour need to be accommodated in a safe and secure facility, and the Department has a duty of care towards anyone entering it.  Apart from any other considerations, the upkeep of the Harbour so that it meets with current health and safety standards has a cost and this cost must be paid for out of the income generated. </p><p>  In the current economic climate, the State must be fully committed to maximising the return on its investment.  Furthermore, my Department is required to ensure that the Fishery Harbour Centres are run on a financially sound basis.  </p><p>  With over 500 parking spaces within the boundaries of the Fishery Harbour Centre at present, it is clear that a significant source of revenue exists that could assist in balancing the books, and providing funding for enhancements that would not otherwise be possible.</p><p>  I am reviewing all aspects of the matter at present.  I can assure the Deputy that the views of the various harbour users, the potential earnings, the possible impact on the harbour businesses and recreational users, the impact on the local economy, the impact on overall traffic management within the Fishery Harbour, are all matters that I will take into account in coming to a decision. </p></reply>

In addition, beef labelling regulations require detailed traceability and labelling of fresh cuts and pure mince at the retail level.  In 2011, the European Union passed a new Council Regulation on Food Information for the Consumers (FIC) Regulation, No.1169/2011, which has updated the requirements for consumer information and labelling in a number of areas: country of origin or place of provenance including the origin labelling for meats other than beef; list of ingredients; quantitative indication of ingredients; minimum durability; use by date; date of freezing; substances or products causing allergies or intolerances; font size; etc.  Many of these new requirements will have to be implemented by way of EU Commission Implementing Regulations and will come into force at the end of 2014.</p><p>  While the Department of Health is the lead department in relation to food labelling, my Department together with the Department of Health and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) attend regular meetings of the Working Group on this legislation in Brussels which is currently discussing the mandatory origin labelling of fresh meat from species other than beef, voluntary origin labelling of foods and the mandatory origin labelling of meat as an ingredient.  A report on this and other matters is to be submitted by the Commission to the FIC Working Group by 13   December 2013.  The question of origin labelling of meat as an ingredient was discussed at the Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting yesterday, which I chaired. The Commission agreed to expedite the completion of its report.</p></reply>

These Schemes operate in the beef, pigmeat, eggs, lamb, poultry products and horticulture sectors and currently include over 150 participating food processors and packers as well as over 40,000 farmers.  The products are available in the major supermarkets and many retail outlets.  The standards of the individual Schemes have been developed and refined over a number of years in consultation with scientists, academics and independent experts on issues such as food safety, animal health and welfare, care for the environment etc. Each Scheme is accredited to IS EN ISO 9001:2008 with the National Standards Authority of Ireland and to the European Standard EN45011.  These measures underpin ongoing commitment to quality and sustainability as well as to the highest standards of traceability and food safety in the Irish food sector.  </p></reply>

Up to that point there was no basis for any action.  My Department was requested on 21st   December by the FSAI to obtain samples of raw ingredients in the context of the FSAI survey on the authenticity of meat products, preliminary results of which indicated traces of non-bovine DNA. My Department was requested by the FSAI not to take any other action as results were inconclusive and required further evaluation by the FSAI.  In this context the FSAI has pointed out that where trace levels are detected this is indicative of inadvertent rather than deliberate presence and not requiring declaration on the product label.   It is and always has been standard practice that preliminary results are subject to a process of confirmatory testing.</p><p>  Having regard to the range of sampling activity taking place at any given time, the lack of any public health concern, the inconclusive nature of the results and the trace level findings, the request of the FSAI on 21st December 2012 to obtain samples of raw ingredients was not regarded as approaching the priority level at which it would be appropriate that it be brought to my attention.  When the FSAI provided my Department with actual results including the 29% finding for the first time on 14th January 2013 it was brought to my attention.  I understand from the Department of Health that the FSAI notified that Department of its request to obtain samples on 21st December 2012.

I would point out, however, that the Programme for Government contains a specific commitment to enact legislation to regulate certain practices in the grocery goods sector.  The Government intends to give effect to this commitment by including an enabling provision in the legislation currently being prepared to merge the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority, which will allow for the introduction of a statutory Code of Practice.  Work on drafting the Consumer and Competition Bill is on-going and the Bill is included in the &ldquo;A list&rdquo; in the Government&rsquo;s current Legislative Programme.  It is important to point out that in introducing a statutory Code the intention is not to protect one stakeholder over another nor is the Code intended to prevent stakeholders such as retailers and suppliers from engaging in the type of contractual negotiations that happen in most other sectors of the economy.  It is also the case that the Code is not seeking in any way to determine the price of grocery goods. Rather, the essential value of the Code is that by regulating problematic practices in the grocery goods sector it seeks to strike a fair balance between the competing interests of the various stakeholders including the interests of the end user, the consumer.</p><p>  The Government is strongly of the view that it important to ensure there is balance in the relationship between the various players in the grocery goods sector and that Ireland continues to have strong agri food and retail sectors, particularly given the importance of these sectors to the national economy.  The introduction of a Code of Practice, as provided for in the Programme for Government, is intended to achieve such a balance taking into account the interests of all stakeholders in the grocery goods sector.  It must also be noted, however, that arrangements in the domestic market are not the primary influence on farmers&rsquo; incomes.  Unsurprisingly, with an Agri-Food industry that exported over &euro;9bn of goods last year, the bulk of most Irish farmers&rsquo; produce is exported (e.g. 4 out of 5 beef cattle produced in Ireland are consumed in other countries), so EU and world prices have a much bigger influence on the price farmers receive for their output overall than does the retail price in Ireland.</p></reply>

An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is working to address this issue, particularly as oil prices increase and the cost of sending trawlers full of fish to Spain, France, Scotland and Norway becomes less economical.  With the increase in the Blue whiting quota for 2013, it is anticipated that there will be increased levels of this stock landed into Ireland by foreign vessels.  I understand that negotiations are ongoing between representatives of the French fishing industry and Irish processing interests, with a view to increasing French landings into Ireland.  A pilot initiative was developed between BIM, Irish processors and French industry during late 2012.  All concerned are seeking to build on the success of this initiative in 2013.</p><p>  In relation to official controls carried out by the SFPA these are done in order to discharge Ireland's obligations under the Framework for the control of the Common Fisheries Policy in EU Waters  as set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, establishing a Community control system to ensure compliance with the rules of the CFP and Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.  Detailed rules for the implementation of the control regulation are set out in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011, and I have implemented these in national law through Statutory Instrument 320 of 2012 as amended.  This is the regulatory EU framework against which the SFPA carries out its inspection regime.</p><p>  These regulations contain an explicit default obligation requiring that all fish be weighed by operators at the point of landing.  In order to ensure a reasonable balance between the burden of compliance and the practicalities of fish landing, SFPA has pursued and achieved approval for landings to Ireland to avail of various derogations.  These allow, in particular for a sample weighing at landing, or a weighing after transport to an Irish premises.  In the case of landings to a Member State for transport to another Member State before weighing, the EU Regulation is prescriptive in only allowing that to occur under the terms of a Common Control Programme agreed between the landing MS and the weighing MS. I am pleased to inform you that due to active engagement by the SFPA with their French counterparts as part of overall pursuit of a level playing field for fisheries control, the EU Commission has approved the Common Control programme between Ireland and France, and anyone landing to Ireland may transport their fish directly to France for weighing, provided they work within the terms of this approved CCP.  The SFPA have engaged in a specific compliance programme including active dialogue with industry stakeholders, with view to discharging Ireland&rsquo;s obligations in this regard.</p><p>  At the request of the industry, I have recently added Castletownbere to the list of Irish ports at which third country landings can be processed and this is aimed  to facilitate  an increase in landings of Blue Whiting into Ireland by the Norwegian fleet.  This is contained in S.I 367 of 2012 Sea-Fisheries (Illegal, Unreported And Unregulated Fishing) (Amendment) Regulations 2012.</p></reply>

The administrative functions for Cork have been recently centralised in Cork city and the administrative functions in the Limerick DVO will be transferred to Naas with effect from 4th March, front office presence will remain.  It has also been decided to transfer the administrative functions out of the Tipperary Regional Office to Cavan.  The centralisation of administrative functions in other regional offices will be considered in light of the availability of opportunities to redeploy the staff concerned to support other critical public services.  There are no plans for the closure of any of the 16 Regional Offices to the public in the context of this review.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-26a.1386.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013022600055#WRBB02300"><p>The market performance of the sheep sector, in common with other agricultural sectors, is a function of supply and demand. I am aware that sheep prices for the year 2013 to date are disappointing for producers and are running at around 17% below the 2012 level for the corresponding period. This decline is reflected also in other EU member states and can be attributed to a number of factors including increased imports from New Zealand and the impact of austerity in Europe on demand generally. However, I would like to put the current difficulties in context.</p><p>  After successive years of decline, 2011/12 saw an important turning point for the Irish sheep industry.  It was a period when confidence grew on the back of incremental growth in the national breeding flock.  This brought about increased throughput at farm and processing level. During that same period Irish sheep exports delivered double digit growth and retail sales of Irish lamb have grown steadily. These developments are in sharp contrast to other Member States, where sheep meat production and domestic consumption have been falling.  </p><p>  Throughout 2012 a higher demand from both the domestic and export markets were evenly matched with supplies, particularly during the peak periods of hogget and main season lamb supply.  Slaughterings in 2012 were up 12%, or 260,000 head to 2.43 million sheep.  This included 68,000 extra hoggets, 160,000 extra lambs and 32,000 additional ewes and rams slaughtered in 2012.   </p><p>  On another positive note, exports of Irish sheep meat registered a solid performance in 2012 where total value rose by 7% to &euro;205 million.  Seventy percent of our production was exported, the vast majority of which was destined for the EU market.  Just over 42,000 tonnes were exported to over 24 individual markets across the globe in 2012. France and the UK continue to be our core export markets representing three quarters of our volume exports.  Strong increases in shipments were recorded to Belgium, Germany and Sweden as exporters continue to secure new business and grow volume with existing customers. Despite the ongoing pressure on retail meat sales in Ireland, lamb held its own, with data from Kantar Worldpanel showing a rise of almost 4.5% for the 52 week period ending November 2012.</p><p>  Tighter global supplies that characterised the sheepmeat markets in 2011/12 have eased slightly as global production edges up 1% to 13.6 million.  Good pastures and favourable lambing conditions in Australia and New Zealand have reversed four years of declining output. Production in both countries is forecast to grow by 3-5% this year. Due to the ongoing austerity in Europe and with an increase in the availability of cheaper lamb from the southern hemisphere, in comparison with 12 months ago, the price differential between New Zealand and EU lamb has been widening since summer 2012.  The carryover of UK hoggets into 2013 has also put downward pressure on prices in the early months of 2013. </p><p>  Today&rsquo;s consumer seeks value and is prepared to switch to a cheaper protein option.  Lamb is perceived as a relatively expensive meat and Bord Bia promotion campaigns play an important role in positioning lamb as a preferred choice. Increasing the frequency of purchase of Irish lamb and encouraging shoppers to look for the Bord Bia Quality Mark on-pack when shopping will be the key objective of the Bord Bia 2013 lamb promotions. Promotional activities will include radio advertising, which will be undertaken around Easter, announcing the arrival of early season lamb amongst consumers. Similarly, a series of promotional activities to include PR, publicity and in-store activities will be undertaken to coincide with peak availability of new season lamb. The TV advert highlighting the unique flavour of Irish lamb due to our ideal climate will play a central role in our 2013 promotions.</p><p>  Overall numbers of lamb producers in the Bord Bia Lamb Quality Assurance Scheme (LQAS) stand at just over 9,300, which roughly equates to 45% of our national throughput.  I recently launched the Sheep Technology Adoption Programme (STAP), which I believe will be a key element in driving the ambitious target for the sheepmeat Sector in Food Harvest 2020. The STAP is intended to provide participants with the knowledge and the skills necessary to improve on-farm technical efficiency in a number of key areas. The sheep sector is a key part of the Agrifood sector, especially in marginal land areas and there is huge scope to improve farm incomes through focusing on issues such as grassland management, financial management, breeding, health and welfare and environmental efficiency. The STAP provides an opportunity to grow the membership base of the LQAS amongst lamb producers, while also promoting the adoption by farmers of best practice in the various aspects of sheep farming. I have allocated &euro;3 million to the STAP for 2013, with a maximum payment of &euro;1,000 per participant. Though the Grassland Sheep Scheme was due to expire at the end of 2012, I decided to extend it for another year and am providing some &euro;14 million for this purpose in 2013. The scheme will be funded from unspent Single Farm Payment funds. I am also providing for a continuation of the sheep fencing scheme in the amount of &euro;3 million this year to enable many farmers in the sheep sector to complete the necessary investment works in order to maintain competitiveness and introduce increased efficiencies on their farm and so secure the future of their enterprises.  I am confident that all of these initiatives will be of significant assistance in developing a strong and sustainable sheep sector for the future.</p></reply>

My Department maintains a permanent presence in approved slaughter plants. Regular visits are made to other Department approved meat plants. The frequency of these inspections in plants other than slaughter plants, which focus primarily on food safety requirements, is determined by a risk assessment, as required under EU legislation, which is conducted for each plant. My Department has been able to reduce the number of inspections at non-slaughter meat plants, where there is no permanent supervisory presence, by moving to a more robust and rigorous targeted system of official controls, based on the risk assessments mentioned above. Official controls and inspections levels are monitored independently by the EU Food and Veterinary Office and by the FSAI under service contract. </p><p>  Food business operators in Ireland are responsible inter alia for carrying out checks to ensure that their ingredients come from approved plants. In meat plants that operate under the supervision of the Department, official controls are conducted on these checks to verify their effectiveness. An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department approved meat plant. The audit includes physical identity, labelling and documentary checks. This includes product originating both in EU Member States and third countries. Labelling and documentary checks also form part of the routine checks conducted by Department officials. </p><p>  Under the Department&rsquo;s National Residue Programme, and including tests on bovine samples carried out by processors, up to 30,000 samples taken at farm and factory level and covering a wide range of food stuffs are tested annually. These tests relate to microbiological and chemical standards, their primary focus being on food safety. These are fully in accordance with EU testing requirements.  </p><p>  In addition the Product Official Sampling and Testing (POST) programme is a microbiological testing programme on samples taken from Department approved ready-to-eat food, meat product, minced meat and meat preparation plants i.e. added value plants. This is part of the official verification of food safety controls in the plants concerned as provided for in Regulations (EC) 852/2004, 854/2004 and 2073/2005. A total of 1,600 samples are taken annually and the sampling and testing is risk based.</p><p>  The number of inspections has not been found to be inadequate as compliance with existing food safety and food hygiene requirements was not an issue in relation to the mislabelling of meat products uncovered by the recent FSAI survey. It is clear however that the focus of checks henceforth will also need to include food authenticity and the EU wide programme of DNA testing recently agreed will provide the basis for consideration of future action in this respect.</p><p>  In the meantime, in the light of recent developments, officials from my Department and the FSAI met with the meat processing sector on 14th  February to agree a national protocol for DNA testing of meat to be applied at retail, catering and processing level in Ireland. This testing will provide further reassurance to Irish consumers and consumers of Irish food abroad about the authenticity of ingredients in our meat based products. DNA testing will apply from now on as part of routine food testing across the country. The following categories of food are being tested &ndash; pre-packaged beef products on sale to the final consumer or to mass caterers, beef products offered for sale without pre-packaging to consumers or to mass caterers and meat ingredients used in processed beef products.</p></reply>

One of these measures related to the number of weeks over which the free pre-school year could be provided.  At that time, approximately 30% of children in the relevant age-cohort were in full daycare.  Therefore, in order to facilitate full daycare services in the early years of the programme, services were permitted to choose between providing a 38 week or a 50 week model.</p><p>  I should emphasise that the ECCE programme is designed as an educational programme for children.  It was always intended, once the programme had bedded-down, to introduce a standard 38 week model.  This is primarily because this is the optimal model in terms of ensuring a high-quality early years experience for pre-school children.  The S&iacute;olta and Aistear frameworks were developed to support this objective. The ECCE programme is designed to be delivered across 38 weeks.  It is difficult to see how the curriculum can be delivered across a 50 week period when the children spend less time (generally 2 hours 15 minutes per day) availing of it.</p><p>  My focus is on improving the quality of childcare services.  For this reason, therefore, services participating in the ECCE programme are now required to provide the programme on the basis of 3 hours per day, 5 days per week, over 38 weeks. It is not mandatory that children attend every day but, where they do not, the capitation fee is reduced accordingly.   </p><p>  The change to the 38 week model only was introduced in September 2012 and all participating services have successfully made the transition to the new arrangement.  There are no proposals to re-introduce the 50 week model.</p></reply>

The necessary legislative and organisational preparations are being prioritised so that the Agency can be established as soon as possible. The Agency, upon establishment, will assume full statutory responsibility for a range of child and family services currently provided by three separate agencies; namely the HSE, the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board. </p><p>  The Government's consideration of these matters was informed, by the content and recommendations of the Report of the Task Force on the Child and Family Support Agency which I published in July 2012.  The Task Force considered that the Agency needs to be as broadly based as possible and should include a range of prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic care interventions.  It is my intention that the Agency will have a role in supporting families and communities. I can assure the Deputy that the new Agency will build on the excellent work undertaken by the Family Support Agency over the last decade, and that a community based approach will form an integral part of the new Child and Family Support Agency. </p><p>  Funding of over &euro;23.5 million has been provided to the Family Support Agency (FSA) for 2013. This includes a dedicated provision of over &euro;14 million in respect of the Family Resource Centre Programme in 2013. Under the programme some 106 Family Resource Centres will receive funding from the FSA this year. The FSA, like all other State bodies, has been asked to make savings across all the programmes which it administers. In this context the Family Resource Centres have been asked to focus, in particular, on identifying the scope for greater efficiency and for reduction in the administration and overhead costs associated with the day-to-day running of the centres.</p><p>  The composition of the Board of the Child and Family Support Agency is currently under consideration. It will reflect the broad ranging nature of the Agency's responsibilities. In line with best corporate governance, the criteria for Board membership will be focused on ensuring that Board members have the requisite mix of experience and competencies needed to steer such a large organisation providing a diverse range of personal services. </p><p>  The establishment of the new Agency and the wider transformation of children's services represents one of the largest, and most ambitious, areas of public sector reform embarked upon by this Government.</p></reply>

Applicants decide, through a range of information and contact options, how they wish to proceed.  It is intended that the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2013 will provide for placing the National Contact Preference Register on a statutory basis. I hope to submit the draft Heads of Bill to Cabinet for approval shortly. </p><p>  At the end of 2012 there were 7224 adopted people and  3165 natural relatives registered with the NACPR. Just over 600  &ldquo;matches&rdquo; in total have been generated, i.e. over 600 adopted persons have been matched with one (or more) natural relatives. In 2012 the Information and Tracing Unit processed 542 new applications to join the Register, which resulted in 54 &ldquo;matches&rdquo;.  </p><p>  The Authority advises that around 80% of the natural relative applicants are parents, around 10% of them choose to have no direct contact, but may be willing to exchange some information.  A majority of those choose to be discretely informed if a &quot;matching&quot; application was received and some of those changed their contact option when subsequently informed that a match had occurred. The Authority advises that people can, and do, change their minds about the type and extent of contact that they want and the Authority are happy to amend their applications accordingly. </p><p>  The Adoption Board published a review of the operation of the Register from 2005 to 2007 in November 2007. This review contains detailed information about the register and is available on the Information and Tracing section of the Authority website,www.aai.gov.ie.</p></reply>

Work is ongoing on the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill, which  will address this matter with regard to adoption.  The proposed Bill will provide for a structured and regulated approach to providing access to adoption information and will facilitate contact for those affected by adoption, including in circumstances where an adoption order was not effected. </p><p>  It is intended that the Bill will provide for the Adoption Authority to have access to all adoption records. The Bill will provide for a National Index of Adoption Records to be maintained by the Adoption Authority containing information as to where all known adoption records are located within the State. It is envisaged that only the Authority, the HSE and accredited bodies will hold adoption records, with the Authority having overall charge of those records. </p><p>  It is also intended that the Bill will provide for placing the National Contact Preference Register on a statutory basis. The purpose of the Register is to allow persons affected by adoption to register their names with a view to receiving information about a person from whom they have been separated as a result of adoption and will allow for registering a preference, as to whether or not,  they want to have contact with that person.  </p><p>  A National Tracing Service will be established, the operation of which will be subject to guidelines which will be set out in regulations. It is intended that the Tracing Service will be made available to adopted persons, birth parents and relatives with the Adoption Authority having the overarching responsibility for the service.  </p><p>  It is intended that prior to the release of adoption information, counselling will be offered by the Adoption Authority, the HSE or by an accredited body to an adopted person, a birth parent or to an adoptive parent if, in the opinion of the Authority, the HSE or an accredited body, such counselling would be beneficial in the circumstances, or if such counselling is requested by the applicant seeking the adoption information.</p><p>  Complex issues have arisen during the course of the preparation of the Bill  including the criteria for balancing an adopted person's right to information about his or her identity as against a birth parent's right to privacy. My own view is that persons affected by adoption should be provided with as much information as possible within permissible Constitutional boundaries. </p><p>  Consideration of legal and policy issues is ongoing and once these have been satisfactorily resolved, I intend to seek Government approval to publish the Heads of Bill. It is my intention to bring this Bill before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the coming months.</p></reply>

In the Irish context, there is no existing data to establish what that cost might be or the level of need for such a service. </p><p>  The absence of data for aeromedical support in the Irish context indicated the need for a pilot project, in order to assess the type and extent of service, if any, that might be required to support the National Ambulance Service (NAS).  In cooperation with my colleague Alan Shatter, Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, the Emergency Aeromedical Service, was initiated as a trial service in June of 2012, to gather this information and it will run for 12 months.  </p><p>  In current conditions, it is prudent to maximise the use of state resources wherever possible.  Accordingly, the trial project is being operated from within existing resources.  It involves the Irish Air Corps providing aeromedical support to the NAS, from Custume Barracks, Athlone, with flight and maintenance personnel.  The NAS is responsible for patient care, which is provided by advanced paramedics.  Assessment of the trial will inform future policy direction, and in the event that a decision is made to provide this type of service, how best to proceed operationally.</p></reply>

The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format will reveal the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals.

The intern year is an integral part of medical training and a medical practitioner cannot be fully accredited without it.   Under the provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 it is a matter for the HSE to assess, on an annual basis, the number of intern training posts required by the health service.  </p><p>  There were 572 intern posts available in Ireland for the July 2012 intake, an increase of almost 70 posts since 2007. All 2012 EU graduates from Irish medical schools who sought an intern post here that year and met the HSE eligibility criteria were successful in securing a post. Indeed, to date there have been sufficient posts for all EU graduates from Irish medical schools and a number of additional posts for some non-EU applicants. </p><p>  My Department is in regular contact with the HSE in relation to the issue of intern places with the aim, in so far as is possible, of providing a sufficient number of intern places for Irish/EU graduates from Irish medical schools.  It should be noted that under EU law intern posts must be open to graduates from other EU countries and the HSE has no control over the numbers applying. </p><p>  The Higher Education Authority has indicated that the number of medical graduates this year has not yet been finalised. However, the application process for internships commencing in July 2013 closed in November last. A total of 960 eligible applications were received, 652 from EEA applicants and 308 from non-EEA applicants. There is no separate figure available for Irish applicants. The final numbers that will proceed to the first round match have not yet been determined as the overseas candidates must pass the entrance test; meet the HSE English language requirements; provide a Basic Life Support (BLS) certificate; and pass their final year medical exams. Candidates applying from within Ireland must provide a BLS certificate and pass their final year medical exams. </p><p>  The HSE will have approximately 80 additional posts available for interns commencing their training in July 2013. In total there will be in the region of 650 places available for 2013 and the HSE consider that there will be sufficient capacity and funding to ensure that every EU graduate of the six Irish medical schools can access an internship this year.</p></reply>

In order to deliver on this commitment, the preparation of a new General Medical Services (GMS) contract with GPs will be required.  The Department and the HSE are currently examining the changes that need to be made to the GMS contract to facilitate the introduction of Universal Primary Care.</p><p>  In 2007, the Department received legal advice that both European Union and national Competition law preclude the fees payable to self employed health professionals being settled on a negotiated basis.  </p><p>  In August 2011, following contacts initiated by the Minister for Health, the Competition Authority advised on what the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) can and cannot do under Competition law.  The IMO can, for instance, negotiate non-fee related elements of the contract.  It can also present the views of GPs in the course of consultations on the contract, including matters relating to fees.  Competition law does, however, preclude the IMO from organising collective action by GPs, including collective withdrawal or boycotts, in order to force the State into paying more than it is willing to pay for GP services.  The key issue is that the Minister makes the final decision on what the State will pay under the contract.</p><p>  I have recently had discussions with the IMO during which I outlined the Government&rsquo;s policy in relation to free GP care.  I intend to engage in further discussions with the IMO once the legislation regarding the extension of free GP care is published.</p></reply>

The objective is to develop services in the community which will give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of general practitioners (GPs), nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and others.  </p><p>  At the end of December 2012, there were 426<b></b>  Primary Care Teams operating, i.e. holding clinical team meetings, involving GPs and HSE staff.  The 426 Teams provide services for almost 4 million of the population with 2,636 HSE staff members and over 1,692 GPs participating.  The HSE's 2013 National Service Plan commits to having 484 operational Teams in place by the end of this year.  An allocation of &#8364;20 million is set aside in the HSE's 2013 National Service Plan for approximately 250 Primary Care posts to strengthen primary care services.  The posts will be filled using the Resource Allocation model, based on deprivation and need, which was developed by the HSE's National Primary Care Office and Health Intelligence Unit.  Using this model, the HSE completed a detailed analysis of the numbers and distribution of public health nurses, registered general nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and speech and language therapists.  The analysis revealed considerable variation across the 17 Integrated Service Areas in ratios of health care professionals to population, and to population numbers in areas of high deprivation.  Based on this analysis, it proposed that the following additional posts be recruited to Primary Care Teams:</p><p>- 70 Public Health Nurses;</p><p>- 37 Registered General Nurses;</p><p>- 51 Occupational Therapists;</p><p>- 46 Physiotherapists;</p><p>- 47 Speech &amp; Language Therapists.</p><p>  It is the firm intention to have these posts filled as soon as possible in 2013.</p></reply>

As part of this work, cognisance was taken of the findings of the comparative review carried out by the Health Research Board (HRB) of independent hospital trusts in a number of countries and the factors identified as contributing most to successful trusts.  These considerations, and the comprehensive consultation process undertaken with stakeholders, have informed the development of recommendations on the formation of specific groups and arrangements for the management and governance of all groups.  These recommendations have been considered and endorsed by a Strategic Board composed of representatives with national and international expertise in health service delivery, governance and linkages with academic institutions.</p><p>  Lessons learnt from other jurisdictions as well as the learning gained from the operation of the hospital groups will be taken on board in creating the legislative framework for hospital trusts here.  The intention is, of course, that the trusts and the reformed health system within which hospital trusts will operate will be designed in a way that best suits Irish requirements and this will be done in a way that seeks to avoid difficulties encountered in other jurisdictions.</p></reply>

Part of the debate about the future of our health system overall has been about the most appropriate role for the private sector, and the balance to be drawn between it and the public and voluntary sectors.  The Government is committed to the continued development of a mixed health care system in Ireland, drawing on the strengths of all three sectors.  That said, we are committed to the development of a single-tier health service, in which the distinction between &lsquo;public&rsquo; and &lsquo;private&rsquo; patient is removed.  We can no longer accept a situation where patients can queue-jump because they can afford to pay for faster access.</p><p>  Within this context, I believe that the free market has an important role to play, provided that the system is regulated effectively to protect quality and to control costs. For example, private hospitals play an important role in delivering acute services in Ireland, and private companies also deliver community based services, such as home supports for older people.  The move to Universal Health Insurance will involve a very important role for the private sector, in which health insurers will compete for business in a manner designed to drive efficiencies and offer customers choice between funders of health care. While the overall approach to reform will be informed by the experience of other countries and best practice the system as a whole will be uniquely Irish.  Whatever the precise configuration of services as between public, voluntary and private, and whatever the exact role of a regulated free market within the system, my priority is to ensure that all patients and clients receive the best possible service for the lowest cost, in the setting that is most appropriate to their needs. The reform of our health system will be developed on these principles.</p></reply>

The report outlines the significant advances that have been made by BreastCheck in recent years and demonstrates the contribution that the continued investment in screening has made to outcomes such as improving cancer survival rates.  Breast cancer survival is now estimated at 80.7% (2004-2007), up from 75.1% (1998-2002).</p><p>  The health services continue to experience very significant budgetary challenges alongside increased demands for services. The savings targets to be achieved by the HSE are required in order to meet the Government's fiscal targets.  However, the BreastCheck Programme Report acknowledges that while there are challenges in the context of limited resources, the National Cancer Control Programme and the National Screening Service are committed to the continued provision of a world-class breast screening programme, which delivers a reduction in mortality from breast cancer for women in Ireland.</p><p>  In addition, my Department commissioned an Efficiency Review of the BreastCheck Screening Programme in order to prepare for the age extension of BreastCheck to women up to the age of 69 years, as provided for in the Programme for Government. The review makes a number of recommendations on how the screening process could be enhanced to increase the number screened. My Department will continue to work with the HSE to ensure that national priorities and Programme for Government commitments are met.</p></reply>

A total of 27 beef burger products were analysed.  The FSAI then arranged further intense testing of the samples to validate the correctness of the initial analysis and to quantify the amount of horse DNA in each sample - the results of these tests were received on 11 January 2013. These results showed that, of the 10 burgers found to contain horse DNA, one contained 29% horsemeat, another 0.3% and the remainder had less than 0.1%. Traces of horse DNA were also detected in batches of raw ingredients, including some imported from other Member States. The FSAI communicated this information to the Department of Health on the 14th January 2013. The FSAI confirmed at the time that there were no food safety issues. </p><p>  As this was not a food safety issue and there was no threat to public health it was proper that the Department of Agriculture, Food &amp; the Marine took the lead role with regard to the incident as they have primary responsibility relating to primary food processing. Accordingly, since the initial test results were confirmed, that Department has conducted further tests on numerous establishments to identify the exact source of the equine DNA and work is ongoing in this regard. Furthermore, the Minister for Agriculture, Food &amp; the Marine has initiated and led a rapid and collective response to the horsemeat incident in Europe in his capacity as President of Council of Agriculture Ministers.</p><p>  While this is not a food safety issue, officials from my Department are in daily contact with the FSAI in relation to the ongoing horsemeat incident in Europe to ensure there remains no threat to public health.  Since January, extensive sampling and testing of beef products by both regulatory authorities and the food industry has been undertaken. Testing is continuing in Ireland and elsewhere. A major EU wide programme of testing of beef products for the presence of equine DNA is now underway. While many sausage and black and white puddings are pork rather than beef based products, to date no evidence has emerged to suggest they are the subject of adulteration.</p></reply>

The HSE anticipates that all EU graduates from Irish medical schools who meet the eligibility criteria for intern posts and who desire to remain in Ireland for an internship starting in July 2013, will be accommodated within the Irish public health service. The HSE has in place formal agreements with the Intern Training Networks/Universities regarding the provision of the Medical Council accredited National Intern Training Programme. </p><p>  The main reforms of the intern year as recommended by the Report of the National Committee on Medical Education and Training (NCMET) have been implemented by the HSE in collaboration and consultation with the Medical Council and the relevant educational partners at both undergraduate and postgraduate level. The HSE has formal agreements in place with the recognised postgraduate medical training bodies in Ireland regarding the provision of specialist medical education and training to the Non Consultant Hospital Doctor (NCHD) cohort in Ireland.  These agreements set out the number of doctors to be trained by each training body both by year of training and by specialty.  This number is determined by the HSE following consultation with the training bodies and consideration of current and future workforce requirements for qualified specialists.</p><p>  The HSE also has formal agreements in place with the recognised postgraduate medical training bodies in Ireland regarding the provision of professional development programmes to NCHDs not engaged in specialist training in Ireland.  The objective of these programmes is to facilitate this cohort of doctors to maintain their professional competence.  In recent years the HSE has invested significantly in the expansion and development of existing and new specialist medical training programmes including the development of a basic specialist training programme in Emergency Medicine; the expansion and reconfiguration of specialist training in Anaesthesia; and an increase in GP training numbers from 120 per year to 157, in line with GP workforce requirements.  </p><p>  In addition, the HSE has implemented two scholarship programmes specifically targeting NCHDs in their latter stages of training. The first programme enables NCHDs to undertake specialist training in novel medical areas abroad with a view to returning and developing their new expertise within the Irish health service as specialists. The second programme supports NCHDs in undertaking an integrated PhD research programme with their higher specialist training, thereby further developing high quality relevant clinical research in Ireland.</p></reply>

As a first step on that journey, hospitals will be aligned within groups on an administrative basis. The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive the service reforms and provide the maximum possible benefit to patients.</p><p>  It is well recognised that the Rotunda Hospital provides leadership in maternity services obstetrics, midwifery, neonatology and gynaecology services to all of north Dublin and the northeast.  Strong clinical links with the Mater Misericordiae<font color="#0000FF"> </font>University Hospital, including joint consultant appointments, are a fundamental support to the work of the Rotunda, and this will continue in any configuration in which the Rotunda is required to operate. It is neither intended nor anticipated that the Rotunda will be constrained by being positioned within a particular group.  As well as its long standing links with the Mater, which can and should be retained, it would also be appropriate for the Rotunda to establish links with other hospitals to meet its future aspirations for sub-specialty development and to expand and consolidate the links which currently exist.</p><p>  With regard to the framework within which maternity services are delivered, the Deputy refers to the KPMG Independent Review of Maternity and Gynaecology Services in the Greater Dublin Area and to a review of maternity models of care. The KPMG report, which was completed in 2008, noted that Dublin&#8217;s model of stand alone maternity hospitals is not the norm internationally and recommended that the Dublin maternity hospitals should be co-located with adult acute services and that one of the three new Dublin maternity facilities should be built on the site of the new national paediatric hospital.  In regard to the review of maternity models of care referred to by the Deputy, work is currently ongoing in the HSE's Clinical Programme for Obstetrics and Gynaecology  on the development of models of care for maternity services, which includes a review of current models with the development of a proposal for future developments. Both the KPMG report and the review to be carried out by the Clinical Programme will inform the delivery of maternity services in Dublin and nationally, as appropriate. </p></reply>

There are currently two categories of eligibility for all persons ordinarily resident in Ireland i.e. full eligibility (medical card) and limited eligibility (all others).  Full eligibility is determined mainly by reference to income limits and is granted to persons who, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive, are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services to themselves and their dependents without undue hardship.  There is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with any specific illness.  There is a provision for discretion to grant a card in cases of &quot;undue hardship&quot; where the income guidelines are exceeded.  The HSE set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards where there are difficult personal circumstances.</p><p>  There is an emergency process for a person who is terminally ill, or in urgent need of medical attention and cannot afford to pay for it, that provides a card within 24 hours while the normal application process is completed.  Once a letter from the patient's GP or consultant is received stating that the person is terminally ill and the required personal details are provided, an emergency card is issued to that person for a six-month period.  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the Long Term Illness Scheme.</p></reply>

The FSAI will be leading the EU delegation at this meeting.  The Department of Health continues to attend meetings of the Irish Codex Advisory Committee.  The Department will meet with the FSAI prior to the May meeting to ensure that Irish health policy is reflected during those discussions.  In 2012, my Department requested the FSAI to conduct a national consultation on the display of calories on menus.  Over 95% of respondents expressed their support for this initiative.  I then wrote personally to a range of fast food restaurants requesting that they display calories on menus on a voluntary basis.  Recent monitoring information from the FSAI, found that almost half of the 19 fast food restaurants, coffee shops and catering companies are now displaying calories on menus.  I consider that this will help consumers to make healthier eating choices.  To assist the companies concerned, the FSAI has published technical instructions for Irish food business operators.  It is also in the process of developing a software tool to help Irish companies to count the calories in dishes that are on menus for more than 30 days per year.  The FSAI is currently conducting a large telephone survey and quality assessment evaluating the uptake of calorie menu labelling by Food Service Businesses in Ireland. The final survey results will be ready for publication in March 2013.</p></reply>

The National Audiology Review Group developed a comprehensive set of recommendations to address the inconsistencies and inadequacies in audiology services which are contained in the HSE Report of the National Review of Audiology Services published in April 2011.</p><p>  This report provides the blueprint for the planning, development and delivery of HSE audiology services, from new- born screening to assessment and management of adults and children with hearing problems, including cochlear implantation. That report included a recommendation that continued ring-fenced financial support be provided for the cochlear implant programme but at levels which allow for simultaneous bilateral implantation for children.</p><p>  Since then, the HSE Audiology Clinical Care Programme was formed to oversee the implementation of the recommendations detailed by this report.  Progress is being made on the modernisation of audiology services in Ireland with the introduction of a universal national programme of new-born hearing screening a key priority.</p><p>  Beaumont Hospital is the centre for delivering Ireland&rsquo;s national cochlear implant programme, with surgical provision for patients under six (6) years carried out in the Children&rsquo;s University Hospital Temple Street. While no dedicated programme for simultaneous or sequential cochlear implantation is being carried out in Ireland at this time, some bilateral implantation has already occurred for patients, mainly very young children with certain medical conditions such as a history of meningitis or blindness. It is estimated that there are approximately 200 children in Ireland today who may be suitable for a second implant. Not all suitable patients proceed with the second implant when appraised of all the issues involved.</p><p>  I am aware that Beaumont Hospital, HSE Management and the HSE&rsquo;s Audiology Clinical Care Programme have met recently to discuss a joint process to identify the options for developing and resourcing a programme of simultaneous and sequential cochlear implantation. An important element of this will be the development of clear clinical criteria to prioritise clients for assessment and follow on implantation.  The HSE has advised that these plans will be progressed through the HSE 2014 estimates process.</p></reply>

The service is provided by contracted dentists. As funding has been capped at the 2008 level of &euro;63 million, the HSE prioritises for treatment patients with special needs, high risk patients and those who have greater clinical needs. A free oral examination every calendar year and free emergency dental treatment with a focus on relief of pain and sepsis are available to all eligible patients, regardless of their medical condition.  This includes 2 fillings, all extractions and a number of complex treatments. </p><p>  The National Oral Health Office of the HSE issued Standard Operating Procedures to dental contractors in November 2011 to provide clearer guidance to them on the application of DTSS prior approval requests. The Standard Operating Procedures confirm that high risk patients are to be prioritised for approval for treatment. All fillings as required and  complex care including root canal treatment, gum treatment and dentures are available to such patients subject to prior approval by the HSE. </p><p>  If a patient is not deemed high risk or vulnerable and a filling has already been provided in the previous five years, a replacement filling on the same tooth is not approved. For patients who are high risk or vulnerable, a replacement filling may be approved if a satisfactory explanation as to the clinical necessity for the repeat treatment is given by the dentist.</p><p>  There are no waiting lists for this service.</p></reply>

Developments so far under the Programme include the opening of Rapid Access Clinics at four of these centres, including Beaumont, St James&rsquo;s, Galway and Limerick. The Rapid Access clinics are led by Advanced Nurse Practitioners (ANPs). Under the Programme, 10.5 (WTE) Advanced Nurse Practitioners (ANPs) have been recruited to lead these clinics so that a total of 12 ANPs are now in place across the four centres, delivering services on site and on an outreach basis.</p><p>  The two Epilepsy Monitoring Units (EMUs) planned for Cork and Beaumont under the Programme will increase pre-surgical evaluation capacity. Monitoring is required for those patients with the worst effects of epilepsy, and patients at these units will require 24/7 care. </p><p>  The staffing requirements to enable the units to be safely opened have been identified. I am advised that the staffing required for the unit at Beaumont includes five staff nurses, one consultant neurophysiologist and three technicians. I am advised by the HSE that, having secured recruitment approval from the National Control Group, Beaumont is progressing the recruitment of the posts necessary to support the service development. </p><p>  With regard to Cork, the HSE has advised that it is the intention of the Cork University Hospital management to open the EMU in Quarter 3 of this year and this will be included in the HSE South&rsquo;s 2013 Regional Service Plan.</p></reply>

The setting of this target has been made possible by the considerable work done by the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) working in conjunction with the SDU.  For the first time, clear and comprehensive data on outpatient waiting times is available (www.ptr.ie).  The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format reveals the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals. In the first instance, this allows resources to be targeted towards those patients who are waiting longest, to ensure that they are seen and assessed.  In parallel with reducing the numbers of longest waiters, the SDU will this year work with the HSE National Clinical Care Programmes to reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time. </p><p>  In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.</p></reply>

As a first step on that journey, hospitals will be aligned within groups on an administrative basis. The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive the service reforms and provide the maximum possible benefit to patients.</p><p>  It is well recognised that the Rotunda Hospital provides leadership in maternity services obstetrics, midwifery, neonatology and gynaecology services to all of north Dublin and the northeast.  Strong clinical links with the Mater Misericordiae<font color="#0000FF"> </font>  University Hospital, including joint consultant appointments, are a fundamental support to the work of the Rotunda, and this will continue in any configuration in which the Rotunda is required to operate. It is neither intended nor anticipated that the Rotunda will be constrained by being positioned within a particular group.  As well as its long standing links with the Mater, which can and should be retained, it would also be appropriate for the Rotunda to establish links with other hospitals to meet its future aspirations for sub-specialty development and to expand and consolidate the links which currently exist.</p><p>  The KPMG Independent Review of Maternity and Gynaecology Services in the Greater Dublin, which was completed in 2008, noted that Dublin&#8217;s model of stand alone maternity hospitals is not the norm internationally and recommended that the Dublin maternity hospitals should be co-located with adult acute services and that one of the three new Dublin maternity facilities should be built on the site of the new national paediatric hospital. The intention has been that the National Maternity Hospital should be relocated to St Vincent's, the Coombe to Tallaght and the Rotunda to the Mater, and the maternity hospitals have been working with the relevant adult sites to progress this. There will be early discussions with the maternity hospitals regarding their maternity /adult co-location plans in the context of the Government decision to build the new children&#8217;s hospital on the St James&#8217;s campus.  Notwithstanding this, I am committed to the intent of the report - that the Dublin maternity hospitals be located alongside adult acute services - while also bearing in mind the  need to plan for the provision of tri-located paediatric , adult and maternity services, as is the intention in relation to the new children's hospital.</p></reply>

There is an emergency process for a person who is terminally ill, or in urgent need of medical attention and cannot afford to pay for it, that provides a card within 24 hours while the normal application process is completed.Once a letter from the patient's GP or consultant is received stating that the person is terminally ill and the required personal details are provided, an emergency card is issued to that person for a six-month period.  The Programme for Government commits to reforming the current public health system by introducing Universal Health Insurance with equal access to care for all.  As part of this, the Government is committed to introducing, on a phased basis, GP care without fees within its first term of office. Primary legislation is required to give effect to Government commitment to introduce a universal GP service without fees.</p><p>Legislation to allow the Minister for Health to make regulations to extend access to GP services without fees to persons with prescribed illnesses is currently being drafted by the Office of the Attorney General and the Department and it will be published shortly. Implementation dates and application details will be announced in due course.  There are no plans to abolish the LTI scheme and give medical cards to patients with defined long term illnesses.</p></reply>

To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the Rural Transport Programme (RTP) was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA) with effect from 1st   April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context. </p><p>  I also established the National Integrated Rural Transport (NIRT) Committee in April 2012, comprising key stakeholders and chaired by the NTA, to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport. There is significant  scope for achieving greater levels of transport integration and coordinated delivery across a range of Exchequer funded local and rural transport services such as school and HSE transport services.</p><p>  I am very aware of the very valuable work done on the ground by the RTP Groups such as Westmeath Rural Transport in ensuring that the transport needs of their local community are being identified and delivered within available resources. However, given  resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the establishment of better alignment between the 35 RTP groups and local authorities, it is necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised. </p><p>  Work is underway to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective.  One of the proposals being examined is that the RTPs be &quot;aligned&quot; with local authorities and that a number of Coordination Units be established.  Discussions are taking place with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the County and City Managers Association and the Rural Transport Network in the context of aligning the new structure with the local authority structure.  I would emphasise that no decision has been taken but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to recommend a new structure later this year which will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs.</p><p>  I will be ensuring that any future structure for the rural transport programme will be based on community input, local flexibility and involving the voluntary sector.  Rural Transport by its nature is community-based and this will remain under any new structure.   While I can understand and fully appreciate that this creates a level of uncertainty for RTP groups, I am hopeful that the outcome will be a better service delivered more efficiently. I will work with all involved over the coming months to make any transition as smooth as possible.</p></reply>

However there is no separate allocation available towards this grant category.  Instead local authorities may use up to 7% of their Discretionary Grant towards local improvement schemes should they wish to do so.  The local contribution for these schemes has been increased to a minimum of 20% of the total cost of the project. Apart from this amendment the same eligibility rules apply for these schemes as heretofore.  If the Deputy has any particular suggestions with regard to guidelines, I would be happy to hear them.</p></reply>

Thereafter the new standardised digital photographic requirements will come into effect. The system that comes into place at that stage will be of significant benefit to consumers, as the processing will take place at the new front office centres will have longer open hours than under the current arrangments and will also be open on Saturdays. Furthermore, consumers will only be required to make one journey to get their license and won't be required to make a seperate journey to have a photograph taken, and one fee will cover the license and this will include the photography costs.</p><p>   I have no plans to provide compensation for such individuals as proposed by the Deputy. It should be noted that they can still use their equipment for photographs for other forms of identification. </p></reply>
