Niall Molloy.  In accordance with its terms of reference, this independent examination comprises two elements.  Firstly, Mr. McGinn is to examine the Review Team's report which, for legal reasons, cannot be put into the public domain in its current form, with a view to preparing a report which can be put into the public domain on any issues of public interest which may arise from the report.  Secondly, he is to identify matters, if any, of significant public interest or concern that would warrant examination by a further inquiry and in respect of which such further inquiry would have a reasonable prospect of establishing the truth.</p><p>  My priority is to allow Mr. McGinn to complete this process so that the maximum amount of information can be put into the public domain at the earliest possible date. At that point I will also of course fully consider the outcome of the examination concerning any further inquiry.  While Mr. McGinn's terms of reference do not stipulate a specific timescale, my understanding is that his work is well advanced and it is anticipated will be completed by the end of the summer.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-24a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014062400051#WRA00900"><p>I am, of course, deeply concerned at the distressing circumstances surrounding the operation of Mother and Baby Homes, including the Home at Tuam.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs recently announced the Government's intention to establish a Commission of Investigation to examine these complex issues.  An interdepartmental group has been established and has met on a number of occasions. The group is to bring a report to the Government shortly which will inform decisions on the terms of reference for this Commission.</p><p>  My Department is participating fully as required in this process, and, at my request, the Garda authorities have been of assistance in gathering certain information in respect of issues relating to the former St. Mary's Mother and Baby Home at Tuam.  This has involved inquiries in the local area concerning the site and its history, with a view to establishing an overview of the issues and identifying relevant sources of information which may be of assistance to the Commission once established.  These inquiries have confirmed that the area has been known locally as a burial ground for children who died while resident in the home and, although unmarked, has been cared for by local residents who have placed some memorial items there.  The site in question is owned by Galway County Council, having been part of the lands on which the housing estate adjoining the site was built.</p><p>  As part of these inquiries, Garda&iacute; have made informal contact with two men widely reported as having discovered remains at the site while playing there as children, and both have spoken to Garda&iacute; in relation to the location and circumstances of their discovery circa 1975.  To date no records have been identified suggesting that this discovery was reported to the police or the Coroner at the time, and the account of the two men in question does not recall any such involvement.  Garda&iacute; have also made informal contact with the Bon Secours Order, as the body who managed the former Home, to establish general background information, which may be of assistance to the work of the Commission.  Garda&iacute; have also met with the local historian whose research has called attention to the deaths at the Home.</p><p>  While these inquiries are ongoing and should be of assistance, the Deputy will appreciate, however, that the question of initiating a criminal investigation is a matter for the Garda authorities, and my understanding is that information which would warrant such an investigation has not at this point come to light.  Furthermore, and following Garda contact with the local Coroner, who is independent in carrying out his functions, my understanding is that circumstances which would give rise to an inquiry by him under the Coroner's Act have also not arisen.  In saying this I should of course make absolutely clear that while the question of any criminal or coroner's investigation is a matter for the relevant authorities, the need to carry out a broad inquiry into the circumstances at the Tuam Home, and at Mother and Baby Homes generally, is not in question and this is precisely what the Government has resolved to do in the form of a Commission of Investigation.</p></reply>

The ongoing work is informed by the findings and recommendations set out in the relevant modules of the Report of the Working Group on Medical Negligence and Periodic Payments including as they relate to Pre-Action Protocols and Periodic Payment Orders. Detailed consideration is being given to these matters and the complex legal issues that have arisen by my Department including in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of the Parliamentary Counsel.</p><p>In relation to aspects of the matters raised by the Deputy, which are the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Health, I am informed by the Department of Health that:</p><p>- Medical negligence<b></b>cases are primarily handled by the State Claims Agency, which manages the State&rsquo;s Clinical Indemnity Scheme (CIS). The Scheme&rsquo;s actuaries estimate that the cost of settling CIS claims in 2014 will be approximately 200 million Euro.</p><p>- A National Policy on Open Disclosure was developed jointly by the HSE and the State Claims Agency and launched in November 2013. The Policy is designed to ensure an open, consistent approach to communicating with patients when things go wrong in healthcare.</p><p>- Open Disclosure will also be provided for under Minister Reilly's Health Information Bill. The Bill will contain a range of information related measures designed to improve information management in the health system, patients&rsquo; rights to their information and patient care and safety. Given the changes in the Bill since its original General Scheme was approved by the then Government in 2009, it is planned that a revised General Scheme will be sent to the Government in the next few months with a view to publication in early 2015.</p><p>I should add that the Government has approved the drafting of the Heads of a Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill to implement the recommendations contained in the High Court Working Group Report on Periodic Payments Orders in catastrophic personal injury cases with respect to awards made against the State and agreed that the extension of the Bill to private defendants would be examined further in discussions between my Department and the Department of Finance.  A Working Group, comprising relevant Government Departments and State Agencies, has been established to progress a number of complex policy issues in order to progress to the drafting of this Bill. The Working Group is tasked with completing its work by the end of September this year at which time the General Scheme will be revised and, subject to Government approval, drafting will get going fully.</p><p>I am acutely aware of the human dimension and the urgency which is attached to the resolution of the PPO issue and the House can be assured that I have directed that this issue be treated as an absolute priority.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-24a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014062400051#WRA01300"><p>As I stated in response to Deputy Higgins, I am, of course, deeply concerned at the distressing circumstances surrounding the operation of Mother and Baby Homes.  As I have advised, last week the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs announced the Government's intention to establish a Commission of Investigation to examine these complex issues.  An interdepartmental group has been established and has met on number of occasion. The group is to bring a report the Government shortly which will to inform decisions on the terms of reference for this Commission.</p><p>  I understand that the Bethany Home as a mother and baby home will be included within the terms of reference.  While a final position has not been adopted as regards the Magdalen institutions, my primary concern is the interests of the women known to have been in these institutions and who have applied for benefits under the Magdalen scheme.  The facts available regarding Magdalen laundries have already been set out in detail in the McAleese report which exceeds 1,000 pages.  The women concerned have received an apology from the Taoiseach, have had the opportunity to relate their stories to both Mr McAleese and Judge Quirke and are entitled to receive a capital sum of up to &euro;100,000 depending on duration of stay as well as life long pension top up payments and access to medical services.</p><p>  The McAleese report did address the question of links between Mother and Baby Homes and Magdalen Laundries.  His statistical analysis of the known entry routes into Magdalen laundries for the period 1920 onwards showed that less than 4% of entries were from Mother and Baby Homes and Adoption Societies.  In the light of the above, there is a valid question as to how extending the terms of reference for mother and baby homes Commission of Investigation to include the Magdalene Laundries would be in the interest of or be of any benefit to the women in question.  Nonetheless, I can assure the Deputy this question will be reflected upon and considered carefully by Government in the context of setting the terms of reference for the Commission of Investigation, including on foot of the report.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-24a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014062400051#WRA01500"><p>The House will not need reminding of the consequences of gun crime, and will join with me, I am sure, in expressing our collective outrage at the appalling recent incident which resulted in a child being shot.  Our sympathy is with this young boy and his family, and as I outlined to the House last week, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is determined to bring to justice those involved.</p><p>  I can also assure the Deputy that gun crime generally is being tackled aggressively by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by means of a range of targeted and intelligence based operations, often disrupting and preventing incidents before harm is caused, as well as detecting and prosecuting those involved.  I recently discussed the challenges presented by this type of crime, and particularly its association with organised crime, with the Acting Commissioner, who outlined the substantial efforts being made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to identify and target those involved.</p><p>  In particular, the 2014 Policing Plan of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na sets outs this continued commitment to confront groups and individuals engaged in criminal activity, including by employing multi-disciplinary approaches and utilising all available resources and legislation.  Advanced analytical and intelligence methods are applied, and proactive high-visibility checkpoints, patrols and searches are deployed, coordinated with armed response capacity to ensure that such resources are focused on key locations and periods.  In addition to these enforcement measures, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also engages extensively with communities in a range of fora to address local concerns relating to crime and community safety, including the impact that organised crime can have at a community level.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also works closely with other law enforcement agencies to tackle the transnational dimension to organised crime, and there are substantial multi-agency operations in place to tackle drug trafficking, as well as other smuggling activity associated with organised crime.</p><p>  In relation to the statistics requested by the Deputy, as he will be aware, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) is responsible for the production of the official Recorded Crime Statistics and I have asked the CSO to compile and provide the Deputy with the specific statistics he has requested in his question insofar as they are available.  What I can tell the House is that the most recent figures, which are for the full year of 2013, show that the number of crimes where a firearm was involved reduced by more than 7%.  Total weapons and explosives offences were also down, by nearly 10%.  These figures should also be seen in the context of a general reduction in most categories of offences, reflecting well on the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

Under this legislation, an independent regulatory agency for the charitable sector is being established. The Charities Regulatory Authority will have extensive functions in the registration, monitoring and oversight of the charity sector. Arrangements are underway to establish the Authority formally by Ministerial Order in October of this year. As part of this work, the first meeting of the Charities Regulatory Authority Board took place on 29 May 2014.</p><p>An early priority for the new Authority will be the preparation and publication of a statutory register of charities. All registered charities will be required to provide reports to the Authority each year on their activities and these reports will be made available to the public. This will provide a much needed increase in transparency and accountability in the charitable sector, and will support the good practice in charity governance and management that is critical to a vibrant charity sector that commands the trust and confidence of donors and beneficiaries alike.  The Authority will also take on the functions of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland. The temporary website of the Authority is at .</p></reply>

This has necessitated the temporary redeployment of large numbers of Garda&iacute;, including specially trained personnel, from throughout the Western Region into the Belmullet District.</p><p>  The reality is that substantial Garda resources have to be tied up in the policing of protest activity at this location.  This has been necessary in view of the actions of some of the protestors, many of whom are not from the area and engage in acts of public disorder as well as damage to property. The action of some of the protestors was designed not just to register their disapproval of the work going on there but to try to prevent that work proceeding. The aim of these policing measures is to prevent public order offences and to ensure that people can go about their lawful business.  From 2011 to 2013, 38 defendants were brought before the courts for public order offences, criminal damage and assault on Garda&iacute; in connection with the protests at the Corrib site.  The total cost of policing these protests has now reached in excess of &euro;16m. This does not include the significant cost of the basic salaries of the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have performed duties at the Corrib Gas Project as these arise in the normal course.  Such expenditure comes at a time of economic difficulty for the State and when such resources could be put to far better use elsewhere.</p><p>  I am not aware of any basis on which I should initiate a public inquiry into what of its nature is a difficult policing operation.  It is, of course, open to persons to make complaints to GSOC.  In fact, GSOC has investigated in the region of 124 complaints against members of the force arising from policing at this location and that other matters remain under investigation by it.  In excess of 100 of these complaints have either been found by GSOC to be inadmissible or not to have disclosed breaches of discipline on the part of the members complained of, and that those that did indicate a breach of discipline on the part of the Garda member concerned related to the behaviour of the individual member rather than practices, policies or procedures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  As I have indicated previously, a review is ongoing on the effectiveness of the provisions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and Regulations made under the Act insofar as they relate to the oversight of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the powers and remit of the Ombudsman Commission. I have already indicated that I will bring forward very urgent legislation to strengthen the powers and remit of GSOC and this will allow GSOC to undertake reviews of Garda practices, policies and procedures on their own initiative.</p></reply>

I will forward that table to the Deputy.  According to those figures, the incidence of gun crime fell between 2003, when there were 500 incidents recorded, to 381 last year, fluctuating considerably over the intervening years, and falling by more than 7% last year.</p><p>  It is clear to all that gun crime has for some time been an inherent part of organised criminal activity in this jurisdiction, as it is in other similar countries.  This demands a robust response and this is precisely what is happening.  Considerable powers and investigative tools are available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to which we have recently added the DNA database legislation.  The Garda&iacute; make extensive use of these powers to tackle and disrupt organised crime, with persons regularly brought before the courts and substantial sentences handed down.  I can assure the Deputy that confronting organised crime and the harm it causes is a priority for the Government and will certainly be a priority for me as Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></reply>

As at 8 June 2014 there were 4,353 persons availing of direct provision accommodation in 34 accommodation centres across 16 counties. 1,109 (25%) made their initial asylum application up to 2 years ago while the remaining 3,244 (75%) made their initial application more than 2 years ago.</p><p>  I acknowledge that the length of time that residents spend in Direct Provision is an issue to be addressed.  The Direct Provision system is not ideal but it is a system which facilitates the State in providing a roof over the heads of those seeking asylum or seeking to be allowed, on humanitarian grounds, to stay in the State.  The Direct Provision system is inextricably linked to the surrounding international protection process.  By its very nature, the processing of applications for international protection is a solemn and complex task which does not always lend itself to achieving speedy outcomes.  The time needed to determine the outcome of any legal proceedings also impacts on the length of the process. </p><p>  A key priority for this Government is legislative reform aimed at establishing a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection and any other grounds presented by applicants seeking to remain in the State. Such reform would substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements and would provide applicants with a final decision on their application in a more timely fashion.  In consultation with my officials, I am reviewing the work done to date in respect of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill and will then decide on how best to progress the implementation of the Government's priorities, in particular to expedite those relating to the establishment of a single application procedure.</p></reply>

My Department has input into the process through the Inter Departmental Committee established by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  It is my understanding that Bethany Home will be included in the Commission of Investigation.</p><p>  My primary concern is the interests of the 500 or so women known to have been in Magdalen laundries and who have applied for benefits under the Magdalen scheme.  The facts available regarding Magdalen laundries have already been set out in detail in the McAleese report which exceeds 1,000 pages.  The women concerned have received an apology from the Taoiseach, have had the opportunity to relate their stories to both Mr McAleese and Judge Quirke and are entitled to receive a capital sum of up to &euro;100,000 depending on duration of stay as well as life long pension top up payments and access to medical services.</p><p>  I have seen no indication that these 500 women or a portion thereof wish to be called before a Commission of Investigation to give evidence and possibly be subject to cross examination.  Indeed all the indications to date have been that the women did not wish to go through such a process.  The McAleese report did address the question of links between Mother and Baby Homes and Magdalen Laundries.  His statistical analysis of the known entry routes into Magdalen laundries for the period 1920 onwards showed that less than 4% of entries were from Mother and Baby Homes and Adoption Societies.</p><p>  In light of the above, there is a question as to how extending the terms of reference for mother and baby homes Commission of Investigation to include the Magdalene Laundries would be in the interest of or be of any benefit to the women in question.</p></reply>

Those who carried it out displayed contempt for life itself and inflicted unutterable grief on those whose lives were brutalised by their actions.</p><p>  My predecessor met with members of the Omagh Support and Self-Help Group in July 2012, where they raised issues of concern with regard to events surrounding the bombing and presented a copy of a document setting out these concerns in support of its call for a public inquiry.  A detailed consideration of the matters raised, insofar as they relate to this State and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, had been carried out and was being finalised earlier this year.  Given the detailed and sensitive nature of the material in the document it required some time for those matters to be given proper consideration.</p><p>  However, in April of this year a man was arrested in Northern Ireland and has been charged with the 29 murders caused by the bomb at Omagh.  In these circumstances, it was considered appropriate and the safest course of action to postpone finalising consideration of the matters raised by the Omagh Group until the completion of the prosecution process in Northern Ireland.  This position has been communicated directly to the Omagh Group.  In our shared desire for those who carried out the atrocity at Omagh to face justice I believe we must all seek to ensure we do not do or say anything that could in any way be interpreted to interfere with that process.  I fully understand that the Group wishes to receive a response to its concerns and I am anxious to ensure that will take place as soon as is prudent.</p></reply>

The total number of committals to prison has also risen sharply during the same period from 11,934 in 2007 to 17,026 in 2012, an increase of over 43%.  2013 saw the first significant decrease in prison numbers since 2007.  There were 15,735 committals to prison in 2013 which was a decrease of 7.6% on the 2012 figure.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the primary role of the Irish Prison Service is to provide safe and secure custody for prisoners.  The Prison Service must accept all persons committed by the courts into custody and does not have the option of refusing committals.  As outlined in the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan, it is intended to align the capacity of our prisons with the guidelines laid down by the Inspector of Prisons in 2014, insofar as this is compatible with public safety and the integrity of the criminal justice system.  As of 20 June 2014, there were 4,001 prisoners in custody.  This figure was 99% of the Inspector of Prisons recommended total of 4,035.  The Three Year Strategic Plan also outlines a number of measures to be undertaken including the Community Return Scheme, a closer working relationship with the Probation Service, and a more structured approach to Temporary Release.</p><p>  I understand there has been some research particularly in the United Kingdom to support the view that longer prison sentences do cut crime and deter re-offending.  In an Irish context, the joint Irish Prison Service and Central Statistics Office Recidivism Study was published in 2013.  This ground breaking research provided a comprehensive analysis of the rate of recidivism among ex- prisoners.  The findings will help inform policy on the management of offenders and will assist in the formulation of new strategies aimed at reducing recidivism.</p><p>  Finally, the Deputy will be aware that a working group was established by my predecessor to conduct an all encompassing strategic review of penal policy. The Group was asked to examine the role of penal policy in crime prevention, sentencing policies, alternatives to custody, custodial accommodation and regimes, reintegration and rehabilitation as well as any special issues relating to female offenders.  The Group is expected to report shortly.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-24a.60.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014062400051#WRA04100"><p>At the outset, can I say that the matter of issuing a Deportation Order only arises where the person concerned is illegally present in the State including circumstances where they have not abided by their visa conditions or where they are in the State illegally and have left without notifying the relevant authorities.  There are a range of circumstances where this latter situation can arise including, for example, where the person&rsquo;s permission has expired and they subsequently leave the State without notifying the authorities or cannot provide documentary evidence of their departure.  The key issue is that the onus is on the person concerned to abide by the immigration laws, notify the authorities of their departure and provide documentary evidence as required.  Otherwise, the result is that a Deportation Order may be made in respect of them.</p><p>Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) provides for the making of a Deportation Order and also sets out the procedures to be followed where it is proposed to make such an Order against a named person. Where it is proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of a person, that person must be advised in writing to this effect and the reason(s) for the proposal must be stated. The person in question will be advised of their options, which must be exercised within a 15 working day period, and these options are (i) to leave the State voluntarily, (ii) to consent to the making of a Deportation Order or (iii) to submit written representations to the Minister setting out reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made.  In the majority of cases, persons faced with these options avail of the option referred to at (iii) above. In such instances, any representations submitted must be considered under a variety of headings set out in Section 3 (6) of the same Act.</p><p>In addition, a <i>refoulement</i>consideration must be carried out i.e. an assessment as to the safety of returning that person to their country of origin having regard for the political and human rights conditions prevailing in that country at that point in time. Consideration must also be given to the person&rsquo;s rights to a private and a family life, as provided for under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and to the rights of any Irish citizen child or children directly associated with the case.</p><p>Once all of these matters have been considered, a decision must be made to make a Deportation Order or to grant permission to remain in the State. Once a Deportation Order is made, this will be formally served on the person in question.  Against this background, the Deputy will appreciate that a decision to make a Deportation Order is not made until all relevant matters have been fully considered. </p><p>Where a Deportation Order is made in respect of a third country national person who has left the State, albeit without first notifying the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of their plans to leave the State, it would be open to such a person to apply for the revocation of the Deportation Order, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 (11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended).  All such applications are considered on their individual merits. In all instances, the information and documentation submitted in support of the application is considered in great detail before a decision is made to revoke or to affirm the Deportation Order.  Overall, I am satisfied that the current legislative and administrative arrangements in place for the making of deportation orders provides sufficient safeguards to ensure that such orders are only made in the appropriate circumstances.</p></reply>

However, the legal advice received during the enactment of this legislation pointed to the constitutional difficulties of making civil partnership identical to marriage.  As a consequence, it is not possible for civil partners to have the same legal entitlements and rights as married couples in all areas in the absence of an appropriate decision of the people in a referendum on marriage equality.</p><p>  However, the Government has sought, where possible constitutionally, to extend the rights of civil partners.  As the Deputy may be aware, the Government published the draft General Scheme of the Children and Family Relationships Bill on 30 January 2014. The General Scheme proposes a comprehensive reform of family law in fulfilment of the Government's commitment in the Programme for Government to modernise and reform family law so to address the needs of children and parents living in families which are not adequately covered by current legislation.</p><p>  The reforms proposed in the General Scheme include the possibility of extending a range of parenting responsibilities to civil partners and to cohabitants in relation to the biological or adoptive children of their partners or cohabitants.  The Scheme also provides for civil partners and cohabitants to obtain guardianship rights of the children of their partners or cohabitants where they are undertaking day-to-day care for the children.  In addition, the General Scheme proposes that civil partners and cohabitants would have maintenance liabilities towards the children of their civil partners where the children are being raised by them.  My aim is to proceed to drafting of the Bill as soon as possible, subject to Government approval, with a view to enactment in 2015, prior to a referendum on marriage equality.</p></reply>

I will meet with Minister Ford later this week in the framework of the regular meetings under the Intergovernmental Agreement on co-operation in criminal justice matters.  This will afford us an opportunity to discuss the broad range of productive North-South police and criminal justice co-operation which is taking place and which involves the Justice Departments, the police services and the other criminal justice agencies North and South, who are engaged in workstreams covering youth justice, victims issues, social diversity, registered offenders, probation and forensic science.</p><p>  On 29 May I met with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers MP, who is my British Government counterpart in respect of security-related matters in Northern Ireland.  The meeting provided us with an opportunity to review the security situation, in particular the persistent threat posed by paramilitary groups on this island, and also to reflect on the close and ongoing co-operation, particularly between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI, in dealing with this threat.  The two Governments are committed to supporting the police and security services in their vital work in this regard. </p><p>  While there is, understandably, a particular Garda operational focus on combating the paramilitary threat, there is also strong co-operation in combating serious organised crime, such as fuel and tobacco fraud, which adopts an interagency approach involving the police, customs and assets recovery services North and South working together.  The Garda&iacute; and the PSNI also work closely together across the range of other policing functions.</p><p>  I believe we can continue to enhance and develop such co-operation across the board in order to improve community safety for all on this island.</p></reply>

Direct provision provides for full board accommodation supports while a final decision is awaited by a person on their protection or any related leave to remain application.  As at 8 June 2014, there were 4,353 persons availing of direct provision accommodation and supports in 34 accommodation centres across 16 counties. The expenditure outturn for the accommodation costs incurred by RIA in the last five years is as follows:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Outturn</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;55.2m</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;62.3m</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;69.5m</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>&euro;79m</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>&euro;86.5m</td></tr></table></p><p>The 2014 Estimate Provision for RIA is &euro;51.9 million.  More detailed information on the breakdown of costs associated with the Direct Provision system can be found on the RIA website (at www.ria.gov.ie).</p><p>It should be noted that the direct provision system is only one element of the State&rsquo;s response to its international obligations on the asylum issue.  As well as educational, health and welfare costs, there is the asylum determination system itself, as well as the downstream judicial and policing costs.  All countries which take their responsibilities in this area seriously are faced with similar calls on their financial resources.  For example, it was estimated that in the period 2005 to 2009 inclusive, the total amount spent across the whole of Government on asylum seekers was &euro;1,275.31 million, of which &euro;424.43 million was spent on the direct provision system.</p><p>The numbers of asylum seekers residing in direct provision has reduced significantly in recent years. The current figure of 4,353 compared to the numbers residing in direct provision at its highest point in April, 2005 (8,080), shows that there has been a reduction of 46%, or 3,727 persons, in the intervening period. </p></reply>

These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services.</p><p>  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015. There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning through  Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes.  Other areas where there has been significant progress in prison education are in physical education, in the provision for higher education, in the arts and in preparing prisoners for release and supporting their transition to life, and often to education, on the outside.  A top priority for the Irish Prison Service is ensuring help for those with reading and writing problems and peer mentoring programmes are currently active in all of our prisons.</p><p>  As well as seeking to draw on best practice in adult and further education in the community, there has been a lot of curriculum development over the years that is specific to prison circumstances, such as courses on addiction, health issues and offending behaviour. </p><p>  The guiding principles which underpin the prisons' work and training service are to make available, work, work-training and other purposeful activities to all those in custody aiming to give useful skills and serve the purpose of promoting rehabilitation.  Training activities are chosen to give as much variety as possible and also to give opportunities for those in prison to acquire practical skills which will help them secure employment on release.  Vacancies are in the process of being filled by a combination of redeployment of Clerks under the Croke Park Agreement and a competition for promotion to Work Training Officer.  To date 110 Work Training Officers have been appointed and assigned to areas such as catering, laundry, industrial cleaning, industrial skills and gym.</p><p>  The Irish Prison Service has also been expanding the number of accredited courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years. Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies such as City and Guilds, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), and the Guild of Launders and Cleaners and the centralising of coordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled us to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification. </p><p>  On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison.  At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date. Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral. </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware records of prisoner participation in vocational training and education programmes are not maintained in such a way as to provide the information sought by the Deputy.  The manner in which records are collated does not allow us to differentiate between first-time offenders and repeat offenders.  However, from the records that are available I can inform the Deputy that figures  are compiled retrospectively and the latest available figures (07/04/14 - 11/04/14) show that an overall total of 1,789 offenders participated in Education activities which represents almost 40% of the prisoner population at that time.  </p><p>  Similarly an average of 1,073 prisoners engaged in vocational training activities each day in April and this represents 26% of the average prison population in that month.  It should be noted that a prisoner may participate in more than one activity. </p></reply>

In conducting this review, the Working Group was asked to examine the role of penal policy in crime prevention, sentencing policies, alternatives to custody, custodial accommodation and regimes, reintegration and rehabilitation and any special issues relating to female offenders.  The Group is expected to report shortly and I will take into consideration their recommendations when looking at the question of sentencing guidelines.</p><p>  As regards legislation relating to the criminal justice system, pre-legislative consultation on the General Scheme of the Criminal Procedure Bill is underway.  The primary aim of this Bill is to increase the efficiency and fairness in the trial process and to reduce delays in the criminal system generally.  It provides for new preliminary trial hearings to so that procedural arguments which arise during trials at present can be dealt with before a jury is empanelled, thereby saving time and allowing juries to focus on the facts of the case.  The General Scheme of the Bill deals with a number of other issues such as electronic transmission of warrants, more efficient use of videolink hearings and the provision of information to juries.</p><p>  The drafting of the General Scheme of a Bail Bill to modernise the law on bail is at an advanced stage in my Department.  I intend to bring proposals to Government on the matter soon, having regard to other legislative priorities.  It has, unfortunately, not been possible to progress this legislation as quickly as I had hoped due to other legislative imperatives.  While the primary aim of the proposed Bail Bill is to consolidate and update bail law, I will take the opportunity in this legislation to seek, as far as is possible, within the constraints of the Constitution and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, to restructure the law so that it has a focus on the protection of the individual and of the public.  The intention is that the new proposals will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided.</p></reply>

Direct provision provides for full board accommodation supports while a final decision is awaited by a person on their protection or any related leave to remain application.</p><p>As of 8 June 2014, there were 4,353 persons availing of direct provision accommodation and supports in 34 accommodation centres across 16 counties. Since Direct Provision was introduced, over 52,000 protection applicants have been accommodated by RIA.  In terms of numbers entering the system, several points need to be noted.  Firstly, not everyone who claims asylum seeks to be accommodated in the Direct Provision system.  Some protection applicants live on their own resources or live with friends or relatives.  Secondly, some who enter into the initial reception centre where they can be medically assessed and make their initial asylum application leave the accommodation system after a short while to stay elsewhere.  Thirdly, some persons seek re-accommodation in the Direct Provision system having lived outside it for some time.  </p><p>Therefore, it is assumed that the question refers to asylum applicants - either newly arrived or who had never previously lived in the Direct Provision system - being accommodated for the first time in the Direct Provision system.  Specific details in this respect are available for the past five years as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>No. of persons claiming asylum during the year</th><th>No. of persons being accommodated in the Direct Provision system for the first time during the year</th></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>2,689</td><td>2,062</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>1,939</td><td>1,391</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>1,290</td><td>909</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>956</td><td>715</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>946</td><td>727</td></tr><tr><td>Up to 8 June, 2014</td><td>515</td><td>404</td></tr></table></p><p>In relation to the part of the question about those persons awarded citizenship, records are not kept in such a manner that would allow the identification of former direct provision residents.</p><p>The numbers of asylum seekers residing in direct provision has reduced significantly over recent years. The current figure of 4,353 compared to the numbers residing in direct provision at its highest point in April, 2005 (8,080), shows that there has been a reduction of 46%, or 3727 persons in the intervening period. </p><p>The operation of the Direct Provision system is kept under review and I acknowledge that the length of time that residents spend in Direct Provision is an issue to be addressed.  I have no desire for applicants to remain in the protection system any longer than the minimum period it takes to process their case.  The Direct Provision system is not ideal but it is a system which facilitates the State in providing a roof over the head of those seeking asylum or seeking to be allowed, on humanitarian grounds, to stay in the State.</p><p>A key priority for this Government is legislative reform aimed at establishing a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection and any other grounds presented by applicants seeking to remain in the State . Such reform would substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements by removing the current multi-layered and sequential processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their application in a more straightforward and timely fashion.  In consultation with my officials, I am reviewing the work done to date in respect of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill and will then decide on how best to progress the implementation of the Government's priorities, in particular to expedite those relating to the establishment of a single application procedure. </p></reply>

In this context, the Bill will include a statutory framework for warning individuals who may be put at risk by convicted sex offenders.

The Council discussed the current economic situation in Member Administrations. It also discussed the various initiatives that are in place to stimulate the economy.  The Council reviewed the latest youth employment statistics, welcomed the recent encouraging trends and acknowledged the value that focussed discussion on the economy had on the overall work of the BIC.  The Council had a detailed discussion on the economic importance of transport links focussing on how the promotion of effective transport links between Member Administrations can be beneficial to their economic development. </p><p>  The Council also received an update of the work that had taken place across each of the twelve work sectors since the last Summit in November 2013.

Richard Haass and Meghan O&rsquo;Sullivan consulted widely across society in Northern Ireland last year and brought to the table a clear message from the people that they want to see the party leaders finding new, comprehensive and credible ways of dealing with legacy issues.  I agree with Dr Haass&rsquo;s assessment that there is deep and wide public support for these issues to be dealt with in a comprehensive way.  I have witnessed this at first hand during my visits to the North.  The Northern Ireland Party Leaders have individually acknowledged that there is broad agreement among the parties on the basic architecture for moving forward on each issue.  They are continuing to meet, including a meeting scheduled to take place today, with a view to closing the remaining gaps between them and for developing the practical mechanisms and related timeframe for implementation.</p><p>  It is in the best interests of Northern Ireland that agreement is reached now.  It is particularly important in advance of the marching season and the summer recess that politics is seen to be working in the best interests of all communities in the North.  There have been several instances over recent months where the legacy of the past has seriously disrupted political and community life in Northern Ireland.  It is clear from my contacts with business leaders that they are concerned at the broader economic and social consequences of the lack of political progress in recent months in addressing these legacy issues.</p><p>  In Washington DC last week, I heard genuine concern being expressed by political, business and community leaders on the need for progress in the Party Leaders talks, which the United States government regards as very important in themselves, and which they recognise are also hampering progress and decision-making across a broad range of Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly business.</p><p>  In my ongoing meetings and contacts with the Party Leaders and the Secretary of State, most recently on 9 June in Belfast, I have stressed the importance of securing an agreement on the outstanding issues.  I underlined that the people of Northern Ireland expect politics to deliver tangible outcomes that improve their lives.  I remain committed to doing everything possible in the time ahead to ensure that real progress is achieved.  As I said yesterday on the occasion of the award of the Tipperary Peace Prize to Dr Haass, his work last year represents a solid foundation for the agreement that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s leaders must deliver.</p></reply>

My officials in the British Irish Joint Secretariat in Belfast closely monitor the situation on the ground and maintain regular contacts with political and community leaders who work to manage and to resolve parade related difficulties.  Thanks to such community work and dialogue, the vast majority of parades pass without incident.  Last year, for example the Parades Commission dealt with over 4,000 notifications of parades, of which 146 were contentious and required Parades Commission determinations.</p><p>  Contentious parades in Northern Ireland give rise to annual concerns and they heighten sectarian tension at community level.  In the past, disagreements over some contentious parades have spilled over into street violence, have deepened division and have put the Police Service of Northern Ireland in harm&rsquo;s way.  There is considerable concern about the prospects for this year&rsquo;s marching season, particularly centered on the current impasse in relation to the Ardoyne/Woodvale/Twadell parading issue.  I welcome all the work that has been underway at community level in recent months to try to overcome the serious concerns about those contentious parade issues.  The Church led talks initiative, in particular, is to be commended.  Sustained, meaningful dialogue to resolve difficulties is the key to a peaceful and honourable resolution of these issues.</p><p>  While seen as a local issue, the Parades impasse in North Belfast goes to the very heart of the challenges of building support for reconciliation and a shared society in Northern Ireland.  Therefore, resolving the Ardoyne/Woodvale/Twadell issues through agreement is important - not only for the communities in North Belfast but for the people of the Northern Ireland more generally.  I would therefore call on all the party leaders to actively encourage and support local efforts to resolve the contentious parades problem in North Belfast.  A resolution of the parades issue is essential for politics to be seen to work and could build momentum for the early completion of the wider talks process on parades, flags, and dealing with the past.  The memory of the dreadful violence of previous summers; the memory of the harm done to PSNI and local communities; and the real damage done to Northern Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation by street violence in previous summers, makes early efforts to reach agreement in North Belfast both necessary and urgent.</p></reply>

As part of that transformation in policing, accountability mechanisms are in place for the Service, including the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Policing Board.  The Policing Board is an independent public body made up of Political and Independent members tasked with ensuring an effective, efficient, impartial, representative and accountable police service which commands the confidence of the whole community.  The Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s office also offers an impartial system for the handling of complaints about the conduct of police officers.

The list has been prepared according to the information available to my Department and aims to be as comprehensive as possible.  There are 83 agreements on the list: 20 Multilateral agreements for which the UN Secretary General is the depositary; 16 Council of Europe agreements; 32 EU agreements; 7 Other multilateral agreements; and 8 Bilateral agreements.</p><p>The two-step process whereby a state will first sign an international agreement, subject to ratification, is the usual manner in which international agreements are concluded.  This interval permits states to take whatever legislative or administrative measures are required to fulfil obligations assumed under the agreement.  The signing of an agreement may be an important demonstration of a state&rsquo;s support for it, pending its ratification when in a position to do so.  The alternative would be to refrain from signing the agreement at all, which may be interpreted as a lack of support for the agreement.  In this regard, there is nothing unusual, or wrong in principle, in having some time period between signature and ratification, and the length of time required may depend on the complexities of the particular issues involved.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, Article 29.6 of the Constitution provides that international agreements do not form part of the domestic law of the State unless the Oireachtas so provides through the enactment of legislation.  This is what is known as a &ldquo;dualist&rdquo; approach to international agreements.  In contrast, for some states, ratification of an international agreement automatically incorporates the terms of that agreement into its domestic law.  Such states may be in a position to ratify agreements more quickly than dualist states such as Ireland.</p><p>As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I have an important role in relation to all international agreements entered into by Ireland.  Before a treaty may be signed, ratified or acceded to, it is necessary to obtain an authorising Government Decision.  As the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 designates the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade as the Minister responsible for external relations, all Memoranda for the Government concerning international agreements (other than International Labour Organisation Conventions) are brought by me, irrespective of their substantive content.  Where the agreement is the functional responsibility of another department, as is usually the case, the Memorandum is brought by me on behalf of the relevant Minister.  Therefore, while my Department has a central role in relation to signing and ratifying international agreements, it is often the case that the necessary legislative or administrative measures required to implement them are for the line Department responsible for the subject matter of the agreement.  Line Departments, in taking steps to ratify an agreement, will consult with my Department as the ratification process develops to ensure that important procedural steps are followed.</p><p>My Department annually publishes all international agreements that enter into force for Ireland in the Irish Treaty Series, which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, and lays them before this House.  A notice of all agreements laid is also published in Iris Oifigi&uacute;il.  I have asked my officials to ensure that a list of the international agreements which have been signed but not ratified by Ireland be published on the Department&rsquo;s website by the end of the year and updated annually. </p><p>List of International Agreements signed by Ireland, but not Ratified</p><p>[1] Multilateral Treaties deposited with the Secretary General of the United

I have also raised my concerns at this individual&rsquo;s continued detention without trial with the then Egyptian Foreign Minister, Nabil Fahmy, on 11 November and 23 December 2013.  I followed up these phone calls with a letter to Minister Fahmy in January, expressing my continued concern at this individual&rsquo;s detention.  The Minister for European Affairs Paschal Donohoe, T.D. met with Foreign Minister Fahmy, on 11 June 2014 in Athens, on the margins of the EU-League of Arab States Ministerial meeting.  The Minister raised the ongoing detention of the individual and requested that all appropriate assistance might be provided to him and his family arising from our serious concerns over his case.</p><p>  From the outset, Ambassador Isolde Moylan and her colleagues in the Embassy of Ireland in Cairo have been in sustained and direct contact with the Egyptian authorities in relation to the case and contacts have included numerous meeting at Ambassadorial level with senior officials from the Foreign Ministry, Ministry of Justice and the office of the Prosecutor General.  Also, on 12 March 2014, the Minister for Justice wrote to the Egyptian Minister for Justice Abdel-Moneim Othman, raising the Government&rsquo;s concerns at the individual&rsquo;s situation and requesting the opportunity to speak about this case as soon as possible.</p><p>  I have worked with the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, to ensure maximum engagement at EU level.  As advised already, as recently as 9 May, I wrote to Ms. Ashton to raise this case.  At my request, Minister of State Paschal Donohoe, T.D. raised this individual&rsquo;s case in person with High Representative Ashton at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Brussels on 12 May.  High Representative Ashton had confirmed that the EU is both acutely aware of, and closely monitoring, this individual&rsquo;s situation.  The European External Action Service delegation in Cairo has raised the case during official contacts.  The EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Stavros Lambrinides, mentioned the case during separate meetings with the Egyptian Foreign Minister and the Prosecutor General in Cairo on 9 February.</p><p>  From the beginning, the Consular Section in my Department has been actively liaising with the family of this individual and the Head of Consular Section in Dublin met with family representatives on 17 August, 19 September, 24 October and 16 December 2013, 16 January, 6 March, 1 and 21 May 2014.  Also, the Embassy in Cairo has been allowed regular consular access to this individual and consular visits were made by the Embassy on 24 August, 8 September, 15 September, 10 October, 24 October, 30 October, 10 November, 21 November, 3 December and 18 December 2013 and 8 January, 26 January, 13 February, 23 March, 9 April, 5 May and 9 June 2014.</p><p>  In all dealings with the authorities the Embassy has sought to stress the individual&rsquo;s young age, the length of time he has already been in detention, and the necessity for him to return to Ireland as soon as possible to continue his studies for his Leaving Certificate examination as mitigating factors in his case in addition to the fact that his three sisters who were part of the same case and with him when he was arrested have already been allowed to return to Ireland.  However, as you will be aware, the individual named is still before the judicial system in Egypt and we are precluded from getting involved in the judicial process.  Let me assure you that I continue to remain seriously concerned at the continued detention of this individual and have directed that the Irish Embassy in Cairo and the Consular Assistance Section at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continue to give all appropriate consular assistance.</p></reply>

Support to development education is an integral element of this work.  The Non-Governmental Organisation referred to, Kerry Action for Development Education, received funding of &euro;20,000 from Irish Aid under the 2014 Development Education Annual Grants call.  The purpose of the annual grants is to provide support for the implementation of innovative, results focused initiatives that support the achievement of objectives set out in Irish Aid&rsquo;s Development Education Strategy 2007-2015.  Forty-two applications were received under the grants call in 2014.  A total of &euro;1.15 million was allocated to 30 successful organizations.  This allocation was in line with the allocation for 2013.  The Development Education Annual Grants Call is a competitive process.  Grants are awarded based on the recommendations of a Development Education Grants Committee, which comprises independent consultants, a representative of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and members of the Development Education Section in Irish Aid, in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Input is also received from the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>  On the basis of the appraisals undertaken by the external consultants, the Committee reviews all proposals.  In making recommendations for funding, it also considers issues of financial sustainability, alignment with Irish Aid&rsquo;s strategic priorities, the development education approach and the organisation&rsquo;s previous grant record.  I am satisfied that the appraisal of all applications for funding was carried out fairly and independently, ensuring that all applicant organisations were assessed for grant allocations in a fair and consistent manner.  It is open to all applicant organisations to discuss the outcome of their grant application with officials in my department.</p></reply>

Access to quality education is one of the priorities of the programme, as reaffirmed in our new Policy for International Development, <i>One World, One Future </i>published in May 2013<i>.  </i>At a global level, Irish Aid provides support to education, both directly to the education sectors of selected Key Partner Countries and through the Global Partnership for Education and civil society partners.  Ireland is also working internationally to ensure a continued focus on good quality education, at primary level and beyond, in the context of the negotiations at the UN on the follow-up framework to the Millennium Development Goals, post-2015.</p><p>At a national level, Irish Aid provides strong support for development education.  We take a strategic approach, with targeted funding support in a number of areas.  These include the development of a number of partnerships to support the implementation of the Irish Aid Development Education Strategy 2007-2015.  We have developed partnerships focused on initial teacher education, post-primary schools and capacity building for the development education sector.  In addition, support is provided through annual grants for the implementation of innovative, results focused initiatives that support the achievement of the Development Education Strategy.</p><p>Officials from my Department who manage Irish Aid&rsquo;s development education work are also actively involved in the Global Education Network Europe, a network of EU member States.  GENE works to assist national Governments in improving their approaches to development education and provides an important peer learning support function for all members.  To underline the importance we attach to development education, two advisors with development education expertise have recently been appointed to the Irish Aid Expert Advisory Group, the independent group which provides external advice on the Irish Aid programme.  I am confident that Irish Aid will continue to draw on best practice in its approach to global education, both in our partner countries, at multilateral level and at home.</p></reply>

The Fiscal Council's analysis and recommendations are being considered by my Department, and will feed into the preparation of its updated economic and fiscal projections in the Budget.  As is my usual practice, we will be publishing a comprehensive response to this report.</p><p>  Firstly, it is important to note that the report stated that the fiscal stance remains conducive to prudent economic and budgetary management and that the Government is complying with the fiscal rules.  The Council recommends that there should be no deviation from the &euro;2 billion consolidation in 2015.  Let me be clear.  The Government has repeatedly said that it will do whatever is necessary to ensure that the 3% of GDP target will be met.  Ireland has consistently met or exceeded the fiscal targets to date and Budget 2015 will set out the measures necessary to achieve this goal.  The composition of Budget 2015 measures will be finalised in the context of budgetary discussions, informed by the latest economic and fiscal data.</p><p>  The Council also states that the Government's recently published fiscal adjustment plans for 2016-18 appear to go beyond the minimum requirements of the new fiscal framework.  The rules specify the need to make progress towards the medium term objective (MTO) of a balanced budget after taking into account the impact of the economic cycle (i.e. in structural terms).  In particular, the preventive arm sets out the requirement for an annual correction in the level of the structural balance (an improvement of 0.5 per cent per annum as a benchmark), without specifying when this position should be achieved.</p><p>  In contrast, the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the EMU (sometimes referred to as the 'fiscal compact') tasked the European Commission with producing an actual timetable for participating Member States to achieve their MTOs.  Last summer, the Commission outlined that Ireland should achieve its MTO by 2018.  On this basis, the April 2014 Stability Programme Update set out a path for achieving a balanced budget by 2018.  Until the 2014 Country Specific Recommendations (CSRs) are formally adopted by the European Council (early July), Ireland remains subject to the requirement of meeting the 2018 deadline.</p><p>  Following discussions on the necessary consistency between the fiscal compact and the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), and ahead of the formal adoption of the 2014 CSRs, the European Commission has clarified that the deadline for MTO achievement is not fixed but the required annual improvement in the structural balance is.  Consistent with SGP rules, Member States not at their MTOs must improve their structural balance by at least 0.5 per cent of GDP per annum.</p><p>  So, in summary, last year the requirements of the fiscal compact set out a deadline for MTO achievement, whereas from this year onwards, the focus will be on the required fiscal effort.  Therefore, once the 2014 CSRs are formally adopted, we will no longer need to reach a balanced budget by 2018; instead, we will have to deliver the required annual improvement in the structural balance.</p></reply>

In relation to the remaining residential mortgage loans the Special Liquidators will now devise and manage a further sale process in respect of these unsold assets in a manner that maximises the return to all remaining creditors of IBRC, including the State.  Those borrowers whose loans have not yet been sold will be receiving communication from the Special Liquidators over the coming weeks.</p><p>  I have been informed by the Special Liquidators that the sale of a residential mortgage does not change the terms and conditions of the loan agreement in any way.  Irrespective of who acquires the loan(s) they will be required to honour the legal terms and conditions of the existing loan agreement(s), including previous restructuring arrangements put in place as well as offers made to customers prior to the sale.  The terms and conditions of a mortgage continue to apply on the sale of the mortgage and the lender may have discretion with regard to the interest rate charged depending on  these terms and conditions.  As Minister for Finance, I do not regulate interest rates and this situation applies to both regulated entities such as the banks and unregulated entities.  The Government is keenly aware of the concerns raised by the Central Bank and others regarding the potential loss of protection under the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA).  The Government is committed to bringing forward legislation that will protect mortgage holders and believes the sale of loan books to unregulated third parties Bill is the most effective way to address the issue in a comprehensive manner.  The legislation will ensure the protection of the CCMA or any replacement code in the future will continue to apply to mortgages which are sold to unregulated financial service providers.</p><p>  In  the interim the Government has always been clear that we fully expected that any purchaser of the IBRC mortgage portfolio would service the loan books in accordance with the CCMA.  The two purchasers of the IBRC residential mortgage loans to date, Loanstar and Oaktree, have both committed to servicing these books in accordance with the terms of the CCMA.</p></reply>

The banks are highlighting the lack of supply of houses in particular urban areas as a contributing factor for the lack of drawdown of approved mortgage facilities.  I would look upon the development of this initiative as being an aid to encouraging and facilitating the supply of new homes particularly for young families.</p><p>  In other jurisdictions, such as the UK and Canada, &quot;mortgage insurance&quot; markets have been developed to support bank mortgage lending, particularly to 'First Time Buyers'.  Mortgage insurance allows banks to share the risk of mortgage lending, either with the public sector or with private sector insurance companies with the aim of increasing bank lending in general or to target groups.</p><p>  My Department is committed, under 'Construction 2020 A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector', to examine the concept of a mortgage insurance scheme and how it might benefit new housing completions in the Irish market.  The objective of any scheme would be to ensure adequate availability of mortgage finance on affordable terms for new completions, particularly for 'First Time Buyers', as the economy recovers.  In doing so we would aim to provide the certainty needed to support greater levels of investment in new housing, with the associated benefits for the construction sector and ultimately for the consumer.</p><p>  As the Construction Strategy mentions, my Department is undertaking an economic impact analysis which will assess the impact such a scheme would have on the Irish housing market, taking into consideration time limits, targeting 'First Time Buyers' or owner occupiers and focussing on new housing.  I would like to assure the Deputy that the points he raised will be considered during the analysis process.  The analysis will draw lessons from mortgage insurance initiatives undertaken in other countries and will include questions as to the appropriateness of a price cap as well as regional or geographic restrictions.  Once this analysis has been completed and presented to me I will consider next steps.</p></reply>

The primary objective of these requirements is to ensure that claims made in respect of policies issued will be adequately provided for by an insurance undertaking. </p><p>  Under Article 20 of the Third Non-Life Directive the Home Regulator is required to notify the Host Regulator (in case the Central Bank of Ireland) if the solvency margin of an undertaking falls below the statutory requirement.  In such instances the Home Regulator, i.e. the MFSA should inform the Host Regulator, i.e. the Central Bank of Ireland, of the measures it has taken to address the solvency deficit.  EEA insurance regulators are also members of EIOPA (European Insurance &amp;amp; Occupational Pensions Authority) and are required to comply with the General Protocol relating to the collaboration of the insurance supervisory authorities of the Member States of the European Union.  This general protocol statement was issued in 2008 and is currently under review by EIOPA.</p><p>  In my role as the Minister for Finance I have responsibility for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  The day to day responsibility for the supervision of financial institutions is a matter for the Central Bank of Ireland, which is statutorily independent in the exercise of its regulatory functions.  I have consulted with the the Central Bank on this matter and they have informed me that the Central Bank co-operates on an ongoing basis with peer regulators on matters of mutual interest.  This includes the MFSA. </p><p>  In response to the Deputy's specific question, neither I nor my officals have at any time been advised that the MFSA was unable to have a meaningful engagement with the Central Bank of Ireland in regard to Setanta.  The Central Bank had Regulator to Regulator contact with the MFSA in September 2013 and in October 2013 the Central Bank undertook a consumer protection inspection of Setanta.  The Central Bank became aware of prudential issues in the course of this investigation and subsequently shared these with the MFSA in November 2013. At this point the Central Bank entered into a phase of heightened contact with the MFSA in relation to these issues.  Regular contact was maintained in the following months, and in January 2014 an announcement was made that the firm would cease writing new business and issuing further renewals.</p></reply>

Once the excessive deficit is corrected, Ireland will be subject to the requirements of the preventive arm of the SGP.  The rules specify the need to make progress towards the medium term objective (MTO) of a balanced budget after taking into account the impact of the economic cycle (i.e. in structural terms).  In particular, the preventive arm sets out the requirement for an annual correction in the level of the structural balance (an improvement of 0.5 per cent per annum as a benchmark), without specifying when this position should be achieved.</p><p>  In contrast, the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the EMU (somethimes referred to as the 'fiscal compact') tasked the European Commission with producing an actual timetable for participating Member States to achieve their MTOs.  Last summer, the Commission outlined that Ireland should achieve its MTO by 2018.  On this basis, the April 2014 Stability Programme Update set out a path for achieving a balanced budget by 2018.  Until the 2014 Country Specific Recommendations (CSRs) are formally adopted by the European Council (early July), Ireland remains subject to the requirement of meeting the 2018 deadline.</p><p>  Following discussions on the necessary consistency between the fiscal compact and the SGP, and ahead of the formal adoption of the 2014 CSRs, the European Commission has clarified that the deadline for MTO achievement is not fixed but the required annual improvement in the structural balance is.  Consistent with SGP rules, Member States not at their MTOs must improve their structural balance by at least 0.5 per cent of GDP per annum.</p><p>  So, in summary, last year the requirements of the fiscal compact set out a deadline for MTO achievement, whereas from this year onwards, the focus will be on the required fiscal effort.  Therefore, once the 2014 CSRs are formally adopted, we will no longer need to reach a balanced budget by 2018; instead, we will have to deliver the required annual improvement in the structural balance.</p></reply>

Under the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code, banks are required to give a minimum of 2 months' notice before they close a consumer's account.  It is important that consumers are given adequate notice to allow them to take the required steps to close or transfer their accounts.  I am not aware of particular difficulties being experienced by the bank's customers in relation to the withdrawal. </p><p>  In March 2014 the Government affirmed its commitment to bringing forward legislation to protect consumers whose mortgages are sold to unregulated entities.  My officials have been in constant contact with the Central Bank and the Office of the Attorney General to develop the draft heads of this  legislation.  I can assure the House that the Government remains committed to bringing forward this legislation at the earliest possible date.</p></reply>

As part of the handover process, Revenue received the HHC Register from the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) and cross-referenced it with its own LPT Register to identify a list of properties for which the HHC was still outstanding. Once the list of properties was compiled, Revenue wrote to the property owners concerned advising them to either pay within a specified period of time or confirm the reasons as to why the liability was not due, for example if a property was exempt from HHC. </p><p>  In regard to the specific case to which the Deputy refers, Revenue has confirmed to me that the person in question is fully compliant with his LPT obligations for both 2013 and 2014. However, according to Revenue's records, payment was not received in respect of the arrears of HHC and a liability of &euro;200 remains outstanding.</p><p>  Revenue has confirmed to me that a member of the LPT team has already been in contact with the daughter of the person in question and it has been clarified that the credit transfer payment of 3 February to which the Deputy refers related to a different liability and was not connected to either HHC or LPT.  On foot of the conversation between the person's daughter and the LPT tem member, arrangements are now in place for the person to pay the &euro;200 HHC liability through one of the approved Payment Service Providers.</p></reply>

Permanent TSB continues to work to enhance the value of our investments through the continued delivery of the Restructuring Plan, which will, if delivered, provide the State with more optionality regarding the future structure of Permanent TSB.  </p><p>  During 2013 Permanent TSB grew its presence and activity in the retail market in general and in the current account and deposit markets in particular, as well as in mortgages and term lending; and it launched several new products during the year.  Permanent TSB has also made progress in relation to managing its portfolio of mortgages in arrears. I am advised by Permanent TSB that during 2013 it made approximately 18,000 offers of long term sustainable solutions to customers in arrears or having difficulty with their mortgage repayments.</p><p>  The strategy for Permanent TSB is to be an independent bank, competing within targeted segments of the retail banking market, and I will continue to support the board and management in the delivery of that strategy.  While I am strongly supportive of Permanent TSB in the delivery of their strategy I cannot discount the possibility that a strategic transaction could arise opportunistically at any time involving Permanent TSB which could be in the best interests of the State.  As part of their day-to-day role my officials will consider all credible proposals and strategic options relating to our banking investments.  </p><p>  As I have stated previously in addition to the many initiatives the Government is undertaking relating to non-bank credit I would like to see more competition in the domestic banking system to provide the lending required for our growing economy and that as part of that process I would welcome the participation of foreign banks in Ireland, possibly by way of  partnership with some of our domestic banks.</p></reply>

Ireland applies the 13.5% reduced VAT rate to bakery goods and catered food, while the standard VAT rate of 23% applies to alcohol, soft drinks, confectionary and snacks.</p><p>  In addition, Member States can retain historical zero-rated VAT treatment under Article 110 of the EU VAT Directive, where a good or service was zero rated on and from 1 January 1991.  Ireland applies the zero rate to most food. In this context, it is not possible to apply the zero rate to any new food and drink items that have not already applied at the zero rate, and where a decision is made to apply a positive VAT rate to food that is currently zero rated, it would not be possible to reintroduce the zero rate to that food. </p><p>  The VAT rate applying to food and drink in Ireland was set many years ago and the historic VAT treatment places a limitation on the VAT policy options regarding food and drink.   Nonetheless, the health benefits of food and drink is reflected in the historic VAT rating of food and drink. The 23% standard VAT rate in general applies to less healthy food and drink such as alcohol, soft drinks, confectionary and snacks, while the zero rate applies fruit, vegetables, meat and dairy products.</p></reply>

Those designated areas will be decided upon following consultations with the relevant local authorities and other Government agencies. It is important to note that I do not see this as a wide-spread Initiative, as it is targeted at those areas which are most in need of attention.

While such an effect is never ideal, it is necessary to achieve the desired yield, which in itself contributes to keeping workers on incomes lower than the threshold to remain outside the charge to employee PRSI entirely.  However it should be noted that the cohort identified being affected by this step effect do not ordinarily pay income tax on the first &euro;16,500 of their income because of the PAYE and personal tax credits, and in some cases, depending on eligibility for additional credits, they may be exempt from the income tax charge entirely.</p><p>  The potential cost of addressing this step effect must be viewed in the context of the constrained fiscal environment in which we find ourselves.  Under the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact, until Ireland has reached its objective of a balanced budget in structural terms, we may not introduce discretionary revenue reductions unless they are matched by other revenue increases or expenditure reductions. This means that Government must consider carefully any tax changes as any reductions will have to be offset elsewhere.</p></reply>

The first is the global rate of tax which is paid by multinational companies who operate across a number of jurisdictions.  This is a 'blended' rate which takes into account the amount of tax charged across all of the countries that a company trades in and not just Ireland. </p><p>The extremely low effective rate figures are sometimes quoted and attributed to Ireland are based on a flawed premise.  The figures are estimated by dividing the amount of Irish tax paid by a total profit figure that includes substantial profits made by companies that are not tax resident in Ireland.  They are running together the profits earned by group companies in Ireland and in other jurisdictions and incorrectly suggesting that Irish tax does or should apply to both.  Ireland cannot tax profits that are properly attributable to other jurisdictions.  </p><p>The ability of some multinationals to lower their world-wide rate of tax using international structures reflects the global context in which Ireland and indeed all countries operate.  The best way to effectively address this issue is for countries to work together at the international level and the appropriate action is being considered in this regard by the OECD as part of their project on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and Ireland is participating fully in this process.  </p><p>The second issue is the effective rate of tax applying in individual countries.  Clearly, the domestic rate of tax paid in Ireland is within the control of the Irish tax system and Ireland is responsible for the amount of Irish corporation tax that is charged here.  I want to re-emphasise that all companies operating in Ireland - domestic businesses and multinationals - are chargeable to corporation tax at the 12.5% rate on the profits that are generated from their trading activities here. A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits, as well as certain petroleum, mining and land-dealing activities, and chargeable capital gains are taxable at the capital gains tax rate of 33%.</p><p>Some other countries have a high headline rate of corporation which is then supplemented by a high number of tax reliefs which reduce the overall rate of tax paid.  By contrast, the approach in Ireland is transparent: we have a competitive headline rate of corporation tax which is applied to a broad base.  We therefore have only a small number of corporation tax incentives in Ireland, and we make sure that those we do have are specifically targeted.  They are focussed on the creation of employment and on areas of innovation.  These reliefs are evaluated on a regular basis to ensure that they give the taxpayer value for money.</p><p>My Department recently published a technical paper to provide clarity to the D&aacute;il about the seemingly conflicting figures and methodologies.  The Department commissioned an external and independent academic to ensure that this piece of work was as objective as possible.  This report is published on the Department's website and can be viewed at the following link:</p><p>.  </p><p>Based on data from the Central Statistics Office (using the &quot;Net Operating Surplus&quot;) and the Revenue Commissioners (using the &quot;Taxable Income&quot;), this report highlighted that since 2003 the effective corporate tax rate has averaged 10.9% and 10.7% respectively.  While this percentage is lower than the 12.5% headline rate, this can be attributed to the availability of the small number of reliefs I referred to earlier such as the R&amp;amp;D tax credit, which was the subject of a comprehensive review last year and which was found to give value for money for the Irish taxpayer.</p><p>Therefore, I am not in a position to introduce a minimum 'effective rate' in Ireland in the way the Deputy has suggested.</p></reply>

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit. It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced.  It is applied at a low rate on a wide base.  I should point out that it was never intended that the USC would be a temporary measure. It was designed and incorporated in to the Irish taxation system as part of its permanent structure and the revenues collected play a vital part in meeting the many expenditure demands placed on the Exchequer.  </p><p>  As you have alluded to, as a result of a review of the USC conducted by my Department in 2011, the Government decided in Budget 2012 to increase the entry point to the Universal Social Charge from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum. It is estimated that this removed almost 330,000 individuals from the charge.  As part of the normal budgetary preparations, my officials will examine potential options for changes to the tax system for my consideration as part of the overall Budget package. However, it should be borne in mind that under the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact, until Ireland has reached its objective of a balanced budget in structural terms, we may not introduce discretionary revenue reductions unless they are matched by other revenue increases or expenditure reductions.</p></reply>

Applied Behavioural Analysis, or ABA, is one of the approaches used in special classes for children with autism.</p><p>  The use of ABA as part of the range of interventions is particularly useful for addressing behavioural issues. My Department supports the use of ABA and training is provided for teachers in its use.  However, the Department does not accept, based on research, advice and best practice, that ABA should be the only approach used. As children differ significantly from one another and as children's needs vary and change over time, it is not possible to impose a method or approach that will work for all children with autism. This child centred approach is based on advice received from international experts on autism, NEPS, the Inspectorate and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism.</p><p>  My Department has not in the past developed guidelines relating to the transitioning of children from ABA environments to non-ABA mainstream environments. However, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is currently preparing Policy Advice on the Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders. The NCSE has advised my Department that the Policy Advice will be delivered in the spring of 2015 and will draw upon findings gathered from an extensive consultation process which has already commenced. Many studies have been conducted on the value of ABA and if the Deputy is aware of specific research on transitioning which she feels would be of benefit to NCSE in the preparation of the advice she should bring it to their attention directly.</p><p>  I am aware that a number of parents continue to hold a view that my Department should support ABA where it is shown to be successful. As I have already stated, my Department supports the use of ABA, but not where it is exclusive of other interventions.  I expect that the NCSE final report will reflect the broadest possible range of views and provide recommendations which will assist the development of policy for future years.</p></reply>

However, section 8 of the Act allowed the Board to extend the period for receipt of an application where it considered that there were exceptional circumstances.</p><p>  The Residential Institutions Redress Amendment Act, 2011 removed the Board's power to accept late applications received on or after the 17th September 2011. The Board received 2,766 late applications of which it has allowed 2,191, bringing the total number of applications received to 16,623.  Having finalised 16,480 applications by end May 2014, the Board had 143 applications and 1 late submission to consider.  When introducing the 2011 Amendment Act, the Government was satisfied that sufficient time had been given to potential applicants to apply to the Redress Board.  I have no plans to introduce a second redress scheme.</p></reply>

While a small number of secretaries employed under the 1978 scheme remain in schools, the scheme is being phased out - no new posts are being created and posts which fall vacant are not being filled.</p><p>  The 1978 scheme has been superseded by a more extensive grant scheme which was introduced under the PESP agreement of 1992. The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools in the Free Education Scheme now receive capitation grant assistance to provide for secretarial (and/or caretaking) services. Within the capitation grant schemes, the level and extent of services provided is a matter for the school authorities who, through the discretion afforded under the scheme, apply diverse arrangements for secretarial services as resources permit. My Department does not stipulate any rules concerning how secretarial services are to be obtained by the school. It is a matter for the individual school to decide how best to apply the funding to suit the school's particular needs. Secretaries employed by schools using grant funding are employees of the individual school and my Department therefore does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged. These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, a forum was established involving my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, IMPACT and SIPTU to examine the factual position in schools regarding the terms and conditions of employment (including pay) of school secretaries. This task was completed. However, due to the very serious budgetary and financial position that the State still finds itself in, it is not possible to progress to the second element of the forum's tasks i.e. discussion on the introduction of an interim minimum pay rate.  However, the parties have agreed to consider any appropriate measures in relation to the pay of school secretaries which can be introduced in the event that any review of the Public Service Agreements recommends changes to the benefit of those public servants earning &euro;35,000 or less per annum. This is currently the priority for the Forum and discussions are ongoing.</p></reply>

In the 20 month period since its establishment, QQI has incurred the following expenditure.</p><p> External consultants and professional services expenditure was as follows: &euro;5,748 outsourced fixed asset maintenance; &euro;8,925 related to project management advice and support; &euro;14,365 related to single expert for EQF NCP Grant; &euro;9,791 related to public service pension advices; &euro;13,961 related to architect fees and flood damage; &euro;54,796, public relations and media management; &euro;18,250 related to branding and design services; &euro;54,769 related to policy development and implementation support; &euro;385,532 related to ICT; &euro;9,841 other.</p><p>  Audit costs amounted to &euro;93,151 of which &euro;62,040 were auditor fees paid to the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of the audits of the cessation accounts for QQI's legacy bodies, HETAC, FETAC and the NQAI, and outstanding fees for the 2012 audits of the legacy agencies.</p><p>  Accountancy fees amounted to &euro;358,647. QQI's accountancy services are largely outsourced. In 2013 there were three sets of cessation accounts to be prepared. These services were also required for the support of the C&amp;amp;AG audits of the cessation accounts of HETAC, FETAC and NQAI. Accountancy services were also required for the establishment of QQI which included the introduction of a new accountancy package. There were two legacy accountancy firms in place until June 2013 and following a tendering process new accountants were appointed in September 2013 who now provide routine end-of-month services, preparation of the annual financial statements, preparation of the annual C&amp;amp;G audit file and resources to cover for staff on long term absences. Also included under accountancy is the outsourced payroll services. Other costs incurred included additions to the accountancy system to streamline processes including SEPA payments and file uploads that had been carried out manually.</p><p>  Legal Fees amounted to &euro;61,718 of which &euro;31,660 related to legacy fees relating to a High Court hearing.</p><p>  Staff Development costs amounted to &euro;149,615. This comprised &euro;133,597 for training and development (including &euro;9,328 for hotel expenses associated with venues for all-staff events and an on-going development programme for the senior management team) and &euro;16,017 for educational assistance.</p><p>  With regard to costs arising from speakers to address staff meetings, QQI recently engaged a professional speaker to organise and deliver a full-day course for all staff, which was delivered for three days. While QQI has not yet been invoiced for this service, it is understood the cost will be in the region of &euro;7,000 to &euro;8,000.</p></reply>

One aspect of this Agreement relates to supplementary assignment arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and as both Unions that represent SNAs namely, SIPTU and IMPACT, have signed up to the Haddington Road Agreement, my Department has implemented supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs.</p><p>The first part of the LRC proposals for supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs outlines that the supplementary assignment arrangements only apply to current SNAs who are notified that they are to be made redundant.  Accordingly, the purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate eligible SNAs who are being made redundant by one employer in filling SNA vacancies that may become available in another school / ETB.</p><p>The detailed supplementary assignment arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for the 2014/2015 school year are set out in Departmental Circular 0044/2014 which issued on 12 May 2014 and which is available on the Department's website at the following address: .  With effect from 1 May 2013 once an SNA with a minimum of one year's service (Service in a substitute capacity i.e. covering for maternity leave, sick leave, career breaks, job-sharing etc. does not count) is notified by his/her employer that s/he is to be made redundant then s/he shall be deemed to be a member of a supplementary assignment panel for SNAs.</p><p>With the exception of SNAs who have been re-employed on permanent contracts or have chosen to opt out of the panel in accordance with the terms of Paragraph 6 of the circular, all SNAs who have been made redundant since 1 May 2013 are members of the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel.  It should be noted that this does not prevent any person, including SNAs who are working in temporary or cover positions, or SNAs with less than one year's service, from applying for SNA vacancies but employers are obliged to give precedence to applicants who are members of the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel.  When an employer has a vacancy to fill, they must undertake the recruitment process in accordance with the provisions outlined in paragraphs 12-18 of Circular 44/2014.</p><p>As the LRC proposals are part of a wider public-sector pay agreement that represent compromises by both employers and unions, I do not have the ability to alter the terms of that agreement.</p><p>Finally, my Department has set up a dedicated e-mail address to deal with all queries in relation to the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel and any queries in respect of the operation of the Panel can be directed to this dedicated e-mail address: snasupplementpanel@education.gov.ie.</p></reply>

The VECs were dissolved on 1 July last and were replaced with Education and Training Boards (ETBs).</p><p>  The new ETBs will strengthen locally managed education and enhance the scale of local education and training.  This represents a major component of the public service transformation agenda. The new configuration has facilitated exciting new provisions including the establishment of SOLAS, the dissolution of F&Aacute;S and has paved the way for the transfer of training functions to the newly formed Education and Training Boards.  On 1st January of this year, 7 training centres transferred to 4 ETBs and in July of this year a further 12 training centres will transfer to 7 ETBs, including Longford and Westmeath ETB.  In October 2011, I decided on the headquarter locations for the new ETBs.  In relation to the Longford and Westmeath Education and Training Board, I decided that the headquarters would be in Mullingar.</p><p>  In arriving at this decision, I considered a range of factors including the need to ensure that the location of an ETB headquarters will, to the greatest extent possible, facilitate staff redeployment under a redeployment scheme within the context of the Croke Park Agreement and the need to operate at lowest cost having regard to the accommodation available in existing locations.  In terms of these criteria, I was aware that redeployment of staff from Longford to Mullingar is possible under the Croke Park agreement.  The offices in Longford have remained open and staff formerly employed in County Longford VEC headquarters have not yet been redeployed to Mullingar.  I expect that the offices in Longford will remain open for some time and that the approach to redeployment will be measured and considered. I am satisfied that, properly managed, the move will positively impact on education services offered by the new ETB.</p><p>  Since the offices in Longford have remained open and staff have not been redeployed to Mullingar following the establishment of the ETB in July last year, no savings have accrued from the decision to locate the VEC headquarters in Mullingar, County Westmeath.</p></reply>

This decision has been taken to give schools the flexibiilty to develop their Junior Cycle programme mindful of the educational needs of their own students and mindful of the principles, statements of learning and key skills as set out in the Framework. </p><p>  Education about active citizenship and the promotion of human rights issues are an integral component of the new Framework for Junior Cycle.  For example, one of the 24 'Statements of Learning', that encompass the key knowledge and skills that students will develop during their junior cycle, requires that all students will &quot;value what it means to be an active citizen with rights and responsibilities in local and wider context&quot;.  In addition, the 8 key skills which underpin the new Framework for Junior Cycle, include &quot;working with others&quot; whereby students should realise and experience how they can &quot;contribute to making the world a better place&quot;.  As junior cycle students will experience the statements of learning and key skills, it is expected that education for active citizenship and education about human rights and responsibilities will continue to be an important part of the new Junior Cycle. </p><p>  I recently approved a new short course in CSPE that has been developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).  This short course will be available to schools to implement, from this September, should they wish to do so as part of their Junior Cycle programme or they may continue to offer the current syllabus. Schools will choose from one or the other for the up-coming academic year 2014/2015.  This programme is in fact designed for 100 hours of teaching compared to less than 70 hours for the existing CSPE syllabus.  The new short course aims to inform, inspire, empower and enable young people to participate as active citizens in contemporary society at local, national and global levels based on an understanding of human rights and social responsibilities. </p><p>  As with Junior Cycle, education about active citizenship and human rights issues are also reflected at Senior Cycle.  As part of transition year, students are afforded the opportunity to further interrogate some of the themes encountered in CSPE at Junior Cycle.  This is facilitated by the availability of resources and materials that have been developed by as number of NGOs, including Amnesty International, for use by transition year pupils. I have also indicated my intention to introduce 'Politics and Society' as a new optional Leaving Certificate subject.  One of the objectives of the draft syllabus, which has been developed by the NCCA, is to develop 'a sense of care for others and a respect for and a valuing of diversity in all areas of human life within the parameters of human rights principles'.  In addition, the draft syllabus is structured around four key areas.  One of these areas is 'Active Citizenship'.  The Politics and Society subject will be made available to schools once the NCCA has advised my Department on a number of outstanding issues.</p></reply>

Where children have significant care needs whereby they may need additional support to be able to attend school, the NCSE may make an allocation of SNA support to the school to assist that child.

SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>The NCSE invited schools to make applications for SNA support for children who have assessed care needs for the coming 2014/15 school year by 26th March 2014, for their consideration.  Details of the NCSE application criteria are available at <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.  The NCSE will shortly advise all schools of their SNA allocations for the coming school year.

The specification for Science will give schools the freedom to provide more time for Science if they deem it appropriate, or to provide short courses or learning experiences such as involvement in the Young Scientist and Technology competition or SciFest.  A greater focus in other subjects on key skills such as managing information and thinking will also support the development of science-related skills and aptitudes.

While statistical data in relation to superintendent appointments in relation to this year's examinations is not yet complete, I can confirm that for the 2013 examinations the SEC received 1,084 applications for superintending positions from either unemployed or substitute teachers.  Of these, a total of 54 subsequently withdrew their application and 14 were not appointed as they either did not meet the criteria for appointment or their application was received late in which case they could only be included on the reserve panel.  Hence 99.5% of applicants for superintending positions who were either unemployed or substitute teachers were appointed to superintend examinations by the SEC.  </p><p>  The policy of my Department is to ensure, as far as possible, that the Managerial Authorities of schools give priority to unemployed registered teachers who are fully qualified when filling vacant teaching posts.  It is important to note that schools themselves employ teachers and not the Department of Education and Skills.  Circular 31/2011 details a cascade of measures for the recruitment of teachers, prioritising registered teachers over retired registered teachers and unregistered people.  School Principals must maintain a list of unemployed registered teachers who are available for substitute work at short notice and report to the Board of Management on any exceptional occasion where they have to engage a registered teacher who is retired.</p></reply>

Such exempt buildings would principally include those used for public worship, education and health care provided on a not-for-profit basis, and charitable purposes. The Act maintains the long-standing position that commercial facilities - including all private childcare facilities such as play schools, preschools, cr&egrave;ches and Montessori schools - are liable for rates.</p><p>  I am informed by the Valuation Office that the property to which the Deputy refers was the subject of a request from the occupiers for a revision of valuation in 2013 on the grounds that the operating company was a charitable organisation and that, as a consequence, should be exempt from the payment of rates. The Revision Officer appointed by the Commissioner of Valuation, on considering the Memorandum and Articles of Association submitted by the operators of the facility, found that it did not state as its main object or objects, a charitable purpose and, accordingly, it did not qualify for exemption under paragraph 16 of Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act, 2001.</p><p>  The legislation is quite specific about the range of exemptions that can be allowed by the Commissioner, who is very much constrained by the legislative provisions which allow him no discretionary latitude to grant exemptions not covered by Schedule 4. His Office thoroughly examines all requests for exemption to ensure that fairness and equity are observed in the operation of the Valuation Act as it relates to the valuation of childcare facilities and all other categories of property.</p></reply>

The new Circular has been broadly welcomed by industry representative associations.</p><p>  The Circular applies to all public sector bodies, such as Government Departments/Offices, local and regional authorities, the health and education sectors and non-commercial State bodies. It also applies to works and related services contracts awarded by a private entity, which are subsidised 50% or more by a public body, are covered by the EU Directives if they exceed the EU thresholds. Contracts below the EU thresholds which are funded or part-funded from public funds, awarded by private sector entities, should, as far as possible, be awarded in accordance with the national procurement guidelines.</p><p>  In conjunction with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Office of Government Procurement has set up a high level group on SME access to Public Procurement.  The focus of this group is to develop and monitor strategies for SME access to public procurement.  The group also has regard to the Government's Action Plan for Jobs and specifically those actions aimed at maximising procurement opportunities for SME in the public sector.  In addition the Office of Government Procurement, through its new governance model, including its procurement executive, will be monitoring any issues that arise from the implementation of Circular 10/14.  Finally, design changes are currently being made to the eTenders national portal to capture data relating to procurement, and, in particular, data relating to contracts awarded over &euro;25,000.  It is expected that these changes will facilitate better monitoring and reporting on public procurement trends on a broad range of fronts going forward.</p></reply>

However the greater use, where appropriate, of multi-supplier frameworks can address local supplier issues while also ensuring on-going cost competitiveness of the framework itself.  Such multi-supplier frameworks may offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions.</p><p>  Data on the splitting of tenders into lots which has been taken from the Government eTenders portal indicates that 587 tenders above the EU threshold were published between 1 January 2014 and 19 June 2014.  Of these tenders, 150 were split into lots (26%).  Since the publication of Circular 10/2014 on 17 April 2014, 243 tenders have been published of which 71 were split into lots (29%).</p><p>  The reform of procurement across the public service is a key element of the public service reform programme.  Public procurement savings enable public service organisations to deliver much-needed services from the tighter budgets within which they are now required to operate. Reforms are being carried out in a manner that recognises the clear importance of small and medium-sized enterprises in this country's economic recovery. The Office of Government Procurement will continue to work with industry to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that Government procurement policies are business friendly.</p></reply>

Therefore, I have no plans to change the method by which valuations are assessed for rating as such a radical move would represent a significant departure from the long-standing practice of levying rates solely by reference to property values.</p><p>  It is important to acknowledge that commercial rates, as a source of revenue, and the rating system generally, are deeply embedded in the local government system. Rates income is a very important contribution to the cost of services provided by local authorities such as roads, public lighting, development control, parks and open spaces.  All rates collected within a local authority area are spent exclusively in delivering the public services which are required locally to create the environment in which businesses can prosper. Locally elected members adopt the annual rate on valuation (ARV) they consider necessary in order to provide the required services. Rates are a stable source of financing for local government which is not affected unduly by short-term changes in economic circumstances.  A system having regard to economic factors on an ongoing basis would create uncertainty by providing for continuous change to the valuation base. Such a system would not provide a stable basis for funding local government and would require significant additional resources to operate.</p><p>  In recent years, local authorities have been asked by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to exercise restraint in setting the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) and they have responded positively in this regard.  The Government recognises that these are difficult economic times for many businesses. It will continue to keep all matters relating to rates under regular consideration and it is determined that every avenue will be pursued to optimise efficiency, and contain and reduce costs in the local government sector.</p></reply>

Subsequently the policy approach in this area has been guided and informed  by key national strategies in the area of gender equality.</p><p>  My Department continues to review our targets on a regular basis, in line with the targets included in the National Women's Strategy 2007-2016.  In that Strategy the original targets for the percentage of women in the grades of Assistant Principal (33.3%) and Principal Officer (27%) in the Civil Service have already been well exceeded for both grades. At the end of 2013, the female percentage in the Assistant Principal grade was 43% and the female percentage in the Principal Officer grade was 35%. Earlier this year, the Strategy set new targets for the Civil Service of 40% women in both grades and while we are already at the target for the Assistant Principal grade we will continue to work to achieve the target in the Principal Officer grade.</p><p>  A further key strategy in gender equality is the wide availability of flexible working practices.  In this regard work-life balance arrangements in the Civil Service are among the best available options provided by Irish employers, particularly when considered in tandem with annual leave and other provisions.  Civil servants continue to have access to a number of flexible working arrangements including flexi-time, work-sharing arrangements, the shorter working year scheme and career breaks.</p><p>  The Civil Service Gender Equality Policy is underpinned by current equality legislation and requires individual Departments to set strategic objectives and equality goals in each Department's Strategy Statement, including goals for increasing women's representation, particularly at the higher management levels. The inclusion of such goals in each Department's Strategy Statement is a key element in the achievement of gender equality in the Civil Service.</p><p>  My officials also engage on a regular basis with the  Unions through the Equality sub committee of General Council to discuss matters relating to equality generally, including both the Gender and Diversity Policies.  The Civil Service is strongly committed to equality of opportunity in all its employment practices and will continue to monitor female participation at all levels in the Civil Service and support the increased participation of women.</p></reply>

The report was prepared to provide analysis, insights, learnings and guidance to SMEs no matter where in the world they operate.  The Mazars report goes on to explore what it takes to achieve levels of superior performance, to compete in the market place and effectively stand out from the crowd. </p><p>  There are 21 million SMEs across the EU, 92% of which are micro enterprises.  Some of the key findings of the study relate to building financial resilience and ensuring SMEs look beyond local or regional markets.  The Deputy will be aware that this Government is maintaining its focus on assisting our SMEs to establish, scale and export, with a view to driving economic recovery and creating jobs across the country.  </p><p>  SMEs have a critical role to play in both our domestic economy and in international markets and that is why almost all of the actions contained in the Action Plan for Jobs 2014 will impact on the SME sector generally or specific groups of SMEs.  Actions around access to finance, the skills agenda, support for research and innovation, support for management development and other capacity building measures are set out in the Action Plan.  Sector specific actions covering food and drink, retail, construction, tourism, creative services, eHealth and the Green Economy aim to provide new opportunities for SMEs to win business both here and abroad.</p><p>  Just some of the measures introduced by this Government to assist SMEs to date, include the establishment of the Local Enterprise Offices; improving access to finance through the Credit Guarantee Scheme and the Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme, and the establishment later this year of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland; the development of an online tool which details the different government supports available to SMEs; supporting a pilot SME financial capability programme and supporting SMEs in developing an online presence which is vital in order to maximise their export potential.  It is my intention to shortly publish a National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement which will complement the existing business support initiatives in order to ensure that the operating environment is more coherent, responsive and conductive to entrepreneurship.</p><p>  The hard work undertaken by this Government has already begun to bear some fruit with domestic demand showing signs of growth in the past year and our competitiveness rankings continuing to improve from 24 in 2011 to 15 in 2014, according to IMD's World Competitiveness Yearbook.  In addition Forbes magazine recently named Ireland as the best country in the world in which to do business.</p><p>  Finally I wish to point out that much of the information relied upon by Mazars in their Report was contained in the Small Business Act Profile for Ireland for 2013, which scores each Member State in the European Union on its delivery of the European Small Business Act.  In 2013 Ireland was found to be in positive territory in relation to 9 of the 10 measures identified by the Commission in the implementation of the Small Business Act.  I am confident that the Commission will once again find that Ireland has a positive Small Business Act Profile for 2014, when the Report is published later this year.</p></reply>

To this end, the enterprise agencies and other relevant players have been tasked with working to enhance the competitiveness of manufacturing in Ireland by working with companies and implementing the recommendations in the Strategy. That sector lost 50,000 jobs in the years up to 2010 but at the end of 2013, there were a total of 215,900 people directly employed in the sector, which was an increase of 10,000 on the numbers identified at the time the Strategy was published.  This sector also supports a similar number of jobs indirectly. The Strategy does not identify specific location around the country for the expansion of the sector. In addition to that Strategy, I also initiated another, complementary,  research project on issues relating to skills needs, and that report entitled &ldquo;<i>The Future Skills Needs of the Manufacturing Sector to 2020</i>&rdquo; was published by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs/Forf&aacute;s at the same time.  Implementation of this report is also in hand </p><p>A particularly attractive feature of manufacturing in Ireland is the fact that many of the present jobs are not in the main urban areas, but dispersed into regional locations, thereby providing a valuable employment focus in areas where alternative jobs are scarce. The further development of the sector will, of course, build on this key feature.</p><p>Key tasks from both reports have been incorporated into the<i>Action Plan for Jobs, </i>which includes a series of actions to develop the sector.  It is also relevant that the <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2014</i>includes a commitment to develop a framework for a Regional Enterprise Strategy to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprises.  I intend that the framework will be developed on a pilot basis initially, focusing on the Midlands region, and involving the agencies under the remit of this Department &ndash; Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices.  The objective is to enhance synergies between the agencies and their client companies and build on the competitive strengths of the region to maximise the potential for job creation.  The role which other public bodies in the region can play in working towards this objective will also be examined as the project develops.  My aim is that this framework will serve as a model for other regions of the country.</p><p>In addition, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s current 5 year strategy &quot;Horizon 2020&quot; expires at the end of 2014 and the agency is currently in the process of developing a new strategy from 2015 onwards.   To assist in the development of such a strategy I have asked Forf&aacute;s to undertake an in depth analysis of Ireland&rsquo;s FDI strategy to take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI and the changes in EU state aid rules, which come into effect on I July 2014.  These two exercises will form the basis of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy from 2015 onwards.</p></reply>

An employee is entitled to 4 working weeks in a leave year where they have worked at least 1365 hours, or one third of a working week for each month in the leave year where they have worked at least 117 hours, or 8 per cent of the hours worked in a leave year (but subject to a maximum of four working weeks).  The most beneficial of the calculations is the one that will apply where more than one option is possible but all are subject to a maximum of 4 working weeks.  The employer decides when annual leave can be taken but must take into account the need for the employee to balance work and family responsibilities and the opportunities for rest and recreation available to the employee.</p></reply>

Directive 2006/123/EC [the Services Directive] on services in the internal market was transposed into Irish law by way of S. I. No. 533 of 2010, European Communities (Provision of Services) Regulations 2010 and S. I. No. 555, European Communities (Court Orders for the Protection of Consumer Interests) Regulations, 2010.  While the Directive is not concerned specifically with casual trading, but with the provision of services in general, it does impact on the issue of the regulation of casual trading by local authorities.</p><p>  On the 17 December 2009, my Department issued a detailed guidance notice to all 88 local authorities entitled to make bye laws under the Casual Trading Act, 1995 outlining the obligations arising for them under the Services Directive.  This guidance notice was drawn up in my Department following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.  Arising from the issue of this guidance notice, some local authorities raised issues in respect of their obligations under the Services Directive.  My Department has engaged with the Office of the Attorney General in an attempt to resolve these issues and as a result of these consultations, my Department is currently examining whether the Casual Trading Act 1995 needs to be amended by way of primary legislation, whether the outstanding issues arising out of the Services Directive could be dealt with by way of revised a guideline notice or if a combination of the two methods is required.  It is hoped to have a final decision on this shortly.</p></reply>

The GEM Report is prepared independently of my Department and its agencies and I would suggest that the Deputy contact the authors of the GEM Report directly in order to obtain the required information.  The most recent figures that I have to hand from the Companies Registration Office suggest that almost 6,000 companies were incorporated in Ireland between January and April of this year.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the vast majority of the measures contained in the Action Plan for Jobs 2014 will impact on the SME sector generally or specific groups of SMEs.  Actions around access to finance, the skills agenda, support for research and innovation, support for management development and other capacity building measures are set out in the Action Plan.

While responsibility for Ireland&rsquo;s tax regime rests with the Minister for Finance, my Department is very conscious of the need to maintain a competitive corporate tax regime and to that end, closely monitors developments in other countries.</p><p>  The development of the knowledge economy is seen as essential for generating new jobs.  In particular, research and development and innovation are of vital importance in increasing economic activity both in terms of domestic business sectors and in attracting foreign direct investment.  Many countries are continuing to develop fiscal policy tools to promote investment in intellectual assets.  We are aware that other countries have introduced patent box schemes, including the UK. The general objective of such schemes is to provide a lower rate of tax on income derived from patents and other intellectual assets that are developed and commercially exploited by companies, generally by deducting or excluding a certain percentage of income from the tax base.  It is understood that the EU Commission is currently reviewing the scheme.  </p><p>  In considering the merits of introducing a patent box scheme in Ireland, it is important to bear in mind that countries which have introduced such schemes have corporation tax rates that are significantly higher than our general 12.5% corporation tax rate for trading income.  Alongside the 12.5% rate, Ireland provides attractive incentives to encourage R&amp;amp;D and the creation and exploitation of intellectual property, including a 25% tax credit for R&amp;amp;D expenditure. In addition, Ireland has a comprehensive capital allowances regime for expenditure on the provision of intangible assets for use in trading activities.  We continue to keep Ireland&rsquo;s tax offering under review to ensure that it remains competitive and effective in promoting investment in R&amp;amp;D, innovation and high-quality employment.</p><p>  Responding to the Deputy&rsquo;s reference to the Unified Patent Court, it is the case that under the international Agreement on the Unified Patent Court, London will host a central division of the court, in addition to which it is understood it will host its own local division of the Court.  The nature of Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the Unified Patent Court is currently a matter that is under active consideration and will be brought to Government for consideration before the Parliamentary summer recess.</p></reply>

A new national Gateway website, and 31 local sites, including Galway, will provide immediate access to such information.</p><p>  In addition to the financial and soft supports available from the LEO, anyone thinking of starting or expanding a business in any part of Galway will be able to access the full range of State supports provided by different Government bodies &ndash; for example Galway County Council, Enterprise Ireland, Revenue, the Department of Social Protection, the Credit Review Office, training bodies &ndash; in one easily accessible location within the local authority. The enhanced LEO service provides that all categories of business &ndash; including sole traders, micro businesses and small and medium sized companies &ndash; will have access to all available Government supports and advice. </p><p>  The changes at local government level through the Department of Environment, Community &amp;amp; Local Government include the creation of new Local Community &amp;amp; Development Committees which will include representation from the LEOs in each local authority area. In addition, appropriate mechanisms will be devised between the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government to ensure that where funding for enterprise development is available from different sources at local level the activities of LEOs, Local Development Companies or other support providers complement each other.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-24a.526.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014062400059#WRJ02100"><p>Since the EU Council&rsquo;s Decision in June 2013, to start negotiations with the US on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), five negotiating rounds have taken place, the most recent taking place from 19-23 May in the US. This Round covered extensive technical discussion on a broad range of issues including regulatory issues, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, government procurement, intellectual property rights, electronic commerce and telecommunications, environment, labour, small and medium-sized enterprises, and energy and raw materials.  Some discussion has already started on the text of an agreement in relation to helping SMEs, technical barriers to trade and on competition. </p><p>Negotiations on TTIP can be summarised as covering three broad areas:</p><p>The first is <b>market access</b>, for goods, services, and public procurement.  The first tariff offers, that is, the immediate or phased elimination of import tariffs on an extensive list of goods, were exchanged earlier this year, and I expect that, over the next few weeks there will be further work and negotiations to extend the range of tariff free trade that can take place once TTIP comes into effect. On services, I understand that the US tabled its first offer last week, and Member States will meet shortly to discuss what has been proposed by the U.S. The Commission expects that the EU&rsquo;s first offer on services will be ready soon. Naturally there is an important level of confidentiality about the detail of both sides&rsquo; negotiating position, but I am hopeful that the greatest level of market access can be achieved for our services exporters and for those looking to penetrate the very large U.S. public procurement market.</p><p>The second area covered by the talks is <b>&ldquo;rules&rdquo;</b>, on trade facilitation (EU and US customs systems), state-owned enterprises (these should operate on commercial lines), on raw materials and energy (EU is looking for access to US oil/gas exports that are currently restricted), and on labour and the environment issues (no weakening of standards/protections). Coming to agreement on these will also serve to set the standards for other Free Trade Agreements with trading partners, reduce the complexity for small companies to comply many standards and market regulations, and regulate markets in an open and transparent manner.</p><p>The third most difficult and complex, but most important aspect of the negotiations, is <b>reducing regulatory burdens, </b>which will involve a multiplicity of sectoral regulations.  In particular, areas of regulation such as financial services, environment, and health and public safety are important here, where there are legitimate but in many cases unfounded concerns about possible lowering of regulatory standards.  In fact, both the EU and the US are equally committed to the retention of high standards that serve to protect consumers. The objective is to address differences in standards between our two economies while at all times maintaining the high levels of health, safety, environmental and other protection that is reflected in EU legislation.  </p><p>Progress in respect of regulation, through harmonisation, mutual recognition or convergence, is the most important area, as the result of studies show it will yield the most net gains. The Commission&rsquo;s impact assessment suggests that between two thirds and four fifths of the gains from a future agreement would come from cutting red tape and having more coordination between regulators. It is important to see this as a two part issue: the process of how regulation is enacted, and the sector specific solutions being negotiated.  How regulations are made needs to be more transparent, with regulators deepening relationships in order to address emerging issues together such as setting standards for new technologies. Regulators are also discussing how to reduce the cost of meeting existing standards without affecting the levels of protection afforded by them. </p><p>In addition, real progress on issues like car safety standards, ending double inspections at pharmaceutical and medical device plants, should, over time, reduce costs for business, regulators and consumers. It is important to note that while regulatory aspects are one of the main elements of the TTIP negotiations, there is nothing in the negotiations that should prevent or undermine the rights of both sides to regulate, and the level of regulatory protection on both sides, be it environment, food, consumer safety, will not be lessened.</p><p>As regards investment protection, the public consultation launched by the European Commission last March on the investment protection provisions of a future Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, is still underway and will run until 6 July.  All stakeholders have the opportunity to respond to this consultation, so that specific interests and concerns on investor protection and settlement of related disputes are well understood by the European Commission, and can be used to better define the EU&rsquo;s approach to investor protection in the TTIP negotiations.  The public consultation can be accessed at .  Further information on the negotiations, including background documents, are available on the European Commission&rsquo;s TTIP website.   </p><p>At the fifth round of negotiations and as in all previous negotiating rounds, both negotiating teams maintained close dialogue with a large number of representatives of the academic community, consumer groups, labour unions, environmental groups, farmers and employers. The negotiators met with over 300 representatives of civil society. These discussions and briefings have become an integral part of the EU&rsquo;s negotiating approach to TTIP, both during each round and also between each round, so that as much information as possible can be given to interest groups.</p><p>My Department recently engaged international expertise to examine the economic and other impacts TTIP and related potential opportunities. The focus of this study will be to identify key areas and sectors of the economy that will be impacted by the TTIP. This work will help to inform our input to the Commission&rsquo;s negotiating position and to identify appropriate policy responses to be deployed to maximise the potential of this historic agreement and provide an assessment of the longer term implications for enterprise policy.</p><p>I hosted a Conference in Dublin Castle on 20 June to look at the opportunities for Ireland from the TTIP and to bring together at political and senior executive level, Oireachtas members, representatives of various economic actors, Government Departments, Agencies and Regulators, in order to explore opportunities that lie ahead for Ireland.  I will continue to look for an agreement that is comprehensive and balanced and one that delivers real trade and economic potential for our economy. In this context I recognise the need to minimise the impact of trade liberalisation and market opening on sensitive areas of the economy and will continue to express our concerns that any agreement respects our broad trade interests and especially those of the Agriculture sector. </p><p>I understand that the next negotiating round is scheduled to take place from 14-18 July in Brussels.</p></reply>

The income received by participants in employment schemes such as T&uacute;s, Community Employment Scheme, Rural Social Scheme and Gateway is treated as income from employment for PRSI purposes and, in the same manner as other workers, is subject to Class A PRSI.  This provides the participants on these schemes with access to the benefit of full insurability, including future entitlement to short-term benefits such as illness and jobseekers benefits and contributes towards establishing entitlement to pensions.</p><p>  Participants on T&uacute;s and other employment schemes receive a standard weekly rate of payment which is equivalent to the social welfare payment appropriate to their family size plus a top up of &euro;20 subject to a minimum of &euro;208 per week.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-24a.536.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014062400059#WRJ02800"><p>Over the past number of years, pension provision in all its forms in Ireland has experienced considerable challenges and changes. The sustainability of the wider system is a particular concern because of the demographic issues Ireland faces, the associated increases in pension (and other age related) costs, varying investment losses and the deterioration in the public finances since the recession. </p><p>  The National Pensions Framework was published in March 2010 and provided a framework for long term pension reform. It encompassed consideration of all aspects of pension reform including the State pension, supplementary occupational pensions, private pensions and public sector pensions. Development of the framework was informed by a range of views provided during the Green Paper consultation process.  These reforms are designed to enhance the sustainability of the system overall and ensure that people&rsquo;s income in retirement is protected. </p><p>  Since the publication of the Framework, it became necessary to further consider pension reform given the economic difficulties and deterioration in the public finances. In this regard, and at my request, in 2012 the Government engaged the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to conduct an independent review of long term pensions policy in Ireland.  This review was published in April 2013 and encompasses the totality of pension provision in Ireland &ndash; State, private, occupational and public sector. The issues of sustainability, adequacy, modernity and equity were central to this review. Whilst endorsing pension policy reforms undertaken to date, the report makes a number of recommendations for future reform.  Its key recommendation is to improve the adequacy of pensions by increasing coverage in the funded part of the pensions system through a universal mandatory or quasi-mandatory employment based pension system. </p><p>  In this regard, you will be aware the Programme for Government includes a commitment to reforming the pension system to progressively achieve universal coverage, with particular focus on lower-paid workers. I have previously stated that a soft-mandatory approach such as that envisaged by an auto-enrolment scheme, using scale to achieve greater cost efficiencies for the member, is a very proactive way in which we can increase supplementary pension coverage, though it is recognised that introduction of such an initiative would be best supported by a more favourable economic environment than is currently the case. </p><p>  In relation to the State pension, recent reforms to the pension system include a gradual increase in State pension age and the abolition of the State pension (transition). In January 2014, State pension age was standardised at age 66 with the cessation of State pension transition. The State pension age will increase to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028. These reforms were introduced in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives.</p><p>  Reforms will continue with the current PRSI system and, as highlighted by the OECD, to strengthen the link between social insurance contributions and benefits received.  In this regard, a number of significant reforms have already been introduced and further reforms are scheduled for the years ahead.  From September 2012, new rate bands for State pension were introduced.  These additional payment rate bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.  With effect from April 2012, the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a State pension increased from 260 paid contributions to 520 paid contributions.  It is also planned to introduce a &ldquo;total contributions approach&rdquo; to determine eligibility for a State pension. The level of pension paid will be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life. The proposed date for the introduction of a move to a total contributions approach is 2020, but this may be subject to change. </p><p>  Arising from changing demographics, policy reform will continue to support longer working lives and to focus on the need to provide for sustainable and adequate pensions.</p></reply>

The General Scheme of the Bill was then referred for pre-legislative scrutiny to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education and Social Protection.  Officials from the Department, representative groups and legal and medical experts participated in hearings held by the Committee in October 2013.  The Committee&rsquo;s Report was published in January 2014.</p><p>I gave careful consideration to the Committee&rsquo;s Report and, following Cabinet approval, on 17 June 2014 I published the Revised General Scheme of the Gender Recognition Bill 2014.  The Bill<i></i>provides for the recognition of the acquired gender of transgender people who are not married or in a civil partnership. The legislation will also facilitate persons with intersex conditions.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  Once the legislation is enacted, it will mean that a person will have their acquired gender fully recognised for all purposes, </font>including dealings with the State, public bodies, and civil and commercial society. <font color="#2F2F2F"> This will be done through the issuing of a gender recognition certificate by the Department of Social Protection. </font>The person would <font color="#2F2F2F">then be able to apply for a new birth certificate. They </font>would be entitled to marry a person of the opposite gender or enter a civil partnership with a person of the same gender.  The Bill includes a provision that a person aged 16 or 17 years may, with parent/guardian consent, apply for a Court order exempting them from the requirement that an applicant for gender recognition must be 18 years or more. This application must be accompanied by confirmation from the treating physician and an independent physician that the person is sufficiently mature to make the application. </p><p>The introduction of gender recognition legislation raises complex and challenging Constitutional issues on marriage. In the context of this Bill, these were the subject of lengthy deliberation by the Attorney General and, subsequently, were carefully considered by Government before it approved the General Scheme of the Bill. As a result, one of the provisions of the proposed legislation is a requirement that in order to obtain a gender recognition certificate, a person must not be in a subsisting marriage. Similar considerations apply in relation to civil partnership.</p><p>It is fully acknowledged that the requirement to be single will be disappointing for those transgender persons who wish to remain married and have their acquired gender recognised. However, the Constitutional position that there is an impediment to legislating in such a way as to give rise to same-sex marriage requires that, under the proposed legislation, a person seeking recognition of their acquired gender must be single. If the planned referendum on same-sex marriage is approved by the public the obstacle will be removed and the legislation can be widened to include persons who are married or in a civil partnership.</p><p>The Revised General Scheme of the Bill has been referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting with the aim of the legislation being published later in the year and enacted as soon as possible after that </p></reply>

There are currently approximately 76,000 rent supplement recipients.  All prospective tenants, including those seeking to access rent supplement, particularly in urban areas, are now finding it increasingly difficult to secure appropriate accommodation due to the reduced availability of rental properties. </p><p>In view of these supply difficulties, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive in conjunction with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations have agreed a protocol with the Department so that families at risk of losing existing private rented accommodation can have more timely and appropriate interventions made on their behalf.  While there are no plans to extend this arrangement to other local authority areas at this time, I can assure the Deputies that officers administering rent supplement throughout the country have considerable experience in dealing with customers and make every effort to ensure that the accommodation needs of families are met. Staff in the Department&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service have discretionary powers to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant, for example, when dealing with applicants who are homeless or who are at risk of losing their tenancy. Such cases are examined on a case by case basis having regard to the situation presented. </p><p>The current maximum monthly rent limits are provided in the tabular statement.

Presentations on the introduction of these changes were also made at the Department&rsquo;s regular briefings with customer representative groups and to members of the public.</p><p>Finally, social welfare supports will continue to be available to those who need them most and where a person fails to meet the qualifying conditions of an insurance based scheme, a means tested assistance payment, such as the State pension (non-contributory), may be available provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions.</p></reply>

All anonymous or confidential reports are examined and, where the information is relevant, they are referred to scheme areas or Inspectors for follow-up action.

The cost of the OFP scheme was &euro;935 million in 2013 and is estimated to be &euro;863 million in 2014.  Both the OFP maximum personal rate for the parent (&euro;188 per week) and the increase for each additional qualified child (&euro;29.80) remain untouched since 2011.  An OFP recipient can also earn up to an average of &euro;425 per week and still receive the OFP payment.  </p><p>  The OFP scheme has played an important role in providing income support to lone parents since its introduction in 1997.  However, in the past, this income support was passive in nature, with little systematic engagement being made by the State with recipients.  This engendered long-term social welfare dependency and associated poverty among one-parent families.  Despite significant levels of State spending on OFP the results have been poor in terms of tackling poverty and social exclusion rates among lone parent families who continue to experience higher rates of &lsquo;consistent poverty&rsquo; in comparison to the population generally.</p><p>  The reforms to the OFP scheme that were introduced in Budgets 2011, 2012, and 2013, aim to address these issues.  They aim to provide the necessary supports to lone parents to help them to escape inter-generational poverty and joblessness, to participate in education and training, to develop their skills set and by entering the workforce to attain financial independence for both themselves and their families.  The reforms to the OFP scheme also aim to bring Ireland&rsquo;s support for lone parents in line with international provisions &ndash; where there is a general movement away from long-term and passive income support.</p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2012, introduced changes to the OFP scheme, including the phased reduction of the maximum age limit of the youngest child at which a recipient&rsquo;s payment ceases to 7 years from 2014 for new entrants and from 2015 for existing recipients.  Transitional arrangements will apply during the period between 2013 and 2015, depending on the date that a recipient first claimed the OFP payment. By 2015, the maximum age limit of the youngest child will be 7 years for all OFP recipients.  Special Provisions exist for customers who are in receipt of the Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) and, also, for those who are recently bereaved. These savers can extend payment of the OFP beyond the maximum age limit threshold for these customers.</p><p>  As an additional support for previous OFP recipients with young children, the JA transitional arrangement was introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2013.  This caters for OFP recipients who lose their entitlement to the OFP payment from 4 July, 2013, onwards, who have a youngest child aged under 14 years, and who are entitled to the JA payment. These customers are exempt from the JA conditions that require them to be available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work, and also, from having to prove unemployment. They can work part-time without restrictions and still receive the JA transitional payment &ndash; subject to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance means test. </p><p>  OFP recipients affected by the age reform are supported by the Department to transition to other social welfare income support payments as appropriate.  These include the family income supplement (FIS), the carer&rsquo;s allowance (CA) payment, the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) payment and the JA transitional arrangement.  The Department engages with these customers well in advance of their payment ending to support them through this change and to ensure that they continue to receive social welfare income support as appropriate.  </p><p>  OFP customers leaving the scheme, who are also in receipt of Family Income Supplement, will be moved to an increased Family Income Supplement payment.  OFP customers leaving the scheme, who are also in receipt of a half rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance payment, will be moved to a full-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance payment.  The majority of customers who do not fall into this category can apply for the JA payment or the JA transitional arrangement. Applications for these income support payments are expedited for these customers.  </p><p>  Previous OFP recipients who avail of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, including the JA transitional arrangement, are required to engage with the Department&rsquo;s activation service where they are provided with access to a range of educational and employment supports to increase their skills and move them into the labour market.  As such, lone parents are now obliged to engage in education, training, and employment programmes in order to retain their social welfare income support payment.  This is a significant reform for lone parents as it is the first time that this cohort have access to the Department&rsquo;s full activation process and services to assist them to make their way towards employment and financial independence.  Lone parents who do not engage in the activation process will be subjected to the same penalty rates and disallowances as every other jobseeker.  There are no plans to review these reforms to the OFP scheme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-24a.577.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014062400060#WRK01300"><p>The OECD Review of Pensions in Ireland, which was published last year, provides an international perspective on Ireland&rsquo;s retirement-income provision. Whilst endorsing pension policy reforms undertaken to date, the report also makes a number of recommendations for future reform in the key parameters of Irish State, occupational and private pension schemes and outlines options for more profound structural reforms of the retirement income system.  In considering these alternatives, the OECD highlighted that it should be kept in mind that each of the national schemes and reforms discussed in the review was adopted in a specific national economic, social and political setting and that there is no blueprint for future reform which Ireland could take off-the-shelf and implement directly.  As was expressed by the OECD, any solution has to fit the Irish situation. </p><p>  A key recommendation made by the OECD is to improve the adequacy and sustainability of pensions by increasing coverage in the supplementary part of the pensions system through a universal mandatory or quasi-mandatory employment-based pension system and/or through improving existing financial incentives. This recommendation is in line with the Programme for Government commitment to reform Ireland&rsquo;s pension system to progressively achieve universal coverage, with particular focus on lower-paid workers.</p><p>  The fundamental policy rationale in this area is to ensure that those who do not currently have a supplementary pension are assisted and encouraged towards having one.  As I have previously stated, a soft-mandatory approach such as that envisaged by an auto-enrolment scheme, using scale to achieve greater cost efficiencies for the member, has been proven a successful and proactive way in which we can increase supplementary pension coverage.  However, it is recognised that introduction of any such initiative would be best supported by a more favourable economic environment than is currently the case.  </p><p>  With respect to OECD recommendations about Defined Benefit schemes, legislation has recently been introduced to provide for minimum guarantees for scheme members in the case of double insolvencies.  This legislation removes the absolute priority order for pensioners and facilitates a greater degree of risk sharing across all members of DB schemes.</p><p>  In relation to the State pension, reforms will continue with the current PRSI system and, as highlighted by the OECD, to strengthen the link between social insurance contributions and benefits received.  In this regard, a number of significant reforms have already been introduced and further reforms are scheduled for the years ahead. </p><p>  Firstly, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension were introduced.  These additional payment rate bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.  </p><p>  Secondly, with effect from April 2012, the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a State pension increased from 260 paid contributions to 520 paid contributions.  </p><p>  Thirdly, it is planned to introduce a &ldquo;total contributions approach&rdquo; to determine eligibility for a State pension. The level of pension paid will be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life. The proposed date for the introduction of a move to a total contributions approach is 2020, but this may be subject to change. </p><p>  Finally, recent reforms to the pension system include a gradual increase in State pension age to 68 years and the abolition of the State pension (transition). In January 2014, State pension age was standardised at age 66 with the cessation of State pension transition. The State pension age will increase to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028. These reforms were introduced in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives.</p><p>  In relation to the issue of retirement age, I would like to clarify that there is no statutory compulsory retirement age for employees in Ireland.  The setting of retirement age is a matter for agreement within the employer/employee relationship and the contract of employment.  Arising from changing demographics, policy reform will continue to support longer working lives and to focus on the need to provide for sustainable and adequate pensions.</p></reply>

My Department have been advised by Solas, (formerly F&Aacute;S) that as the allowance is non pensionable in accordance with the rules of the F&Aacute;S Superannuation Scheme, no pension contributions were ever deducted from the allowance.  However, the allowance is subject to the Public Service Pension Related Deduction (Pension Levy) which is deductible from gross remuneration for all staff. </p><p>  In 2012, following their transfer to DSP, the two staff members involved were advised that their secondment arrangements would continue as long as the Partnership Company require their services and that the appropriate allowance could only be paid on receipt of the required signed transfer contract that applied to all staff transferring from F&Aacute;S.

Despite significant levels of State spending on the OFP scheme, the results have been poor in terms of tackling poverty and social exclusion rates among lone parent families, who continue to experience higher rates of &lsquo;consistent poverty&rsquo; in comparison to the population generally. The passive nature of the payment with little systematic engagement being made by the State with recipients has engendered long-term social welfare dependency and associated poverty among one-parent families.</p><p>The reforms to the OFP scheme aim to address these issues by providing the necessary supports to lone parents to help them to escape inter-generational poverty and joblessness, The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2012, contains provisions to reduce, on a phased basis, the maximum age limit of the youngest child at which an OFP recipient&rsquo;s payment ceases to 7 years from 2014 for new entrants and from 2015 for existing recipients.  </p><p>The next phase of the OFP age reductions will take place on 3 July 2014 when it is expected approximately 5,140 customers will leave the OFP scheme on that date. The Department has contacted all affected customers and has invited them to attend information seminars or one-to-one sessions in their respective Social Welfare Local Office. The purpose of these sessions is to brief affected lone parents on the broad range of income and other supports, which the Department provides.</p><p>Special arrangements have been introduced to ease affected lone parents make the transition to another income support payment. For instance, affected OFP customers who are also in receipt of the Family Income Supplement (FIS) will have their FIS payment automatically adjusted to take account for approximately 60% of their loss of OFP.  However, it is expected that the majority of affected customers will apply for the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance (JA) payment. As 64% of the existing OFP population do not work it is expected that the majority of customers will suffer no loss in income when they make the transition from OFP to JA.  </p><p>However, in cases where customers are employed and have earnings in excess of &euro;60 per week, they will see a reduction in their weekly social welfare payment should they make the transition from OFP to JA. The reason for this reduction is the difference in the earnings disregards between the two payments. OFP recipients receive an earnings disregard of &euro;90 per week while the JA equivalent is &euro;60 per week. In addition, the OFP taper for amounts in excess of the disregard is 50% while JA has a higher taper of 60%. The table depicts the losses of income when a lone parent with one child who is working moves from OFP to JA.<table><tr><th>Earnings</th><th>OFP</th><th>JA</th><th>Total OFP income (earnings + OFP)</th><th>Total JA income (earnings + JA)</th><th>Total income entitlement loss</th></tr><tr><td>&euro;0.00</td><td>&euro;217.80</td><td>&euro;217.80</td><td>&euro;217.80</td><td>&euro;217.80</td><td>&euro;0.00</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;100.00</td><td>&euro;217.80</td><td>&euro;193.80</td><td>&euro;317.80</td><td>&euro;293.80</td><td>&euro;24.00</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;200.00</td><td>&euro;170.30</td><td>&euro;133.80</td><td>&euro;370.30</td><td>&euro;333.80</td><td>&euro;36.50</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;300.00</td><td>&euro;120.30</td><td>&euro;73.80</td><td>&euro;420.30</td><td>&euro;373.80</td><td>&euro;46.50</td></tr></table></p><p>Former OFP recipients, who avail of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, are required to engage fully with the Department&rsquo;s activation process.

The cost includes an increase, where applicable, in the qualified adult rate to that applying to recipients aged 26 and over. </p><p>  The cost of re-introducing a telephone allowance of &euro;9.50 per month for pensioners aged 66 and over is estimated, based on recipient data at the end of 2013, at &euro;35 million in a full year. Extending similar entitlement to cohorts aged under 66 who were previously eligible for the allowance such as invalidity pensioners, recipients of carer&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance would cost an additional &euro;10 million in a full year. </p><p>  The cost of increasing the rates back to school clothing and footwear allowance (BSCFA) by &euro;50, based on recipient data in 2013, is estimated at &euro;16.2 million in a full year. </p><p>  It was estimated in Budget 2014 that the abolition of payment of the BSCFA for children over the age of 18 years, other than those attending secondary school, would be &euro;2.5 million in 2014 and subsequent years. </p><p>  The cost of increasing the maximum personal weekly rate of welfare payments by &euro;5 per week and &euro;10 per week (with proportionate increases for qualified adults) for all recipients aged under 66 including jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, disability allowance, invalidity pension and carer&rsquo;s allowance is estimated at &euro;219.5 million and &euro;439 million, respectively, in a full year. This costing is independent of the earlier costing shown above in relation to certain jobseekers aged under 26. The additional cost of increasing the maximum personal weekly rates of payment for those aged 66 or over (with proportionate increases for qualified adults) by &euro;5 and &euro;10 is estimated at &euro;136 million and &euro;272 million, respectively, in a full year.</p></reply>

This was, for the first time, signed on foot of a detailed specification of services and was openly and publicly advertised in a procurement competition for the delivery of these services.  It was essential that the procurement competition was fully compliant with European procurement law given the previous challenge adjudicated on by the European Court of Justice in relation to the cash payment services delivered through An Post.  The contract has been awarded for two years commencing on 2 January this year.  The contract may be reviewed annually for to four years thereafter &ndash; an accumulated period of up to six years in total up to December 2019.</p><p>  I am confident that the contract for the delivery of payments to welfare clients is now robust.  My next step was to ensure that the legislation backing the contract was equally robust.  The objective behind the proposed legislation currently being considered by the Houses of the Oireachtas is to achieve that new strength in law.  The legal provisions being considered do not interfere with the contract.  They do, however provide a basis for a new resilience in law to fully recognise that these services are being delivered under formal contractual arrangements, which was not the case heretofore. That contract is between me, as Minister, and an external payment service provider, An Post. The proposed amendments, as set out in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2014 reflect the services that An Post is providing to us to deliver welfare payments to properly authenticated clients.</p><p>  The measures contained in the Bill update the legal framework behind the new contract with An Post so as to ensure that its activity on behalf of the Department on a week-to-week basis has the backing required to ensure our fraud and control regime remains robust and resilient.  I place a very high value on protecting the integrity of expenditure from public funds.  Key to this is tackling the risk of fraud and abuse within the social welfare system.  The proposed amendments enhance the Department&rsquo;s opportunities in tackling fraud and abuse within the aspects of the system that directly relate to the payments to clients and allows An Post to work with the Department in implementing these controls.  </p><p>  I am keenly aware of the excellent work carried out by postmasters. I am also aware of the concerns and many debates that have been held over the past few months in relation to the future of An Post.  As Minister I need to ensure that the legislation can stand up to scrutiny and that neither I as Minister, nor An Post are exposed in any manner to any risk to the existing contract.</p></reply>

While as Minister I have responsibility for the legislative and policy frameworks, I have no role or function in determining energy market matters, including matters relating to energy supply for the north Kerry area.  The development and expansion of the natural gas network is in the first instance a commercial matter for Gaslink, which is mandated by legislation to develop and maintain a national system for the supply of natural gas that is both economical and efficient. The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is statutorily responsible for all aspects of the assessment and licensing of prospective operators who wish to develop and/or operate a gas distribution system within the State under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002.</p><p>  The CER&rsquo;s network connections policy provides that in order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be met as a prerequisite. The policy framework provides that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting the town to the network are recouped through the actual consumption of gas and the associated tariffs. This is designed to obviate against uneconomic projects which would increase costs for all gas consumers.</p><p>  The progression of electricity generation infrastructure projects is, in the first instance, a matter between the project developer and the relevant planning authority, having regard to the overarching policy and regulatory framework. </p><p>  Concerning the Shannon LNG proposal, since 2002, the regulation of the gas market has been the responsibility of the CER which is independent in the performance of its functions. I and Government colleagues have consistently been supportive of the proposal by Shannon LNG to construct a LNG terminal near Ballylongford, County Kerry. This LNG facility would bring connectivity for the first time to the global LNG market. The prospect of such a facility is therefore a potentially positive step for the island of Ireland. While neither I nor my Department have any direct role in regard to the project, my officials and I have met with representatives of Shannon LNG to discuss project and EU related issues.  The timing of an investment decision by Shannon LNG is a commercial decision for the company.</p></reply>

These schemes were introduced to incentivise the development of renewable electricity generation capacity necessary to allow Ireland to meet its target of meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable generation by 2020. This target must be achieved in order for Ireland to meet its binding obligation of 16% of total energy demand to be met from renewable sources by 2020.</p><p>The Alternative Energy Requirement (AER) was a series of 6 competitive tender schemes to support new renewable generation that were run to the mid 2000s. REFIT is based around 15 year Power Purchase Agreements between generators and suppliers which provide developers with the necessary certainty required to finance their projects. Both AER and REFIT are funded from the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy.  The PSO levy is charged to all electricity customers. It is designed to support the national policy objectives of security of energy supply, including through the use of indigenous fuels (i.e. peat), and the use of renewable energy sources in electricity generation. The proceeds of the levy are used to recoup the additional costs incurred by suppliers in sourcing a proportion of their electricity supplies from such generators. </p><p>The estimates for how much subsidy is funded by way of the PSO levy for each year since 2003 are published in the annual PSO decision by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). While the bulk of subsidies for renewable electricity generation paid under these schemes have been for wind, the CER has initiated a project to generate a report on the annual and cumulative costs to date in relation to AER and REFIT support schemes for each technology supported. The table presents the costs for both AER and REFIT since 2003 (the 2003 figure for AER is cumulative from the year 2000):<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>AER </th><th>REFIT</th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td></tr><tr><td>2013/14</td><td>-8.0</td><td>51.1</td></tr><tr><td>2012/13</td><td>7.1</td><td>47.5</td></tr><tr><td>2011/12</td><td>0.7</td><td>35.8</td></tr><tr><td>2010/11</td><td>13.5</td><td>29.7</td></tr><tr><td>2009/10</td><td>24.3</td><td>39.8</td></tr><tr><td>2008/9</td><td>-58.4</td><td>24.4</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>0.4</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>-29.9</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>0.2</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>12.3</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td>16.1</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2003</td><td>6.6</td><td>-</td></tr></table>In Decision CER/13/168 of 31 July 2013, the CER has calculated the payment by customer category for the levy period 2013 - 2014. This is approximately 1.25% of a typical domestic electricity bill ex. VAT. This Decision is available on the CER website.</p><p>Analysis is being undertaken by my Department, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, EirGrid and the CER to further assess the costs and benefits associated with achieving 40% renewable electricity generation in 2020, compared to a scenario where renewable electricity remains at 2013 levels. This ongoing analysis will inform a report to be published shortly, and builds on existing work in this area such as the recently published SEAI report on <i>Quantifying Ireland&rsquo;s Fuel and CO2 Emissions Savings from Renewable Electricity in 2012</i>, which found that the value of the fossil fuels not consumed in the Republic of Ireland in 2012 as a result of renewable electricity generation is estimated at &euro;245 million, with the value of avoided CO2 emissions being a further &euro;15 million.</p></reply>

This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and</p><p>- a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>Since publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. </p><p>As a result of this accelerated investment the addressable area required by the State-led intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched. While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns. Consequently, the speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. </p><p>On 25 April last, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment, as part of the State-led intervention under the National Broadband Plan. This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way. </p><p>Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users. The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.</p><p>A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department which will identify those areas that will require a State intervention. I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out. This list is available on my Department's website, . Currently, a total of 18 areas in County Kildare and 40 areas in County Meath have been identified as requiring an intervention. This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the mapping exercise. Further locations may be identified as this process continues. Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention. I expect that this mapping exercise will be concluded in the autumn. </p><p>I would point out that the EU Commission&rsquo;s guidelines on State aid for high speed broadband infrastructure preclude Member States from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out their own infrastructure within the following three years. In this regard, I understand that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out 39 fibre-based broadband networks in County Kildare, including the areas of Newbridge, Maynooth and Maynooth Business Campus, and 36 fibre-based broadband networks in County Meath, including the areas of Carnaross and Moynalty, by July 2016.</p><p>In tandem with the completion of the mapping exercise, intensive design and planning work is ongoing in my Department with a view to producing a detailed end to end strategy for the State led intervention. It is my intention to conduct a full public consultation on the outcome of the mapping process and the proposed strategy. EU State aid clearance will also be required for the intervention once finalised. This will be followed by a detailed procurement process with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in identified areas as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

In addition to onshore oil storage tanks, the facility had a berth (known as a jetty) capable of accommodating large oil tankers. In 1979 a major accident occurred as oil was being unloaded from a tanker called the Betelgeuse. Fifty persons in all lost their lives in this tragic incident, which included a major fire and a series of explosions. The vessel was rendered a total wreck and extensive damage was caused to the offshore Jetty and its installations.</p><p>  As a consequence of the accident, the Terminal was non-operational for some 19 years. Gulf Oil Corporation ceased to exist as an independent company in 1985, when it merged with Standard Oil of California, with both re-branding as Chevron in the USA. In 1986 Chevron withdrew its operations at the Terminal. At that time the State then took over the terminal on Whiddy Island, including the derelict Jetty. An &ldquo;exit payment&rdquo; of US$44 million was paid to the State by Chevron in respect of the State taking over the Jetty, in the context of any future costs associated with the removal or repair on the Jetty, in accordance with environmental standards.</p><p>  The State re-commissioned the terminal in 1998 following the construction of a Single Point Mooring buoy (SPM) in Bantry Bay. The original Jetty was not necessary for the commercial operation of the terminal as this could be carried out using the SPM and the small craft harbour (on the other side of the island) for smaller operations.  In 2001 the State sold the Whitegate refinery together with the Whiddy Island terminal facility to Tosco Corporation. Tosco made it clear that they would not take any responsibility or liability for any issue relating to the Jetty. The State accepted Tosco&rsquo;s position on this matter during the sales process and provided a guarantee to that effect. </p><p>  The guarantee entered into by the State to retain liability for the Jetty at the time of the sale to Tosco related to a liability not held by any other party and in respect of which the State had previously received compensation. If the facilities had not been sold, the State would have continued to be potentially liable in this area, without any formal limitations.  Irish National Petroleum Corporation (INPC), which is the State company which previously ran the refinery and Whiddy Island facility, retained certain rights and obligations under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) relating to the 2001 transaction. INPC has no staff and a Board oversees the company&rsquo;s outstanding liabilities. INPC recently tendered for an Engineering and Risk Assessment of the Jetty for the purpose of evaluating its current condition.</p></reply>

Fingal County Council (pursuant to section 152 of the Planning &amp;amp; Development Act, 2000 as amended) issued a Warning Letter to the owner of the cottage on foot of the erection of the gate. In response, the previous owner sought clarification by way of a referral under section 5 of the Act to clarify if the erection of the gate was exempted development. In this regard, it is contended by the previous and current owners that the gateway was erected in compliance with the conditions and limitations associated with Class 5 of Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Planning Regulations, and that the pathway which would be closed off by this gate is not a public right of way.  As such, they contend that it is exempted development under the planning legislation.  </p><p>  Fingal County Council, considering all the facts and details submitted, concurred with the previous and current owners that the development in question (i.e. the erection of the gate) was exempted development.  This determination by Fingal County Council was appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la by a local group, Howth Pathways.  An Bord Pleanala subsequently set aside the determination of the Council and decided that the erection of the gate constituted development and was not exempt.  This Section 5 determination is now the subject of High Court Proceedings.   </p><p>  In September 2013, the High Court made an Order putting a stay on any steps being taken or any action being initiated pending final determination of the proceedings.  Consequently any action by Fingal County Council in respect of the statutory Warning Letter originally issued must be stayed in accordance with the terms of the High Court Order. The proceedings were listed in the High Court Judicial Review list in November 2013 and again in January 2014 but they were deferred on each occasion.  Pending final determination on this matter by the High Court, Fingal County Council is precluded from taking any enforcement action in relation to this matter.</p></reply>

The three Departments concerned have agreed to a funding transfer from DSP to my Department for the projected programme costs, which is based on the movement of 3,595 cases into HAP across the 7 of the pilot authorities.  All three Departments are continuing discussion on the arrangements for funding the administration costs of HAP by local authorities, as approved by Government.  A shared service is being provided by Limerick City and Council for 5 of the pilot authorities which is designed to deliver efficiencies in the implementation of HAP during the pilot phase. </p><p>  HAP is essentially a new area of activity for local authorities with consequent decisions required as to how best to deliver the service in the local government sector.  In that context, a business case has been drafted which develops a number of options for delivery which have been subjected to assessment against pre-determined criteria.  Best practice guidelines in respect of the drafting of the business case and a peer review process have been followed to ensure efficiency and effectiveness. </p></reply>

Both the Heads of the Bill and the National Policy Position which the legislation will underpin were finalised having regard to the substantial public consultation which my Department facilitated in 2012, and the second round of consultation facilitated by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht last year. A very broad range of issues was raised in both consultations and I am satisfied that the National Policy Position and the planned legislation reflect where the balance lies at this time in terms of the views across the spectrum of stakeholders and society generally. Both the National Policy Position and Head 4 of the General Scheme of the Bill address the fundamental objective on transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient, and environmentally sustainable economy in the period to 2050.   </p><p>With regard to climate justice, Ireland has an excellent record of working with key partners in developing countries. We fully recognise the importance of addressing the heightened vulnerability to climate change experienced by some of the world&rsquo;s poorest people. The <i>Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill</i>is focussed on Ireland&rsquo;s domestic transition to low-carbon development. In tandem with our commitment to the developing world, a progressive approach to mitigation at a national level is the most effective contribution we can make to the global-scale actions necessary to combat climate change.</p></reply>

Through careful management of my Department&rsquo;s housing budget in 2013 additional funds were made available to local authorities with high levels of grant activity.  I will be applying the same close scrutiny to the capital budget for 2014 and, in the event of savings arising, these grants will be a priority for supplementary funding. </p><p>  In January 2014, some changes to the terms and conditions of the grant schemes were notified to local authorities.

In terms of the delivery of social housing, the main focus in terms of supports provided by Government will be on meeting the most acute needs &ndash; the housing support needs of those unable to provide for their accommodation from their own resources.  Under Action 8 of the Government&rsquo;s <i>Construction 2020</i>strategy, a Social Housing Strategy is to be published by Q3 2014. To assist in the development of this Strategy the Housing Agency has invited submissions by 31 July 2014. This invitation for submissions is available at the following weblink: </p><p>I am determined to ensure that the Strategy optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested. To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs. The financial parameters within which we continue to operate will not facilitate a return to large-scale capital funded construction programmes. </p><p>As a result of the economic downturn there has been an associated significant decline in construction activity.  As the extent of social housing gain from Part V of the Planning and Development Acts is directly related to private housing construction, the current situation is that Part V is delivering little in terms of social housing. Action 9 of <i>Construction 2020</i>provides that a review of Part V will be completed by the end of Q2 2014. I am committed to the principle of a social housing gain from private development but to maximise that gain we need a properly functioning and sustainable construction sector. I believe that the Part V mechanism has the potential to again be a significant contributor to social housing in the context of a recovering housing market. </p><p>It is anticipated that any legislative changes required on foot of the review will be incorporated into the General Scheme of a Planning Bill, which is currently in preparation.</p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from each customer in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers. </p><p>Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations 2014, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, suppliers of drinking water are required to ensure that the water supplied is wholesome and clean. Water which is wholesome and clean is defined as water which is free from any micro-organisms and parasites and from any substances which in numbers or concentrations constitute a potential danger to human health, and which meets the quality standards specified in the Schedule to the Regulations. </p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the supervisory authority with responsibility for monitoring Irish Water&rsquo;s compliance with these Regulations. In the event of non-compliance with the quality standards set out in the Regulations, the water supplier will investigate the cause in consultation with the EPA and, if a potential risk to human health exists, with the Health Service Executive, to ensure that the appropriate remedial action is taken. This may include the prohibition or the restriction (e.g. a boil water notice) of the supply by the water supplier. The EPA publishes an annual report on the quality of drinking water supplies in Ireland, which sets out details on the numbers of water restrictions and boil water notices. Copies of these reports are available in the Oireachtas library or from the EPA website (). </p><p>I intend to use my powers under the Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 to issue a Water Charges Policy Direction to the CER in relation to a number of matters relating to domestic water charges including where the quality of water services provided by Irish Water to customers is impaired or where services are reduced or restricted.  The Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 requires the CER to perform its functions in a manner that best serves the interests of the customers of Irish Water. This is similar to the CER&rsquo;s statutory role in respect of the gas and electricity sectors. I fully expect that the CER will consider compliance with statutory standards by Irish Water in the discharge of its functions.</p></reply>

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies. The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group and assigned the company the necessary powers to allow it to undertake the metering programme. </p><p>Most meters for public utilities are located at the point where the connection enters the household. In the case of water services, under the provisions of the Water Services Act 2007, households&rsquo; pipes internal to the boundary of a property are considered the responsibility of the householder, and thus water meters are being fitted at the stopcock at the boundary of the property. As this is located on publicly accessible land, it minimises disruption during the installation programme and also in terms of meter reading in due course as access is not required to people&rsquo;s homes.  Meters will be read automatically and the information will be provided directly to customers in their bills.  Any unusual usage patterns can be discussed with Irish Water if the householder is concerned.  Irish Water has confirmed to my Department that all the water meters in use by Irish Water comply with the Measuring Instruments Directive. In all customer communications, Irish Water asks any householders with any disability, mobility or medical concerns to contact its call centre (1890 278 278) in advance of the meter installation so any additional support or advice can be arranged. </p><p>In common with meters for other utility services, the meters remain the property of Irish Water and it is illegal to tamper with a meter.  However, as the meter boxes are not sealed, it will be possible for a customer to access the meter to verify readings if necessary.  Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives. They may be contacted via email to <i>oireachtasmembers@water.ie</i>or by telephone on 1890 278 278.</p></reply>

The announcement of the review followed consideration of various sample complaints and concerns referred to the Minister by a number of stakeholder groups and individuals. While it was originally contemplated that this review might be undertaken by consultants, it was subsequently decided that the review should be prepared internally by my Department in light of increasingly constrained Exchequer resources. </p><p>  The Planning Review Report to review the performance of the planning functions in certain selected planning authorities was published on 12 June 2012. The Report recommended 12 actions which entail legislative change and consolidation, revised guidelines and improved management systems in planning authorities. I subsequently committed to have the Report assessed by an independent planning expert and, on 8 March 2013, I published the &ldquo;Independent Evaluation of the Planning Review Report June 2012&rdquo; prepared by Mr. Hendrik van der Kamp. The report by Mr. Hendrik van der Kamp led to some modifications to the original 12 recommended actions. Those actions requiring statutory underpinning are being considered in the context of forthcoming planning legislation. Others actions have been reflected in the initiation of the review of development management guidelines and the finalisation of local area plans guidelines for planning authorities and related best practice guidance. </p><p>  I will further consider the recommendations of both these reports in light of the forthcoming independent planning review being undertaken by MacCabe Durney Barnes Consultants on the performance of planning functions in six of the previously selected planning authorities (Carlow, Cork, Galway and Meath County Councils, and Cork and Dublin City Councils). This review is being undertaken in order to ensure maximum transparency and integrity for the planning system generally and is progressing in accordance with section 255 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  The review is focused on procedures and practices rather than individual planning decisions.</p><p>  The review of the performance of the planning functions of the seventh planning authority which was part of the original 2012 planning review (Donegal County Council) is not included in the scope of this current independent planning review and accordingly the consultants involved will not be contacting the Donegal complainant. In this regard, on 14 June 2013, the High Court made an Order quashing that part of the original Planning Review Report relating to Donegal following a settlement between my Department and the party concerned who had brought judicial review proceedings in respect of that part of the Report. The matter has now been disposed of to the satisfaction of both sides.</p><p>  In light of these proceedings, my Department subsequently sought the advice of the Attorney General on how best to proceed in the case of Donegal. My Department is continuing to engage with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office on the matter and the course to be pursued in this case.  It is expected that further legal advice will be provided in the near future, thus informing the next steps to be taken in relation to Donegal.</p></reply>

However, the Retail Planning Guidelines published by my Department in 2012 provide policy direction for local authorities which relates, <i>inter alia</i>, to commercial properties. The Guidelines provide advice to local authorities with regard to preparing the retail content of a development plan. They require development plans and their supporting analyses to adopt a proactive approach to the development of city and town centres, assessing their vitality and viability, investigating potential development opportunities and activating potential development and redevelopment opportunities.</p><p>Annex 2 of the Retail Planning Guidelines recommends examining the strengths and weaknesses of town centres to inform authorities on how well centres are performing in terms of their attraction, accessibility, amenity, and action programmes.  One such indicator is the proportion of vacant street level property. The guidelines also advise that the indicators should be collected and monitored regularly for the main centres in the retail hierarchy in order to provide baseline information on the health of town centres and help inform the preparation of city or town centre strategies.</p><p>Local authorities also have the power to levy rates on the owner of vacant property under the Local Government Act 1946, where a property is unoccupied on the date of the making of the rate. The recent Local Government Reform Act 2014 provides for a change to rating law in relation to the refund of rates on vacant properties and gives discretion to the elected members of individual local authorities to vary the level of rates refunds that apply in individual local electoral areas within the authority&rsquo;s administrative area. This discretion allows elected members to respond to the differing characteristics of the local commercial property markets. The collection of rates and the determination of eligibility for a refund in this context are matters for each individual local authority.</p></reply>

The Agreement will signal a significant shift in how the world will deal with the challenge of climate change.  The milestones on the way to the Paris COP have already been agreed. At COP19 in Warsaw in 2013, Parties agreed that they would bring forward their intended, nationally-determined, contributions - which will become mitigation commitments under the new Agreement - well in advance of the Paris Conference and in the first quarter of 2015 for those in a position to do so. The EU, along with the US and others, has committed to that timetable.</p><p>COP20 , which will be held in Lima, Peru in December 2014, will further develop elements for a negotiating text and will decide on the type and level of information that will be needed to accompany Parties&rsquo; contributions to ensure they are easily understood by all. This will enable the consideration of intended contributions in terms of their aggregate adequacy in relation to the global goal of keeping the average temperature increase to less than 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels.</p><p>Ireland participates in the UN climate process through the EU, and Ireland&rsquo; s preparations for the Paris Conference will be finalised in the context of the overall contribution by the EU and its Member States. The EU contribution, which the European Council has committed to bringing forward in the first quarter of 2015, will be informed by the outcome of the ongoing discussions on the recent Communication from the European Commission on <i>a policy framework for climate and energy in the period from 2020 to 2030</i>.</p><p>At national level, I recently published the <i>National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development</i>and the <i>General Scheme of the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill</i>.  The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy over the period to 2050.  Proposed statutory authority for the plans is set out in the General Scheme of the Bill.  In anticipation of the planned legislation, work is already underway on developing a National Low-Carbon Roadmap to 2050, the primary objective of which will be to identify additional measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low-carbon transition agenda.</p></reply>

The KCS document is the outcome of a review of fire service activities and sets out a system of national processes and standards for fire service delivery in Ireland based on a risk management approach. This addresses the critical elements of fire prevention and fire protection in buildings as well as fire brigade response.</p><p>The retained fire service in Ireland is recognised as a particularly appropriate community service provided by the local authorities. Retained fire-fighters are required to live and work close to their fire stations so that they can meet the generally accepted five minute turn-out times. Retained fire-fighters are paid an annual retainer in respect of the availability they provide, as well being paid hourly rates for their fire service work as set out in the Table below.</p><p>The standards for provision of fire services contained in KCS are based on an &lsquo;area risk categorisation&rsquo; system which is being applied across the country by all fire services. This results in individual fire station areas being risk-graded across five bands from very high to very low, based on analysis of relevant local factors including three years of activity data. The fire service response in terms of numbers of fire appliances and fire crews in an area is related to this risk categorisation. The Pre-Determined Attendance (PDA) is the initial fire service turnout in response to a call for assistance from a member of the public, and indicates the number of appliances that will be mobilised automatically in response to calls for assistance to particular categories of incident.</p><p>For the first time in Ireland, KCS sets out standards for normal crewing levels on fire appliances which are very much in line with international practice; the first appliance mobilised to an incident should have a normal crew compliment of 5 personnel, to include a designated Incident Commander, with 4 personnel on the second or subsequent appliances mobilised from the same station. However, KCS makes clear that this is a norm and additional available crew over the initial five may travel on the first responding fire engine or on another fire vehicle as arranged locally. The crewing standards in KCS do not affect the incomes of retained fire-fighters in any way, which are based on the availability and rates of pay as set out above.</p><p>KCS properly seeks to continue the downward trend in the number of fires and other incidents which the fire services respond to annually. However, the setting of national standards for Pre-Determined Attendances is expected to lead to an increase in the number of fire service turn-outs for some categories of incidents. It is also clear that implementation of KCS is leading in many cases to a higher level of other activities, including training and community fire safety, for retained fire-fighters.</p><p>The current rates applicable to Retained Firefighters are contained in the table below:</p><p><b>Retained (Part-Time) Fire Service</b><table><tr><th>Service </th><th>Station Officer </th><th>Sub Officer, Driver Mechanic </th><th>Firefighter </th></tr><tr><td>0 - 5 years </td><td>&euro;15,438 </td><td>&euro;11,687 </td><td>&euro;8,402 </td></tr><tr><td>5 &ndash; 10 years </td><td>&euro;17,345 </td><td>&euro;13,130 </td><td>&euro;9,439 </td></tr><tr><td>10 years + </td><td>&euro;19,078 </td><td>&euro;14,442 </td><td>&euro;10,383 </td></tr></table><table><tr><th><b>Hourly rate of attendance -</b></th><th><b>Drill</b></th><th><b>Fire</b></th><th><b>Fire</b></th><th><b>Fire</b></th><th><b>Fire</b></th></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Day</td><td>Day  </td><td>Night/Weekend</td><td>Night/Weekend </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>1st Hour </td><td>Subsequent Hours </td><td>1st Hour </td><td>Subsequent Hours </td></tr><tr><td>Rate per Hour </td><td>&euro;19.86 </td><td>&euro;39.72 </td><td>&euro;19.86 </td><td>&euro;79.44 </td><td>&euro;39.72 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

As required by the Act, a draft of the policy direction issued to the CER and the Joint Oireachtas Committee for the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, and was published in Iris Oifigi&uacute;il.  The draft direction was also published on my Department's website for public consultation.  The closing date for receipt of submissions on the draft direction was 16 June 2014.</p><p>  I can confirm that a submission was received from the Marino Residents Association before the closing date.  All submissions received are currently being reviewed in my Department and I intend to issue the policy direction to the CER after the completion of this review.  The approach to charging will be outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan to be submitted by it to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act.  The CER will be responsible for approving the water charges plan, following public consultation, which will set the approaches to charging domestic and non-domestic customers.  In making its decision on the approval or otherwise of the first water charges plan, the CER will take into account the policy direction issued by me.   </p><p>  The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water and assigned the company the necessary powers to allow it to undertake the water metering programme.  Of the estimated 1.35m domestic properties connected to public water supplies, approximately 300,000 properties will not be metered as part of the current phase, due to the cost or technical difficulty of doing so.  These properties would include apartment blocks, other multi-occupancy buildings and houses with shared service connections.  Irish Water has confirmed to my Department that the current phase of the metering programme in the Marino area was substantially completed in December 2013 and January 2014.  Significant proportions of the dwellings were found to be shared services and were not metered under this phase of the programme.  While Irish Water cannot confirm an exact percentage, the report from the metering contractors is that the incidence of shared service connections in the Marino area was about 4 in 5 households.   </p><p>  Irish Water commissioned a study on possible approaches to metering properties that are not part of the current metering programme, including apartments and properties with shared service connections.  This report was recently submitted to my Department and the recommendations of the report are being considered.</p></reply>

The objective of the Regulations is to protect ground and surface waters, including drinking water sources, primarily through the management of livestock manures and other fertilisers.  In order to protect drinking water sources from the risk of pollution, the Regulations lay down general minimum set back distances around abstraction points used for the abstraction of drinking water for human consumption.  Land spreading of organic fertilisers (e.g. manures and slurries) is not permitted within those set back areas.  The set-back distance requirements are 200 metres from an abstraction point for a water scheme supplying 100m3 or more of water per day or serving 500 or more persons, 100 metres for an abstraction point for a water scheme supplying 10m3 or more of water per day or serving 50 or more persons, and 25 metres from any borehole, spring or well used for the abstraction of water for human consumption.   </p><p>  These setback distances can be reduced to 30 metres (and 15 metres in the case of small abstractions) where the local authority determines that the reduced distance does not give rise to a risk to the water supply and a potential danger to human health.  This requires the local authority to undertake a technical assessment of conditions in the vicinity of the abstraction point, taking into account soil conditions, land-spreading pressures in the area, the type of drinking water abstraction, the available water quality evidence and the likely risk to the drinking water supply source.  The Environmental Protection Agency has provided guidance to assist local authorities in this regard.   </p><p>  Ireland's Nitrates Action Programme was substantially reviewed in 2013 in a process that included public consultation.  No changes to set back distances from drinking water sources were made on foot of this review.  The Programme will be reviewed again in 2017.</p></reply>

The objective of the guidelines is to ensure high quality sustainable development through facilitating:</p><p>- quality homes and neighbourhoods;   </p><p>- places where people want to live, work and raise families; and   </p><p>- places that work in relation the provision of infrastructure.   </p><p>  The guidelines set out a broad policy context for the achievement of sustainable development by balancing the need to ensure the highest standards of residential design, while at the same time ensuring efficient use of scarce land and infrastructural resources and the avoidance of urban sprawl.  In particular, the guidelines set out a range of densities appropriate to different location types, from lower densities in the range of 15-20 dwellings per hectare at the edges of smaller towns and villages for private site type developments to densities in the range of 20-40 dwellings per hectare in more centrally or edge of centre sites in smaller towns, through to densities in the range of a minimum of 50 dwellings per hectare in larger urban areas along public transport corridors.  The guidelines also place a heavy emphasis on the importance of public infrastructure such as public transport, community facilities and sports facilities as densities increase towards more central urban locations, and of the development plan process in achieving effective outcomes in securing sustainable urban development.   </p><p>  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is required to take the guidelines into account in the performance of its statutory planning functions.  The comments of the Chairperson at the launch of the Annual Report of the Board for 2013 were particularly focussed on the future sustainable development of the Greater Dublin Area and are broadly in line with the national policy on urban residential densities outlined above.  In this regard, it is considered in the overall context of the development of new housing in the Greater Dublin Area, and indeed in the other major urban centres, that the quality of urban construction and house design is consistent with best international standards in order to ensure the highest sustainable living patterns into the future.</p></reply>

In Dublin, rents for houses increased by 6.7% annually, and for apartments the figure was 10.3%. </p><p>  The fundamental reason behind the rise in rents is a lack of supply.  In 2006, some 93,419 housing units were completed across the country, 19,470 of them in Dublin.  In 2013, a total of 8,301 homes were completed nationally with just 1,360 in Dublin.  The volume of activity in residential building and construction remains less than half of the volume seen in the year 2000.  Increasing both public and private housing supply is a critical issue and the Government's Construction Strategy, published on 14 May 2014, is a blueprint for a properly functioning and sustainable construction sector.  It provides for a strategic approach to the provision of housing based on real and measured demand and addresses the full range of relevant issues including the planning process, financing, access to mortgage finance and the construction workforce.   </p><p>  Resolution of the housing supply situation is the key element in restoring stability to the market but I recognise that the provision of additional units of housing takes time.  Consequently, I have asked the Private Residential Tenancies Board to carry out a focused piece of research that will explore options to address the difficulties being experienced in segments of the private rented sector due to rising rents and to report back to me with policy recommendations before the end of June.  My goal is to achieve stability and sustainability in the market for the benefit of tenants, landlords and society as a whole.</p></reply>

As the extent of social housing gain from Part V is directly related to private housing construction, the current situation is that Part V is delivering little in terms of social housing.  I am committed to the principle of a social housing gain from private development but to maximise that gain we need a properly functioning and sustainable construction sector.  I believe that the Part V mechanism has the potential to again be a significant contributor to social housing in the context of a recovering housing market. </p><p>The Government's recently published <i>Construction 2020 &ndash; A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector</i>aims to build a competitive, innovative, and sustainable construction sector.  Action 9 of the strategy provides that the review of Part V will be completed in Q2 of 2014.  It is anticipated that any legislative changes required on foot of the review will be incorporated into the General Scheme of a Planning Bill, which is currently in preparation. </p><p>While the local authorities will continue to have the lead role in addressing social housing need, in their capacity as statutory housing authorities, the growing role of the not-for-profit sector, as represented by the Approved Housing Bodies, and other potential investors must also be further developed.  My intention is that the Social Housing Strategy, provided for in Construction 2020 and now in preparation, will be both challenging and innovative, and will provide the basis for an enhanced approach to social housing provision in Ireland.</p></reply>

The broad outline for developing the beef industry in Ireland was set out in my Department&rsquo;s Food Harvest 2020 (FH2020) strategy. The recommendations for development of the sector included the identification of &ldquo;target markets for which access for Irish beef, beef offals and breeding stock should be secured&rdquo;.</p><p>  My strategy for implementing this recommendation is to constantly develop relationships in existing and in new and expanding international markets, raising the profile of Ireland and increasing international confidence in Irish production and control systems. Since taking office I have led trade missions to China, the US, Algeria and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries in the Middle East. Last saw year saw yet another increase in the value of our beef exports, which rose to almost &euro;2.1 billion.</p><p>  Ireland is more than six times self sufficient in beef and therefore the promotion of Irish beef on external markets is critically important to the sector. There is a strong demand for meat globally and my focus is aimed at enabling Irish exporters to take advantage of the opportunities that arise. My Department engages on a daily basis with many countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia and Irish embassies&rsquo; personnel on market access issues. These initiatives have led to a number of notable successes in securing market access from authorities in Japan, Singapore, Egypt and Iran.  This year to date we have agreed access terms with the Lebanon and Namibia. In 2013 the value of beef exports is estimated to have increased by 10%, driven by a 5% rise in output and a similar jump in average prices.</p><p>  In November 2013, the US lifted its ban on the importation of beef from the European Union. This was one of my priorities the previous year when I visited the US, where I pushed the matter strongly with the US Department of Agriculture Secretary of State, Tom Vilsack and in meetings with Senators. Last week saw a return visit from Mr. Vilsack where we again discussed the issue of Irish beef access to the US. As part of the visit we had the opportunity to visit a beef farm in Co. Kildare to impress upon him and his officials the high quality standards which apply to beef production in Ireland. We now expect an audit team from the US in early July after which they will inform us of their decision regarding re-entry to the market.</p><p>  In December 2013, a delegation from my Department visited China for discussions with authorities there on the lifting of the beef BSE ban which prohibits imports from any EU country. While there are a number of stages to go before Ireland secures access for beef to China, I am hopeful that these can be progressed further in 2014.</p><p>  The Canadian Food inspection Agency (CFIA) visited Ireland in early February 2014 to inspect the control systems in place at national and food business operator level.  A positive outcome to the visit could lead to export opportunities to this premium market in the near future. </p><p>  Irish beef is now listed with more than 75 high-end retail chains across EU markets. This wide portfolio of customers has contributed significantly to higher returns for Irish beef in recent years and reflects the success of Bord Bia&rsquo;s differentiation and premiumisation strategy which focuses on the key attributes of Irish beef: environmentally sustainable, grass-based production systems, full traceability, quality assurance at all stages and superior eating quality. Among Bord Bia&rsquo;s key initiatives this year is the continued development, global promotion and marketing of its Origin Green initiative, designed to establish Ireland as a world leader in sustainably produced food and drink. Over 200 companies are currently working with Bord Bia to develop, and commit to, sustainability plans setting out clear targets in emissions, energy, waste, water, biodiversity and corporate social responsibility activities.</p><p>  This year, I hosted two round-table discussions with the key stakeholders in the beef sector. An important promotional measure that I announced of foot of these discussions is the allocation by Bord Bia of an additional &euro;0.5m to intensify its marketing of Irish beef in the UK, Netherlands and Germany and I understand the bulk of this money will be spent between now and the peak autumn cattle supply period. An additional &euro;85,000 will go towards the UK market, bringing Bord Bia&rsquo;s total spend for marketing Irish beef in the UK to &euro;0.4 million.  The additional expenditure will contribute towards an online promotion on well-known food websites, as well as profiling Irish beef through recipes and competitions.</p><p>  A manufacturing category study is also being carried out to reaffirm the position of Irish beef alongside British beef as an ingredient in value-added ready meals. This &euro;0.5m allocation is in addition to the &euro;9m budget spend per year by Bord Bia on marketing of Irish beef internationally.Domestically, Bord Bia will spend &euro;170,000 this year in the promotion of Irish beef, to reinforce consumer purchasing of beef with the Bord Bia Quality Mark. This is achieved through initiatives such as the airing of television adverts, sponsorship of cookery programs on television such as &lsquo;Nevin Maguire&rsquo;s Home Chef&rsquo;, cookery demonstrations at events such as &lsquo;Bloom&rsquo; and also in schools, as well as publication of recipes in consumer leaflets and on Bord Bia&rsquo;s website.</p><p>  I am sure the Deputy will agree that there are very substantial resources dedicated to the promotion of Irish beef, both home and abroad. The export performance of Irish beef has been one of the major success stories of the Irish agrifood sector in recent years and I expect that our export performance will continue to improve.</p></reply>

I do not have a role in setting prices or the details of commercial arrangements in the food supply chain but I am concerned about fairness and sustainability.  </p><p>  The Consumer Protection and Competition Bill published by my colleague Minister Bruton provides for statutory regulation of certain practices in the grocery sector in the form of regulations with associated sanctions and new investigation and enforcement powers.  The regulations will prohibit many unfair practices including the compelling of payments for the allocation and retention of shelf space and compelling a supplier to obtain any goods or services from particular third parties.  </p><p>  Sustainable food production requires access to a wide range of markets, competitiveness, adding value and innovation. The resources of my Department and its agencies are deployed to support and develop quality production systems, deep market insight, understanding of buyer and consumer needs and facilitating varied routes to market.  I support initiatives which partner retailers, food producers and agencies in improving routes to market.  In the beef sector I have recently hosted two round table meetings to facilitate improved communications between processors, farmers and other stakeholders and in the interests of a more balanced food supply chain I am examining possible legislation to support the development of producer groups in the beef and dairy sectors, to allow for collective action in order to give farmers scale and market presence, and potentially as a vehicle for facilitating technology adoption and the development of quality or other standards. </p><p>  I believe that operators along the supply chain must acknowledge their interdependence and work together to develop a supply chain model which sustains agricultural production at a time  when global demand for food is increasing and Ireland is positioned to grow the value and volume of agrifood products and exports.</p></reply>

The current downward pressure on Irish beef prices is of course replicated in the UK, which is our main export market, and in other key EU markets. That said beef prices in Ireland remain above the average of the EU-15 MS and the price differential between the Irish and UK markets has narrowed substantially in recent months. However as the Deputy is aware, it is not within my gift or that of any Minister for Agriculture to become involved in the issue of beef prices, as this is one between suppliers and processors.</p><p>Against the background of the current concerns, I met separately with representatives of the farm organisations (IFA, ICMSA, ICSA) and meat factories (MII) in February and March this year. More recently, I invited key stakeholders, including farm organisations, beef processors and relevant state agencies, to a round table discussion on the future development of the beef sector on 17 April and chaired a second meeting on 3 June.  There have already been a number of initiatives in the wake of this forum. These include: </p><p>- The Beef Round-table discussions will reconvene quarterly to exchange intelligence on market developments and forecasts particularly in relation to supply, demand, prices, product specifications, retail changes etc; </p><p>- I have committed to launching a &lsquo;Beef Pricewatch&rsquo; online tool to make price information more accessible and free of charge to farmers. Work has commenced and already as an initial step the department has improved its website in order to make price information more user friendly for farmers;</p><p>- My Department is examining the possibility of legislating for the<b></b>recognition of producer organisations in the beef sector. This initiative could provide a vehicle for collective action by farmers in a way that can give them the advantages of scale and market presence, as well as a useful vehicle for transferring technology and expertise to improve profitability at farm level;</p><p>- My  Department will prioritise its targeted on-farm capital investments for suckler farmers through the new Rural Development Programme; </p><p>- Bord Bia has allocated &euro;0.5m to expand and target promotion of Irish beef through its campaigns in the UK and in certain continental markets.</p><p>During the first beef forum, I had requested Mr. Michael Dowling, Chairman of the Beef 2020 Activation Group, to review the implementation of the Group&rsquo;s report, after intensive consultation with all stakeholders. That report has been delivered, and I have asked round-table participants to reflect on its recommendations. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware this year I announced details of an investment package worth up to &euro;40m to beef farmers in 2014, aimed at sustaining a critical mass in the suckler cow herd, the seedbed for our beef industry. This package includes:</p><p>- &euro;23m for the Beef Genomics Scheme;</p><p>- &euro;10m for the Beef Data Programme;</p><p>- &euro;5m for the Beef Technology Adoption Programme; &amp;amp;</p><p>- &euro;2m in residual payments under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme. </p><p>I also announced details in relation to the financial allocations for the new Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 (RDP) as well as outlines of the proposed measures for inclusion. The development of a new RDP will be a key support in enhancing the competitiveness of the agrifood sector, achieving more sustainable management of natural resources and ensuring a more balanced development of rural areas.</p><p>Under the new RDP, beef suckler farmers will be eligible for participation under a range of measures, including: </p><p>- a substantial new agri-environment/climate scheme (GLAS), which will build on the progress made under REPS and AEOS. This will provide for a maximum payment of &euro;5,000 for up to 50,000 farmers and a further payment of up to &euro;2,000 for a limited number of farmers who take on particularly challenging actions;</p><p>- continued strong support for disadvantaged areas (now known as Areas of Natural Constraint) to the tune of about &euro;195 million per year;</p><p>- incentives for on-farm capital investment, including support for the expansion of the dairy sector following the abolition of milk quotas in 2015;</p><p>- knowledge transfer and innovation measures, aimed at underpinning farm viability, sustainability and growth through the adoption of best practice and innovative solutions;</p><p>- a new beef data and genomics measure worth up to &euro;52 million per year aimed at improving the genetic quality of the beef herd;</p><p>- a separate strand of the support for on-farm capital investment will be ring-fenced for young farmers at a higher rate of aid intensity of 60%; &amp;amp;</p><p>- other supports aimed at collaborative farming, artisan producers, organic farming etc.</p><p>The Government is confident that this range of measures will, when taken together with other Pillar I direct payments, assist suckler farmers to improve their on farm viability.</p></reply>

Following months of intense lobbying and negotiation, I announced on 12 June 2014 that I had secured &euro;148 million from the new Fund for the period 2014 to 2020 for the development of the Irish seafood industry and the coastal communities that depend upon it. This funding is more than double the amount that was available to Ireland during the last Common Fisheries Policy and will ensure a strong seafood industry in Ireland that can grow and expand to meet its potential up to 2020.  Ireland&rsquo;s EMFF allocation is to be provided through 5 discrete funding envelopes, namely &euro;71 million for investment in the seafood industry, &euro;32 million for data collection, &euro;37 million for control and enforcement, &euro;5 million for implementation of the Integrated Maritime Policy, and &euro;1.3 million for storage aid. I will be discussing with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the near future Exchequer matching funding, having regard to the general budgetary situation for the coming years.</p><p>  The EMFF Fund will provide support for our fishing fleet to meet the challenges of the new discards ban.  It will support the development of the seafood processing sector, a sustainable aquaculture industry and the communities that depend on a vibrant seafood industry.  </p><p>  My Department has been working since 2013 on developing a new Operational Programme setting out the arrangements for spending Ireland&rsquo;s allocation under the Fund and has engaged with stakeholders on a number of occasions to date.  Further public consultation and strategic environmental assessment will take place over the summer 2014.  The new Operational Programme must be submitted to the European Commission for adoption before the end of 2014.</p><p>  Many investment measures that may be included within the new Operational Programme have the potential to contribute to job creation in peripheral coastal communities, including in particular capital grants to support growth and expansion of seafood processing and aquaculture enterprises and capital allocations to Fishery Local Action Groups for dispersal to projects within their coastal areas. Any allocation to these measures is subject to final decisions on overall priorities for the seafood sector and to ex-ante evaluation by independent consultants of the appropriateness of such measures.</p></reply>

In line with this definition, in circumstances where more than one person has an interest in a herd, my Department requires one person to be nominated as &ldquo;keeper&rdquo; to be the initial point of contact in regard to animal inspections, testing, identification, records etc. to sign documents pertaining to the identification of the animal and to be deemed legally responsible for the day to day care and welfare of the animals.</p><p>  The designation of a person as &ldquo;keeper&rdquo; also places a responsibility on that person to notify the database of animal births, deaths and movements, to keep the herd register and to sign certain documents such as the animal passport when the keeper takes possession of an animal.  The designation of more than one person as &ldquo;keeper&rdquo; would lead to general confusion, possible denial of responsibility, duplication of communication to all named parties and difficulties in prosecutions, all of which could delay immediate action in relation to the prevention of the spread of animal disease and the protection of animal welfare.

Where allegations of non-compliance are made, my Department investigates such matters to ensure that the obligations of all parties under the Milk Quota Regulations are being met, that any levies are paid in full, that the systems and procedures underpinning the operation of the regime are robust and to ensure that there are no financial losses to the Exchequer or the European Union arising from any non compliance.</p><p>  On the question of possible food safety issues, the investigation has shown that the actions in this case related to an internal alteration of records and that all activities in relation to the collection, transportation and processing of the milk concerned were carried out in full compliance with the relevant regulations insofar as these relate to food safety matters. I am satisfied therefore that there were no food safety or traceability issues involved.</p><p>  As I have previously outlined to the House, the investigation carried out by officials in my Department is now complete. At my request, corrective actions have been completed by all parties concerned, including the reallocation of milk to the original supplier; the payment of the super levy fine by the supplier concerned; and the distribution of the unused quota though the &lsquo;flexi milk&rsquo; scheme. I am currently making arrangements with the parties concerned to have these actions independently verified.</p><p>  I have also as indicated, requested that the relevant papers be sent to the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office for advice on whether any further action is warranted, having regard to the provisions of the Milk Quota Regulations or other legal provisions. As this matter is now under consideration with that Office, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the case at this time.</p></reply>

This reputation arises as a direct result of the high level of compliance from stakeholders, coupled with effective enforcement on the part of the staff in my Department.  The Deputy will be aware that any system of enforcement must carry sanctions which are effective, proportionate and dissuasive.  In a minority of cases, this includes submission of files for prosecution before the Courts.  These controls are effected by a range of DAFM inspectorates, including the Special Investigation Unit, which constitutes a very small proportion of the overall DAFM staff involved in implementing legislation and in investigating breaches.</p><p>  The legal costs associated with legal proceedings initiated by my Department as a result of the investigations carried out by the Unit are, in general, borne by the CSSO and are a matter for that body.  However, since 2004, my Department has paid &euro;126,057 in respect of legal proceedings arising from investigations by the Special Investigation Unit.  Such costs have to be seen in the context of the need to preserve the reputation of Irish agriculture and food, exports of which amounted to &euro;10.7 billion in 2013.</p><p>  The investigative procedures adopted by the SIU comply with the standard requirements in regard to the taking and presentation of evidence and the rights of the person or persons being investigated.  They follow the same protocols as are used for criminal investigation carried out by the Garda&iacute;  A formal code of practice relating to the operations of the SIU, which codified existing guidelines, was put in place in February 2004.</p><p>  If stakeholders or members of the public are dissatisfied with the conduct of any member of the Unit, they may, in the first instance, use the Department&rsquo;s documented complaints procedure, which provides for an investigation of the complaint by more senior Department staff who themselves have had no direct role in the original engagement with the client.  If still dissatisfied with the outcome, a complainant also has the right to have his/her complaint forwarded to the Office of the Ombudsman.  As the Office of the Ombudsman already has jurisdiction to investigate complaints by members of the public who believe that they have been unfairly treated by my Department, I would see no reason to seek to establish a further Ombudsman Office.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware the role of GSOC is to receive and deal with complaints made by members of the public concerning the conduct of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na &ndash; it has no role outside of this remit.</p></reply>

Exports are showing double digit growth and a resurgence in demand is making Irish Whiskey the fastest growing premium spirits category globally with premium brands leading the way. In 2013, over 6.2 million 9-litre cases of Irish Whiskey were exported to over 100 countries.  Irish Whiskey embodies traditional skills, authenticity and heritage and is one of the EU products with Geographical Indication status which have been listed for recognition and protection in EU free trade agreements with other countries.</p><p>  As part of Food Harvest 2020, participants in the sector recently came together to form the Irish Whiskey Association and to chart a plan for future development and growth which could see up to sixteen potential new distilleries on the island of Ireland.  Existing distilleries are engaged in major expansion and new entrants, both international operators and smaller independent companies, have plans to invest in the sector.  The expansion under way, both large-scale and niche, will provide a strong base for the sector to expand further and in many cases the investments will also include a tourist element helping to bring jobs and visitors to rural areas.</p></reply>

In this context, an &ldquo;eligible hectare&rdquo; is land that is used for an agricultural activity and includes land used to grow cereals, oilseeds, short rotation coppice, miscanthus sinensis, protein crops, sugar beet, maize, fodder beet, turnips, mangolds, kale, vegetables, potatoes, grass for silage or hay or grazing.  REPS areas such as newly created habitats under option 4a of REPS 3 and REPS 4,.  Areas under linnet and riparian zones are also eligible for SPS.</i></p><p>The Terms and Conditions provide further, as follows:</p><p><i>For land to be eligible, a number of further conditions have to be complied with, namely: </i></p><p><i>1. The land must be used and managed by the applicant. If the applicant is not the owner, he/she must have a lease or rental agreement in place with the owner of the land.  The land must be suitable for and compatible with the farming enterprise; </i></p><p><i>2. There must be independent and suitable access for animals and/or machinery. Independent access means access by public or private roadway or by a defined right of way.  Access over adjoining landowners land, or over land which is subject to a lease or rental agreement to another person, is not acceptable; </i></p><p><i>3. There must be appropriate fencing for the farming enterprise.  Appropriate fencing means stockproof fencing that will control the applicant&rsquo;s animals and also the neighbouring farmer&rsquo;s animals. In mountain/hill areas this generally means sheep fencing; </i></p><p><i>4. There must be defined external boundaries except in the case of commonage; </i></p><p><i>5. If at inspection the applicant claims to be farming the land with animals then the type of animals must be appropriate to the land and there must be appropriate handling facilities available to meet the animals&rsquo; welfare requirements. </i></p><p><i>6. The releasing of animals onto a parcel without conducting the normal husbandry and welfare practices throughout the year does not satisfy the requirement of an agricultural activity and will be deemed to be in breach of Article 30 of Council Regulation 73/2009 </i></p><p><i>7. There must be evidence of an agricultural activity being conducted throughout the parcel, otherwise the unused part(s) of the parcel may be found to be ineligible. This can arise where the stocking rate is too low.</i></p><p>Furthermore, Section 21 of the 2014 Terms &amp;amp; Conditions provides as follows in regard to the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme:</p><p><i>(3) Occupy and farm in your own right and at your own risk a minimum of 3 hectares of forage land, situated in an area within the State designated as a Disadvantaged Area by the Minister and classified as Less Severely Handicapped Lowland or as a Coastal Area with Specific Handicaps or as More Severely Handicapped Lowland or as Mountain Type Grazing.</i></p></reply>

The rationale of linking the scheme with intervention stocks is no longer valid as there has been no surplus product bought into intervention for the last number of years.  However, in March 2014, the European Council and Parliament agreed a regulation to introduce a new Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD) to support the provision of food and consumer products to those most in need.  The Fund will contribute to the reduction of poverty by supporting national schemes that provide non-financial assistance to alleviate food and severe material deprivation.

At the start of each year, my Department issues colour maps of all land parcels declared by farmers in the previous year together with a covering letter. In that letter, farmers are clearly informed of the need to carefully examine each map carefully and to identify and exclude from their application all unfarmed land, ineligible features such as buildings, farmyards, scrub, roadways, forests, lakes etc. included in the land parcels. There is, therefore, an onus on all farmers to ensure that the area of land declared by them as eligible for payment under the Direct Payment Schemes is accurate. They are also given the means to do so by making the ortho-photos available to them on an annual basis. These requirements are also made clear in the Terms and Conditions of the Schemes, which accompanies the pre-printed application form issued to all farmers. </p><p>  In the letters which issue where ineligible areas have been identified, considerable detail regarding the issues and maps to advise of the particular over-claims, are provided, in addition to which farmers are also informed of the appeals process, should   they disagree with my Department&rsquo;s findings.  The appeals process I have introduced is both robust and comprehensive; in the first instance, applicants are entitled to have their case reviewed by submitting their appeal on the form provided by my Department. If they are not satisfied with the outcome of the review, they can appeal their case to the independent-chaired Land Eligibility Appeals Committee. </p><p>  To date, some 10,173 appeals have been received, of which 3,852 have been finalised. A total of 3,464 cases have been referred for verification visit, in order to establish the position on the ground. To date, 179 cases have been referred to the Appeals Committee for consideration; the number of cases being referred will increase, as the number of verification visits finalised increases.</p></reply>

The attainment of this target is underpinned by a number of policies and initiatives; notable amongst these was the establishment of the Teagasc/IFA pig Joint Programme in May 2013. Funded by a levy on each pig slaughtered and/or exported, this has enabled Teagasc to employ four additional advisors and researchers to support producers and the sector through advice, research and education across a range of issues of importance to the sector. Almost &euro;230,000 was collected during 2013 and over 300 commercial pig producers will benefit from this initiative. </p><p>The value of pig output has increased by 41% over the baseline average since the launch of Food Harvest 2020. Output value in 2013 amounted to &euro;436 million, compared to the overall Food Harvest target of &euro;464m by 2020. This compares with the baseline average of &euro;309 million and therefore represents a considerable increase in the performance of the sector.  Based on the above, the value of pig output is more than four-fifths of the way to its 2020 target. The associated volume data shows an increase of 20% during the same time.</p><p>With regard to exports, the 2020 target has already been exceeded. The 2013 outturn of some &euro;485 million compares to an absolute target of &euro;467 million, that being 40% above the baseline.  Fresh<i></i>or<i></i>chilled<i></i>pigmeat<i></i>and frozen<i></i>pigmeat<i></i>have grown by a total of &euro;123m against the baseline. There is an associated volume increase of 57% (47k tonnes), while the volume of edible pig offal, fresh or chilled has increased by 216% (10k tonnes).</p><p>The pig sector is one to which I attach great importance particularly as it is an industry which supports approximately 7,000 jobs including production, slaughter, processing, feed manufacture and services. The sector accounts for 5% of the total agri-food sector and is the 3rd  largest individual component.  I am pleased to note in particular that prices paid to farmers in the pig sector are currently at a three-year high. I will continue to work with the sector at all levels to ensure that implementation of the Food Harvest strategy continues and delivers viable returns for all links in the supply chain.</p></reply>

Exemptions from this general policy are only allowable where a non-EEA student is pursuing a course of study at PhD level and where the student continues to make academic progress with a view to completing their Doctoral studies within four years. A further exemption exists where the Non-EEA student is a participant in an academic programme agreed between the Irish State and another state whereby the student and dependants are sufficiently well funded in respect of all expenses in Ireland, or where any such agreement provides an exemption. </p><p>  In that context the Deputy may wish to note that students from Saudi Arabia, in the vast majority of cases, are resident and funded in Ireland for the purposes of study under the terms of the King Abdullah Scholarship Programme and another similar programme which allows Saudi students to avail of the Family Reunification conditions set out above. </p><p>  With regard to Libyan students, no equivalent scholarship programme agreed between Ireland and Libya is currently in place. In the event of such a programme being discussed and agreed between the relevant national authorities, there is no reason in principle why equivalent Family Reunification conditions could not be put in place.

Upon receipt of an application, an initial examination is carried out to determine if the application is valid. If the application is incomplete then it is returned in its entirety to the applicant. If required information or supporting documentation is missing then the applicant will be given 28 days in which to provide the required information, failing which the application will be rejected.</p><p>  Valid applications are examined to determine if the applicant meets the statutory residency criteria. Applicants with any shortfall in their residency are informed of this and will be able to reapply when they have the required residency.  Those whose applications successfully pass the initial assessment stage are informed that their application has been initially assessed and has proceeded successfully to the second stage of processing.</p><p>  In the second stage of processing the case is examined in detail and enquiries are made with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other Government Departments and external agencies as appropriate in order to determine if the good character condition is satisfied.  When all enquiries have been completed and all necessary documentation has been compiled the case is submitted to me for decision. For over 70% of cases, a decision is being made within 6 months, with the remainder taking longer and in a small number of cases considerably longer to process.</p><p>  The third stage of processing involves notification of my decision to the applicant and, where applicable, the issuing of invitations to citizenship ceremonies, production of certificates of naturalisation and the preparation of ceremony packs. Formal citizenship ceremonies allow candidates for citizenship to make their declaration of fidelity to the Irish nation and loyalty to the State and receive their certificate of naturalisation in a meaningful and dignified manner which befits the importance and solemnity of the occasion. </p></reply>

Direct provision provides for full board accommodation supports while a final decision is awaited by a person on their protection or any related leave to remain application. As at 8 June 2014 there were 4,353 persons availing of direct provision accommodation and supports in 34 accommodation centres in the State.</p><p>  The operation of the Direct Provision system is kept under review and I acknowledge that the length of time that residents spend in Direct Provision is an issue to be addressed.  I have no desire for applicants to remain in the protection system any longer than the minimum period it takes to process their case.  The median processing time to a final decision by the Minister on an asylum application in 2013 was 36 weeks.  Some cases can take significantly longer to complete due to, for example, delays arising from medical issues or because of judicial review proceedings. All asylum applications and appeals are processed in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996 and other relevant statutory provisions.  High quality and fair decision-making in all cases continues to be a key priority at all stages of the asylum process.</p><p>  Persons who are refused refugee status are notified of their entitlement to apply for subsidiary protection.  This is separate to the asylum or refugee status determination process. This is invariably followed by the so-called leave to remain process. Each of these processes which determine whether an applicant can remain in the State are hugely complex and subject to oversight by the courts and have to be examined in accordance with a large body of Irish and international law. There are no shortcuts as the outcomes can lead to the most fundamental life-changing event for the applicants.</p><p>  Measures have recently been taken with a view to delivering improvements in the processing of protection applications. The Deputy may be aware that the European Union (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No. 426 of 2013) were signed into law by my predecessor last November. Under the new Regulations, responsibility for the processing of applications for subsidiary protection was transferred from my Department to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) with appeals to be dealt with by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT).  Both of these bodies are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions and they have substantial experience in the area of asylum investigations and appeals, respectively.</p><p>  Additional resources have been allocated to the establishment and operation of the new arrangements for the processing of these cases which include the engagement of a panel of legally qualified persons to process cases, personal interviews for each applicant at the first instance and the opportunity for an applicant to appeal a negative recommendation of the ORAC to the RAT. The ORAC, in consultation with the UNHCR, have recently published on its website details of how it will prioritise the process of scheduling persons for interview taking into account, inter-alia, dealing with applicants who are longest in the system first. The intention is to process as many of these cases to finality, to include consideration of any leave to remain aspects arising, in the shortest possible timeframe  consistent with quality and fair assessment of all cases and of course, subject to the cooperation of applicants and no further legal impediments arising.</p><p>  The Government remains committed to immigration and protection reform as provided for under the Programme for Government and under the Government Legislation Programme. Legislating to provide the means for a single procedure and related issues to deal with all protection claims is of priority in that it will provide the framework for removing the structural delays which are a feature of our existing protection system. In that respect work by my officials on legislative reform in this area continues, including in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of the Parliamentary Counsel, with a view to bringing forward legislation this year.</p></reply>

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the arrangements in relation to driving licences changed in January 2013. Up to then, when a person was disqualified by a court, they had to send/hand their driving licence into the court office. The disqualification was physically marked on the licence which was then sent to the relevant motor tax office where it was held until the period of disqualification was completed or the licence was restored by the court.</p><p>  From January 2013, the person was required to send the licence directly to the licensing authority. This coincided with the introduction of the new card type driving licences on which details of a disqualification could not physically be entered. The fines notice which now issues to the person who was fined and disqualified includes the following &quot;Please forward your driving licence to the National Driver Licence Service, PO Box 858, Southside Delivery Office, Cork for the purpose of having the particulars of the conviction of disqualification of the District Court endorsed on your driver record&quot;.</p><p>  Prior to 2013, there were no computerised records of any driving licences which were handed in so it is not possible to provide figures for 2012. The Courts Service has advised that all the figures should be available from the local motor tax offices for the period up to the creation of the National Driver Licence Service in late 2013. Figures since then should be available from the National Driver Licence Service.</p></reply>

The conditions are that the applicant must:</p><p>-  be of full age</p><p>-  be of good character</p><p>-  have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years</p><p>-  intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation</p><p>-  have, <font color="#212100">before a judge of the District Court in open court, in a citizenship ceremony or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows&mdash;</font></p><p><font color="#212100">(i) made a declaration, in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, and</font></p><p><font color="#212100">(ii) undertaken to faithfully observe the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values.</font></p><p>A foreign national who is married to, or is the civil partner of, an Irish citizen for at least three years may apply for naturalisation under section 15A of the Irish Naturalisation and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, where they have been continuously resident in the island of Ireland for the year immediately prior to the date of their application and for two out of the four years prior to that year.

That human suffering is still felt to this very day and our thoughts are with the victims of the many atrocities perpetrated over the course of the troubles and their families.</p><p>  Mr. Justice Henry Barron carried out a detailed and painstaking independent inquiry into those awful events and, indeed, other atrocities that took place between 1972 and 1976 in which so many innocent people lost their lives.  Related matters were also investigated by a Commission of Investigation carried out by Patrick McEntee SC.  Arising from the report of the Barron Inquiry and the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights the Garda Commissioner appointed a dedicated liaison officer for the victims of the bombings in Dublin in 1972 and 1973 and in Dublin and Monaghan in 1974.  This dedicated liaison service has been in place since then.  It is currently provided by a Garda Superintendent based at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation in Dublin.</p><p>  It is the policy of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to provide effective liaison with the victims of crime and their families.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is strongly aware of the importance of victims in the criminal justice system and will continue to make efforts to ensure their needs are met, particularly in respect of making information available to them.  The Garda authorities are conscious of the need to ensure that the liaison process is operated in order to best address the needs of the individual victims while at the same time ensuring that criminal investigations would not be in any way compromised.</p><p>  In achieving this and in the interests of operational effectiveness, Garda liaison with the victims of serious crime and their families, such as those crimes related to the conflict in Northern Ireland, is provided directly to them from the Garda Division and investigation team which is investigating the case at hand.  The Garda&iacute; in the Division which is investigating a case are in possession of the detailed and up-to-date information with regard to it and are, therefore, best placed to interact with the victims and their families.  Such interaction is done directly by or under the supervision of the relevant Garda Superintendent.</p><p>  I am sure the Deputy will agree that we must always be conscious that the victims of crime are individuals with individual needs and that any approach must take into account the specific requirements of the individuals themselves.  As part of the Government's comprehensive programme of reform in the areas of policing and justice in the State, I have indicated my intention to bring forward new legislation in relation to the remit of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  One of the issues being considered in the context of this project is the basis on which complaints can be dealt with by the Ombudsman Commission.  However, it will be appreciated that I must, of course, continue to have regard to ongoing developments in relation to the general question of dealing with the past in terms of the troubles on this island. </p></reply>

Our sympathy is with this young boy and his family, and as I outlined to the House last week, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is determined to bring to justice those involved.  I have also indicated my willingness to meet members of the local community.</p><p>  While the challenges faced are very real, Garda&iacute; tackle organised and gun crime through a range of targeted and intelligence based operations, often disrupting and preventing incidents, as well as detecting and prosecuting those involved.  I recently discussed the challenges presented by this type of crime, and particularly its association with organised crime, with the Acting Commissioner, who outlined the substantial efforts being made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to identify and target those involved.</p><p>  Addressing organised crime is a key ongoing priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and this priority is clearly reflected in the Garda Policing Plan for 2014. This priority is given effect through a range of targeted activities designed to disrupt and dismantle criminal operations. This involves the use of focused intelligence led operations by specialist units such as the Organised Crime Unit, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau and international cooperation including through Garda liaison officers based in other jurisdictions and in bodies such as Interpol and Europol.</p><p>  We all appreciate the concern that gun crime gives rise to in the community but it is only right that we also we acknowledge that the number of crime incidents in which a firearm was involved was last seen down, by more than 7%.  It is also important to note that, in addition to law enforcement and criminal investigation, the Garda&iacute; work closely with local communities to address local concerns about crime and community safety, including through schemes to divert young people from getting involved in criminality.</p><p>  It is clear to all that gun crime has for some time been an inherent part of organised criminal activity in this jurisdiction, as it is in other similar countries.  This demands a robust response and this is precisely what is happening.  Considerable powers and investigative tools are available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to which we have recently added the DNA database legislation.  The Garda&iacute; make extensive use of these powers to tackle and disrupt organised crime, with persons regularly brought before the courts and substantial sentences handed down.  I can assure the Deputy that confronting organised crime and the harm it causes is a priority for the Government and will certainly be a priority for me as Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></reply>

Accordingly, decisions in relation to the introduction or extension of such systems are a matter for the Garda authorities.  I am advised that whilst there are currently no plans to install a Garda CCTV system in the area referred to, the question of further extending Garda CCTV schemes is kept under ongoing review in the context of overall policing requirements.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Garda authorities that, following their examination of the report of the Moriarty Tribunal, the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions has been sought on the findings of that examination, with a view to determining whether or not a full Garda investigation should now be commenced.

This has necessitated the temporary redeployment of large numbers of Garda&iacute;, including specially trained personnel, from throughout the Western Region into the Belmullet District.  The reality is that substantial Garda resources have to be tied up in the policing of protest activity at this location.  This has been necessary in view of the actions of some of the protestors, many of whom are not from the area and engage in acts of public disorder as well as damage to property.</p><p>  The action of some of the protestors was designed not just to register their disapproval of the work going on there but to try to prevent that work proceeding. The aim of these policing measures is to prevent public order offences and to ensure that people can go about their lawful business.  From 2011 to 2013, 38 people were brought before the courts for public order offences, criminal damage and assault on Garda&iacute; in connection with the protests at the Corrib site.  The total cost of policing these protests has now reached in excess of &euro;16m. This does not include the significant cost of the basic salaries of the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have performed duties at the Corrib Gas Project as these arise in the normal course.  Such expenditure comes at a time of economic difficulty for the State and when such resources could be put to far better use elsewhere.</p><p>  I am not aware of any basis on which I should initiate a public inquiry into what of its nature is a difficult policing operation.  It is, of course, open to persons to make complaints to GSOC.  In fact, GSOC has investigated in the region of 124 complaints against members of the force arising from policing at this location and that other matters remain under investigation by it.  In excess of 100 of these complaints have either been found by GSOC to be inadmissible or not to have disclosed breaches of discipline on the part of the members complained of, and that those that did indicate a breach of discipline on the part of the Garda member concerned related to the behaviour of the individual member rather than practices, policies or procedures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  As I have indicated previously, a review is ongoing on the effectiveness of the provisions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and Regulations made under the Act insofar as they relate to the oversight of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the powers and remit of the Ombudsman Commission. I have already indicated that I will bring forward very urgent legislation to strengthen the powers and remit of GSOC and this will allow GSOC to undertake reviews of Garda practices, policies and procedures on their own initiative.</p></reply>

Included is a key commitment that the Prison Service will work in partnership with the Probation Service and other stakeholders in developing a strategy for managing women offenders.  This commitment is being delivered through the Services' joint Women&rsquo;s Strategy 2014 &ndash; 2016 which was published on 6 March, 2014.  The strategy entitled &ldquo;An Effective Response to Women Who Offend&rdquo; outlines how the two agencies along with other statutory, community, and voluntary sector partners will provide customised interventions for women with the aim to reduce offending, improve opportunities for reintegration, and to improve outcomes more generally.</p><p>  While the majority of women&rsquo;s offending behaviour is at the lower end of the seriousness scale, it is acknowledged that they generally have a high level of need which can make the impact of imprisonment for them and their families particularly challenging.  This strategy will deal with this through a dedicated and effective approach to working with women offenders.</p><p>  As regards accommodation for female prisoners, a refurbishment project in the D&oacute;chas Centre to convert a building previously used for administration and storage into prisoner accommodation was completed in 2012 providing an additional 20 prisoners spaces.  This Unit is used to house prisoners on an incentivised regime.  A Business case for the modernisation of facilities in Limerick prison is currently being drafted by the Prison Service.  Part of the proposed re-development includes the provision of high quality prison accommodation for female prisoners with capacity of approximately 50 individual cells and 8 custodial apartments.</p><p>  Finally, the Deputy will be aware that a working group was established by my predecessor to conduct an all encompassing strategic review of penal policy.  The Group was asked to examine the role of penal policy in crime prevention, sentencing policies, alternatives to custody, custodial accommodation and regimes, reintegration and rehabilitation as well as any special issues relating to female offenders.  The Group is expected to report shortly.</p></reply>

The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is responsible for the accommodation of protection applicants in accordance with the Government policy.  I acknowledge that the length of time that residents spend in Direct Provision is an issue to be addressed.  My immediate priority is that the factors which lead to delays in the processing of cases are dealt with so that protection seekers spend as little time as necessary in direct provision.</p><p>A key priority for this Government is legislative reform aimed at establishing a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection and any other grounds presented by applicants seeking to remain in the State. Such reform would substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements by removing the current multi-layered and sequential processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their application in a more straightforward and timely fashion.  In consultation with my officials, I am reviewing the work done to date in respect of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill and will then decide on how best to progress the implementation of the Government's priorities, in particular to expedite those relating to the establishment of a single application procedure.</p><p>With regard to the more specific matters raised in the question, as at 8 June 2014 there were 4,353 persons availing of direct provision accommodation in 34 centres under contract to the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department.  Approximately 38 % of these residents are children under the age of 18.  Overall, 68 % of RIA residents had first claimed international protection in Ireland three or more years previously.  More detailed information is available on the RIA website, .</p><p>With respect to the question of standards and inspections, I wish to advise the Deputy of the following measures currently in place:</p><p>- Centres are inspected three times a year, once by an independent company.</p><p>- Regular 'clinics' are held where residents can talk one to one with RIA staff regarding RIA's Child Protection policy and Garda Vetting Policy for all staff; and through its domestic violence and sexual harassment policy.</p><p>- A further complaints mechanism is contained in the centre House Rules which is considered by RIA to be broadly in line with the guidelines set out by the Office of the Ombudsman for internal complaints systems.</p><p>In addition, with respect to child protection, I would add that:</p><p>- The RIA operates a Child Protection Policy is based on the HSE's &quot;Children First - National Guidelines for the protection and welfare of children&quot;.</p><p>- There is a specific unit in RIA called the Child and Family Services Unit, which is fully staffed and whose role is to manage, deliver, coordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all asylum seekers residing in the direct provision system.  It also acts as a conduit between RIA and the HSE, the latter having statutory functions in this area.</p></reply>

My Department does not provide direct funding to local groups, but funding is provided in relation to the employment and associated costs of a National Coordinator and Development Officers, as the long-standing view has been that this is the best use of the resources available to my Department to support effective community crime prevention actions. I am currently providing the maximum possible funding to Community Alert that is open to me, having regard to the overall restrictions on my Department's resources and other expenditure needs.  I understand that funding for Community Alert is also received from the HSE.</p><p>  In relation to Neighbourhood Watch groups, while certain costs related to their operations are funded from the Garda Vote as approved by local Garda management, there is not a specific financial allocation for this purpose.  With respect to the general supports which are available for community crime prevention groups, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have published new Community Crime Prevention Guidelines to facilitate the establishment of new local groups and also to help revitalise existing groups where necessary.</p><p>  Further information, advice and support is available locally from community Garda&iacute;.

As Taiwanese nationals are not required to have a visa to enter Ireland, they already in effect benefit from the new Scheme.  The aim of the BIVS Scheme is to facilitate and promote legitimate travel to Ireland and the UK by visa required tourists and business visitors while also strengthening the external border of the Common Travel Area (CTA).  The Scheme will allow travel to, and around, the CTA on a single visa. Currently, visitors planning to travel to Ireland and then on to the UK have to apply in advance for separate Irish and UK visas. BIVS will dispense with this requirement by allowing visitors to Ireland to enter the UK (including Northern Ireland) on foot of their Irish visa. Furthermore, it will also allow spontaneous trips from Ireland to the UK, including, for example, day trips to Northern Ireland.</p><p>  The Scheme builds on the success of Ireland's Short Stay Visa Waiver Programme, introduced in 2011, which allows nationals of 18 countries (including China and India) to travel from the UK to Ireland using their UK visit visa.  The Deputy may wish to note that Ireland also operates a very successful Working Holiday Authorisation Scheme for Taiwanese nationals who wish to travel to the State for a period of 12 months for the purposes of leisure, study or work, In excess of 250 Taiwanese nationals availed of this Scheme in 2013 and indications are of an even greater uptake this year.</p></reply>

Together with full time members, they provide vital assistance to communities and neighbourhoods right across the country.  The Admission and Appointment Regulations provide that, as part of the competitive selection process organised by the Public Appointments Service for full-time membership of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, <i>&quot;due recognition to any satisfactory service by the person as a reserve </i>member&quot; shall be given to such candidates.  This provision was introduced in order to acknowledge the beneficial experience and skills gained by a reserve member and to allow them, at assessments and at interview, the opportunity to highlight that experience and skill.  It is important that all persons wishing to join the full time force undergo the same competitive selection and recruitment process.  A candidate who fails any stage of the process will be eliminated and will not be allowed re-enter this particular competition.</p><p>The competition for the selection of Garda Trainees attracts a very high number of applicants. Accordingly, the selection process to become a Garda Trainee is comprehensive, with candidates required to undertake a range of relevant assessment tests and exercises over a number of selection stages.  The assessment process will ensure that those that are successful including Garda Reserve members have the capability both to pass the BA course in Applied Policing, as well as the ability to carry out the important functions of a full-time member. I wish to point out that not all Garda Reserve members wish to become full-time members.  It is important that those who do apply for a full-time position have the capability to do so.</p></reply>

In general, the type of situation mentioned by the Deputy may be contrary both to criminal and to civil law.  As regards criminal law, Section 10 of the Non Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 creates an offence of harassment where a person, by any means, intentionally or recklessly, seriously interferes with another person&rsquo;s peace or privacy, including by persistently watching, pestering, or besetting him or her. The Act provides that a person guilty of the offence shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to &euro;2,500 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both. If a person is convicted on indictment, they may be fined and-or imprisoned for up to seven years.</p><p>  As regards civil law, taking images of a tenant without their consent or knowledge in a part of the rented property where they have a reasonable expectation of privacy may be contrary to the terms of their tenancy agreement, including those implied under statute. It may also infringe both common law and constitutional rights to privacy.  Furthermore, the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 generally apply to personal images recorded by means of video cameras unless the recording activity relates to an individual's own personal, family or recreational activities i.e. the &lsquo;household&rsquo; exemption.</p><p>  Since the activity referred to does not appear to fall within the &lsquo;household&rsquo; exemption, the recording of such personal data appears to come within the scope of data protection law. This means that the person responsible for such recording is a &lsquo;data controller&rsquo; for the purposes of the Acts, and that any individual who is filmed may invoke the remedies provided under the Acts, including a right to establish the existence of personal data, a right of access to the data and a right to its erasure. Enforcement of data protection law in this jurisdiction is a matter for the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner. The statutory functions of the Office include the investigation of alleged infringements of the Acts.</p></reply>

The process of examining issues and options has already commenced.  The National Disability Authority (NDA) facilitated consultations with the Deaf Community in Ireland in 2012 at my request in relation to actions that could make improvements in the lives of deaf people and submissions received from them were considered for inclusion where possible and appropriate in the National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan (NDSIP) which was published in July 2013.</p><p>  As part of the follow-up to that initiative, I chaired the first special themed meeting of the National Disability Strategy Implementation Group (NDSIG) on the issue of Irish Sign Language on November 28, 2013. This meeting brought together representatives of relevant Departments, the NDA, the Deaf Community and other relevant stakeholders with a view to further progressing the implementation of the NDSIP in this regard.  The meeting reviewed the current situation across Government Departments and their Agencies with regard to promoting recognition of Irish Sign Language including in-service provision and provided the Deaf Community with the opportunity of presenting their experience of interaction with the Public Sector.  It also provided a useful opportunity to examine mechanisms which could promote the further use and recognition of Irish Sign Language and understand practical implications for service users.  Further to this meeting, the Deaf Community prepared a report to reflect their views on key actions and priorities.</p><p>  This report was submitted for my consideration last month. The intention is that the recommendations from this report  will be reflected in the NDSIP where practicable, through the incorporation of new actions and related performance indicators and timelines as appropriate. Progress on all relevant actions will then be monitored as part of the Implementation Plan monitoring process.  The focus is on the identification of mechanisms for the further promotion and recognition of Irish Sign Language with a view to promoting and supporting its use, so as to improve service delivery on the ground.  I might add that the existing supports for use of Irish Sign Language in Ireland give a level of recognition and practical measures equal to, or above that, in countries which have formally recognised sign language.</p></reply>

An application is first examined in order to determine if the applicant is eligible for refugee status.  If the applicant is found not to be a refugee a second application can be examined in order to determine if the applicant is eligible for subsidiary protection.  By contrast, under a single procedure, following a single examination, the applicant is subject first to a determination as to whether he or she is a refugee, and if not, is then subject to a determination as to whether he or she is eligible for subsidiary protection.</p><p>  The introduction of a single procedure for new applicants would raise the question as to what extent the new procedure could be applied to old cases.  In reality this arises only in the case of applicants who have not yet received a final decision regarding their application for refugee status.  In respect of these applicants it could be possible, consistent with the requirements of legal certainty and administrative practicality, to apply a single procedure while respecting determinations already made.  Therefore, the benefits of introducing a single procedure would not necessarily be limited to new applicants.</p></reply>

The Policing Plan 2014 of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na sets out the continued commitment to pro-actively target groups and individuals engaged in such criminal activity, including multi-disciplinary approaches which are utilised to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in such criminal enterprise are effectively targeted.</p><p>  The Garda National Drugs Unit, working with other national units, including the Organised Crime Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau, target persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to record significant successes in intercepting substantial quantities of controlled drugs and have recorded numerous arrests of individuals involved in the trafficking and distribution of controlled drugs throughout the State.  Given the global nature of the drugs trade, international law enforcement cooperation remains a key element in the overall response to organised drug crime.  In this regard, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has strong and strategic partnerships in place at international level targeting drug trafficking including in working closely with relevant law enforcement agencies such as Interpol and Europol and participating in the Maritime Analysis Operations Centre for Narcotics based in Lisbon (MAOC-N).</p><p>  Drug law enforcement continues to remain a key area as part of the overall comprehensive approach in tackling the problem of drug misuse under the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016.  I reiterate to the House my continued support for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in all their efforts to bring about the successful disruption of the illegal drug trade and I commend them on their ongoing successes in this regard.</p></reply>

The Bureau is being actively utilised to identify and target funds accumulated by those involved in criminal activity, in order to seize such assets and to deprive those involved of the profits of their criminal activity.  Furthermore, 194 asset profilers trained by the Bureau are providing a criminal asset profiling service across the Garda Divisions in relation to persons or suspects operating within the area, with particular reference to those involved in drug dealing and serious criminal activity.</p><p>In accordance with section 21 of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996, an annual report on the activities of the Criminal Assets Bureau is prepared and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.

The scheduling of court cases and the allocation of court business is a matter for the Presidents of the courts and the presiding judge who are under the Constitution independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.  The Presidents monitor waiting times across all courts lists and seek to ensure the optimum use of court time.  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the primary objective for the Service is to maintain the delivery of front line court sittings and services.  The Courts Service continuously works to support the judiciary and assist in ensuring that cases are dealt with as effectively and as speedily as possible.  Available resources and operational and organisational structures are under ongoing review to ensure that resources are targeted and focused on keeping waiting times in the provision of services to a minimum.  I am informed that waiting times in the Circuit and District Courts vary from venue to venue based on the number and complexity of cases.</p><p>As previously mentioned in response to Question No. 136 of 5 February 2014, a significant number of extra sittings were scheduled during 2013. The additional weeks were provided across crime, family law and civil matters.  The Courts Service has indicated that the additional sittings have ensured that waiting times in the Circuit Court have been reduced. In addition, six specialist judges of the Circuit Court were appointed in July 2013 to deal with the new work arising as a result of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.  I am informed that High Court waiting times are being maintained and in some cases are being further reduced.  The President of the High Court keeps waiting times under continuous review and has introduced a number of initiatives including the reorganisation of sittings of the High Court outside Dublin and arranging for additional court sittings during court recesses.  The delegation to court officials of administrative functions previously dealt with by High Court judges has also yielded significant savings in judicial time resulting in increased judicial availability for trial work.  More than 10,000 matters were dealt with in this way in 2013.  These case management initiatives continue to be reviewed and expanded.</p><p>In respect of the Court of Criminal Appeal, the Chief Justice, in consultation with the President of the High Court, convened nine additional sittings during September and the first week of October 2013 to deal with sentence appeals/undue leniency applications.  Following the appointment of two additional Supreme Court Judges in October 2013, the Supreme Court has been enabled to sit in two panels on a continuing basis and I am informed that the rate of disposals of appeals has increased significantly, with one panel assigned to the disposal of backlog appeals.  The comparative figures for the first quarter of this year and 2013 show an increase in excess of 60% in the rate of disposals.<b></b>While some immediate improvement has been achieved<b>,</b>the backlog that has accumulated in the Supreme Court over the past number of years is such that it will take a longer period to reduce the waiting time for the hearing of appeals to a more appropriate level.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b>The issue of capacity in the Supreme Court can only be fully resolved through the introduction of the Court of Appeal, which is due to be established later this year.</p></reply>

On 23 June 2014 there were 3,958 prisoners in custody.  This represents under 95% occupancy.  I wish to inform the Deputy that on 1 April 2014 the cell accommodation census returned the following information. 2,044 prisoners were accommodated in single cells which accounted for 50% of all prisoners in custody on that date (4,103).  In addition, there were 764 cells which accommodated 2 prisoners, 138 cells which accommodated three prisoners and 30 cells which accommodated 4 or more prisoners.</p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate the Irish Prison Service must accept all prisoners committed by the Courts into its custody and does not have the option of refusing committals.  The Deputy will appreciate that my officials are concentrating on aligning our prisoner population numbers with the Inspector of Prisons' recommendations in those prisons with the highest levels of over-crowding, namely Cork Prison, Limerick Prison and the Dochas Centre.  In addition, a 40 month capital programme is being implemented to eliminate slopping out and to improve prison conditions in the older part of the prison estate.</p><p>  I am advised by my officials that work is continuing on the modernisation project at Mountjoy prison.  &quot;D&quot; Wing is the last wing requiring refurbishment and work commenced on this in May this year.  On the completion of this, all cells in Mountjoy prison will have in cell sanitation facilities and this will complete slopping out in Mountjoy Prison in 2015.  Refurbishment of the Mountjoy B and C wings was completed in 2012.  &quot;A&quot; wing commenced in early January 2013 and was occupied earlier this year.  In relation to Cork Prison, the contract was awarded late last year and construction began in January, 2014 with a completion date on the third quarter of 2015.</p><p>  A Business Case for the Modernisation of Prison Facilities in Limerick Prison is currently in draft form.  Part of the redevelopment includes the provision of high quality prison accommodation for female prisoners with capacity of approximately 50 individual cells and eight custodial apartments.  Finally, the Deputy will be aware that a working group was established by my predecessor to conduct an all encompassing strategic review of penal policy.  The Group was asked to examine the role of penal policy in crime prevention, sentencing policies, alternatives to custody, custodial accommodation and regimes, reintegration and rehabilitation as well as any special issues relating to female offenders.  The Group is expected to report shortly.</p></reply>

They aim to bring about the conditions whereby the behavioural patterns of young people towards law and order can develop and mature through positive interventions and interaction with the project.

The Garda National Policing Plan for 2014 sets out the policing priorities and objectives for the current year.

The Deputy will also be aware that tackling organised crime is a key ongoing priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which is clearly reflected in the Garda Policing Plan for 2014.

The effectiveness of Garda strategies is illustrated in the official CSO Recorded Crime figures for 2013 which show reductions in 11 out of the 14 categories for which figures are given, and an overall reduction in crime of 6.6% during the year. I am assured that local Garda management in all Garda Divisions, closely monitors the allocation of resources in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</p></reply>

Patients, in conjunction with their Irish based public referring hospital consultant, have the ability to apply to the HSE TAS seeking access to public healthcare outside the state through model form E112. The treatment must not be available within the State or not available within a time normally necessary for obtaining it.  Applications to TAS are processed and a determination given in accordance with the statutory framework prior to a patient travelling to avail of treatment. A decision is made on each application in accordance with this legislation and guidelines and on the basis of a review by clinical experts. Approved applicants/patients' hospital treatment costs are covered through the issue of form E112 (IE) for the specific identified episode  of care. Once a patient is discharged from a specific episode of care abroad, their care immediately reverts to their Irish based consultant.</p><p>The TAS allows for an Irish based medical consultant to refer a patient who is normally resident in Ireland, for treatment in a public hospital in another EU/EEA member state or Switzerland, where the treatment in question meets the following criteria:</p><p><i>(a)  The application to refer a patient abroad has been assessed and a determination given before that patient goes abroad.</i></p><p><i>(b)  Following clinical assessment, the referring Consultant certifies the following:</i></p><p><i>- They recommend the patient be treated in another EU/EEA country or Switzerland;</i></p><p><i>-  The treatment is medically necessary and will meet the patient&rsquo;s needs;</i></p><p><i>-  The treatment is a proven form of medical treatment and is not experimental or test treatment;</i></p><p><i>-  The treatment is in a recognised hospital or other institution and is under the control of a registered medical practitioner;</i></p><p><i>-  The hospital outside the state will accept EU/EEA form E112 (IE).</i></p><p>Each application to the HSE TAS is reviewed individually on its own merits and there are no restrictions, regarding age or otherwise, on a person making an application to the HSE TAS for review and decision. Previous approvals or declines are not used as an influencing factor on subsequent applications. Each application is for an individual episode of care unless otherwise specified by the consultant on the application form. Each application to TAS is processed and given a formal written decision. If that decision is one of decline, the reason for that decision is clearly outlined and the option of an appeal is afforded. </p><p>Full details of the Treatment Abroad Scheme and how to make an application may be found on the HSE website at .

Work is ongoing on the policy proposals to be brought to Government for the drafting of primary legislation for a new scheme. Proposals will be legally robust and must take account of the Ombudsman's findings that both the Mobility Allowance and the Motorised Transport Grant were illegal in the context of the Equal status Acts.  </p><p>  The Government made it clear in February 2013, that the decision to close the schemes was in no way intended to save costs and the funding involved in the two schemes remains committed to meeting the transport needs of relevant people.  In fact, the Health Service Executive has continued to make payment to the 4,700 people who were in receipt of the monthly Mobility Allowance payment.  The Motorised Transport Grant was a single grant payment payable once in any three year period and was made to approximately 300 people each year.

The Government remains committed to the provision and development of vision services and supports through health prevention, screening and intervention policies and programmes, all of which contribute to address the priority goal of Vision 2020, namely to eliminate avoidable blindness in Ireland.</p><p>  The issues involved in eye health span a number of areas in the health sector with regard to access to treatment, patient safety and quality of care.  There are a number of eye conditions which require specialist health services including cataract, refractive error, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and age related macular degeneration.  There are detection and treatment services available at present in community and acute hospital settings for these conditions.</p><p>  The Health Service Executive (HSE) provides a sight testing service as part of the school health screening programme for children of primary school age.  Children who are identified as requiring treatment or intervention are referred to the HSE ophthalmic service for follow up.  Urgent cases are given priority and less urgent cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.  Children between 12 and 16 years, whose parents are in receipt of a medical card, are eligible for HSE eye-care services when named on their parents' card.  Other children between 12 and 16 years are eligible to be seen by the HSE ophthalmic service when there is a medical reason for the eye condition, rather than a refractive error.  The HSE also provides vision tests and standard prescription spectacles to adult medical card and Health Amendment Act Card holders.  </p><p>  The HSE is establishing an Ophthalmology Review Group with key stakeholders to examine issues around primary care ophthalmology services including popuplation needs and adequacy of current services, with a view to making recommendations for a national plan for the service.  Screening by the National Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Programme is well underway.  In addition, there are a number of high level strategies which are relevant to the area of eye health, including Clinical Programmes; Public Health; Health Protection; Positive Ageing and Carers Strategies and Screening initiatives.  A number of these strategies link with the Health Service Executive's Clinical Ophthalmology Programme.</p></reply>

However, public hospital in-patient statistical data shows that there were 473 cases of patients admitted to public hospitals with a diagnosis of Lupus in 2012.</p><p>  The Long Term Illness (LTI) Scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act, 1970 (as amended). Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme. There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered under the LTI Scheme.  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p><p>  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations.  The Government has decided to develop a new policy framework of eligibility for health services to take account of medical conditions. The HSE has established an expert panel to examine the range of conditions that should be considered as part of this process and has been asked to make an early report to the Minister for Health.</p></reply>

Action Areas 12 and 13 in <i>Reach Out</i>which specifically relate to Deliberate Self Harm and Mental Health Services aim to:</p><p>-  Develop and resource an effective response in the health services for people who present to services having engaged in deliberate self-harm and design ways to reach out to those who self-harm, but are reluctant to access traditional services and supports.</p><p>-  Improve mental health service provision, especially in the areas of community mental health, pre-discharge assessment from in-patient services, and follow-up support. </p><p>Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) helps reduce self harm and self destructive behaviours, using a combination of group skills training, individual therapy and phone coaching.  DBT is delivered by a team of mental health professionals including psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, occupational therapists, and nurses.  It comprises individual therapy sessions for each participant, group skills training sessions delivered by two clinicians, crisis phone support and consultation meetings for clinicians each week.  </p><p>Foundation and Intensive DBT training has been made available to all Integrated Service Areas through HSE National Office for Suicide Prevention funding in 2013/2014.  Decisions on how, and if, DBT is provided are a matter for local HSE management.  DBT training is not mandatory, and is very resource-intensive both in terms of preparing for, and committing to, training and subsequent service delivery.  As such, it may not be suitable to all areas, and is only one of a broad range of service interventions.  </p><p>By the end of 2013, 19 Community Mental Health Teams were trained in DBT.  This includes 5 Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) teams based in Donegal, Sligo, Cork (North Cork and North Lee area), and Linn Dara in Dublin.  The HSE indicate that three more CAMHS teams will begin training in September 2014 - Cork South Lee, Galway and the Lucena clinic.  All area teams were offered the opportunity to apply for this initiative, and all CAMHS teams that applied were accepted.</p><p>In 2014, the Department of Health and the HSE have committed to developing a new strategic framework for suicide prevention, building on the comprehensive work delivered under <i>Reach Out.</i>One of the core areas of practice for review and development is DBT.  The framework, which is expected to be completed by the end of the year, will provide for improved coordination and integration of services to ensure that pathways of care for persons at risk of suicide or in suicidal crisis can be accessible, acceptable and available.</p></reply>

The aim of the Lyme Borreliosis Subcommittee will be to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise the harm caused by of Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland.  These strategies will be published in a Final Report.</p><p>The membership of the Lyme Borreliosis Subcommittee will comprise a range of experts who will be able to provide expertise and will be in a position to input into relevant policy areas relevant to Lyme borreliosis.  These will include Public Health Experts from HPSC and from the regional Department of Public Health, representation from the Department of the Environment, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, an Occupational Health Physician, an Entomological/Tick Expert, Surveillance Scientist (HSE-Area) with support from HPSC Secretariat.  In addition, the views of the Irish College of General Practitioners will be sought on the recommendations of the final documentation.  Once a series of recommendations has been produced by the Subcommittee, this will go for general consultation through the normal HPSC consultation channels.</p><p>The Terms of Reference of the Lyme Borreliosis Subcommittee are:</p><p>- To raise awareness in Ireland of Lyme Borreliosis amongst clinicians and the general public;</p><p>- To identify and highlight best international practice in awareness raising about Lyme Borreliosis for the General Public;</p><p>- To develop policies of primary prevention of Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland based on best international evidence;</p><p>- To explore ways in which to improve surveillance of neuroborreliosis in Ireland;</p><p>- To develop strategies to raise awareness among the general public particularly in relation areas with higher tick populations;</p><p>- To produce a Final Report covering all the above areas.</p><p>In establishing this subcommittee, the Scientific Advisory Committee advised that the Subcommittee should ensure that there would be a robust process for including Lyme patient representation groups in the consultation process for the Sub-Committee&rsquo;s output.</p><p>It is intended that this group will build upon the extensive work that has already been undertaken by HPSC in raising awareness of this condition.  Following representation to the Department of Health by HPSC, Lyme Borreliosis (as neuroborreliosis) was included in the schedule of notifiable diseases in 2012, making a more accurate assessment of the level of the more serious forms of this disease in Ireland possible for the first time.  </p><p>The Scientific Advisory Committee approved the establishment of the Lyme Borreliosis subcommittee in December 2013, with a decision that the group will be established in the second half of 2014 on completion of the work of the Scientific Advisory Committee&rsquo;s Cryptosporidiosis Subcommittee.  In order to ensure that momentum was not lost, work has been ongoing within HPSC to make sure that awareness-raising was maintained as a priority.

More than a dozen radio interviews and several print media articles resulted from this raised awareness.  This increased activity resulted in a 100% increase in the amount of web traffic to the various Lyme disease section of the HPSC website </p><p>Finally, to ensure that diagnosticians are increasingly aware of the issue of Lyme borreliosis, information is provided specifically for clinicians:</p><p>- Clinical Guidance: </p><p>- Guidelines for the clinical management of patients with Lyme disease:  </p><p>- Lyme Factsheet for health practitioners:  </p><p>- Prevention and control of tick-borne disease in Europe: Information to Healthcare Professionals (slides):  </p><p>HPSC continues to work with sister organisations and others to ensure that the issue of Lyme disease is brought to as wide an audience as possible.</p></reply>

The purpose of the agreed guidelines is to prioritise patients who present to their GP with suspected  cancer.  These guidelines are based on best international evidence. </p><p>  Patients presenting to GPs with symptoms and signs suggestive of breast cancer are normally seen by a Consultant within 2 weeks. One of the key determinants in assessing the degree of risk is the age of the patient, as a woman&rsquo;s risk of developing breast cancer increases with age.  Breast cancer is extremely rare in women under 25 years of age.  The Report of the National Cancer Registry of Ireland on Breast Cancer Incidence, Mortality, Treatment and Survival in Ireland 2005-2009 records that no woman in the 15-24 year age group was diagnosed with breast cancer during that period.  All young women presenting with a breast lump to their GP are referred for investigation to the Symptomatic Breast Service.  If a GP is particularly suspicious that a lump is in fact cancer it is open to her/him to liaise directly with the local cancer centre in regard to a more urgent appointment.</p></reply>

Primary legislation and resources will be required for the introduction of a statutory regulation system for home care services, and this will be progressed in the context of overall legislative and resource priorities.</p><p>I would like to emphasise, however, that statutory regulation or licensing is only one way of improving quality and safety. The HSE is already progressing a range of measures to improve Home Care provision overall, to standardise services nationally and to promote quality and safety. These include a <i>Procurement Framework for Home Care Services</i>with quality and screening requirements which came into effect in 2012 and applies to services procured by the HSE from external providers.  The HSE is currently undertaking a review of home care services with a view to improving services generally.  The aspects of the question relating to operational matters have been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) for the assessment of new medicines. In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. The report is available on the NCPE's website ().</p><p>The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable. Due to the very difficult and challenging economic environment in which the Government targeted additional savings in health expenditure of &euro;619 million in 2014, which must be achieved while protecting front line services to the most vulnerable to the greatest extent possible, the HSE decided it was not in a position to add the drug to the List of Reimbursable Items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes. </p><p>It is open to the supplier, at any time, to submit a new application to the HSE incorporating new evidence which demonstrates the cost effectiveness of Fampridine. The HSE will then re-consider the application to add this product to the List of Reimbursable Items, in line with the agreed procedures and timescales for the assessment of new medicines.  In this context, I understand the manufacturer has indicated to the HSE that it intends to submit a revised application for Fampridine. The HSE will then re-consider the application on receipt in line with the agreed procedures and timescales for the assessment of new medicines.</p></reply>

If the medical card or GP visit card to which the Deputy refers was awarded  by way of discretion and was refused renewal in the period from 1 July 2011 to 31 May 2014 following the completion of an eligibility review, a card will issue by the HSE.</p><p>  The HSE has commenced the process of identifying and contacting persons to advise them that their medical cards and GP visit cards will issue.  It is estimated that this process will take 3 weeks.  No action is required on the part of those affected as the HSE will be in contact.  If people do not hear from the HSE by mid July, they should contact the HSE on its Lo-Call contact number: 1890 25 29 19.  These individuals will be able to access medical card and GP visit card services in the normal manner when they have been advised by the HSE that their medical card or GP visit card is active.</p><p>  The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine the specific query raised and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.  It has established a dedicated contact service for members of the Oireachtas specifically for queries relating to medical cards and GP visit cards, which the Deputy may wish to use for an earlier response.

The Department is also collaborating in a University College Cork-led research project, "Fluoride and Caring for Children's Teeth" (FACCT). The study will consider the impact of changes on the oral health of children, following policy decisions relating to toothpaste use by infants and young children made in 2002 and the reduction in the level of fluoridation in drinking water introduced in 2007.

Therefore, the Government has decided to develop a policy framework for providing eligibility for health services on the basis of medical conditions, including new legislation as appropriate, and a HSE clinical expert group is to examine the range of conditions that should be considered as part of this process. The group has been asked to make an early report to the Minister for Health in the autumn.</p><p>  The Government was very concerned about the potential impacts on the health of persons with serious illnesses whose discretionary medical cards and GP visit cards were refused renewal since the centralisation of medical card assessment in 2011. Therefore, in the context of the above eligibility policy development, the Government decided that medical cards and GP visit cards are to be issued to persons with a serious medical condition (or disability) who had the renewal of their discretionary card refused by the HSE, having completed an eligibility review during the period from 1 July 2011 to 31 May 2014.</p><p>  The HSE is currently identifying these people to activate their eligibility status. The HSE intends to have contacted all of the relevant persons over the next few weeks.  If people do not hear from the HSE by mid July, they should contact the HSE on its LoCall contact number: 1890 25 29 19.</p></reply>

The service provides dedicated aeromedical support to the NAS in the west, specifically where land ambulance transit times would not be clinically appropriate.  The EAS  completed 652 missions up to the end of May 2014, about one third of which involved STEMI-type heart attack patients, who need time-critical transfers to primary percutaneous coronary intervention units for treatment.</p><p>  An evaluation of the pilot found a clinical need for the service and recommended that it should be established on a permanent basis.  I accepted the review&rsquo;s findings and an inter-service working group is currently examining how best to implement the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  With the agreement of the Minister for Defence, aeromedical support by the Air Corps to the EAS will continue until September 2014, pending finalisation of the deliberations of the working group.</p></reply>

The supplier can make an application to the HSE for their product to be included on the list of products covered under the GMS and other community drug schemes. The application is considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) for the assessment of new medicines. </p><p>  In accordance with these procedures, the HSE may ask the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) to conduct a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of the new product which provides detailed information on the potential budget impact of the medicine. It also assesses whether the product is cost effective at the price quoted by the company in question. The NCPE report is an important input to assist the HSE in its decision making process and informs further discussions between the HSE and the supplier.  The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable.</p><p>There are currently two levonorgestrel emergency hormonal contraception products licensed for sale on the Irish market &ndash; Levonelle&reg; and NorLevo&reg;.  Levonelle&reg; is a prescription only product which is currently included on the List of Reimbursable Items for the GMS and other community drug schemes. This product is therefore available to medical card holders under the GMS Scheme, subject to the prescription charge, once they have a prescription from their GP.  The other levonorgestrel emergency hormonal contraception product licensed for sale on the Irish market is NorLevo&reg;. In February, 2011 the Irish Medicines Board announced its decision to allow the sale of NorLevo&reg; without prescription. This product may, therefore, be supplied from pharmacies without a prescription by or under the personal supervision of the pharmacist.  <i></i></p><p>However, as NorLevo&reg; is an over-the-counter product it no longer complies with the applicable reimbursement criteria for the GMS Scheme and other community drug schemes, as a prescription is not normally required for its supply to a patient. Therefore, for all recipients of this product, the supply process is essentially a private transaction between the patient and the pharmacy.</p><p>In the case of  drugs and medicines which are paid for by the HSE, prices are set in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 or the terms of the framework agreements between the Department of Health and the HSE and the representative bodies for pharmaceutical manufacturers in Ireland. However, neither the Minister for Health nor the HSE has any power to set the prices of drugs and medicines purchased by private patients.  </p><p>The HSE advises the public that if they are being charged prices which exceed the reimbursement price listed on the HSE website (), plus a dispensing fee of between &euro;3.50 and &euro;5, then they should discuss the differential with their pharmacist to ensure they get the best possible price for the medicine concerned.  In addition, measures have been taken to increase price transparency among retail pharmacies. In March of this year the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland issued guidelines to pharmacists on procedures and minimum standards of information to be provided to customers, including a requirement to provide an itemised receipt of purchase of medicines. </p></reply>

These have resulted in reductions in the price of thousands of medicines. Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013; the average cost per item reimbursed is now running at 2001/2002 levels. </p><p>  A major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) in October 2012. The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nine EU member states. The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400 million over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will be available to fund new drugs.</p><p>  A new agreement was also reached in October 2012 with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic drugs industry. Under this Agreement, the maximum price the HSE paid for generic products was 50% of the initial price of an originator medicine. Recent negotiations with the APMI have resulted in additional price reductions being agreed. From 1 May 2014, the maximum price the HSE will pay for generic products will be 40% of the initial price of an originator medicine. This will result in the price differential between off-patent drugs and most generic equivalents increasing from 5% to approximately 20%.  It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;148 million in 2014.</p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 introduced a system of generic substitution and reference pricing.  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines. It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the maximum price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine&rsquo;s prices. It is expected that referencing pricing will save approximately &euro;50 million in 2014.</p><p>  The HSE is responsible for the administration of the primary care schemes, therefore, I have asked the HSE to examine the specific issues raised by the Deputy and to reply to her as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Data on those who died of a heart attack who did not have prior symptoms or treatment for heart disease are not available.

Data on persons who died of a heart attack here in each of the past ten years as a result of a second or subsequent heart attack are not routinely available.  However, the CSO have advised that between 1 and 5 people per year between 2007 and 2013 have died from an infarction of any myocardial site, occurring within 4 weeks (28 days) from onset of a previous infarction (ICD 10 Code I22).

The Department of Health&rsquo;s &ldquo;Changing Cardiovascular Health: Cardiovascular Health Policy 2010 -2019&rdquo; was launched in 2010. The policy establishes a framework for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, including stroke, which seeks to ensure an integrated and quality assured approach in their management, so as to reduce the burden of these conditions.</p></speech>

The cost to haulage operators carrying loads outside of Ireland has been considered and a full review carried out of the road charging regimes in other European states, including the system introduced in the UK this year. The relevant European Union legislation in this area has also been examined. I understand that the Group has identified various options for changes to the motor tax regime in Ireland, to support the haulage industry and to ensure that transport costs do not negatively impact on Irish businesses, particularly Irish exporters who are driving our economic recovery.  I look forward to receiving this report later in the summer.</p></reply>

I understand that many local authorities are already positioning themselves to avail of such opportunities.</p></reply>

The Coast Guard carries out this function utilising its own assets and declared resources.  Currently, mountain rescue teams (MRT) fall under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality and are co-ordinated and tasked by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS) in accordance Ireland's Framework for Major Emergency Management. While it is clear that MRTs are considered a resource of AGS, my Department administers a grant scheme to the mountain rescue teams and the Coast Guard also chair the National Co-ordinating Committee for Mountain and Cave Rescue (NCCMCR).   </p><p>  It is my view that a single lead Department could more effectively coordinate and manage the mountain rescue service and provide oversight of the service providers, i.e. volunteer mountain and cave rescue teams.  I discussed this recently with the Minister for Justice and Equality with a view to exploring the options available.  At the Mountain Rescue Ireland (MRI) AGM earlier this year I undertook to consider the possibility of providing a capital grant to assist mountain rescue services for the purchase of equipment.  This matter is still under consideration but I hope to make a decision on this shortly.</p></reply>

The Expert Panel established to find a solution to the industrial relations issues relating to the IASS presented its final report on 16 June last. </p><p>  Now that the Panel's work is complete, I have urged all the parties to give the report very careful consideration, use its recommendations as the basis for timely constructive engagement, and achieve a resolution in the best interests of all.  In this regard, the Panel has recommended that the IASS trustee should meet with the employers to discuss and agree how funding for deferred members of the scheme is to be made available to alleviate, as much as possible, the impact of the trustee's proposals, while recognising the overall affordability to the employers of the proposals.  This represents the best chance to resolve this long-standing problem, and give the members of the scheme some certainty about their future pension entitlements.</p><p>  I have no concerns about the constitutionality of the legislation mentioned and powers of the Pensions Authority to wind-up pension schemes where deficits cannot be resolves is well known.  The Deputy's constituent seems to suggest that Aer Lingus is solely responsible for resolving the deficit in the scheme.  This is very much a minority view and is not supported by legal advice.</p></reply>

It is a whole-of-Government approach to policies for children and young people.  The development of a new policy framework meets one of the key recommendations of the implementation plan for the Ryan Report.  </p><p>This Framework is based on a clear vision of what we want for children and young people in Ireland. This vision is for: </p><p><i>Ireland to be one of the best small countries in which to grow up.  Where the rights of all children and young people are respected, protected and fulfilled; where their voices are heard and where they are supported to realise their maximum potential now and in the future.  </i></p><p>The Policy Framework comprehends the continuum from infancy through early and middle childhood to adolescence and early adulthood.  It provides the overarching framework for the development and implementation of policy and services for children and young people.  The Framework brings together key policies instanced in the Programme for Government including those relating to prevention and early intervention initiatives, early childhood education, breaking the cycle of disadvantage, through area based approaches to address child poverty, aftercare provision and addressing issues around anti-social behaviour.  </p><p>The Policy Framework provides a means for cross departmental collaboration to promote the well-being of children and young people and a fresh impetus to a whole-of-government approach to current and emerging issues, including childhood obesity, healthy lifestyles, the impact of media and new technologies, the sexualisation of children and promoting pro-social behaviour.  It accommodates a number of constituent strategies which focus in greater detail on the areas of Participation, Early Years, and Youth, which be developed in 2014.</p><p>The views of a wide range of interests including children themselves have shaped the development of the Policy Framework and it was informed by the following inputs: </p><p>- the results of a consultation in 2011, which focussed on children and young people, in which almost 67,000 people throughout the country participated and the results of the analysis of the consultation were published last November;</p><p>- a public consultation of the general public conducted during in 2012. Over 1,000 submissions were received as part of that consultation.  An analysis of the submissions was completed in April 2013 and </p><p>- the advice of the National Children&rsquo;s Advisory Council which represented a range of statutory and non-statutory organisations working with children and young people. </p><p>Since 2011 &euro;431,246.70 has been spent on the development and publication of Better Outcomes: Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014 -2020.  This expenditure includes the cost of the public consultation, the children and young people consultation and the publication of the Policy Framework.</p></reply>

The ECCE programme is a free and universal programme to which all children have access. </p><p>  To make the ECCE programme more accessible to children with special needs a number of additional provisions are in place.  These include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification under the programme where a child is developmentally delayed and would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.  </p><p>  My Department has been actively working with the Department of Health, specifically the Office of Disability and Mental Health, in the context of building better supports to facilitate the inclusion of special needs children in mainstream pre-school settings.  However the issue of supports for children with special needs availing of services in mainstream childcare settings remains a matter for the Department of Health and the HSE and the specific issue outlined by the Deputy should be raised with the Minister for Health. </p></reply>

This is delivered in partnership with the young person, his or her family, foster carers, social workers, key residential social care workers and other statutory, community and voluntary agencies.  Approximately 450 children leave care annually.</p><p>  Aftercare is the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of a young person who is leaving statutory care at 18 years of age, to assist him/her in making the transition to independent living.  The most important requirements for young people leaving care are for continuity of relationships; secure, suitable accommodation as well as further education, employment or training.  The core eligible age range for aftercare is from 18 years up to 21 years. This can be extended until the completion of a course of education and training in which a young person who has left care, or is leaving care, is engaged in.  The Child and Family Agency has advised that as at the end of March 2014, 1,539 young people are in receipt of an aftercare service.</p><p>  Many young people remain in their foster care placement after 18 &ndash; in the region of 45%.  The assistance they need may be a continuation of the fostering arrangements and support in accessing educational opportunities.  The Agency has advised that as at the end of March 2014, some 60% of care leavers are engaged in some form of education or training.  Young people who do not have family support from a foster carer or family base are assisted in finding accommodation in either supported lodgings, sheltered housing or independent accommodation and encouraged and supported financially in furthering their training and education.</p><p>  The most vulnerable group of young people are those leaving residential care or short term foster care placements.  Children, who come into care late, in their mid to late teens, may not have developed the relationships with staff or aftercare workers that helps them achieve positive outcomes.  It is essential that these young people have an opportunity to develop a relationship with a dedicated aftercare worker who will work with them to identify their needs and ensure that services are in place to help provide them with the stability and support they need. </p><p>  The Agency has advised that they are in the process of establishing interagency aftercare committees at local level bringing together Local Authorities, HSE and other statutory and voluntary agencies.  These committees will develop interagency wrap around aftercare plans for young people, particularly for those with complex needs, including housing requirements.</p><p>  A protocol, developed by the Child and Family Agency and the County and City Managers' Association, in relation to dealing with accommodation issues of young people leaving care, is nearing completion.  The protocol has been developed in response to the Ryan Report recommendation that the &quot;HSE and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will review the approach to prioritising identified &quot;at risk&quot; young people leaving care and requiring local authority housing&quot;. When agreed and implemented, the protocol will see the relevant local authority housing representative attend aftercare planning meetings with social workers of the Agency in relation to those young people for whom social housing has been identified as the most appropriate form of accommodation support.  This, it is hoped, will facilitate a more efficient service for those leaving care in obtaining social housing suitable to their needs.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, it has been decided to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare.  This is in response to concerns, including those raised in the Ryan Report, that there was insufficient focus in this area and that such planning was not taking place on a properly structured and consistent basis.</p><p>  The approach adopted is to impose a statutory duty on the Agency to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person.  The aim is to create an explicit, as opposed to implicit, statement of the Agency's duty to satisfy itself as to the child's or young person's need for assistance by preparing a plan that identifies those needs for aftercare supports.  The draft provisions also clarify the range of agencies providing relevant services with which the Agency will cooperate in the development of the plan.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, at its sitting on 1 April, considered the draft aftercare provisions.  I understand that following this meeting a report is being prepared, which will be forwarded to me in due course.  I will consider its content prior to refining the text of the provisions in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.</p></reply>
