    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-01-29a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015012900044#WRA00600"><p>While I agree with the Deputy that insulation and retrofitting are vital to conserving energy and boosting domestic employment, I do not accept that Ireland is underperforming in this area.</p>  <p>  Under the range of Better Energy Schemes administered on behalf of my Department by SEAI, energy efficiency retrofitting has been supported in over 163,000 homes, while almost 112,000 homes in energy poverty have received free energy efficiency improvements.  A further 9,600 homes have received funding as part of community energy efficiency iniatives.  In total, nearly one sixth of all homes in the country have received a Government supported energy efficiency upgrade.  The Better Energy Programme will be continued in 2015 with expenditure of &euro;40m planned.</p>  <p>  To build on this progress, and to embed energy efficiency in the supply chain, last year I introduced an energy efficiency obligation on energy suppliers.  This places a mandatory requirement on energy suppliers to work with all categories of customer, including those in energy poverty, to deliver energy efficiency improvements. The aim of this scheme is to increase the scale, and reach, of energy efficiency projects.  Similar projects are already in operation in other EU states and internationally. </p>  <p>  It is clear that increasing the scale of energy efficiency action in both the private, and public, sectors requires commercial funding.  This is why the National Energy Efficiency Fund was launched in 2014.  This type of initiative is critical to supporting the scale of energy efficiency deployment necessary to maintain our progress to 2020 and to lay the foundations for continued action to 2030. Energy efficiency will be key to a cost effective and technically feasible contribution by Ireland to the objectives of the EU 2030 Climate and Energy Framework.</p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.<br/><br/>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades.  Approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland are expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next two years. These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.<br/><br/>On 24 November last, a public consultation on a national high speed coverage map 2016 was launched.  This consultation will close on the 12th February next.  The map can be accessed at .  The areas on the map marked Blue will all have access to high speed broadband services of at least 30Mbps from the commercial sector by end of 2016. The areas marked Amber will require the intervention of the State. <br/><br/>The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises or home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention.  It also provides detailed information on over 50,000 townlands throughout the entire country.<br/><br/>It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30Mbps will be also delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.<br/><br/>In tandem with the mapping consultation, intensive design and planning work is underway in my Department to produce a detailed intervention strategy.  The strategy will address a range of issues in relation to the intervention including the optimum procurement model, ownership model for the infrastucture, intervention cost and likely market impact. <br/><br/>My Department has engaged external advisors to provide legal, economic, technical and financial advice on the various aspects of the Plan over the next two years.  The next steps in this process will see a further public consultation on a detailed intervention strategy in mid-2015. The Intervention Strategy will be notified to the European Commission for State Aid clearance. <br/><br/>Following the public consultation, towards the end of this year a detailed procurement process will be undertaken in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders.  The Department will design a tender in a way that maximises efficiencies and keeps the cost of the network build as low as possible.  I am keen to see the implementation begin as quickly as possible and completed at the earliest opportunity.  I anticipate that the first homes and businesses will be connected in 2016 and connections will continue thereafter, with the intention of having the final homes and businesses connected within a 5 year period. <br/><br/>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government. It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in Ireland.</p></reply>

Ireland aims to meet this target mainly through the use of sustainable biofuels with electric vehicles also making a contribution. </p>  <p>  The Electric Vehicle Grant Scheme supports and incentivises, through grants of up to &euro;5,000, the early deployment of electric vehicles in Ireland.  These grants are in addition to the VRT reliefs of up to &euro;5,000 which apply to electric vehicles.  The grant scheme will remain open for this year and I have no plans, at this stage, to introduce any new financial incentives for the purchase of electric vehicles.  Additionally, the ESB is continuing to roll out both publicly accessible charging infrastructure and domestic charge points. </p>  <p>  Ireland's third National Energy Efficiency Action Plan, which is available my Department&rsquo;s website, estimates that approximately 50,000 electric vehicles could form part of the transport fleet in 2020.  However, the extent to which electric vehicles are adopted in the short-to-medium term will depend on a range of factors including, inter alia, the strength of the economy, the overall numbers of new cars being purchased, the cost of purchasing and running electric vehicles compared to fossil fuel comparators, and the number of different electric vehicle models available to purchase.  There are signs that these factors are improving, and 2014 saw an increase in electric vehicle purchases through the EV Grant Scheme compared to previous years.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, who administer the scheme, has advised of increasing interest in EVs continuing into 2015. </p>  <p>  My Department has not had any discussions with the company mentioned regarding the deployment of its vehicles in Ireland. The company has not registered with the SEAI for participation in the EV grant scheme.  However, I understand that its vehicles are available for Irish consumers to purchase from the company's website and that there are a small number of the cars registered here.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's question regarding charge points, I propose to circulate with the Official Report a tabular statement setting out the information requested.</p></reply>

The scheme is a key initiative under the Government&rsquo;s National Digital Strategy and the Action Plan for Jobs.</p>  <p>  The changes in consumption patterns and citizen behaviour that come with the online revolution are affecting all Irish businesses.  Irish consumers are now spending more than &euro;6 billion online every year.  Yet, less than a third of this spend goes to Irish retailers, and only 23% of small Irish companies have engaged in online sales. </p>  <p>  To address this challenge and working in partnership with Enterprise Ireland and the Local Enterprise Office network, the Trading Online Voucher Scheme aims to get 2,000 small and micro businesses trading online by the end of this year.  This targeted initiative has the capacity to bring new sustainable jobs to all parts of Ireland: directly for the businesses that participate, and indirectly for those who supply them with expertise, training, hosting and logistics services. </p>  <p>  The scheme offers financial assistance of up to &euro;2,500, matched by the qualifying business, for investments in a digital component of their business. Initial allocations of Trading Online Vouchers were made in 2014 to the 31 Local Enterprise Offices.  By end 2014, some 550 businesses were awarded a voucher under the scheme.  Rollout of the vouchers will continue in 2015 and a number of awareness raising initiatives, including the development of online resources, are planned to drive its momentum. </p>  <p>  The Trading Online Voucher Scheme was informed by learnings from other schemes in the marketplace which have sought to incentivise small businesses to get online, including Google&rsquo;s Getting Irish Business Online and Dublin Chamber of Commerce Activating Dublin as well as the pilot phase of the scheme.  Such initiatives pointed to the value of including a training element in the scheme to help businesses to understand the opportunities of digital and how best to adapt it for their business. </p>  <p>  An information session forms an important part of the application process for a trading online voucher. It provides support to prospective applicants who have little knowledge of the internet or its potential to help them access new markets and create jobs.  It assists business owners and managers in their application by encouraging them to think strategically about enhancing the digital capability of their business. </p>  <p>  Under the scheme, 53 information sessions were held nationwide in 2014.  This intervention in advance of an application to the scheme has resulted in an increase in the quality of the applications received by the Local Enterprise Offices which in turn is expected to enhance the impact of the vouchers on the businesses who receive them. </p>  <p>  The scheme is on target to reach 2,000 businesses by the end of the year in line with the commitments in the National Digital Strategy and the Action Plan for Jobs.</p></reply>

The network we wish to see built will, therefore, have to be scalable and capable of meeting future anticipated traffic growth.</p>  <p>  Whatever the technology used, the proposed intervention must ensure users have a minimum service of 30Mbps and that this can also meet future anticipated growth in traffic and consumer demand for more bandwidth.</p>  <p>  In line with the EU competition rules, we must observe a policy of technology neutrality in any State intervention into a competitive market. </p>  <p>  However, the scale of the Government&rsquo;s ambition in regard to the level of service we wish to see available in rural areas, the step change in broadband quality demanded by the EU Commission&rsquo;s State Aid guidelines, the exponential growth in demand from consumers, the on-going significant improvement in services that is now available to many urban dwellers and businesses through commercial investment as well as the current fibre deficit in much of rural Ireland all point to a major role for fibre in resolving this issue. </p>  <p>  In line with the provisions of the State Aid Guidelines, we are likely to adopt an approach that will see the deployment of fibre networks as close as possible to end-users.  Through a variety of technology platforms, retail telecommunications providers would then able to use this wholesale network to offer services to the final customer.</p></reply>

I have no statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas network. </p>  <p>  In 2006, the CER approved a Gas Connections Policy which enabled assessment of the feasibility of connecting new towns to the gas network.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied.  The policy provides that the construction and operating costs of connecting a town, or group of towns, to the network are recovered through the consumption of gas and the associated network charges.  The distance of a town from the gas network is the major factor determining the costs of building a gas pipeline.  The anticipated industrial or commercial gas usage in the town largely determines the revenue from gas network charges which must balance the connection costs. Uneconomic gas pipeline projects would unfairly increase energy costs for all gas consumers. </p>  <p>  Gaslink has completed three comprehensive studies to assess nearly 80 towns for connections to the gas network with the result that more than twenty new towns have been connected in recent years.  Gaslink constantly reviews unconnected towns for increases in forecasted industrial energy use or where new pipelines or developments may make a town economic for a gas connection.

The post office network faces significant challenges given the impact of the economic downturn over the last few years, changes in technology and customer retail preferences.  The network stands well positioned, however, to become the front-office provider of choice for Government and the financial services sector for both electronic transactions as well as the more traditional over-the-counter transactions.</p>  <p>  On 21 December 2014, I announced the appointment of Mr. Bobby Kerr as the independent Chair of a Post Office Network Business Development Group.  Mr. Kerr will bring a depth of knowledge and experience in identifying and developing business opportunities for the post office network.

It is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by these producers.  The PSO levy is vital to enable Ireland to meet its 40% target for electricity generated from renewable sources by 2020, which in turn is important for the achievement of Ireland's 16% EU 2020 target for renewable energy.</p>  <p>  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) determines the PSO levy which is a charge on all electricity customers without exception.  The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation are set out in Regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (S.I. 217 of 2002). </p>  <p>  In accordance with legislation the CER also administers payment of the PSO Levy in accordance with the provisions of SI 217 of 2002.  My Department does not keep the records sought by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  The annual PSO levy amount for 2014/2015 is &euro;335.4 million.

In 2013, 20.9% of electricity, 5.7% of heat and 4.9% of transport, were met from renewable sources. In terms of achieving our 2020 targets, to date wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity in Ireland. In 2013, 16.5% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity demand was met by wind generation.<br/><br/>The economic benefits of the transition to renewable energy include employment from the construction and maintenance of generation infrastructure as well as from component manufacturing.  Employment creation is strongly linked to the level of deployment and hence will be further strengthened as we continue this transition.<br/><br/>An Irish Wind Energy Association member survey in 2014 indicated that 3,400 people are employed in the sector in Ireland.  A report published in 2014 by the ESRI and Trinity College Dublin, estimated direct and indirect employment under various realistic scenarios.  The report, which estimates multiple thousands of jobs depending on the scenario, is available on the ESRI's website at .<br/><br/>Additionally, biomass can replace imports of fossil fuels and contribute to job creation in Ireland. The availability of competitively priced locally-sourced biomass has the potential to enhance the opportunities for local employment in the sector.  A report commissioned by the Irish Bioenergy Association in 2012 indicated that, in the context of 2020 targets, 3,600 permanent jobs could be created in the bioenergy sector with 8,300 work years available during construction and installation of biomass facilities.  The Government recognises the enterprise potential of the sector and additional policies brought forward in the context of the draft bioenergy plan, published in October 2014, will facilitate further employment in the sector.<br/><br/>The Economic Study for Ocean Energy Development in Ireland published by SEAI and Invest Northern Ireland in 2010 identifies the potential of the ocean sector for job and wealth creation.  It found that an island of Ireland wave industry could produce 17,000 to 52,000 jobs and an NPV (net present value) of between &euro;4 billion to &euro;10 billion by 2030.  Given the current state of readiness of the technology, these projections are unlikely to be achieved in the time-scale envisaged in the report, but they remain valid over a longer time frame.</p></reply>

An open and competitive procurement process was conducted in accordance with Department of Finance and EU procurement frameworks.<br/><br/>A pre-qualification questionnaire was issued on on 17 January 2011.  This invited interested parties to tender for the contract as a postcode management licence holder for a period of 10 years to design, provide, disseminate and maintain a National Postcode System. A number of companies entered and participated in the procurement process.  Three parties qualified following Stage 1 of the procurement process.  The choice of postcode operator was restricted to those companies who participated in the procurement process. My Department subsequently received two final bids from consortia led by Capita and An Post. <br/><br/>My Department evaluated the final bids and Capita&rsquo;s bid was found to be the most economically advantageous of the two bids.<br/><br/>On 8 October 2013, the Government approved the appointment of Capita Business Support Services Ireland Limited as the company which will develop, roll-out and operate the National Postcode System.<br/><br/>The overall projected cost of implementing the National Postcode System over the 10 year cycle of the contract is expected to be &euro;27m (ex VAT) with costs covering design, database upgrades, communications and postcode distribution.  The cost of the contract will be approximately &euro;16m over the first two years and a further &euro;1.2m per annum for the remaining 8 years of the contract.  There has been approximately &euro;1.2m spent on specialist costs arising from the project in the period 2010 to date. <br/><br/>The costs of designing the eircodes and setting up the Eircode Address Database are approximately 9% of total cost.  It is expected that 43% of the overall cost over 10 years will be attributed to dissemination, communications and upgrade of public sector databases.  The remaining estimated costs, approximately 48% of the total cost, will be accounted for by the acquisition of data from GeoDirectory and costs of maintaining the postcodes.</p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.<br/><br/>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades.  Approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland are expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next two years.  These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.<br/><br/>On 24 November last, a public consultation on a national high speed coverage map 2016 was launched.  This consultation will close on the 12th February next.  The map can be accessed at .  The areas on the map marked Blue will all have access to high speed broadband services of at least 30Mbps from the commercial sector by end of 2016.  The areas marked Amber will require the intervention of the State. <br/><br/>The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises or home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention. It also provides detailed information on over 50,000 townlands throughout the entire country.<br/><br/>It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30Mbps will be also delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.<br/><br/>In tandem with the mapping consultation, intensive design and planning work is underway in my Department to produce a detailed intervention strategy.  The strategy will address a range of issues in relation to the intervention including the optimum procurement model, ownership model for the infrastucture, intervention cost and likely market impact. <br/><br/>My Department has engaged external advisors to provide legal, economic, technical and financial advice on the various aspects of the Plan over the next two years.  The next steps in this process will see a further public consultation on a detailed intervention strategy in mid-2015.  The Intervention Strategy will be notified to the European Commission for State Aid clearance. <br/><br/>Following the public consultation, towards the end of this year a detailed procurement process will be undertaken in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders.  The Department will design a tender in a way that maximises efficiencies and keeps the cost of the network build as low as possible.  I am keen to see the implementation begin as quickly as possible and completed at the earliest opportunity.  I anticipate that the first homes and businesses will be connected in 2016 and connections will continue thereafter, with the intention of having the final homes and businesses connected within a 5 year period. <br/><br/>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government.  It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in Ireland.</p></reply>

The European Communities (Machinery) Regulations, 2008 transposed the EU Machinery Directive which is a &quot;New Approach&quot; Directive into Irish law.  The New Approach legislative technique was approved by the Council of Ministers on 7 May 1985 in its Resolution on a new approach to technical harmonisation and standards.  The overall objective of the EU Machinery Directive is the harmonisation of the essential health and safety requirements across the European Union. The aim is to promote the free movement of machinery across the single market while guaranteeing a high level of health and safety protection to workers and citizens. <br/><br/>Under the New Approach, each EU Member State must appoint one or more Notified Bodies to supervise the inspection, testing and certification of products that require CE Marking (Conformit&eacute; Europ&eacute;ene, i.e. European Conformity).  The National Standards Authority of Ireland is the notified body in Ireland. <br/><br/>CE marking is mandatory for products covered by the scope of the New Approach Directives.  The Directives establish whether the conformity assessment may be performed by the manufacturer itself or if assessment by a notified body is required. CE marking requires that the product is assessed before being placed on the market<b></b>and thus satisfies the legislative requirements (e.g. a harmonised level of safety).  It means that the manufacturer or a notified conformity assessment body has verified that the product, in this case a wind turbine, complies with all relevant essential requirements including health and safety requirements of the applicable directives. <br/><br/>In addition, the Health and Safety Authority is the agency with responsibility for workplace safety under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005.  It should be noted, however, that a &lsquo;place of work&rsquo; as described in that Act would only cover wind turbines during their construction or during any maintenance that might need to be undertaken thereafter.  Specific concerns regarding non-compliant wind turbines, placed on the Irish market, can be directed to the Health and Safety Authority, which is the competent authority for the regulations.</p></reply>

The benefits of electricity and gas interconnection with other countries are numerous.  Interconnectors enhance security of supply, increase competitiveness, and improve integration of renewable electricity generation resources.</p>  <p>  In the context of achieving a fully functioning and connected internal energy market, measures are expected to be taken at EU and member state levels to increase electricity interconnections between EU member states by 2020.  These measures will be pursued through the implementation of EU "Projects of Common Interest" (PCIs).</p>  <p>  In June 2013, EirGrid and its French counterpart, RTE (R&eacute;seau de Transport d&rsquo;&Eacute;lectricit&eacute;) signed a Memorandum of Understanding to commission studies on the feasibility of building a submarine electricity interconnector between Ireland and France. Pre-feasibility studies to investigate a possible interconnector took place between 2011 and 2013.  The forthcoming studies will involve desktop exercises and marine surveys to collect data to inform a decision on the feasibility and possible benefits of such an interconnector.  If, on completion of the studies, the project is deemed viable, both partners would then decide on progression to the planning and development stages.  No decision has yet been made on whether or not to proceed with this proposal and one is not expected until 2016 at the earliest.  The project is on the current list of PCIs adopted by the European Commission.</p></reply>

Monaghan were redeployed from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to the Department of Social Protection in July 2012.  The staff are engaged in the processing of the Public Services Card.  The operations have recently been expanded to include eight additional temporary staff and unfortunately the current facilities are not considered appropriate for the existing business processes or to accommodate the recently expanded operation.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the Office of Public Works have investigated all of the options in Ballybay and have inspected a number of properties, with a view to adapting a number of buildings to meet the Department of Social Protection's requirements. The position is that a significant investment would be required to bring the proposed properties up to modern standards. In addition, other technical surveys and reports, planning permission, fire certification and physical works would take approximately one year to complete. Unfortunately, this timeframe is not commensurate with the Department's business requirements and the need to establish a Public Service Card Centre in the County, which is badly needed and is now an urgent requirement.  Consequently, neither my officials, nor the OPW, consider that the properties on offer in Ballybay could meet the requirements in terms of both cost and time and a decision has been made to move the current facilities to Monaghan Town and combine it with a public, customer facing facility to serve the people of Monaghan.</p></reply>

As a first step in that process, the NTMA, on 7 January 2015, raised &euro;4 billion through the syndicated sale of a new seven-year benchmark bond. The funds were raised at a yield of 0.867%, a historic low.</p>  <p>  On 12 January 2015, the NTMA announced its Q1 2015 auction schedule. Bond auctions are scheduled for Thursday 12 February and Thursday 12 March, subject to market conditions. The details are to be announced on the Monday prior to each auction.</p>  <p>  The NTMA today   29 January 2015   completed an auction of Irish Treasury Bills, selling the target amount of &euro;500 million. The Treasury Bills, which have a maturity of six months, were sold at an annualised yield of 0.00%. Total bids received amounted to &euro;1.745 billion which was 3.49 times the amount on offer.</p>  <p>  Ireland currently has thirteen benchmark bonds with maturities across the yield curve out to 2030, which incorporates the new 15-year benchmark bond issued in November 2014.  As part of its regular ongoing funding strategy, the NTMA considers issuance of various maturities subject to market developments and investor appetite.  </p>  <p>  The NTMA will closely monitor the market following the announcement of the expanded asset purchase programme by the European Central Bank (ECB) on 22 January. In recent months, prior to the ECB announcement, Irish Government bond yields declined steadily. It is reasonable to suggest that the expectation, on the part of financial market participants, of an announcement by the ECB that it would purchase sovereign bonds was a contributory factor in the decline. The initial reaction from the market since the ECB announcement has seen a further drop in yields. The ten-year benchmark bond, maturing in March 2025, traded at 1.07% on 26 January compared to 1.24% at close of business on 21 January, the day before the announcement. </p>  <p>  The NTMA advise that they cannot be definitive about the impact of the ECB's expanded asset purchase programme on Ireland's future debt servicing costs, as a range of other factors also matter. However if one of the implications of the programme is that bond yields remain low, this would be positive for debt servicing. The NTMA's funding strategy will continue to take account of the quantum of the funding requirement, market conditions, debt servicing implications, and feedback from Ireland's Primary Dealers in government bonds.</p></reply>

The purpose of the negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) is to reduce barriers to trade and investment in order to generate jobs and growth in the EU and the US.  The government fully supports this objective.<br/><br/>According to assessments made by the European Commission and other European bodies, a comprehensive TTIP could over time boost the EU's GDP by 0.5% per annum, resulting in 400,000 additional jobs across the EU. <br/><br/>Ireland has particularly strong economic links with the US, with over 118,000 people employed in 585 US companies here.  The total level of trade (imports and exports) between Ireland and the US in 2012 was &euro;55 billion.  The US is Ireland biggest merchandise export market.  The most recent data from the CSO shows that Ireland&rsquo;s services exports to the US increased by 40% in 2012.  Notwithstanding the present high level of trade, significant benefits could be derived from a comprehensive and ambitious TTIP.  <br/><br/>My Department commissioned a study on the potential impact of the TTIP for Ireland. This study is intended to assist in guiding the Irish position in the negotiations.  The study is expected to be finalised shortly and published in early 2015.<br/><br/>The initial findings of the study show that the benefit to Ireland would be more than double the EU average, with 1.1% added to GDP.  Other preliminary findings include increased exports (2.7%), increases in real wages (1.4%) and investment (1.6%).  Opportunities are expected mainly in manufacturing &ndash; pharmaceutical and chemical industry, electrical machinery and other advanced machinery; in certain services and in processed foods.  <br/><br/>The European Commission has been taking a much more open and transparent approach to these negotiations, which I believe is important and which I welcome.  <br/><br/>The important question of investment protection in the TTIP was the subject of a public consultation by the EU Commission, the results of which were published on 13 January, 2015.  [.]The EU Commission has stated that it will be discussing the report with Member States and the European Parliament, and with different stakeholders, and that following these consultations, it will develop specific proposals for the TTIP negotiations.  I very much welcome this approach, and I believe that it is important to take time to have open and constructive discussion following the Commission&rsquo;s report that will inform the next steps.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, both options look unlikely. </p>  <p>  For my part as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I will do everything possible, together with Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, to market the facility abroad through IDA&rsquo;s global network of overseas offices. Our aim will be to secure alternative investment. The building itself and the skilled workforce there are both strong selling points and will help IDA when talking to overseas investors. </p>  <p>  More generally, IDA will continue to highlight the strengths of the Border and North East regions to potential investors, and Enterprise Ireland will continue to develop expansion projects by Irish companies in the area. I have asked the Enterprise Agencies under my remit to redouble their efforts to drive job creation and utilise the skill-set of the employees affected by this announcement to find alternative employment.</p>  <p>  I am working directly with IDA and Enterprise Ireland to secure projects for the Cavan &ndash; Monaghan area which will deliver investment and jobs. </p>  <p>  While we have seen much positive news on the jobs front in recent days, weeks and months, affecting every area of the country, this setback is a reminder that we must fight continually to ensure that Ireland is a location of choice for companies, to win new investments and jobs but just as importantly to maintain the ones we have. Monaghan, like many other regions, has seen positive trends in recent years, with employment in agency-supported companies expanding by 11% (or 450 jobs), and substantial improvement in the live register. However we must do more. Through the Action Plan for Jobs 2015 and the development of new Regional Strategies over the coming months, we will intensify our efforts to sustain and ensure continued job growth in the regions and throughout the country. </p></reply>

This figure continues the downward trend in the over-quota figure which was 7.15% and 6.51% in October and November respectively.  However, it is still significantly above the 1.63% over-quota position of this time last year.</p>  <p>  This downward trend in the over-quota figure is welcome as it reduces the exposure of farmers to super levy payments.  I note that the monthly intake of milk in December was 18% down on the same month last year and this suggests that farmers are continuing to take the necessary on-farm measures to stay close to quota limits.</p>  <p>  I would encourage prudent management by farmers of their output in these final three months of the quota regime to help ensure that they enter the quota-free world with as little debt as possible.</p>  <p>  I have, on numerous occasions, called on the Commission to take action to mitigate the impact of superlevy fines, primarily via utilisation of an adjustment to the butterfat coefficient, as this would not have required an amendment to existing regulations.  However, this proposal has not enjoyed the support of a majority of MS, some of which have gone so far as to seek to link the issue to possible measures to regulate supply after quotas are gone.  Due to this opposition there is no realistic prospect of any movement on the amount of super-levy to be paid.  This is also true of a butterfat adjustment, and coming into the final months of milk quotas, farmers should manage their milk supply with this in mind.</p>  <p>  I am continuing to work closely with other EU Ministers and with Commissioner Hogan to examine if measures can be taken at EU level to minimise the impact of the superlevy bill.  I have already secured the Commission&rsquo;s agreement to allow for phased payments by farmers over a number of years if their co-op is willing to facilitate this.  At the Council of Agriculture Ministers&rsquo; meeting this week, the Commissioner committed to a further discussion in March when a clearer picture emerges of the extent of the superlevy bill.</p>  <p>  At national level I have impressed on the major banks the need to show flexibility in their dealings with farmers experiencing temporary cash flow difficulties in 2015.  Following on from an agreement secured with the EU Commission, Co-ops may have a role in mitigating the impact of the global price downturn on their suppliers, with some flexibility in relation to the phasing of superlevy bills to farmers.  Furthermore Teagasc has recently commenced a series of dairy seminars throughout the country to help dairy farmers manage through 2015, while also planning the efficient development of their dairy business in a non-quota environment.  It should also be noted that the Single Farm Payment will also provide a measure of income stability during the forthcoming period.</p>  <p>  The superlevy bill for 2015 will of course, be the last such bill and I expect all of the relevant shareholders to do what is necessary to assist farmers through this temporary difficulty.</p></reply>

Apart from the obvious function of representing their member&rsquo;s interests at annual EU fishing quota negotiations in Brussels etc, POs are also an increasingly important element in terms of delivering on the EUs objectives for the recently reformed Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).  The role of POs is recognised as being integral to achieving the objectives of the new CFP in terms of such important aspects as promoting the viable and sustainable fishing activities of their members, eliminating discards by helping members to avoid and reduce unwanted catches, contributing to the traceability of fishery products and the elimination of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing etc.  The organisations also play an important role in improving the conditions for the placing on the market of their member&rsquo;s fishery products, maximising economic returns for the industry while contributing to the production of a high quality, safe food source.  Other functions may include playing a role in reducing the environmental impact of fishing and, managing temporary storage for fishery products (where relevant).</p>  <p>  It is important to note that Producer Organisations are primarily independent representative organisations operating on behalf of their members, in common with organised representative organisations throughout the Irish economy.  While the State does not have a primary oversight or control role in terms of the day to day operation of these organisations, there is regular interaction via such processes as annual quota negotiations, quota management meetings and (W.E.F 2015) the new requirement for POs to produce and submit annual or multi annual Production and Marketing Plans (PMPs).  The latter may attract funding via the new EMFF (European maritime fisheries fund) and any such funding will therefore be subject to the rules and procedures governing such funds, which will be announced by my Department later this year.</p>  <p>  In very general terms any organised groups of fishermen or seafood related producers may apply to the European Commission via the Member State for official recognition as a fisheries PO.  Before they can be recognised they must have a significant presence in the marketplace and meet the other criteria set down by the Commission for such recognition.  These include, having a demonstrable functioning organisation and business premises, appropriate staffing, expertise and a genuine commitment to sustainable fishing practices etc.  Thereafter such recognition can only be withdrawn if the organisation fails to fulfil its role or meet its obligations under the CFP (see above) or by not adhering to the practice and objectives of the CFP in terms of sustainable fishing and appropriate quota management fishing practices etc.</p>  <p>  The policy of my Department is to encourage and enable existing Producer Organisations to achieve their objectives in terms of maximising their contribution to coastal economies particularly while respecting their independence as representative bodies working on behalf of their individual members.  My Department welcomes applications from groups who may wish to consider becoming recognised POs provided they meet the criteria set out by the European Commission in this regard.  In general any evidence of non compliance by POs with the conditions for recognition laid down in article 14 of EU Reg 1379/2013 or (W.E.F. 2015), obligations provided under Article 28 of EU Reg 1379/2013 regarding Production and Marketing Plans may result in the withdrawal of such recognition.</p></reply>

POs are independent representative bodies who represent their member&rsquo;s interest in issues such as annual quota negotiations with the EU Commission etc.  They are not currently in receipt of any State funding on an ongoing basis apart from an initial assistance from the EU Commission in relation to set up costs.  These organisations may become eligible to receive funding under the provisions of the new EMFF (European Maritime Fisheries Fund) to fund a requirement of the new CMO (Common Organisation of the Market, Regulation) which will necessitate the compilation of annual  or multi annual Production &amp;amp; Marketing Plans (PMPs) by these organisations.  PMPs will provide details of the main marketed species (by PO) as well as details of plans to market these species etc.  As these plans may also contain potentially important commercial information, there are currently no plans to publish them.  The plans will not be submitted to the EC and will be examined and approved at MS level only.  Full details of Ireland&rsquo;s EMFF funding mechanisms will be announced by my Department in due course, a period of public consultation in terms of identifying national priorities will be a part of that process.</p>  <p>  Fish quotas are a publicly owned resource in Ireland and catch limits are made available to vessel owners on a periodic basis in accordance with management policy.  The arrangements for quota management have been set and developed over many years and changes to management arrangements are determined by the Minister following consultation with Producer Organisations and other industry representatives.  POs represent the interests of the catching sector at monthly Quota Management Advisory Committee meetings.  As far as possible, I take account of the recommendations for monthly regimes for particular stocks.  Additional meetings involving POs are organised as required to discuss specific issues in particular fisheries that may arise, including in relation to pelagic stocks.</p></reply>

It is staffed by officials from my own Department and from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and located in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p>  <p>  The remit of IYJS is to improve the delivery of youth justice services and reduce youth offending.  This challenge is met by focusing on diversion and rehabilitation involving greater use of community-based interventions and the promotion of initiatives to deal with young people who offend.  The key stakeholders supporting IYJS in its work include An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Probation Service, Courts Service; Tusla, HSE, the Children Detention Schools, management and staff of community based organisations delivering Garda Youth Diversion Projects and Young Person Probation Community Projects.</p>  <p>  The youth justice system should be considered in its entirety, from the Garda Diversion Programme through to the Children Courts and the Children Detention Schools.  It is important to note that there it is not a simple question of choice between the Diversion Programme, community sanctions and detention.  The principles of the Children Act 2001 require the various authorities to apply, incrementally, a series of "filters" or tests to each case where a child comes into conflict with the law.</p>  <p>  The first main filter is the Garda Diversion Programme, involving at different stages and depending on the seriousness of the offence, the informal caution (without supervision) and the formal (supervised) caution, including possible involvement with a Garda Youth Diversion Project.  The second main filter is provided by the non-custodial sanctions available to the Courts, including dismissal under the Probation Act and unsupervised sanctions (fines, disqualification, peace bond, curfew etc.).  The next stage involves the Probation supervised sanctions (community service and other community sanctions). Finally, as a last resort, detention may be used.</p>  <p>  Gorey already has access to a &lsquo;youth justice service&rsquo;, in that a child offender, who accepts responsibility for his/her actions, will be considered for admission to the Diversion Programme, which operates nationwide.  The Wexford Garda Division has 3 Juvenile Liaison Officer posts to support the delivery of the Diversion Programme across the county.  Furthermore, following the amalgamation of the Enniscorthy and Gorey Garda Districts in late 2013, the Slaney Project, a Garda Youth Diversion Project originally based in Enniscorthy, extended its reach to include Gorey.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that on 19 December 2014, I was able to announce that funding will be provided under the Dormant Accounts Disbursement Scheme via my Department to expand Irish Youth Justice Service Community Programmes.  This new funding will support efforts by my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to reduce youth crime.  There is &euro;2.8 million available to the Irish Youth Justice Service Community Programmes to support a number of proposals, including the establishment of new Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) at additional locations around the country, additional youth justice workers for GYDPs in areas with high levels of youth crime and the role-out of mentoring supports for GYDPs participants and to assist JLOs operating in areas without access to a GYDP.</p>  <p>  The locations for new projects and for additional youth justice workers have been selected on the basis of various factors including increases in the youth population and levels of youth crime and will be announced shortly.</p></reply>

This high level of support has been maintained despite the difficult budgetary situation that prevailed in recent years. </p>  <p>  It is clear that accessibility, affordability and high quality childcare can play a critical role in achieving a number of Government priorities, including improving educational outcomes for children, reducing poverty and increasing parents' participation in the labour market.  To ensure that all the benefits of childcare investments are fully realised, future public investment in childcare must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated. I am establishing a cross-Departmental group to look at the provision right across the 0 to 6 age group as well as to consider the after-school needs of older school-going children. It is crucial that we develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in childcare services.</p>  <p>  This new group will include representatives of the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach and will be led and supported by my Department.  I will be asking that the work of this group be carried out within a relatively short time frame and I expect that the group will be in a position to report to me in the Summer. </p>  <p>  I wish to point out to the Deputy that, while the annual spend on childcare related programmes has been in the region of 0.2 per cent of GDP in recent years, this expenditure does not include expenditure under other early intervention programmes or by other Departments on early years' programmes and services and therefore does not represent the full extent of State expenditure. </p>  <p>  While it is my objective to incrementally develop the early child care and education programmes over the term of this Government as resources permit, it is the case that expenditure and funding requirements are generally considered as part of the annual estimates cycle and budgetary process. It is not possible for me at this time to determine what decisions may be taken by Government in the context of future budgets and how these decisions will impact on expenditure allocations for programmes and services falling within the Vote of my Department. </p></reply>

A standard capitation fee of &euro;62.50 per week per eligible child is paid to participating childcare services with a higher capitation fee of &euro;73 per week per eligible child available to services with more highly qualified staff.</p>  <p>  The Government succeeded in maintaining the pre-school year on a universal and free basis despite the difficult budgetary situation that prevailed in recent years.  While considerable progress has been made in correcting the overall budgetary situation, the funding available to my Department following the completion of budgetary process this year does not allow for an increase in the capitation paid to childcare providers. As the economy improves and the public finances recover, I would hope that the capitation rates for all childcare programmes could be improved. </p>  <p>  Childcare services in this country are provided by private commercial and community childcare services and the level of remuneration provided to childcare workers is a matter for the individual management of each service.  There are currently no national pay scales that provide for the level of pay of childcare workers.</p></reply>

I would like to be in a position to provide for mandatory CPD but first I would like to see early years practitioners meet the new minimum qualification requirements.  <br/><br/>The Deputy may be aware that as part of the Early Years Quality Agenda aimed at improving the quality of childcare services, new qualification requirements for childcare staff working directly with children were announced last year.  To support staff who are seeking to meet the new qualifications requirement, funding of &euro;3 million is being made available over the two years 2014/2015 under the Learner Fund. <br/><br/>A National Early Years Quality Support Service,  <i>Better Start</i>, has been introduced under the Early Years Quality Agenda.  As part of that service, funding has been provided to allow for the recruitment of 30 graduates in early childhood care and education to work directly with services to improve quality, including assisting services in the implementation of the S&iacute;olta Framework and the Aistear Curriculum.  The new service will work closely with the City and County Childcare Committees and the Voluntary Childcare Organisations to support service providers in improving the quality of their services.  The work of the service will be based on a new Practice Guide based on S&iacute;olta and Aistear, which is currently being developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA). </p></reply>

In responding to these calls it is important to be clear on what we want this investigation to examine and that we are clear and realistic as to our approach and expectations here. My sole objective is to establish a focused Commission, which can effectively utilise all the necessary powers, to establish relevant facts in a reasonable time frame. On the basis of the available information it would not be appropriate to consider places which were children&rsquo;s homes, infants&rsquo; homes or functioned as orphanages, as being Mother and Baby Homes. These institutions did not provide the specific range of services, in particular supervised ante and post-natal facilities to single mothers and their children which are the central focus of this investigation, in the manner of the homes listed in the terms of reference.  </p>  <p>  As I have previously stated, it would not be accurate to suggest children&rsquo;s homes and orphanages are excluded from this Investigation as the relationships of Mother and Baby Homes with such institutions will be explored by the Commission as required by Article 1(VII) of the investigation and in the academic social history module. The Commission will investigate evidence of patterns of referral, relationships and co-operation with other entities and intermediary organisations. This will allow for examination of the practices and procedures pertaining in such institutions including intermediary bodies involved in the placement of children. </p>  <p>  While I do appreciate that there are many additional matters which some might like to be included, and I have responded to the specific issue raised on a number of occasions, it is important to be clear that this is not an investigation into all and every type of institution. It is also the case that other inquiries examined issues relating to a wide range of care settings including children&rsquo;s homes. As we know a major investigation into historical child abuse has already been conducted by the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. Its remit was to inquire into the abuse of children in institutions in the period 1940 to 1999 and the broad definition of institutions covered included settings such as the Westbank Orphanage.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the independent Commission has sufficient scope to examine a broad range of concerns, and to make a determination on their relevance to the central issues in question, and where appropriate to make any recommendations to me which the Commission deems necessary. In this regard, I hope that this will reassure those who feel that the process to date may not have fully uncovered information relevant to their specific circumstances.</p></reply>

The funding is being used to continue to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams for both adults and children, to enhance specialist community mental health services for older people with a mental illness, those with an intellectual disability and mental illness, forensic mental health services, and to enhance access counselling and psychotherapy in primary care and investment in suicide prevention measures.<br/><br/>In relation to the specific issue by the Deputy, there are a number of treatment options for depression.  The best and most appropriate treatment option depends on the individual case, the likely cause of depression and the severity of .  Treatment for depression usually involves a combination of medication, talking therapies - usually provided by a mental health professional, such as a counsellor, psychiatrist or psychologist - and self-help.  In some cases, a combination of all three might be the most appropriate treatment plan for that individual.<br/><br/>There are many excellent counselling services currently provided across the country by both the HSE and voluntary sector.  Counselling is provided across the health service including primary care, social care and within the mental health. The type of service can be provided by a range of trained health professionals and delivered to meet a clinical need at either primary or secondary care level.  The Government, in keeping with its commitment in the Programme for Government to increase access to counselling and psychotherapy, has provided funding totalling &euro;7.5 million to develop the Counselling in Primary Care (CIPC) service, which works closely with HSE Mental Health Service, under whose aegis this funding is provided.  CICP is one of a range of initiatives taken by the HSE to build the capacity of primary care services to respond to mental health needs of individuals.  I was pleased to note that the HSE in its National Service Plan 2015 has committed to &quot;reviewing and improving access to psychotherapy and psychotherapeutic interventions&quot;.<br/><br/>If the Deputy wishes to provide me with the contact details of the person in question, I will ask the HSE to contact the individual directly. </p></reply>

The procedures recognise that parents and pupils have a role and responsibility in helping the school to prevent and address school-based bullying behaviour and to deal with any negative impact within school of bullying behaviour that occurs elsewhere.</p>  <p>  The procedures set out requirements in relation to the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour amongst pupils. They also require that a programme of support for pupils who have been bullied must be in place in all schools. Details of the school's programme for working with pupils affected by bullying must be set out in the school's anti-bullying policy.</p>  <p>  There is and has been no requirement for reporting incidents of bullying centrally to the Department. The procedures contain new oversight arrangements which include a requirement that the school Principal reports regularly to the board of management in relation to the overall numbers of bullying cases and provides confirmation that they are being dealt with in accordance with the anti-bullying procedures. The board of management is also required to undertake an annual review of the school's anti-bullying policy and its implementation by the school. Written confirmation that the review has been completed must be made available to the Parents' Association and published on the school website.</p>  <p>  Arising from commitments made in the Action Plan on Bullying, my Department's Inspectorate is placing a stronger focus on the actions schools take to create a positive school culture and to prevent and tackle bullying. </p></reply>

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.</p>  <p>  The Local Government (Rates) Act 1970 provides for the operation of rates waiver schemes. Under the provisions, a rating authority may make and carry out a scheme providing for a waiver of all or a portion of commercial rates due by ratepayers in respect of a specified class or classes of property. The formulation of such a scheme is a matter reserved for the members of the relevant local authority and is subject to my consent as Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. </p>  <p>  I would consider carefully any application received for a rate waiver scheme. In considering any such application, it has to be borne in mind that a waiver of rates for one class of ratepayer could unfairly impact on existing businesses in the area by giving a competitive advantage to a certain group through a reduction in costs. As such, it would be necessary to consider State Aid rules in relation to the provision of any such relief. In addition, the introduction of a waiver scheme could further increase costs on the part of businesses that are not part of the scheme, as it is likely that they would be required to make up the cost of the waiver scheme through the payment of additional rates. This could impose an additional burden on such ratepayers.     </p>  <p>  Recent developments have seen some local authorities introduce locally designed business incentive schemes which promote the use of vacant commercial property. Such schemes rely upon Part 9 of the Local Government Act 2001 which provides that the functions of local authorities include providing grants, loans guarantees or other financial aid to promote the interests of the local community, including economic interests. Unlike rates waiver schemes under section 2 of the Local Government (Rates) Act 1970, no Ministerial sanction is required for the setting up of these schemes.</p>  <p>  I will continue to keep commercial rates related issues under consideration.</p></reply>

The rates applicable for the half-yearly and quarterly options are 55.5% and 28.25% of the annual charge, respectively. These relativities have remained generally consistent since the 1960s.</p>  <p>  The differential takes account of the extra workload for staffing in motor tax offices and the National Vehicle and Driver File Unit , and the resultant administrative costs and printing costs that arise, including the issuing of renewal notices. Each quarterly renewal of motor tax follows the same administrative procedures as the annual renewal process. Consequently, renewing on a quarterly basis generates four times the workload of an annual renewal for the equivalent period.</p>  <p>  The estimated additional annual income from the increased charges for half-yearly and quarterly discs is in the region of &euro;50m. A loss of income from this source would have a negative impact on the total collected via motor tax, and would have to be borne elsewhere in the motor tax system or through the taxation system generally.</p></reply>

Section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act 2009 and associated Regulations empower a housing authority to carry out a social housing assessment in order to determine whether a particular household qualifies for social housing support. Under these enactments, a household is ineligible for social housing support if a member owns alternative accommodation that could meet the household&rsquo;s needs, either by occupying it or selling it to pay for other accommodation.<br/><br/>The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 prescribe an application form for social housing application that requires the household to supply information on property ownership either in the State or abroad. Regulation 11 obliges a household to provide to a housing authority such additional information, including documents and other particulars, sought by the authority for the purpose of verifying information relating to an application for social housing support. I expect that any request by a housing authority for supporting documentation in relation to ownership of property abroad would be appropriate, having regard to the circumstances in each case.<br/><br/>I am aware that requests by local authorities for documents relating to ownership of property abroad can cause difficulties in particular cases and will consider this issue as part of the review of the social housing assessment system to be undertaken this year, in fulfilment of a commitment in the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>. </p></reply>

The strategy will address a range of issues in relation to the intervention including the optimum procurement model, ownership model for the infrastructure, intervention cost and likely market impact.<br/><br/>Following the public consultation, towards the end of this year a detailed procurement process will be undertaken in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders. The Department will design a tender in a way that maximises efficiencies and keeps the cost of the network build as low as possible. I anticipate that the first homes and businesses will be connected in 2016 and connections will continue thereafter, with the intention of having all premises connected within a 5 year period.<br/><br/>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government.

Ireland, however, has witnessed a positive upswing in the level of petroleum exploration activity in recent years, in particular acquisition of new seismic data. We need to see this translate into an increased level of exploration drilling in the coming years, if Ireland&rsquo;s true petroleum potential is to be realised.<br/><br/>In a similar manner, while the number of active minerals prospecting licences indicate the buoyant state of mineral exploration in Ireland, no new commercially viable deposits of minerals have been discovered in the last five years although there have been some encouraging results, particularly in Counties Limerick and Clare. However, it is too early to determine whether these results will lead to identification of commercially viable deposits or to estimate the economic benefits that might accrue.</p></reply>

EVs currently on the market are offering ranges under 200km per charge. This compares to ranges of approximately 170km two to three years ago. It is expected that similar evolutionary increases in range will continue through improved battery technology and vehicle design.<br/><br/>The contribution that electric vehicles will make to reducing carbon emissions will depend on the number of electric vehicles, the transport fossil fuel they displace, and the extent to which the carbon emissions of the electricity system are reduced.<br/><br/>The extent to which electric vehicles are adopted in the short-to-medium term will depend on a range of factors including,<i>inter alia</i>, the strength of the economy, the overall numbers of new cars being purchased, the cost of purchasing and running electric vehicles compared to fossil fuel comparators, and the number of different electric vehicle models available to purchase. There are signs that these factors are improving and in 2014 there was an increase in electric vehicle purchases through the grant scheme compared to previous years.<br/><br/>The increased deployment of renewable energy will play a significant role in decarbonising Ireland&rsquo;s electricity system. In this regard, SEAI&rsquo;s latest &quot;Energy in Ireland&quot; report noted that energy related CO2 emissions fell by 3.8% and that the carbon intensity of electricity dropped to a new low of 469 grams of CO2 per kilo watt hour in 2013. Furthermore, a report published by the SEAI in 2013 looking at fuel and CO2 emissions in 2012 noted that renewable electricity generation displaced 778 kilo tonnes of oil equivalent of fossil fuel, with an associated saving of almost 2 million tonnes of CO2. Indeed, with careful management of the EV load, a significant uptake of EVs could facilitate increased levels of renewable electricity into the future.<br/><br/>Moving beyond 2020, negotiations are now well underway on the Climate and Energy Framework 2030. The EU proposed targets foresee significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and increases in renewable energy across the EU. My Department is actively participating in the whole of Government approach, which is underpinned by rigorous systems and economic modelling, to determine a technically feasible, cost-effective and fair contribution for Ireland to make to the overall EU ambition, including in the area of transport.</p></reply>

Ireland is currently heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels to meet our energy needs. While it is acknowledged that fossil fuels will remain part of the energy mix for some time to come, progress is being made towards increasing the share of renewable energy in our generation portfolio. The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources. In 2013, 7.8% of Ireland's overall energy requirement was met by renewable energy. This equated to 20.9% of electricity demand, 5.7% of heat demand and 2.8% of transport being met from renewable sources.</p>  <p>  To date wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. In 2013, 16.5% of electricity demand was met by wind generation. At the end of 2014, the total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid was in excess of 2,500 MW. It is estimated that a total of between 3,500 and 4,000 MW of renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target.</p>  <p>  Our progress to date has already had a significant impact on the carbon intensity of our economy. The SEAI Energy in Ireland report, 2013 noted that energy related CO2 emissions fell by 3.8% and that the carbon intensity of electricity dropped to a new low of 469 grams of CO2 per kilo watt hour in 2013. Furthermore a report published by the SEAI in 2013 looking at fuel and CO2 emissions in 2012 noted that renewable electricity generation displaced 778 kilo tonnes of oil equivalent of fossil fuel, with an associated saving of almost 2 million tonnes of CO2. The respective monetary savings are &euro;245 million and &euro;15 million.</p>  <p>  However, challenges remain in terms of achieving our 2020 targets. Looking beyond 2020, the October 2014 European Council endorsed a binding EU target of at least 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990. Ireland intends to make a cost-effective, achievable and fair (in terms of effort sharing among Member States), contribution to these high level EU goals. Various government departments, including my department, are currently undertaking rigorous analysis and modelling to inform Ireland's position ahead of final decisions regarding specific contributions required of Member States.</p></reply>

The Act provides that the Minister may issue a certificate approving of the issue of a licence by the Revenue Commissioners in respect of the arena.  Regulations made by the Minister identify particular areas in the arena within which alcohol products may be sold and consumed.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Deputy was recently informed by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality that section 34 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, as amended, makes it an offence for a licensee to permit a person under the age of 18 years to be in the bar of a licensed premises after 9 p.m. (or 10 p.m. from May to September). However, the Minister for Justice and Equality also advised the Deputy that section 34 applies to bars of licensed premises only and does not apply to premises in which the sale and consumption of alcohol is ancillary to other activity, such as restaurants, theatres or designated national sporting arenas.  Nonetheless I will raise the concerns referred to by the Deputy with the operators of the arenas in question.</p></reply>

As one of the five Ports of Regional Significance, Drogheda Port Company will transfer to the control of Louth County Council through a transfer of the current Ministerial shareholding in the company to the local authority.</p>  <p>  These transfers require amendments to the current Harbours Acts and my Department is working with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to bring forward a new Harbours (Amendment) Bill. I expect to seek Government approval for the text of the finalised Bill within Q1 2015. The Bill itself will not the be the legal instrument of transfer, but it will provide the necessary power to allow for later transfer by Ministerial order.</p>  <p>  The draft General Scheme of the Bill, the associated Regulatory Impact Analysis, submissions made during consultations, together with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport's report thereon and my  response to that report, are all available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  The Company and the Council have been working together on a joint Steering Group established to oversee the necessary operational arrangements under the new governance model. Since publication of the initial Regulatory Impact Analysis in summer 2013 my Department has maintained regular contact with representatives of all relevant companies and local authorities and I look forward to publishing the Bill in due course.</p></reply>
