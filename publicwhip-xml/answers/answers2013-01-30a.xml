    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-30a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1046" speakername="Jimmy Deenihan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013013000054#WRA00500"><p>As the Deputy is aware, the <i>Programme for Government</i> contains a commitment to expand the Culture Night concept and to consider making it a twice yearly event. Following on from discussions between my Department and all relevant stakeholders, it was agreed that this commitment would be best met by the designation and delivery of an <i>International Week of Irish Culture, </i>  based around the St Patrick's Day Festival.  This would allow for the cultivation and development of the solid foundations already in place to showcase to the world Ireland's rich and varied cultural heritage and to promote Ireland as a destination for cultural tourists.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">2012 was essentially the first year of a 5-year development plan for this initiative, which will ultimately potentially link with 2016 commemorations.  Last year, the emphasis was on the international launch of the &quot;</font><i><font color="#2F2F2F">International Celebration of Irish Culture</font></i><font color="#2F2F2F">&quot; brand abroad and a series of programme activities based in existing cultural venues around the Merrion Square/Kildare Street areas of Dublin, marketing the message of &quot;</font><i><font color="#2F2F2F">I Love my City</font></i><font color="#2F2F2F">&quot;.  The existing St. Patrick's Festival activity was used to promote Ireland and its culture, both domestically and internationally, and the initiative was well received and supported in both national and international spheres.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  Plans for the 2013 event are almost finalised and both the duration and programme have been expanded for this year's event, having particular regard to the Gathering.  In addition to profiling the range of rich cultural events taking place during St. Patrick's Festival, the 2013 programme also includes some 16 headline events in collaboration with various cultural institutions and partners over a 4 day period from the 14</font><font color="#2F2F2F">th to the 17</font><font color="#2F2F2F">th March inclusive.  These events will be staged in the beautiful surroundings of some of our most prestigious cultural institutions and venues and admission will be free of charge.  Ireland's current presidency of the EU will also be celebrated during the 2013 event, with the key focus of the international element of this year's programme centring on &quot;</font><i><font color="#2F2F2F">Culture Connects&quot;</font></i><font color="#2F2F2F">, the international culture programme of Ireland's EU Presidency.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  </font>In further recognition of the Culture Night commitment in the<i> Programme for Government</i>, my Department continues to work with all relevant stakeholders to foster and develop the event. Culture Night has grown from a relatively small-scale cultural event staged only in Dublin in 2006 to the significant national cultural event it now is, with Culture Night 2012 featuring a record 34 participating locations, including 6 regions in Northern Ireland, and encompassing over 900 venues, making it the biggest and most extensive Culture Night to date.  Discussions have already commenced with key stakeholders in relation to Culture Night 2013. As it enters its 8th year, the challenge is to keep Culture Night fresh and exciting, whilst building on the platforms and success of previous years to further develop and enhance the event.  Whilst we want people to really enjoy Culture Night, we also want to use it as a stepping stone or bridge to encourage more people to visit cultural venues and experience culture in their locality.  I anticipate that both the Culture Night and <i>International Celebration of Irish Culture</i>  initiatives will make a significant contribution towards the success of The Gathering in 2013.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-30a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1046" speakername="Jimmy Deenihan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013013000054#WRA00800"><p>Government policy on the arts, as set out in the <i>Programme for Government</i> , is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, increase access to and participation in the arts, make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life, and maximise the potential for cultural tourism and job creation in this sector.  In the context of the 2013 Estimates, I continued my endeavours to maximise ongoing Government support for the arts and culture sector. For 2013, the Exchequer allocation to the Arts Council, which is the principal agency through which State funding is channelled to the arts, will total some &#8364;60.7 million in current, capital and EU Presidency funding. I remain committed to securing the best possible level of funding for the arts sector.</p><p>  Under the Arts Act 2003, the Arts Council is statutorily independent in its day-to-day operations and neither I nor my Department has a role to play in its funding decisions. I am advised, however, that the Arts Council operates funding cycles for its three main grant programmes - <i>Regularly Funded Organisations</i>; <i>Annual Funding</i>; and <i>Annual Programming Grants</i>   &#8211; in such a way as to help arts organisations by giving them more funding certainty and improved ability for planning.</p><p>  I believe that within the current economic constraints, our investment in the arts, culture and creative sectors is more important than ever due to the employment intensity of the sector. The arts are a significant economic contributor and employer in their own right and they are also important building blocks for those economic policies the Government has identified as crucial for our economic recovery. The arts continue to underpin policies in attracting foreign direct investment, the creation of an imaginative labour force, establishing an innovative environment in which the creative and cultural industries can thrive, and promoting cultural tourism.</p></reply>

The effect of the Preservation Order is that any works affecting these properties require my consent, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, under section 14 of the National Monuments Act 1930, as amended.  The landowner&rsquo;s application to my Department envisages the retention of the monument buildings and the provision of a commemorative centre to the 1916 Rising and its leaders. That application for consent is being examined by my Department at present.  As part of the consent process, the applicant was asked by my Department to submit an Environmental Impact Statement in relation to the proposed works. This was in accordance with new regulations, which I introduced last year, that have placed additional responsibilities on landowners in respect of monuments protected under the National Monuments Acts.</p><p>  The Environmental Impact Statement was received in my Department on Friday last, 25 January 2013 and, as required by the regulations, copies have been sent to the National Museum of Ireland and Dublin City Council for observations.  It is also available for public examination. Interested parties have 5 weeks from the submission date to provide their comments to me, as Minister, for consideration as part of my assessment of the Environmental Impact Statement.  Having completed the prescribed consultation procedures, I will then undertake the formal environmental impact assessment as part of my decision on the consent application.  My intention is complete these processes as speedily as possible.</p></reply>

A range of actions being taken by my Department and its agencies to support The Gathering were outlined in reply to Question No 16 of 28 November last. That reply acknowledged the importance of genealogy in the context of The Gathering, especially in terms of helping members of the Irish Diaspora to establish links with their family history and place. My Department, the National Library and the National Archives are concentrating on progressing improvements to our genealogical offering as part of our contribution to The Gathering.</p><p>  Art in all its forms is an intrinsic part of Irish culture and will play an important part in The Gathering.  As outlined on 28 November last, our national cultural institutions such as the National Museum and the National Gallery are promoting a number of initiatives to contribute towards The Gathering.  In addition, the National Concert Hall is focusing on two periods in relation to The Gathering: St Patrick's Weekend and <i>Summer at the NCH, </i>where a wide range of concerts featuring leading Irish artists in traditional, popular and classical music will be held throughout July and August.  The National Library's award-winning multimedia exhibition on WB Yeats will run throughout the year. It is also mounting an exhibition to mark the 50th anniversary of the homecoming visit of President John F Kennedy to Ireland in 1963, in partnership with the National Archives, with the support of my own Department, the US Embassy and the JFK Library. It will also host the travelling exhibition &quot;The Fifth Province: Irish County Societies in America&quot;, originally presented in Glucksman Ireland House, New York.  The National Archives will also be playing its part.</p><p>  As outlined previously, the Arts Council is playing an ongoing key role in funding and developing arts events around the country during 2013.  This will seek to ensure that many of the visitors for The Gathering can experience excellent performances and exhibitions locally.  In addition, both the Culture Night and International Celebration of Irish Culture initiatives will make a significant contribution to The Gathering.</p><p>  In the heritage area, my Department is supporting an initiative planned for 2013 by Mayo County Council to create an architectural installation in a westerly location in Co Mayo which will be informed by past and present Diaspora celebrated by The Gathering. I am informed that the Heritage Council, which is funded by my Department, has made a submission to F&aacute;ilte Ireland regarding the international marketing of Heritage Week 2013 to link in with The Gathering. In addition, the Council grant-aided a genealogist post last year in the organisation <i>Ireland Reaching Out</i>, which is a Diaspora-focused organization contracted to support The Gathering.</p><p>  In terms of the Gaeltacht, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta will be placing particular emphasis on events aimed at attracting visitors to Ireland as part of The Gathering in the context of its 2013 scheme for supporting traditional festivals in Gaeltacht areas.  In summary, therefore, I consider that both my Department and the various bodies under its remit will be making a substantial contribution towards The Gathering initiative.</p></reply>

The practical impact of this Charter will result in a more joined-up Government approach across Departments, education agencies and arts organisations. The Charter will require groups like the Arts Council, the National Cultural Institutions, the Colleges of Education and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to work with both my own Department and the Department of Education and Skills in order to bring the arts into the classroom and school children into the arts and culture sector.</p><p>  A High Level Implementation Group will oversee the implementation of the Charter and will report to the Minister of Education and Skills and myself at least twice a year. The Implementation Group may also advise on updating and improving the Charter and will provide a strategic, high-level and ongoing point of contact between the policy-makers, key providers and students in the fields of arts and education.  It is not envisaged that either Department will seek additional resources specifically for the implementation of the <i>Arts in Education </i>  Charter - rather we will work to leverage the maximum from existing resources.  More details of this initiative can be obtained on my Department's website under the <i>Projects and Programmes </i>link listed under </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-30a.29.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1046" speakername="Jimmy Deenihan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013013000055#WRB01300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 34 and 42 together.</p><p>  During Ireland's EU Presidency, we will focus in the cultural area on two legislative proposals - <i>Creative Europe 2014-2020 </i>and<i> Europe for Citizens 2014-2020 </i>- as well as the <i>European Capitals of Culture 2020-2033</i> proposal.  The <i>Creative Europe</i> proposal is very important for artists and arts organisations across the entire European Union. It is vital that we get agreement on this so that those working in the culture and creative sectors can benefit from the new programme as soon as possible. It should be noted, however, that agreement on the Multi-Annual Financial Framework is essential to ensure that the <i>Creative Europe</i> programme is adopted in time for the sectors to start to benefit from it from the beginning of 2014. The Irish Presidency also considers that <i>Europe for Citizens</i> is an important proposal for progression. This proposal seeks to enhance civic participation at the Union level. A further key element of our Presidency is the timely adoption of the <i>European Capitals of Culture </i>  proposal so that the chosen locations can be afforded the necessary lead-in times to bring forward preparations for their period of designation.</p><p>  I would also like to refer to Ireland's Cultural Programme for the Presidency - <i>Culture Connects -</i> which I launched recently in Dublin with Minister of State Creighton. The Programme aims to showcase Irish culture across Europe, as well as European culture in Ireland, thereby illustrating the shared nature of much of our cultural experiences. The Programme incorporates over 300 projects being undertaken under the management and oversight of my Department - at home and abroad.  It will facilitate the engagement of audiences throughout Ireland with European artists, as well as exposing our indigenous artistic community to wider cultural experiences across Europe and further afield, by way of a range of festivals, traditional arts and other specific events. The <i>Culture Connects</i> programme is available on my Department's website and I have also made arrangements to lodge copies in the Oireachtas Library. The EU is culturally diverse, with a rich, shared, European heritage. I firmly believe that it benefits us all to bring our arts and culture to a wider EU audience, whilst also experiencing the cultural offerings of our partner countries.</p><p>  From the heritage perspective, certain nature conservation issues which come into my area of responsibility will fall to be dealt with under the Environment Council formation.  The first of these is an EU Commission proposal in respect of <i>Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization</i>. This is intended to meet the requirements of the Nagoya Protocol within the EU and sets out obligations for users of genetic resources in the Union. The Protocol is aimed at ensuring that there is a reward to countries that are the source of biological materials which may be collected for use in other countries in new and profitable products, such as foods, medicines, or biotech agents. It would protect developing countries from so-called &quot;biopiracy&quot; and is also a key step in meeting the 2020 Global Targets on Biodiversity. Ireland's Presidency aims to make significant progress within the Council with regard to the overall objective of EU ratification of the Nagoya Protocol in early 2014.</p><p>  A new Directive on Invasive Alien Species is expected to be adopted by the Commission in the near future and the Irish Presidency will commence work on this item, if it is adopted.  The Irish Presidency also co-ordinated EU positions for the first plenary meeting of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), which took place last week in Bonn, Germany. This was an important meeting to establish this new international body, which will provide scientific advice on biodiversity issues.</p><p>  Finally, in relation to heritage matters, the Irish Presidency is currently overseeing the formulation of common positions on the proposals to be discussed at the 16th Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Illegal Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), to be held in Bangkok, Thailand, next March.</p><p>  With regard to the Irish language, my Department is a member of the Network to Promote Linguistic Diversity (NPLD), which is a European-wide network working in the field of language policy and planning. During the Irish Presidency of the EU, my colleague, Minister of State McGinley, will launch the NPLD&#8217;s <i>European Roadmap for Linguistic Diversity</i> in Brussels. It is envisaged that this will raise awareness at a European level on the vital importance of linguistic diversity.</p></reply>

It has a board of eleven members, including the Chair. The board and the management are responsible for the day to day running of the Theatre. The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht appoints the Chair and two of the other directors.  Oversight is provided by the Arts Council, which provides the annual operating grant to the Theatre, while the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General audits the financial accounts.</p><p>The Abbey Theatre's mission is to create world-class theatre that actively engages with and reflects Irish society. It seeks to achieve its mission by:</p><p>- Sustaining and re-imagining the repertoire of Irish plays;</p><p>- Presenting classic and contemporary world theatre;</p><p>- Promoting and developing the long-term success of Irish theatre;</p><p>- Touring nationally and internationally; and</p><p>- Engaging its communities in outreach and education programmes.</p><p>The combined total amount of funding provided by the Arts Council and by my Department for the years 2008 to 2012 was some &euro;41.96m.  Details of the funding are set out in the table. Of that &euro;41.96m my Department provided &euro;1.66m in capital funding to the Abbey Theatre for capital upgrades, equipment replacement and health and safety investments.</p><p>Since 2006, the Arts Council, as the principal provider of current State funding to the Abbey Theatre, has provided its funding via a combination of annual and three year multiannual funding agreements. Such funding is provided as a contribution towards both artistic programming costs and operating costs, such as staff and ongoing administrative expenditure. I am advised that funding is offered in response to proposals submitted by the Abbey and, once agreement has been reached on the key deliverables, the purpose for which funding is used is then monitored on an ongoing basis via regular reporting arrangements. Funding for touring production within Ireland is provided by the Arts Council, while funding for international touring is provided under my Department's Culture Ireland Programme.</p><p><bu>TABLE: Funding to the Abbey Theatre 2008-2012</bu></p><p><table><tr><th>Funding Type</th><th><div>2008</div></th><th><div>2009</div></th><th><div>2010</div></th><th><div>2011</div></th><th><div>2012</div></th></tr><tr><td>Arts Council Revenue Grant</td><td><div>&#8364;10,000,000</div></td><td><div>&#8364;8,350,000</div></td><td><div>&#8364;7,250,000</div></td><td><div>&#8364;7,100,000</div></td><td><div>&#8364;7,100,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Arts Council Touring Grant</td><td><div></div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div>&#8364;68,000</div></td><td><div>&#8364;58,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Culture Ireland Touring Grant</td><td><div>&#8364;49,511</div></td><td><div>&#8364;26,400</div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div>&#8364;236,348</div></td><td><div>&#8364;60,204</div></td></tr><tr><td>Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht Capital Grant</td><td><div>&#8364;297,701</div></td><td><div>&#8364;196,272</div></td><td><div>&#8364;467,821</div></td><td><div>&#8364;249,662</div></td><td><div>&#8364;450,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td><div>&#8364;10,347,212</div></td><td><div>&#8364;8,572,672</div></td><td><div>&#8364;7,717,821</div></td><td><div>&#8364;7,654,010</div></td><td><div>&#8364;7,668,204</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Report was published in July 2011 and an implementation committee to pursue the execution of its recommendations has been established.  One of the main recommendations in the Report is the extension of the Section 481 Scheme until the end of 2020; it is currently approved until the end of 2015.</p><p>  A public consultation process to assist the Department of Finance in examining the operation of the Section 481 Scheme beyond 2015 was announced in May 2012.  This consultation process invited interested parties to make submissions on the economic impact assessment of the operation, status and future development of the Section 481 Scheme.  My Department was involved centrally in this consultation.  In his budget speech last December, the Minister for Finance, Mr Michael Noonan, T.D., announced that the Section 481 Scheme will be extended to 2020.  An important and significant change will mean that the scheme will operate as a tax credit model from 2016.  This will allow an extended lead-in period to enable the sector to adapt to the change to a tax credit model.  This very good news has been welcomed by the sector.  The extension of this scheme gives a great deal of certainty to the Irish audiovisual sector to the end of this decade and will help to ensure that current jobs in the sector for indigenous crews and actors are maintained. </p><p>  As the Deputies are aware, primary responsibility for the support and promotion of film-making in Ireland, in respect of both the indigenous sector and inward productions, is a matter for the Irish Film Board (IFB).  This agency is funded through my Department and is independent in its day-to-day operations.  As part of its remit, the IFB would have regular meetings with international film makers, as well as attending the major international film festivals to promote Ireland as a location for film making.  I support that effort and, with An Taoiseach, recently met the renowned film director, Mr Stephen Spielberg.</p><p>  The IFB targets for 2013 in terms of audiovisual production activity is for an increase in the value of such activity of over 20 per cent - from &#8364;180m in 2012 to &#8364;220m in 2013.  In tandem with this, the IFB aims to increase employment in the sector from 6,600 full time equivalents (FTEs) to 7,800 (FTEs) &#8211; an increase of 19 per cent.  These are ambitious targets for the audiovisual sector but, combined with the incentives from Section 481, I believe that they can be achieved.</p><p>  Finally, with regard to the growth in the Irish audiovisual sector in the last five years, one simple indicator can be obtained by comparing the number and value of Section 481 (Film Tax Relief Scheme) projects approved between 2008 and 2012.  In 2008, there were 38 projects approved with an Irish spend of &#8364;108m, while, in 2012, there were 52 projects approved with an Irish spend of &#8364;143m - an increase of 36.8% in the number of projects and an increase of 32.4% in the level of Irish spend.</p></reply>

I was impressed by the proposals brought forward by the community group at St Michael's Estate in relation to the surviving buildings from Richmond Barracks.  In the aftermath of the Easter Rising, these buildings were used for the detention of prisoners and the trials of the leaders.  I invited the group to meet with the All-Party Group on Commemorations, which was satisfied to commend the project for any available support.  The centenary commemorative programme does not contain any capital allocation to assist projects and consequently a decision on an application for a grant does not arise at this time.  However, enquiries are being made with the local authority and other agencies to explore how the heritage at Richmond Barracks can be prepared to be presented in the commemorations of the Rising.  </p><p>  The 1913 Lockout will be the subject of a programme of major events, supported by the State and working with partners including Dublin City Council, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the national cultural institutions, universities and VECs and many others.  Details of the programme events are yet to be finalised and will be the subject of announcements as they arise.  The official events will include a formal acknowledgement of the anniversary of the Lockout in August, the issue of special commemorative issue stamps by An Post and special exhibitions by the national cultural institutions.  I welcome the very significant programme of commemorative events being arranged by the trade union movement and I was pleased that it was possible to provide official support for the tapestry project launched by the President in December last.  I will continue to work closely with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on the Lockout programme.</p></reply>

Of the 2,586 applications for compensation under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme received and acknowledged by my Department to date, 766 applicants have expressed an interest in relocation to non-designated bogs.  A total of 2,142 payments and 194 deliveries of turf have been made to date in respect of the applications received. </p><p>  Arrangements for the relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs have been made as regards a group from Clara Bog in County Offaly and a group from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog SACs in County Galway.  These arrangements involve the groups moving to nearby bogs, with the group from Clara Bog having commenced turf cutting at the relocation site in Killeranny, County Offaly, in June last, where 23 qualifying turf cutters have now been accommodated.  Agreement has been reached between my Department and the group of turf cutters from Carrownagappul and Curraghlehanagh Bogs that necessary infrastructure development works will be carried out this year in the relocation site in preparation for turf cutting. The commencement of cutting depends on the ground settling following these works and I understand that cutting will commence here in 2014.  </p><p>  Progress has also been made with a view to the relocation in a similar manner of qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog SAC in County Kildare.  My Department envisages that qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog will be able to commence turf cutting in a relocation site during the forthcoming turf cutting season.  In total, 70 applicants from Carrownagappul Bog, 19 applicants from Curraghlehanagh Bog and 28 applicants from Ballynafagh Bog have expressed an interest in relocation to non-designated bogs.  I am advised that of the remaining 49 raised bog SACs, potential relocation sites have been identified for a further 31 bogs and work is ongoing on identifying and investigating these. Relocation is unlikely to be required, or is likely to be small-scale, for another 15 raised bog SACs due, for example, to the small number of turf cutters that have been active on these sites.</p><p>  The Deputies will appreciate that relocation is a very complex process, in terms of investigating suitable sites for turf quality and quantity, the infrastructure/drainage works required, establishing the number who can be accommodated on the site, the cost and feasibility of land purchase or lease, and possible planning and Environmental Impact Assessment requirements. Accordingly, it will only be possible to bring this process to a conclusion over time in respect of all the relocation sites.  It is not possible to indicate, therefore, when exactly additional turf cutters can be accommodated at any of these sites over and above the specific cases already mentioned.</p><p>  With regard to the issue of applicants being qualified for relocation, the process of assessing applications is being carried forward by officials in my Department.  Deputies will appreciate that assessment and verification of applications is a complex process.  My officials are continuing to work closely with turf cutters, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (as successors of the Land Commission), Bord na M&oacute;na and other organisations to assist people to provide the necessary proof of legal interest with their applications. </p><p>  With regard to persons awaiting payment under previous compensation schemes, I assume that the Question in this regard is referring to applicants from raised bog SACs. Such applicants had been informed that they could, if they wished, transfer from the former voluntary bog purchase scheme to the new compensation scheme established by my Department for those affected by the cessation of turf cutting on raised bog SACs.  This would, of course allow applicants to retain ownership of their land holding or rights, while availing of compensation.  Over 140 applicants have availed of this option to date and I am advised that of the order of 250 further applications remain under consideration in my Department at this time.</p><p>  Overall, given the magnitude of the challenges involved, I am satisfied that the vast majority of active turf cutters are engaging positively with the schemes put in place by the Government to ensure that Ireland meets its obligations to protect these important areas, while ensuring that the needs of turf cutters are met appropriately.</p></reply>

The harbour porpoise is the principal conservation interest of the site, though it also contains small areas of geogenic reef, which are also afforded protection.  Like all species of cetaceaen, the harbour porpoise enjoys strict protection under Article 12 of the Habitats Directive wherever it occurs, whether within or outside a designated area. </p><p>  My Department was consulted in advance of the issuing of the consents referred to in the questions.  Advice was provided to both the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Communication, Energy and Natural Resource on the protection of marine mammals, including the harbour porpoise, and on appropriate mitigation measures that should be employed during the survey.  Where a site is proposed for designation as an SAC, consent authorities are required to consider the implications of proposals on the site, in keeping with Article 6 of the Habitats Directive, before consents are granted. However, I understand that the consents referred to were granted before I notified my intention to designate the Rockabill to Dalkey Island SAC.  Any future consent for exploration, extraction or any other activity within or in the vicinity of the SAC will need to be examined for potential impacts upon it. Consent authorities will need to satisfy themselves that proposed projects do not pose a risk to the integrity of this and other sites before issuing such consents.</p><p>  In preparing proposals for designation, my Department would normally be in contact informally with relevant bodies as part of the process of preparing formal proposals and in preparing the scientific grounds for proposals. My Department had made known for some time it had planned to designate additional marine sites and this would have been known to the Departments referred to in the Questions. Those Departments are now being consulted on the proposed designation, on a formal basis, in accordance with the regulatory framework.</p></reply>

The then Government agreed to cover the full capital costs of the project, which were estimated at that time to be of the order of &euro;35m.  It was always the intention that the Ulster Canal project would be funded from the Waterways Ireland annual allocations, as agreed through the annual estimates processes in this jurisdiction, as well as the deliberations of NSMC in relation to annual budgets. I am advised that it was a key consideration throughout the process that the Ulster Canal project would be supported by a significant level of projected income from the commercialisation of certain Waterways Ireland assets. As the Deputy will be aware, the economic downturn has had a negative impact on those plans. </p><p>  Despite this, the Ulster Canal project is progressing incrementally. I continue to explore all possible options that may assist in the advancement of the project and have established an Inter-Agency group in that regard. I attended the first meeting of that group and look forward to the group continuing its work in the period ahead.  In the meantime, applications for planning permissions for the project have been submitted to the relevant authorities in each jurisdiction and I trust that the Deputy will agree that this is a significant milestone.</p></reply>

I welcome this initiative, which is expected to be one of the biggest tourism events ever to be undertaken in Ireland. It will be a year-long event when people at home and abroad can play a part in the country's recovery, potentially bringing 325,000 visitors to Ireland and providing a major economic stimulus.  </p><p>  The Gathering is a hugely important initiative for our tourism sector, one with which my Department, its agencies and the national cultural institutions which operate under its aegis are very pleased to support and participate in. In that context, officials from my Department have been working closely with colleagues in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and agencies within its remit on cultural, genealogical and heritage tourism matters.  I also see The Gathering as an excellent opportunity to promote our culture, heritage and the traditional arts. Government policy is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, increase access to and participation in the arts, make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life, and maximise the potential for cultural tourism.  </p><p>  A condition in all relevant schemes of support from my Department in 2013 is that of mobilizing support for The Gathering. Primary responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is devolved to the Arts Council, which, under the Arts Acts, is independent in its funding decisions.  While my Department does not have any special arrangements in terms of financial support to be made available for traditional musicians, dancers and artists for the duration of The Gathering, support for artforms is already provided through Exchequer funding to the Arts Council and Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann. </p><p>  In 2013, the Arts Council will receive an allocation of some &euro;60.7 million in current, capital and EU Presidency funding. The Council has many different funding schemes and programmes available to support a wide variety of artistic genre, including specific supports for traditional arts, music and dance.  In addition, my Department will also be allocating funding of almost &euro;1.6 million in 2013 to Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann to help support its important work in maintaining, developing and promoting traditional Irish music and culture. There are over 400 Comhaltas branches throughout Ireland, as well as in the UK, the USA, Australia and other countries.</p></reply>

Directly and through the arts and culture agencies under its aegis, my Department continues to support the designation. For instance, we are supporting the extension of the Other Voices event in Derry in 2013 and we also support Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann who will be holding Fleadh Ceol na h&Eacute;ireann in Derry this year. Furthermore, I'm looking forward to Limerick's term as the City of Culture in 2014, and I know that the organising partnership there will learn much from the Derry experience. </p></reply>

In 2012, my Department provided &#8364;500,000 in grant-aid assistance through a <i>Structures at Risk Fund </i>  administered by local authorities to assist with works to safeguard structures protected under the Planning and Development Acts. This funding assisted in the conservation of two thatched structures. </p><p>  The Heritage Council, which is funded by my Department, grant-aided the restoration of twenty-three thatched structures under their Heritage Management Scheme in 2012.  In addition, the Heritage Council, in partnership with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, also administers a grants scheme to REPS 4 participants on the conservation and repair of traditional farm buildings, known as the Traditional Farm Buildings Grant Scheme. Grants are available under this scheme to carry out approved conservation works to the exterior of farm outbuildings, including roofs. </p><p>  I am advised that the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government also administers a grant scheme for the renewal or repair of thatched roofs of owner occupied houses. The level of funding available in 2013 and future years for these schemes will be subject to the normal Budgetary and Estimates processes but, a s the Deputy can appreciate, the scope for funding for the conservation of the built heritage is constrained by the significant reduction in the public finances.  As part of an Architectural Advice Series, my Department plans to publish an advice book on thatching in 2013, which will include further practical advice and guidance on aspects of conserving and restoring thatched structures. This will be available on my Department&#8217;s website at  .</p></reply>

This development has had the welcome effect of greatly increasing the availability and visibility of Irish in the EU institutions. Notwithstanding the status of the language in the EU, there is, however, a derogation in place for practical reasons which states that the EU institutions are not bound by the obligation to translate all legal texts. This stems from the difficulties in recruiting a sufficient number of qualified personnel to meet requirements in the EU institutions.</p><p>  The original derogation with regard to the use of Irish in the EU institutions applied for 5 years from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2011. This was extended for another 5 years from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2016. Under the terms of the derogation, only EU laws made under the co-decision procedure must be translated into Irish.  The Lisbon Treaty, which came into effect on 1 December 2009, resulted in the co-decision procedure becoming the norm, rather than the exception, for EU law-making. This has resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of EU laws that must be translated into Irish.</p><p>  A decision on whether to extend the derogation for another 5 years must be made by December 2015 at the latest. This matter will be considered by the Government in due course, having regard to the various implications that arise from it. In that context, it is worth noting that the <i>20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030</i>   states: <blockquote><i>&quot;The Government will work to create the circumstances in which a sufficient number of qualified graduates are in place to meet EU requirement needs so that this derogation can be ended during the lifetime of this Strategy.&quot; </i></blockquote>My Department is working with the EU institutions on a continuous basis to ensure that a sufficient number of qualified personnel are employed in the institutions to meet the requirements arising from the status of Irish in the EU. To this end, my Department provides funding under the Advanced Irish Language Skills Initiative<b></b>for a range of specialised third-level Irish language<b></b>  courses in areas such as translation, interpretation and law. In addition, my Department also provides funding to Fiontar in Dublin City University to translate Irish language terms for the EU terminology database, IATE (InterActive Terminology for Europe).</p></reply>

EU sanctions include a range of individual listings as well as restrictions on goods and services, including an oil and arms embargo.   The EU General Affairs Council at the end of November renewed the sanctions package in place against Syria for a period of three months.   A review of these sanctions is now taking place in Brussels at official level and the Foreign Affairs Council on 31 January will discuss the further extension of the EU sanctions package beyond the end of March.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s position remains one of support for the continuation of the EU's sanctions, including the arms embargo.   The sanctions complement the efforts on the political track which are being led by UN/Arab League Joint Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, to bring about an end to the violence and to get some form of political process underway.

The priority of the ESP, and of the organisations it supports, is in assisting the most vulnerable members of overseas Irish communities. These organisations have made a substantive difference to the lives of Irish people living abroad, reducing homelessness, tackling social isolation, and enabling Irish emigrants to access their local statutory entitlements. </p><p>  The total funding allocated in the Estimates for 2012 for the Emigrant Support Programme was &euro;11,595,000, with an outturn of &euro;11,586,368.  Details of all grant recipients since 2006 can be found on my Department's website, a full list of grant recipients and the amount that they received in 2012 is set out in the following table.  I am pleased that despite the difficult financial situation we face, the Government has maintained funding under the ESP at a level of &euro;11,595,000 for 2013. The 2013 grant round is now open and will close on 20 February. No decisions on the allocation for this year's grants will be made until after this date.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is not possible to accurately quantify that part of the debt servicing bill that relates to the borrowing undertaken to recapitalise the banks.<i>  Budget 2013</i>, published last December,<i></i>estimated that National debt cash interest expenditure would amount to approximately &#8364;7.2 billion in 2013.</p><p>  With regard to the amount of Exchequer borrowing over the period 2013-2015, <i>Budget 2013</i>   provides the most recent estimates for the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement.

Those subject to the full restriction, at adjusted incomes of &euro;400,000 or greater will pay an effective income tax rate of 30% in addition to PRSI and levies.  Broadly, the reliefs restricted are the various property based tax incentives and certain other reliefs such as the Employment and Investment Incentive, film relief and the artists&rsquo; exemption. The normal deductible items available to the broad range of taxpayers such as medical expenses, personal tax credits and exemptions such as that for child benefit are not restricted. Similarly, normal business expenses and deductions for capital allowances on plant and machinery, as well as genuine business related trading losses are not restricted.</p><p>  A reliable estimate of the yield to the Exchequer if tax relief on pension contributions was brought within the ambit of the restriction could only be provided by a significant development of the costing model, which would be prohibitive in terms of the resources required. An indicative and very tentative estimate of the full year yield that might arise if contributions to Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) were subjected to the restriction could be of the order of &euro;30 million to &euro;40 million.  With regard to occupational pensions (schemes set up by employers), the figures in respect of employee contributions are available only in aggregate form and do not provide a basis for compiling a corresponding estimate.</p></reply>

However, I have received a number of submissions from, and on behalf of, private coach operators seeking to have this relief extended to them. I will consider these proposals and the level of the rebate in the context of the Finance Bill.  It is worth noting that one of key arguments for introducing a rebate for the haulage industry is the fact that a large quantity of fuel purchased by this industry is purchased abroad thus generating no tax revenue for the State.  A rebate should encourage hauliers to start purchasing their fuel in Ireland thus offsetting some of the costs involved. Such an argument does not exist for the most part for the coach industry.  The fuel rebate scheme proposed is governed by the terms of Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 which limits its application to auto diesel used in defined categories of road vehicles.</p></reply>

Of this number, 10 are on secondment from the NTMA and 10 are Department of Finance employees. The secondment of NTMA employees is not time limited as the NTMA Banking Unit was seconded to my Department for so long as is required by the Department to fulfil its functions in respect of the banking sector. The remaining staff in the SMU are on secondment from AIB. The term of their engagement finishes, on average, in May 2013.  Nine NTMA employees were initially seconded to the SMU in August 2011. Additional secondments since then have been, at my request, to increase the number of staff in the SMU and/or replace staff who resigned from the NTMA.  The costs of the SMU, borne by the Department of Finance in 2012 were &euro;3.6m and the budgeted cost for 2013 is &euro;4.2m.</p></reply>

In my comments to the media following these meetings I made the point that it would be premature to quote any precise figures for possible savings as the details remain to be worked out, but I noted that this proposal could yield significant savings over time which could be in billions rather than in hundreds of millions of euro. </p><p>  As the issue is still under discussion, the details of any extension agreed are not yet known.  The views of all Euro Area and EU Member States, along with those of the EFSF and EFSM, will need to be taken into account.  The savings arising will depend on a number of factors &ndash; the amount of loans for which a maturity extension is agreed, the length of any maturity extension, and the assumption made about the extent to which the EFSF and EFSM borrowings are cheaper than borrowings by Ireland.  As I have already outlined, the level of loans and the length of the maturity remain to be agreed, while the assumption of the interest rate differential is ultimately a matter of judgement.   There is a broad range of possible scenarios in that regard. It is worth noting that at present the differential between 10 year Irish and EFSF and EFSM borrowing costs would be about 2.5%.  I would stress, however, that any scenarios are highly tentative and sensitive to the assumptions concerning the amount of loans covered, the maturity extension granted and the interest differential applied. </p></reply>

By way of information, both the IMF and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) can provide precautionary financial assistance.  </p><p>  The ESM Treaty provides, in Article 14, that the Board of Governors may decide to grant precautionary financial assistance in the form of a precautionary conditioned credit line (PCCL) or in the form of an enhanced conditions credit line (ECCL).  The Treaty also provides for the conditionality, terms and conditions to be attached to such assistance. Further information in relation to these instruments is available on the ESM website at .</p><p>  The IMF has a number of precautionary or stand-by type facilities including Flexible Credit Line (FCL), the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL), the Extended Funding Facility (EFF) and the Stand By Arrangement (SBA).   These different instruments are designed to address different sets of circumstances, and the terms and conditions attaching to them are structured accordingly. Further information on these instruments is available on the IMF website at . </p><p>  At the end of the eighth EU/IMF review mission, in October, I indicated that we would be discussing the measures necessary for a successful exit with the Troika. Discussions with Troika officials on exit options will be part of the ninth review mission, which started yesterday. All relevant options will be considered in the light of what is appropriate for Ireland, including the terms and conditions attaching to them.

I have a limited role in this function.</p><p>  Allied Irish Banks (AIB) informs me that it has sold mortgage portfolios as part of its continuing strategy to meet non-core deleveraging targets set out by the Central Bank of Ireland as part of PLAR 2011 and to assist with viability enhancing measures. Similarly, Bank of Ireland (BOI) has sold loan books in the United Kingdom as part of its non-core deleveraging plan. Neither Permanent TSB (PTSB) nor IBRC have sold mortgage loan books in 2010, 2011 or 2012, however, PTSB have recently sold the rights to a small number of mortgage loan agreements as part of a larger transaction.</p><p>  Any relevant disclosures in respect of these portfolio sales are made in the Annual Financial Reports or via stock exchange announcements. In the case of any transactions where the sale of mortgages occurs, affected borrowers will continue to remain liable for the full amount of their debt. The loan terms and conditions of borrowers whose loans form part of any sale remain unchanged and are not impacted by the transfer of their loans.</p><p>  Deleveraging of the Banking system has progressed well. Deleveraging of &euro;54.9bn has been achieved by AIB, BOI and PTSB from 31 December 2010 to 30 November 2012. The sales prices on portfolio sales may not in all cases have been disclosed by the banks due to commercial sensitivities and confidentiality of information. AIB and BOI where disposals have been concentrated have disclosed that overall cumulative discounts incurred have been within PCAR assumed discounts. From a capital perspective, the loss incurred on the divestment of these assets is broadly offset by a reduction in the level of risk weighted assets. </p><p>  The on-going progress in deleveraging and deposit gathering activities has seen BOI make further progress towards improving its Loan to Deposit (LDR) ratio, reducing from 136% at June 2012 to less than 130% in November 2012. Similarly, AIB&rsquo;s LDR reduced to less than 120% at the end of October (including loans held for sale) from 125% at end of June.</p></reply>

I can  address the second part of the question. In reaching this decision, I paid particular attention to the context of our support not only for the 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 but also to the Education Act, 1998, to the implementation of the Gaeltacht Act 2012, the recommendations in the Literacy and Numeracy for Learning and Life - The National Strategy to Improve Literacy and Numeracy among Children and Young People 2011 - 2020 and to the implementation of the Framework for Junior Cycle which I published last October. </p><p>  I believe that the amalgamation of An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta (COGG) with the NCCA will enhance the capacity of COGG to meet its statutory functions The NCCA has a significant amount of work currently under way or about to be started on the Irish language in our schools. The new arrangement will maximise the possibilities for collaboration and cooperation between both bodies. As the NCCA will prepare curricula for Irish for my consideration, COGG will develop resources that will compliment the curricula and thereby enhance the quality of the teaching and learning of Irish for our students.

A suite of technical guidance documents is available on my Department's website (www.education.ie) to assist design teams in best practice in the design and development of projects and to encourage them to take a complete design team approach from project conception. These documents cover all aspects of the development of a building project for both internal and external works.</p><p>  In the case of existing schools, ensuring the availability of sufficient playground space can be much more difficult particularly in town and city locations.

Approximately 15% of the entire budget of my Department &ndash; some &euro;1.3 billion &ndash; was provided to support children with Special Educational Needs in 2012.  My Departments spend in 2011, was an equivalent percentage of the overall spend, and was also &euro;1.3bn on special needs provision.  The equivalent spend in 2010 was &euro;1.2bn.  It is expected that expenditure in 2013 will be in line with that provided in 2012 and shows that despite the current economic difficulties, the overall level of funding for special education has been retained.</p><p>  The approximate breakdown of the spend between the special needs assistant scheme and the home tuition scheme during 2012 was in the region of &euro;9.5m for Home Tuition support and &euro;355m on special needs assistants respectively.  Given the different supports provided in special schools depending on the disability categorisations of the pupils attending those schools it is difficult to estimate a definitive average cost per pupil of pupils attending special schools.  The approximate cost per pupil attending Special Schools in respect of teaching, Special Needs Assistant and capitation costs is &euro;22,185 per pupil per annum.  Based on a pupil population of approximately 7,000, this gives an estimated annual cost of &euro;155m, of which approximately &euro;60m relates to SNA support.</p><p>  Additional costs relating to school buildings, transport, the July Programme, the National Educational Psychological Society (Neps) the Special Education Support Service (SESS) and assistive technology support also arise and are not included in this figure.  The bulk of spending on special educational needs provides for: 10,575 whole time equivalent (wte) Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts are being provided for primary, post-primary and special schools for the current school year in order to support the care needs of pupils with disabilities.  Approximately 9,950 learning support/resource teacher posts, including those provided under the General Allocation Model, are also being provided in primary &amp; post primary schools in order to provide additional teaching support to pupils with special educational needs.</p><p>  Over 1,100 teachers are also being provided for in special schools providing teaching to pupils with various disabilities at much reduced pupil: teacher ratios, for example the autism PTR is 6:1 and the moderate general learning disability PTR is 8:1.  Enhanced levels of school capitation are payable to most special schools and special classes and special School Transport arrangements for pupils with disabilities are provided at a cost of over &euro;60m per year.  Approximately &euro;1.3m is also provided annually to schools for assistive technology support.  Early educational intervention is provided for children with autism from 2&frac12; years of age.  There are now 76 early intervention classes for children with autism attached to mainstream schools that are funded by the Department. Funding is also provided through the home tuition programme for children with autism who are unable to access placement in an early intervention class.  An extended school year is also currently available for pupils who have either a severe/profound general learning disability or who have autism.</p><p>  The continued commitment of this Government to special education provision, at a time when savings are being required across a range of expenditure areas has ensured that children with special educational needs can continue to have access to educational facilities in line with their requirements.  The level of investment being provided will ensure that provision can continue to be made to provide for the educational requirements of children with special educational needs in mainstream and special schools this year.</p></reply>

In relation to the number of pupils with intellectual disability who are enrolled in primary and post primary schools, I wish to advise the Deputy that all mainstream primary schools have been allocated additional teaching resources under the General Allocation Model (GAM) to cater for children with high incidence special educational needs, including mild and borderline mild general learning difficulties.  It is a matter for school authorities to determine how these hours are utilised to support eligible pupils.  My Department therefore does not hold details of the number of pupils being supported through this mechanism.  It is therefore not possible to identify the total numbers of pupils enrolled in mainstream schools who have some form of intellectual disability.</p><p>  I can advise the Deputy that the NCSE developed estimates on the prevalence of special educational needs as part of its process to advise the Minister on the implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN), Act 2004.  The Council estimated at that time that up to 18% of the school going population may have a special educational need, as defined under the EPSEN Act, while a more recent NCSE Report: A Study of the Prevalence of Special Educational Needs (2011) estimates that this figure may be even higher that 18% of the pupil population.</p></reply>

My Department provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs in order to ensure that, wherever a child is enrolled, s/he will have access to an appropriate education.  Some children may be fully integrated into mainstream schools without additional teaching or care supports.  Others are able to attend mainstream schools but need additional teaching and/or care assistance.  In respect of children who cannot be accommodated in mainstream education, they may be enrolled in special classes or special schools where more intensive and supportive interventions are provided.  Provision is therefore made for children across the continuum of need.  Where children are unable to attend school for a period of time due to medical reasons, or where no school placement is available for a child, home tuition may be provided  for them in order to provide for compensatory education on an interim basis.</p><p>  The National Council for Special Education can also assist parents to identify school placements which can then be resourced to support children with special educational needs.

This advice will guide the preparation of a plan on how aspects of EPSEN can be implemented, including the prioritising of access to children with special needs to an individual education plan.</p><p>  I can advise that this advice will consider:</p><p> - the identification and assessment of children with special needs</p><p> - the nature of supports provided for children</p><p> - the way in which supports are allocated to schools and</p><p> - how these supports are configured.</p><p>  The NCSE has advised my Department that representative groups including parent representatives have been consulted as part of the development of this policy advice.  These representative groups also participate on the NCSE Consultative Forum, which meets regularly to consider policy matters relating to the provision of services for children with special educational needs.  The advice from the NCSE is expected in the coming months.  It is my intention that the significant resources to support children with Special Educational Needs are deployed to ensure the best possible outcomes for students.  The advice will be a key input into achieving this goal.</p></reply>

In this regard, I would refer the Deputy to my recent reply on this issue (PQ 3066/13 - answered 23/01/13).</p><p>  The range of social considerations that could be relevant for procurement includes promoting employment opportunities for young unemployed or long-term unemployed and promoting compliance with core labour standards. In this regard the standard template contracts issued by the National Procurement Service (NPS) in 2012 include provisions requiring compliance by the contractor with employment legislation. The standard public works contracts include provisions to ensure that the rates of pay and the conditions of employment, comply with all applicable law and that those rates and conditions are at least as favourable as those for the relevant category of worker in any registered employment agreements.</p><p>  The inclusion of a social clause in all public procurement contracts requiring that a quota of long-term unemployed be employed in the delivery of the contract poses a number of risks. In the current economic climate, it would be quite likely that where a business is awarded a public contract, in particular a small-scale contract, the work would be carried out by the existing employees of that business. In such circumstances a social clause requiring that a number of long-term unemployed be employed in delivering a public contract could either impose an additional cost on SMEs that they may not be able to afford, or result in the displacement of existing employees. Challenges also arise from the need to ensure that the benefits are capable of being measured and monitored during the performance of the contract and that additional costs are not placed on local suppliers relative to other potential suppliers.</p><p>  The Government has a wide range of measures that it is deploying to facilitate job creation and support labour activation, with particular emphasis on assisting the long term unemployed people.  Obviously, the main purpose of the public procurement process is to ensure that goods, services and works are purchased by the State in a manner that is legal, transparent and of high probity, and our key requirement is the achievement of value for money.  Within this context my Department and the National Procurement Service are in the process of examining the use of social clauses as an additional means of supporting activation. In light of the risks noted above, we are seeking to identify the scope for the use of social clauses in parts of the capital area in particular, where employers are likely to be hiring additional workers to perform the contracts.</p></reply>

The purpose of this Circular is to inform public bodies of the mandatory requirement to utilise central contracts, put in place by the NPS, when procuring a range of commonly acquired goods and services. Such central arrangements are targeted at securing best value for money and facilitating contracting authorities to deliver services within their budgetary constraints.</p><p>  The NPS is focused on developing centralised arrangements for the procurement of goods and services used commonly across the public service nationwide. The benefits arising from these central arrangements include: cash savings; administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; greater purchasing expertise; improved consistency and compliance with EU procurement regulations; and enhanced service levels.  Prior to issuing tenders the NPS engages with its clients to ensure their requirements are met and that the most commonly bought items are included in the tender. Under the provision of Circular 06/12 it is however permissible for buyers to purchase goods and services from non-NPS suppliers if these goods and services are demonstrably cheaper.</p><p>  However, where a public service body purchases such goods or services it will need to explain the rationale for not using the NPS arrangements and provide a value for money justification that takes account of the full costs incurred in managing its own procurement process.  Systems of internal control within public service bodies are to support compliance with the requirements of the circular. Public service bodies shall make available for review if requested by internal auditors, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Local Government Audit Service or other duly appointed auditors, details of internal controls in place to ensure compliance, and details of goods and services, subject to the mandate, acquired other than under mandated NPS central frameworks and the associated value for money justification.</p></reply>

Significant progress has been made on its implementation to date across a range of areas such as shared services, public procurement, external service delivery and eGovernment.  Details of the progress being made in line with the Reform Plan can be found in the Progress Report published last September, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>  The Reform Plan is not just about securing the substantial savings we need to make in order to restore the public finances to a sustainable footing; it is also about maximising new and innovative service delivery channels; leading organising and working in new ways; and placing customer service at the heart of everything we do.  If we do not radically reform the way the Public Service is managed and organised, it is the most vulnerable in our society who will suffer the most.</p><p>  In order to support our determination to restore order to the public finances and to meet our fiscal targets, the Government have indicated that an additional saving of &euro;1 billion in the pay and pensions bill will be necessary in the period to end 2015.  Any measures aimed at achieving overall savings of &euro;1 billion will involve reductions in payroll costs for serving staff as well as significant productivity and workforce reform measures to support the reform programme, in addition to those already achieved under the current Croke Park Agreement.  The Government is committed to seeking agreement with staff representatives on the measures to be introduced to achieve the necessary savings in the Public Service pay and pensions bill. Intensive engagement, facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission, has now commenced between the parties to the discussions and will continue over the coming weeks. </p></reply>

However, IDA Ireland met with the company on a number of occasions in relation to G-LED&rsquo;s proposal and provided advice, but as the company proposed supplying the Irish market solely, it was not eligible for grant aid under the Industrial Development Acts.

I am continuing to work towards this goal with my Department and the agencies in its remit.  The Programme for Government 2011-2016, along with my Department's Statement of Strategy, has the overall goal of promoting and developing Ireland's world-class artistic and creative strengths at home and abroad and of maximising their societal, economic and reputational value for the country. </p><p>  As the Deputy will know, responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is primarily devolved to the Arts Council. Under the Arts Act 2003, the Arts Council is statutorily independent in its day-to-day operations and my Department has no role to play in its executive or funding decisions. The Arts Council is playing an ongoing key role in funding and developing arts events around the country during 2013.  This will ensure that the visitors for The Gathering can experience excellent performances and exhibitions locally.</p><p>  I would also refer the Deputy to my answer in the house earlier today in relation to my Department's role in The Gathering (ref Ref No: 4479/13). The Gathering affords an excellent opportunity to showcase our arts and all of our cultural institutions. My Department and the agencies under the aegis have been working on extensive programmes to support The Gathering for some time. That collaborative and supportive effort is continuing. </p></reply>

The initiative - the <i>Philanthropic Leverage Initiative </i>  - was designed to encourage philanthropic sponsorship and endowment of the arts from private sources. The initiative, established with funding of &#8364;230,000 for 2012, has provided an incentive to arts organisations to proactively seek new funding relationships with sponsors which deliver private sector financial support, thereby increasing overall funding available to the arts. The initiative was available across projects of varying scale, geography and art forms to not-for-profit organisations for arts programming projects. The organisations approved for funding under the initiative were required to procure matching philanthropic funds and complete their drawdown from my Department in 2012. Matched funding could not come from public funds or from any public sector organisation. It was anticipated that a multiple of 3.5 on the pilot initiative funds of &#8364;230,000 will result in philanthropic funding of some &#8364;800,000 being raised for the arts. The initiative proved very successful with a multiplier of 4.26 in philanthropic donations being leveraged for the arts. I am considering a similar scheme in 2013.</p><p>  The Leverage Initiative was run in parallel with a second initiative - the Arts Council's <i>RAISE: Building Fundraising Capacity</i>   pilot initiative. This initiative provides one-to-one professional support to eight selected organisations for two years through planning and implementing a tailored fundraising programme. This initiative will help those art organisations build and resource their capacity to attract philanthropic giving. In developing this complementary programme, the Arts Council has identified that it is vital for art groups to develop, agree and implement an effective fundraising strategy and to properly resource that fundraising function. </p><p>  My Department has also provided support to Business to Arts (a not-for-profit organisation working to support resilience and transformation in the cultural sector through research, innovation and partnership) for a number of years and, in each of the last three years, this has been allocated to delivery of the New Stream Programme, which builds fundraising skills in the cultural sector in Ireland (The Bank of America Merrill Lynch investment in this project is &#8364;400k over three years).</p><p>  In 2010 my Department also awarded a &#8364;20,000 grant under the Cultural Technology Grants Scheme to <i>Business to Arts</i> for the &#8216;<i>Fund it</i>&#8217; initiative. Business to Arts initially matched this figure with private funding and since then has attracted additional foundation funds to this project. <i>Fund it</i> is a new all-island &quot;crowdfunding&quot; website for Ireland&#8217;s creative projects, giving everyone the power to help good ideas happen. '<i>Fund it'</i>   is designed to support greater individual giving to the creative sector; the approach serves to strengthen the bond between a creator and their audience which offers the potential for wider-ranging, long-term relationships.  In late 2012 I also hosted a conference on philanthropy and the arts and a number of follow-on actions arose from that event.</p></reply>

The Presidency provides the opportunity to fully engage with the EU agenda and to rebuild Ireland&#8217;s reputation, both in Europe and internationally.  Given our current economic situation, it is also critical that the Presidency is both cost-effective and well-run.  It is widely recognised that an efficient Presidency will generate positive short-term benefits, but will also influence longer-term perceptions about the State and promote goodwill towards Ireland.</p><p>  In addition to the wide-ranging policy agenda that will be addressed during the Presidency, it is the practice for the country holding the Presidency to mount a programme of cultural events.  The presentation of a Cultural Programme offers a unique opportunity to project a strong image of Ireland to audiences within the EU and beyond.  It also offers a platform to engage with people at home concerning Ireland&#8217;s place in the EU and to review, after 40 years of membership, how we see that relationship further developing.</p><p>  Clearly, given the wealth of our historic cultural engagement with Europe and our contemporary artistic strengths, there are a host of different approaches that could be taken to developing the Programme.  In line with the overall approach to Presidency planning, it is critical, however, that the Programme is run as cost-effectively and efficiently as possible, making best uses of the resources available to us, whilst also showcasing the best of Ireland.</p><p>  Key objectives of Ireland's Culture Programme include the following:</p><p>- To showcase the strength and diversity of Irish culture and enhance further Ireland&#8217;s reputation for cultural excellence.</p><p>- To present a range of Irish events of high quality across a diverse range of art forms to the widest possible audience across the European Union.</p><p>- To complement the overall programme for Ireland&#8217;s EU Presidency.</p><p>- To programme events across three key locations (Brussels/Belgium, Paris, Berlin) and each EU Member State.</p><p>- To engage with European institutions and culture networks to allow for professional development of Irish artists and cultural institutions.</p><p>- To use the EU Presidency Culture Programme as an opportunity to engage with &#8220;third&#8221; countries or key territories outside the European Union.</p><p>- To achieve maximum visibility and impact for the Irish cultural sector and Ireland, in general, through a communications and promotion strategy.</p><p>  Ireland's <i>Culture Connects </i>Programme is a wide and varied programme which involves the engagement of Irish artists in Europe and beyond, as well as European artists in Ireland. It is a key element in Ireland's plans to celebrate our Presidency of the EU in the first six months of 2013. For many centuries Ireland has had strong historic cultural connections to Europe and our Presidency offers an opportunity to celebrate and build on those connections. There is a great diversity in the culture of the Member States of the EU but there is also a common thread which runs through our culture and which allows us to understand each other and to work closely together to achieve our wider aims.</p><p>  Through the many events planned across all Member States, Irish artists will present and highlight the unique quality of Irish culture. It is a culture of which we are proud and which has gained us an international reputation for excellence. This programme includes many high profile artists from Beckett, Bacon and Eileen Gray to Anne Enright, Se&aacute;n Scully and Altan. Irish artists will present work in all Member States, with a special focus on Brussels, Paris and Berlin. A copy of the programme is available in the Oireachtas Library.</p></reply>

It was established to enhance the cultural area shared by Europeans, which is based on a common cultural heritage through the development of cooperation activities<b></b>  among cultural operators from 37 eligible countries. Applications can be made to the various strands of this programme for support for pan-European non-national cultural activities.</p><p>  The EU Culture Programme introduced a dedicated festivals fund called Strand 1.3.6, <i>Support for European Cultural Festivals </i>in 2010. This strand offered funding towards the non-national European programme costs of the successful festivals. West Cork Chamber Music Festival received funding totalling &#8364;300,000 for the 2011, 2012 and 2013 editions of the festival. Cork Midsummer Festival received funding totalling &#8364;200,000 for the 2011 and 2012 editions of their festival.</p><p>  Festivals are also eligible to apply for project funding under Strand 1, co-operation projects. This strand requires a European partnership (with a minimum of between 3 -6 partners) and applicants must demonstrate that their projects achieve common goals beyond national borders. Costs related to marketing and promotion can be included as a line in the project budget.

The experts quantified the likelihood of incidents occurring at Sellafield, and as stated in the public summary, an incident at the Sellafield site resulting in the release of radioactive material would give rise to &quot;no observable health effects in Ireland&quot;.  The report is a valuable input to developing Government policies including National Emergency Planning.  This public summary document is available on my Department's website at<i></i>.</p><p>  In May 2011, shortly after the tsunami that led to the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan, the European Council called for comprehensive and transparent risk and safety assessments - &quot;stress tests&quot; - of all EU nuclear power plants.  The Sellafield site is a waste repository and reprocessing facility and not a nuclear power plant, and thus did not fall within the strict parameters of the EU &quot;stress test&quot; programme.  The criteria developed for the EU stress tests were specifically aimed at, and designed for, power reactors and not for non-power sites such as Sellafield, and therefore only results from these stress tests were subject to the EU peer review process.  However, the UK required the operators of all of their nuclear sites, including non-power sites such as Sellafield, to apply the EU &#8220;stress test&#8221; assessment criteria to their sites.  The results of the assessments were reported to the UK Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR), whose mission is to secure the protection of people and society from the hazards of the nuclear industry.</p><p>  Ireland has on-going engagements with the United Kingdom in relation to radiological matters.  For example, my Department and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland meet regularly with their counterparts from the UK Department of Environment and Climate Change to discuss radiological matters of mutual interest.  I intend to continue to ensure that the UK authorities are kept aware of any concerns held by Ireland, and to take all possible steps to ensure that the highest levels of safety apply at Sellafield, and at other existing and any &#8220;new-build&#8221; nuclear facilities in the UK.</p></reply>

The Committee includes representatives from the Irish Banking Federation, local authorities, the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, NAMA and the construction sector.  Real progress is being made with regard to the public safety works required to improve the living conditions of existing residents on some unfinished estates and the Committee is meeting on a regular basis to oversee this effort.</p><p>  My Department launched the Public Safety Initiative in March 2011, which provided funding to address immediate public safety issues.  The types of works that have been approved to date under the PSI include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting and other works to secure sites.  Under the PSI, my Department has made allocations totalling some &euro;3.879 million to 21 local authorities from the funding made available and to date a total of &euro;2.515 million has been drawn down by local authorities. The Public Safety Initiative provides funding only in instances where a developer has abandoned the development.  However, in circumstances where the developer is merely inactive, the responsibility for the maintenance and resolution of issues surrounding the development are matters which need to be addressed between the developer and the relevant stakeholders, and my Department has no remit in this regard. </p></reply>

There are a number of channels by which any such applications are considered. For example, non-EEA nationals wishing to work in the State must apply for a work permit from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, whereas my Department is responsible for processing applications for Long Term Residency, citizenship, family reunification, EU Treaty Rights and permission to remain in the State of all categories of persons where this is required by law.     </p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate the nature of these categories is such that different processes and criteria are in place which reflect the statutory and other requirements as they arise in the particular circumstances. Inevitably some of the processes will take considerably than others to complete; that of course is the practice in immigration systems the world over.  If the Deputy has a particular area in mind it is open to him to submit a further Parliamentary Question on the matter or alternatively he may wish to contact my office and I will arrange for my officials to provide a written response to his query. </p></reply>

These guidelines provide considerable flexibility in the operation of committees, including with regard to the use of subcommittees and cooperation between JPCs, including town and county committees. In this regard I am aware of the operating arrangements adopted by the JPCs in County Louth which coincide with the three Garda Districts in the Louth Division. </p><p>  The Programme for Government makes a commitment to build on existing community policing partnerships and forums to enhance trust between local communities and their Garda&iacute;.  In the spirit of that commitment I initiated a review of the operation of JPCs and I have published a discussion document to open the matter for wider consultation.  I have made a specific request that each JPC would consider the document at one of its meetings and notify my Department of the outcome of its discussions. I look forward to the outcome of this consultation process and in that context I certainly welcome the Deputy's views on the role and functioning of the JPCs.  The Deputy will also appreciate that the review process will need to take into account the broader developments with respect to local government reform which are underway and the implications of this reform for the operation of JPCs.</p></reply>

A new comprehensive licensing system for property service providers, including letting agents, was established by the Authority with effect from 6 July 2012.

Of these, 416 cases cannot be progressed further until the documentation requested from the relevant applicants has been received while the remaining 368 cases are made up of cases which are at various stages of processing and those cases which have just recently been received and, as such, no detailed examination of the documentation submitted has yet taken place.</p><p>  Given the facts of the Zambrano case, the criteria to be met in each individual case are that each applicant parent must be a third country national who is residing in the State with their Irish born minor citizen child or children, they must be playing a significant role in the upbringing of their Irish born minor citizen child or children and the applicant parent's immigration circumstances must be such that if a decision was taken to refuse him or her a right of residency, the Irish born minor citizen child or children would be at risk of being expelled from the State and, by extension, the EU and, as such, they would not be able to enjoy the substance of their rights as an Irish and EU citizen.</p><p>  Decisions in Zambrano type cases are based on the provisions of national legislation and outside of the criteria referrred to above, discretion is applied as necessary on a case by case basis including cases where serious or persistent criminality is involved.  Following the Zambrano Judgment, I used my discretion to direct my Officials to urgently examine all cases before the courts involving third country national parents of Irish born minor citizen children to see where such cases could be settled based on the principles of the Zambrano Judgment, and without waiting for the High Court to make rulings in each individual case. This approach alone has led to 134 cases being taken off the High Court's Asylum List which provided a substantial dividend for the Court in terms of reducing its workload and also brought legal certainty to the Irish born minor citizen children and the family units involved.</p></reply>

The Bill does not make any provision in relation to the role or status of &quot;legal executives&quot; nor is any such provision envisaged.  It is clear from the correspondence I have received from the Irish Institute of Legal Executives Ltd that the scope of their proposals to confer legal status and a whole range of functions on such a category of persons is extensive and goes beyond those measures to be introduced under the Legal Services Regulation Bill. </p><p>  It is evident that the proposals being made by the Irish Institute of Legal Executives Ltd, on behalf of its members, are far-reaching from the fact that they relate <i>inter alia</i>  to &quot;a right of audience in the District and Circuit Courts, before tribunals and, subject to review, subsequently in all courts&quot;, and to the eligibility of members for quasi-judicial and judicial appointments (e.g as District Court judges or members of Tribunals). These proposals also draw heavily from the  regulatory and practise models of England and Wales which do not always correspond to those of our jurisdiction nor to those set out under current Government policy in the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011. </p><p>  While recognising that there may be additional benefits and efficiencies to be found for consumers and for the legal services sector in a more developed role for &quot;legal executives&quot;, the far-reaching proposals being made on their behalf at this time lie beyond the scope of the Legal Services Regulation Bill impinging, as they do, on aspects of the courts and the judiciary. Such matters will, therefore, need to be considered separately on their own merits, while others may come to be considered in due course by the new  Legal Services Regulatory Authority.</p></reply>

The required duration of the relationship is two years in the case of a person who is the partner of an Irish/EEA national and  four years where the partners are both non EEA nationals.  A de-facto partner of an Irish citizen or of an EU national who is exercising rights of free movement and who meets the eligibility criteria as to duration of relationship receives an immigration permission that allows them to work without requiring an employment permit.</p><p>  Where both parties are non-EEA nationals the immigration permission granted to the partner of the person already lawfully in the State, is that of dependent with an immigration stamp 3.  This status does not exempt them from the requirement to hold an employment permit but they would be able to obtain one if they meet the conditions set out by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  There is a balance to be struck between facilitating the de facto family to live together while also ensuring that immigration of this nature is not used  as a means of circumventing immigration law requirements, or  labour market law and public policy in this area.</p></reply>

The removal of illegal immigrants from the State is a necessary feature of the enforcement of immigration legislation with the purpose of upholding the integrity of the immigration system.

The Bill provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the introduction of a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection and any other grounds presented by applicants seeking to remain in the State. This change of the processing framework will remove the current multi-layered and sequential processes associated with the existing system.</p><p>  As I have outlined previously to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence, several hundred amendments to the Bill are anticipated, the majority of a technical nature. On that occasion, I also expressed the considered view that instead of engaging in an extremely cumbersome process of tabling hundreds of amendments to the 2010 Bill it would be much more efficient to publish a new and enhanced text.  Such an approach can incorporate the many anticipated amendments while addressing key outstanding issues, several of which have been of concern to Members, including that of a streamlined, single application procedure. This proposition was broadly welcomed by the Joint Committee. Work on the Bill continues, therefore, on that basis, including in cooperation with the Offices of Parliamentary Counsel and of the Attorney General while also taking account of any relevant rulings by the Courts. It remains my objective under this new approach, and mindful of our having to deal with the competing legislative demands of our EU/IMF/ECB Programme commitments, to be in a position to bring a revised Bill to Government for approval and publication later this year.</p></reply>

Following investigation by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, it was established that the person concerned had previously lodged an application for asylum in Italy, on 26th March, 2003.  Arising from his previous asylum history in Italy, and in accordance with the provisions of the Dublin II Regulations, a determination was made that the person concerned should be transferred to Italy for the purposes of having his asylum application examined there. Consequently, a Transfer Order was made in respect of the person concerned. This Order was formally served on the person concerned, by letter dated 10th March, 2008, which placed a legal obligation on him to 'present' himself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), on Thursday 13th March,  2008, to make arrangements for his formal transfer to Italy. The person concerned failed to 'present' on this occasion and was therefore classified as having 'evaded' his transfer. This position continued to obtain with the consequence that the Transfer Order eventually expired and Ireland then became responsible for examining the asylum claim.</p><p>  The asylum claim of the person concerned was examined by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, both of whom concluded that the person concerned did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee. Arising from the formal refusal of his asylum claim, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 14th September, 2010, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him. He was also notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006. </p><p>  The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.  In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  At that point, all representations submitted by and on behalf of the person concerned, including the information included with the Deputy's Question, will be considered before a final decision is made. Once a decision has been made, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned. </p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that issues relating to educational supports are the responsibility of the Minister for Education and Skills and the agencies operating under the aegis of his Department. I, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, have no function in such matters.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The Equitation School has discharged this task with considerable distinction down through the years and, through its participation and numerous successes in equitation events at home and abroad, it has successfully promoted the qualities of the Irish horse.  Army riders competing on Irish bred horses provide an instantly recognisable symbol of Ireland at prestigious international events.</p><p>  In addition to its competition activity, the Equitation School continues to support the Irish horse industry and it encourages breeders and producers, who may have horses suitable for top-level competition, to have them assessed by the School with a view to their purchase or lease. The annual running cost of the Army Equitation School in 2012 (excluding salaries) was &euro;908,478.  Salaries accounted for a further &euro;1.35 million approximately. The allocation to run the Equitation School (excluding salaries) has been reduced to &euro;860,000 in 2013.  A new horse transport vehicle was recently purchased for the Equitation School at a once-off cost of &euro;213,359 (inclusive of VAT).  </p><p>  The total prize money won by the Equitation School at national and international events in 2012 amounted to &euro;73,835.  Under agreed arrangements, fifty percent of the prize money won is awarded to participating Army Riders.  I believe that the Army Equitation School is an important and emblematic feature of the Defence Forces and that it plays an important role in the promotion of Irish horses and the Irish horse industry.</p></reply>

The Marine Institute is responsible for monitoring shellfish for the presence of naturally occurring phytoplankton toxins. Toxicity can occur at any time during the year and the periods of closure can vary considerably from year-to-year. The monitoring programme is designed to detect toxicity in shellfish growing areas before harvesting, thereby providing the necessary information to restrict the placement of toxic shellfish on the market. Regulatory controls, which are enforced by the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, exist to support these restrictions. </p><p>  Cromane Bay has been on a closed biotoxin status on an almost continuous basis since July 2012 for azaspiracid toxins, with levels of azaspiracids detected occasionally up to 9 times the regulatory limit. Azaspiracid shellfish poisoning can cause diarrhoea, nausea, headaches and chills.  I am advised that the azaspiracid toxicity event is expected to pass in the near future.  I am aware of the difficulties that these naturally occurring toxicity events cause for shellfish fishermen and aquaculture operators.  I understand that mussel farmers in Cromane have been unable to bring their product to market because of this toxicity event, but the State controls are there to protect public health and indeed the international reputation of Irish seafood thereby ensuring the future of this important sector.  </p><p>  While there are no specific funds available for operators affected by these natural occurring events, which are an inevitable occasional feature of operating aquaculture farms in Irish coastal waters, a range of financial support measures co-funded by the European Fisheries Fund are available to the seafood sector through the Seafood Development Operational Programme 2007-2013. </p></reply>

However, there was a recognition at the time of the difficulties of regulating the childminding sector, given its scale and the strong view that women should not be subject to regulation if they minded a small number of additional children.  As a result, the majority of childminders are exempt from the Regulations currently in place.</p><p>  The 2000 Expert Working Group on Childcare set out a plan for integrating the various strands of child care and education, including childminding.  It made a number of recommendations aimed at overcoming the barriers preventing childminders from moving into the formal economy, most of which have been implemented.  These included the introduction of a system for voluntary notification of childminders, and the introduction of Childcare Services Relief, which allows a voluntarily-notified childminder to mind up to three children without paying tax on the earnings and to make a PRSI contribution.</p><p>  In 2002, the Health Service Executive (HSE) agreed to fund a Childminding Advisory Officer post in each county, who would work with the 33 City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) funded under the Childcare Programme, implemented by the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The role included notifying childminders of training opportunities, providing networking opportunities and supporting the voluntary notification system which was being developed by the CCCs.  While Childminding Advisory Officers were established in most county areas, this was not always the case and they were not always located with the local CCC.  Despite their presence and the additional supports including training, a small capital grant scheme and the introduction of a tax relief for childminding in 2006, the increase in the number of voluntarily-notified childminders since 2004, when the number was 500, has been relatively small and levelled off at 1,250.</p><p>  In recent years, HSE funding for the Childminding Advisory Officer posts has gradually decreased, and is no longer in place in some areas.  I understand that this is due to pressure on HSE resources and the need to prioritise funding to other areas of front-line services.  While this is not a welcome development, I would point to the fact that the CCCs are now well-established and effective bodies at local level, and that supporting the childminding sector is an integral part of their work.  As a result, childminders continue to have access to support, training and advice.</p><p>  My Department provides annual funding to each CCC to enable them to support and advise all childcare providers at local level.  In 2012, the total amount allocated to the CCCs was &euro;11.3m.  In addition, in 2012 my Department provided &euro;220,000 to the CCCs for Childminding Development Grants.  My Department also provides annual funding, totalling &euro;2.85m in 2012, to seven National Voluntary Childcare Organisations to provide support at a local level to their members.  This included &euro;358,000 for Childminding Ireland, the representative body for childminders.</p><p>  In 2007, the then Office of the Minister for Children published National Guidelines for Childminders which had been developed by its National Childcare Co-ordinating Committee.  The Guidelines provide information to childminders on whether they are subject to the Child Care Regulations, the voluntary notification system, the tax relief for childminders, as well as guidance on good practice and other useful information on the role of the childminder in the provision of childcare services.</p><p>  My Department has commenced work on Ireland's first Early Years Strategy.  I have received Government approval for the approach I am taking in developing this Strategy as an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of our Early Years sector, aimed at providing a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from bith to the age of six.  One of the policy issues which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the Early Years Strategy is the development of the childminding sector as a fully-integrated component of early childhood care and education, in particular for the under-one age group.</p><p>  Under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No 2) Regulations 2006, services providing care for children who have not yet commenced primary school are required to notify their service to the Pre-School Inspectorate of the HSE, and are subject to inspection and report by the Inspectorate on a regular basis.  Services covered by the Regulations include full-time, part-time and sessional services, as well as childminders taking care of more than three pre-school children from different families in the childminder's home.</p><p>  Childminders taking care of not more than three pre-school children from different families are not covered by the Regulations.  Decisions on how best to regulate and support the childminding sector will continue to form part of the ongoing work on the Early Years Strategy.</p></reply>

Building on work already undertaken by the HSE, the NTPF has now taken over the reporting of outpatient waiting time data.  The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format will reveal the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals.  In the first instance, this will allow the SDU and NTPF to target their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  A maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment by 30 November 2013.</p><p>  In parallel with reducing the numbers of longest waiters, the SDU will also work with the HSE Clinical Programmes to reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time.  Should the patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved.

The employment of graduates in a specific graduate scheme is a widespread practice in other sectors of the economy.  The salary level was set having regard to the norms for such programmes and the need to achieve significant savings on nurse agency and overtime expenditure.  The scheme was agreed on the basis that significant savings would arise.</p><p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has also agreed that participants in this initiative will not be counted for the purposes of the Health Sector Employment Ceiling.  The initiative therefore provides a valuable opportunity for a substantial number of recently-qualified nurses and midwives to work in Ireland at a time when job opportunities in the public service are, regrettably, very limited.  The initiative will enable them to gain valuable work experience and development opportunities post-graduation.  Given the requirement to achieve reductions in staff numbers in the health sector and to maximise savings, it is not possible at present, other than in very limited circumstances, to offer employment positions.</p></reply>

The Report was conducted in two stages. The first stage is an independent academic research report, which is based on an analysis of published medical reports and research. The draft report contains information about how frequently symphysiotomy was carried out in Ireland and compares rates with other countries.  The researcher experienced unforeseen difficulties in accessing information sources and as a result, submitted the first stage of the report behind schedule in late January 2012. The researcher informed my Department that this was due primarily to the challenges with accessing historical data from a time when records on the procedure were not routinely kept. The second stage in the research process, involved a consultation process on the draft report involving patient groups, health professionals and in particular the women who have undergone symphysiotomy.  The researcher is currently finalising the report based on the consultation and it is also planned to have a peer review process. It is hoped that the report will be published early in 2013.</p></reply>

The matter of social clauses in public contracts is being examined by the Minister Public Expenditure and Reform and his Department.  </p><p>  Social clauses can be used in public procurement in cases where they are targeted at factoring into the procurement process consideration of social issues such as employment opportunities, equal opportunities and social inclusion.  In 2010, the European Commission issued guidance that identified a range of social considerations that could be relevant for procurement including promoting employment opportunities for young unemployed or long-term unemployed and promoting compliance with core labour standards.  This guidance stressed that when incorporating social considerations into the procurement process one of the key challenges is ensuring compliance with the EU Treaty Principles and the Procurement Directives.  However, challenges arise from the need to ensure that: value for money is not adversely affected; additional costs are not placed on domestic suppliers relative to other potential suppliers; and the targeted benefit is capable of being measured and monitored during execution of the contract. The main purpose of the public procurement process is to ensure that goods, services and works are purchased by the State in a manner that is legal, transparent and of high probity, and our key requirement is the achievement of value for money.  </p><p>   I support the deliberations of the Minister Public Expenditure and Reform and his Department.  The outcome of these deliberations will, where appropriate, be reflected in construction tenders.</p></reply>

The registered provider must ensure that there is an individual care plan for each resident and that this is formally reviewed and updated with each resident in accordance with the resident&rsquo;s changing needs and circumstances. </p><p>  Decisions about do not resuscitate (DNR) orders relate to a complex medical intervention, namely cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Therefore, providing guidance as opposed to specific legislation would represent a better approach to governing the use of DNR orders. Guidelines would allow for greater flexibility to ensure that decisions relating to DNR orders are made on the basis of an individual assessment of each case.  With this in mind, the HSE&rsquo;s National Consent Advisory Group has developed a specific policy for DNR orders as part of its National Consent Policy. The HSE&rsquo;s National Director of Quality and Patient Safety has approved the policy and it will be submitted to the senior management team in the coming weeks, after which it will be disseminated for implementation.</p></reply>

No. 494 of 2004 European Communities (Organisation of Working Time) (Activities of Doctors in Training) Regulations 2004, which transposed the EU Working Time Directive for doctors in training (junior doctors), provides for:</p><p> - A maximum 48 hour average working week;</p><p> - A 30 minute rest break every 6 hours during period on-site on-call;</p><p> - 11 hours rest every 24 hours or equivalent compensatory rest before return to work; and</p><p> - 35 hours continuous rest per week or twice a fortnight or 59 hours continuous rest per fortnight.</p><p>  The 2010 Contract of Employment for junior doctors reflects these provisions.  The contract also provides that junior doctors shall not be required to work more than 24 consecutive hours on-site.  A related agreement between the HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation provides that the contract is subject to the requirements of the Directive.</p><p>  The Government is committed to achieving compliance with the European Working Time Directive in respect of junior doctors by 2014 and I have emphasised to the HSE the high priority the Government and I attach to this issue.  While there has been a significant reduction in the weekly hours worked by junior doctors in recent years, typically they continue to work approximately 55 hours per week.  Further work is therefore required to achieve compliance with the requirements of the Directive. </p><p>  In January 2012, a detailed plan for the achievement of compliance by junior doctors with the Working Time Directive was submitted to the EU Commission.  The plan affirmed Ireland's commitment to achieving compliance with the Directive over a three-year time period.  It committed to implementing the measures necessary, including: new work patterns for medical staff, transfer of work undertaken by junior doctors to other grades, and the organisation of hospital services to support compliance.  The Health Service Executive&rsquo;s Service Plan for 2013 specifically recognises the need to address the issue as a priority, stating that there will be a particular focus in the acute hospital service on the achievement of compliance with the European Working Time Directive amongst the junior doctor workforce, in line with the Implementation Plan submitted to the Commission. The HSE is currently finalising its National Operational Plan to support the implementation of the National Service Plan 2013. This will specify in greater detail the actions to be taken during the year in relation to EWTD compliance. A key priority for the HSE in 2013 will be a further reduction of average weekly hours worked and also a reduction in the duration of shifts undertaken.</p></reply>

The new children&rsquo;s hospital is a key commitment in the Programme for Government and the largest project within the current Capital Plan.  This Government regards the building of the hospital as a priority and no effort will be spared in expediting its completion.  Following the Government decision on the location, my first priority has been to address the necessary project management structures and governance arrangements to enable the delivery of the capital  project as quickly as possible and to the highest quality.  The scale, complexity and vital importance of this project means we must get this element right now, and I have therefore given this detailed consideration and intend to bring proposals to Government shortly. </p><p>  Pending the implementation of revised project management and governance arrangements, work is continuing on the project through the existing mechanisms, including the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board. The terms of office of most members of the Board having expired on 5 December, I have appointed senior representatives from my Department and the HSE as an interim measure aimed at ensuring effective governance and decision-making for the project to ensure that work continues without delay during this transitional phase. </p><p>  The Dolphin report concluded that the existing plan for the Ambulatory and Urgent Care Centre in Tallaght would need to be revisited in light of a decision about the location. It is envisaged that there will be an urgent care centre or urgent care centres based on consideration of the geographical distribution of attendances and acuity of the patient. Following the Government's decision to locate the new hospital on the St James's campus, a review is now underway on the location and number of urgent care centres, which is expected to be complete in the coming weeks.  Preliminary work in relation to the site and site preparation is ongoing, and immediate next steps will include the termination of existing contracts, following legal advice, followed by new procurement processes which will be fully compliant with statutory periods. In this regard, I welcome the fact that a significant proportion of the work that was done for the project on the Mater site, including the internal configuration and adjacencies, will be transferable to the new site, although clearly a new design for the new site is required. </p><p>  In regard to the timelines, the estimation of the various stages of the project require to be developed, reviewed and validated and, once established, will be kept under scrutiny with strong and proactive project management. This Government regards the building of the new children's hospital as a key priority and no effort will be spared in expediting its completion.</p></reply>

This has the effect of placing all State funded local and rural transport services in a broader transport context.  I also established a high level committee of key stakeholders, the National Integrated Rural Transport Committee,  chaired by the NTA, to oversee a more focussed and coherent approach to transport integration with a view to eliminating service duplication, better targeting of services at those with greatest need and the rationalisation of administrative structures.</p><p>  A Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP published in early 2012 made recommendations to achieve greater efficiencies, deliver value for money for the Exchequer and to ensure the on-going sustainability of the Programme. In this regard the NTA is currently  devising an optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective which  will shortly be submitted to me for consideration.</p></reply>

The report  on the public consultation process is available on the NTA's website. The NTA has also briefed the Cabinet Sub-Committee on the process in October 2012.</p><p>  The public consultation submissions will be considered and taken into account  by the NTA  in coming forward with proposals. Where the NTA proposes to enter into a further direct award contract or contracts for bus services it is obliged to carry out a statutory consultation under section 52 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008. Furthermore, the NTA may only enter into a direct award contract &ldquo; where it is satisfied that the continued adequacy of the public bus passenger services to which the contracts relate can only be guaranteed in the general economic interest by entering into such direct award contracts.&quot;  Accordingly the matter will require further examination before any decisions are taken.</p></reply>

In addition, the application did not satisfy the requirements in respect of planning permission for all aspects of the project.  A letter setting out the reasons why the application was deemed invalid has been sent to the club contact.</p></reply>
