No. 418/2011 Finance (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order 2011.  The powers in relation to State property generally are set out in Sections 9, 10 and 11 of the State Property Act, 1954.  The powers in that Act relate to vesting, management and disposal of State land, but not purchase of land which is dealt with under the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  These powers and functions are further elaborated in guidelines contained in Public Financial Procedures and the Guidelines for State Bodies.  Practice may also be affected by specific legal provisions in particular areas, such as the legislation that governs NAMA which, of course, is mainly engaged in disposing of loans, and that governing local authorities.  </p><p>  Bearing in mind the guiding principle to maximise the benefit to the taxpayers, the general approach to the management of assets, including property, held by the State and its agencies is that it is the responsibility of each agency to optimise value.  Public Financial Procedures and the Guidelines for State Bodies impose requirements which should result in agencies having accurate, reviewable records of their property holdings and valuations.  Together with having information about their property requirements and the management of their properties, they should be in a position to dispose of assets they judge to be surplus to their requirements in a manner that maximises public utility; in the vast majority of cases, this means for the best price achievable.   </p><p>  The general rule set out in Public Financial Procedures is that Departments are required to have asset management systems in place (Section B1.2 paragraphs 22-25) which ensure that assets are acquired only when needed, are adequately controlled and maintained, are properly safeguarded and disposed of, and that utilisation is monitored. The 1994 Guidelines on Public Procurement, or Green Book, at paragraph 1.2 states that the disposal or letting of property should be dealt with by competitive tendering or by auction in order to ensure that disposals are both transparent and likely to achieve a fair price. </p><p>  This approach is also reflected in the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.</p><p>  &quot;It should be standard practice that the disposal of assets of State bodiesor the granting of access to property or infrastructure for commercialarrangements e.g. joint ventures with third parties, with an anticipatedvalue at or above a threshold level of &euro;70,000, should be by auction orcompetitive tendering process, other than in exceptional circumstances(such as a sale to a charitable body). The method used should be bothtransparent and likely to achieve a fair market-related price.&quot;  (Paragraph 5.1)</p><p>  The Code also states:&quot;The Board should have a formal schedule of matters specifically reservedto it for decision to ensure that the direction and control of the body isfirmly in its hands (some of these matters may require Ministerialapproval and this should be noted). This schedule should include, atleast, the following:significant acquisitions, disposals and retirement of assets of theState body or its subsidiaries. The schedule should specify clearquantitative thresholds for contracts above which their approval isrequired&quot;;</p><p>  A range of measures to improve property management in the public service is set out inAccommodating Change   Measuring Success, the Government's Property Asset Management Plan published in July 2013.  Within this overall context, further work on standardising the detailed approach to management of property disposals aimed at further improving outcomes is currently underway under the auspices of the Steering Group on Property Asset Management, led by the Office of Public Works.</p></reply>

In this regard my Department has devolved responsibility for the implementation of Irish Language Training and Irish Language Proficiency Testing to the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht while maintaining its overall policy role within the civil service. A Service Level Agreement between the two Departments was signed in 2013 to give effect to this policy initiative.</p><p>  Additionally as the Official Languages Act has adopted the  language scheme as a core instrument by which bilingual services are to be provided my Department has prepared a draft Irish Language Scheme which is currently with the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht for approval. On receipt of the necessary approval from the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht officials in my Department will finalise and publish on my Departments website our completed Irish Language Scheme.</p></reply>

Ministers, Government officials from European countries participating in the OGP, representatives of civil society and non-governmental organisations, representatives of international and regional organisations, the business community, and the academic community will be invited to attend. Officials and civil society representatives from European countries not yet participating in the OGP will also be encouraged to attend. The event will be open to the media. </p><p>  The Government's decision to seek membership of the OGP was based on the assessment that the aims of the OGP strongly reinforced and complemented the Government's commitment to wide-ranging political reform reflected in the Programme for Government.  The continuing development of an open, transparent, accountable and ethical system of public administration consistent with the goals and objectives of the OGP is clearly integral to the ongoing process of rebuilding trust in government and in public institutions and underpinning national recovery.  </p><p>  Ireland's membership of the OGP is expected to reap significant economic and social benefits.  Hosting this conference will give added impetus to the work being done in developing an OGP National Action Plan to progress Ireland's OGP membership. It will provide an opportunity to demonstrate Ireland's commitment to Open Government, to raise visibility of the reforms currently being advanced, and to improve our reputation internationally as a result.  It will allow the sharing of knowledge of OGP initiatives that worked well, lessons learned and best practice between OGP participating countries and civil society.  Participants will share experiences from their respective countries and provide real examples of how, for example, openness can improve public services, drive economic growth and restore public faith in government.  The conference will also, of course, benefit the local economy in terms of business for hotels, catering and tourism potential.  </p><p>  A Planning Committee has been set up comprising officials from my Department, Local Government and civil society representatives and preparations for the conference are well underway.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-26a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022600065#WRA01600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 37 together.</p><p>  The Office of Public Works is currently undertaking the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme, in partnership with its technical consultants, local authorities and other key stakeholders. This is a strategic and fully co-ordinated approach that recognises the need, in line with international best practice, to move to a more sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems.</p><p>  The Programme which is focused on 300 areas of potentially significant risk, lies at the core of the assessment of flood risk and the long-term planning of the flood risk management measures throughout the country, including capital structural and non-structural measures.</p><p>  The CFRAM Studies are comprehensive catchment-based studies through which, following public consultation, detailed flood maps are produced and flood risk management measures are assessed and taken to outline design. These measures will be prioritised and set out in a Flood Risk Management Plan.</p><p>  The CFRAM Programme will be used to determine national priorities for State investment in flood defences, on a systematic and objective basis using Multi-Criteria Analysis. More information on the Programme is available on   .</p><p>  Flood risk from coastal erosion is also integrated into and being assessed under the CFRAM Programme. 90 of the 300 areas of significant flood risk are in coastal areas.  Coastal erosion is a natural and ongoing process and has beneficial as well as detrimental effects.  It is a complex issue and requires to be addressed in a holistic manner to ensure that the best possible approach is adopted in each particular instance. Structural intervention is not always the best option and in some cases it can be difficult to justify such intervention on economic and/or environmental grounds. </p><p>  There is a strategy in place to deal with coastal erosion.  The primary objective of policy on coastal protection is to ensure that in areas identified as being at greatest risk of damage or loss to economic assets through coastal erosion or flooding, appropriate and sustainable measures are identified by Local Authorities to protect those assets and, where intervention measures are economically justified on cost benefit grounds and compatible with all required environmental and other statutory requirements, these are implemented subject to the availability of resources.</p><p>  The Irish Coastal Protection Strategy Study (ICPSS) has surveyed and assessed the coastal erosion risk along the entire national coastline and this information will be available shortly to all Local Authorities to enable them to develop appropriate plans and strategies for the sustainable management of the coastline in their counties including the identification, prioritisation and, subject to the availability of resources, the implementation of coastal protection works both of a structural and non-structural nature as appropriate.</p><p>  In some cases a &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; or &ldquo;no activation&rdquo; intervention approach might be the most appropriate management response, and international studies have borne this out.</p><p>  In the context of the damage done in the recent storms, I have made it clear that it is never going to be possible to protect all of the vulnerable areas of Irish coastline. This is why it is essential that a comprehensive risk based approach to coastal protection is followed.  The Office of Public Works wrote on 10<sup>th</sup> January of this year to City and County Managers in coastal areas indicating that it will accept applications under this Scheme for funding to assist with repairs to built flood defences and coastal protection structures which have been damaged by the recent storms.  This is a once-off measure to reinstate built coastal defences to their pre storm condition.  The specific application form for this entitled <i>Coastal Storm Damage Flooding Questionnaire 2014</i>   is available on OPW's website www.opw.ie under Flood Risk Management.</p><p>  The Government decided on 11 February to make funding of up to &euro;70 million available to assist local authorities with the repair and remediation of damaged public infrastructure. Of this total, an amount of up to &euro;20 million may be made available to assist with the cost of repairing damaged coastal protection infrastructure.</p></reply>

The CFRAM Study is being conducted by Jacobs Engineering on behalf of the OPW and I am advised that good progress is being made on the project.</p><p>  A total of 66 locations along the Shannon have been identified for further assessment under the Study. The output of this important project will be an integrated plan of specific measures to address, in a comprehensive and sustainable way, the significant flood risk factors in the Shannon basin, including the Callows area.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, operational control of water flows and levels on the Shannon is the responsibility of both the ESB and Waterways Ireland.  In order to address ongoing concerns that the existing water level control regime may be a contributory factor in early Summer flooding in the Callows, the OPW facilitated discussions between these principal operating stakeholders toward agreeing a new interim control regime on the regulation of levels.  Under this interim regime the ESB agreed to a trial lowering of the Spring/early Summer target levels in Lough Ree to reduce somewhat the risk of summer flooding, particularly in the Shannon Callows area.  This trial commenced in Summer 2013 and will remain in place until the publication of the Shannon CFRAM Plan.</p><p>  On foot of discussions between my colleague, Minister of State Tom Hayes and the IFA and with the cooperation of both the ESB and Waterways Ireland, a water level monitoring exercise is being carried out as part of the CFRAM process which will allow for analysis of water flows and levels at key points around the Lough Ree and Callows areas.  Interim data from this exercise has been collated and the results have been forwarded to the CFRAM consultants.  This data will feed into the overall Shannon CFRAM study. The interim data is available on  and on . The OPW will continue to review the above process on a regular basis in consultation with the ESB and Waterways Ireland.</p><p>  The Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht report on Shannon flooding dealt with and included recommendations on a number of issues within the areas of responsibilities of a range of Government Departments and State Bodies.  The OPW responded to the Committee, by way of a written reply in September 2012, in relation to the specific matters within the OPW's area of responsibility. The main area addressed in the reply related to the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) programme and how the OPW is addressing flood risk on the River Shannon in the context of the CFRAM Programme.</p><p>  The Committee Report was forwarded to our technical consultants for consideration in the context of the Shannon CFRAM Study.  The Committee received a briefing in late 2012 on the Shannon Levels Operations Report.</p></reply>

The Medium Term Expenditure Framework, with three year ceilings for Ministerial Vote Groups, has been placed on a statutory footing with the enactment of the Minister and Secretaries Amendment Act 2013. This provides greater clarity and certainty about expenditure allocations and allows for structural, medium-term planning and prioritisation within each area.  My Department is in regular communication with all Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being controlled and we monitor their drawdown of funds from the Exchequer against the published expenditure profiles. The expenditure profiles for 2014 will be published this month. Where necessary, my Department meets regularly with line Departments to review financial management and the extent to which expenditure remains in line with projections.  There is regular reporting to Government on these matters, and we publish information monthly as part of the Exchequer Statement.</p><p>  On 14 January, my Department published a new Public Service Reform Plan, covering the period 2014 to 2016. The new Reform Plan includes more than 200 actions, with clear time lines for delivery.  The implementation of the new Reform Plan, alongside the measures introduced to enhance expenditure management, will enable this Government build a new Public Service that is focused on protecting and improving public services while remaining within the Government's overall expenditure targets.</p></reply>

It is open to all members of the public regardless of gender, political affiliations or location to apply for appointment to these vacancies.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the new arrangements introduced by the Government in 2011 have significantly improved transparency in the making of appointments to State Boards compared with the making of appointments in previous years.</p><p>  Since the formation of this Government 22 members have been nominated to State Boards under my remit, 23% of which being female.  In view of the statutory procedures for the appointment of members of the Civil Service Arbitration Board and the Public Appointments Service, there is limited scope for me to take a factor such as gender into account when I make such appointments. </p><p>  I would like to make it clear that it is my intention in the limited number of appointments I have to make to increase the number of women appointees over the lifetime of the Government.

The initial scoping phase of the project has already been completed and it is estimated that sustainable savings in the region of &euro;14.6 million, or over 30%, per annum could be achieved once a shared services solution has been fully implemented.  A Financial Management Shared Services Centre would allow transactional activities such as invoice processing to be managed in a streamlined way.  It would also reduce the number of processing centres from twenty down to three.  Estimations of expected staff savings will be validated during this phase of the Project.</p><p>  I expect to return to Government seeking approval to proceed to implementation of the Financial Management Shared Services within the next year.  Work is underway to record the savings in the costs of HR associated with the reduction in staffing required to deliver HR and Pensions services to the Civil Service and to capture the non-financial benefits associated with PeoplePoint.  A consistent approach will be taken to the measurement of benefits across all Shared Services projects.</p></reply>

Sustainable public finances are a pre-requisite for economic stability and growth. This Government has therefore pursued a determined deficit reduction strategy.  We are committed to reaching the 3% of GDP target for the General Government Deficit by the target date of end-2015.  This is a challenging target and one that is set against a difficult economic background which has required fiscal corrections in the form of significant consolidation to voted expenditure.  The consolidation measures introduced by this Government have ensured Ireland's successful exit from the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland.  To fully appreciate the scale of the consolidation it must be noted that it has been achieved in the context of increasing demands on public services in particular in the areas of Social Protection, Health and Education.  </p><p>  In order to ensure effective prioritisation of public expenditure, this Government committed to examining all areas of public spending. In 2011, the first Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE) was undertaken and the Comprehensive Expenditure Report was published on 5 December 2011.  This document set out three year current expenditure ceilings on an administrative basis for all Departments from 2012-2014.  The Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2013, enacted in July 2013, put the arrangements for these three year expenditure ceilings on a statutory basis.  </p><p>  Changes introduced in relation to the annual estimates process should facilitate more effective financial scrutiny by the Oireachtas Select Committees. Performance budgeting  has now been rolled out for all Departments and provides information about the services being purchased with public money and the impacts of these services for society in general. </p><p>  The Government is committed to making fundamental changes to the way the public service operates to safeguard the delivery of essential services while obtaining value for money for the citizen.  Critical to this are the second phase of  the Public Service Reform Plan which I launched earlier this year allied with the Haddington Road Agreement, both of which are delivering important workplace efficiencies and enhanced productivity.  </p><p>  I established a  new Office of Government Procurement to centralise the procurement of common goods and services across the public service and achieve targeted savings of up to &euro;500m over a three year period,  of which  &euro;127m savings is targeted in 2014.   One of the key priorities of this reform is improving the capacity of SMEs to tender for public sector contracts in order to support innovative Irish firms. </p><p>  There has also been progress on the introduction of shared services.  PeoplePoint, the new Human Resources Shared Services Centre opened in 2013 and  the Civil Service Payroll Shared Service Centre commenced in December 2013. Further work is ongoing to progress shared services projects in the areas of Banking and Financial Management services for Government bodies, Learning and Development services and in each of the health, education and local government sectors. </p><p>  This Government is bringing public expenditure back onto a sustainable path and the delivery of commitments relating to the public service reform agenda should ensure that efficiencies and reformed work practices play a full part in contributing to the overall budgetary consolidation effort which is essential to achieving economic recovery.</p></reply>

Added years could also be applied at the discretion of the Governing Bodies of a number of Universities but these discretions have since transferred to the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform acting jointly under Section 11 of the Financial Measures Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009 - the legislation that provided for the transfer of the relevant pension funds to the National Pension Reserve Fund. </p><p>Ill-Health/Death in Service:</p><p>  Added years may be granted in the Civil and Public Service in cases of retirement on the grounds of ill-health. Added years may also be granted where a Survivors pension is being awarded in circumstances where the civil or public servant dies while still in service.</p><p>Section 6 of the Superannuation Act 1909 and Sections 6 and 7 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act 1963   </p><p>  These set out rules governing the early retirement of Civil Servants as a result of abolition of office or for the purpose of facilitating improvements in order to effect greater efficiency and economy in the organisation of a Department. Section 6 of the 1963 Act provides for the granting of added years.   In the wider Public Service these provisions serve as guidelines in dealing with similar cases. </p><p>Secretaries General/ City &amp;amp; County Managers</p><p>  The provisions of the 1909 and 1963 Acts may also apply to Secretaries General at the end of their contracts, with similar provisions applying to City &amp;amp; County Managers under the Local Government Superannuation Scheme. However as the Deputy is aware I have already reviewed the practice of awarding added years to retiring Secretaries General and City &amp;amp; County Managers.   </p><p>  The Government agreed to my proposal on 25<sup>th</sup> October 2011 to end this practice for any Secretary-General appointed after that date.  Subsequently - in conjunction with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government - legislation was passed in 2012, (S.I. 291 of 2012) ending the automatic entitlement to added years for retiring City and County Managers appointed after July 26<sup>th</sup> 2012.</p><p>Single Scheme: </p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that the Single Pension Scheme for the Public Service (&quot;Single Scheme&quot;) which came into effect from 1 January 2013 removes entirely the concept of added years for any new entrant who joins the public service from that date.</p></reply>

The EIB is also a valued investor in the commercial semi-state sector and has provided substantial investment especially to our energy sector.  In this way, the EIB is important in supporting the enhancement of our national economic infrastructure in particular.  We look forward to continued positive engagement with the EIB into the future.</p></reply>

The area was managed by the Commissioners of Public Works whose staff maintained the grounds, cut grass, etc.  The Park had been opened to the general public by the Office of Public Works (OPW), usually from 9.30 am to 5.00 pm, Monday to Saturday in line with the opening hours of the nearby National Museum.  However the walls are quite easily scaled in certain parts and the grounds have been frequented by people engaging in anti-social behaviour during the hours of darkness, especially at weekends after the park gates were closed. </p><p>  It was becoming increasingly common for OPW grounds staff to find used syringes among other rubbish discarded the preceding night.  In consequence a decision was taken in October 2012 to close the area to the public on health and safety grounds as sufficient resources were not available to the OPW to sterilise the park every day before opening the gates and inviting the public to enter.  OPW was not prepared to accept the possible health and safety risks to the visiting public. </p><p>  OPW entered into negotiations with Dublin City Council&rsquo;s Parks Department in 2013 with a view to handing over responsibility for the management and maintenance of the park to the City Council under a long term licence arrangement.  Agreement was reached with the City Council in June 2013 to hand over responsibility for the maintenance of the park in the interim, pending the putting in place of a licence.  Subsequent to this, the keys to the park were handed over to the City Council.  </p><p>  Before the licence can be finalised, the Council's proposals for improving access to the park and its plans for any alterations to the layout of the park (particularly in relation to the 1798 Memorial) will have to be agreed.</p></reply>

Of this sum, up to &euro;20 million may be provided for restoring coastal protection infrastructure. This figure derives from estimates provided by the local authorities to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and I understand that, within this total &euro;20 million figure, the estimate provided by  Donegal County Council was &euro;662,000.  However the actual amount of funding to be provided to Donegal County Council for repair of damaged coastal protection infrastructure will not be finalised until the applications for funding from the Council have been fully assessed.</p><p>  It is a matter for Donegal County Council in the first instance to investigate and address coastal protection issues generally in the county, including remedial works required on foot of damage from the recent storms.</p><p>  The Office of Public Works wrote on 10 January, 2014 to the Donegal County Managers indicating that it will accept applications under its Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme for funding to assist with repairs to built flood defences and coastal protection structures in the County which have been damaged by the recent storms.  This is a once-off measure to reinstate built coastal defences to their pre storm condition.  The specific application form for this entitled <i>Coastal Storm Damage Flooding Questionnaire 2014</i>  is again available on www.opw.ie under Flood Risk Management.  Any work for which funding is sought will be carried out by the Local Authorities. </p><p>  OPW funding is not available for repairs of other damaged infrastructure or facilities at coastal locations such as roads, promenades, boardwalks, piers, car parks, coastal paths, etc.  Local authorities should apply separately to other relevant Government Departments and State Bodies in this regard. </p><p>  It is also open to Local Authorities to carry out flood mitigation and coast protection works using their own resources.</p></reply>

This will include greater use of alternative models of service delivery, such as commissioning for specific outcomes, and service delivery improvements at sectoral and organisational levels.</p><p>  As well as changing how we deliver public services, we will continue to focus on increasing efficiency and productivity.  As efficiencies are realised through initiatives such as public procurement reform and shared services, some of the savings made will be re-invested in improved services.  This Reform Dividend  will serve to underpin and help sustain the reform agenda beyond the current fiscal crisis.</p><p>  The Public Service must make maximum use of new technologies, digitalisation and open data to deliver services in innovative ways.  A new Government ICT Strategy will be published later this year that will address the use of new and emerging technologies, ensuring that eGovernment is designed around real needs and taking steps to improve the take-up of 'digital government'.  As part of this new strategy, we are capturing data on the top transactional services on which the citizen engages with the State, which will help inform what further services will be put online.</p><p>   The new plan also places a focus on increased openness, transparency and accountability.  Citizens must be able to clearly see that the Public Service is working fairly in its decision making, in implementing policy and in delivering public services.  In this context, the political reform programme will deliver greater openness, transparency and accountability to strengthen trust in government and public services and strengthen public governance.  A particularly important development is the recent publication of a consultation paper focused on options for strengthening Civil Service accountability and performance.</p><p>  The Haddington Road Agreement will be a key enabler of the reform programme and will deliver an additional &euro;1 billion reduction in the cost of the Public Service pay and pensions bill by 2016. </p><p>  In delivering reform, we will continue to ensure that we have strong implementation and governance structures, which were an important element of the first Reform Plan.  The Cabinet Committee on Public Service Reform will continue to provide strategic direction and hold senior managers to account for the delivery of reform.  Each Department and Office has also developed their own Integrated Reform Delivery Plan, based on the commitments set out in the overall Reform Plan and also incorporating their own organisational and sectoral reform objectives.</p><p>  The full details of our ambitious reform programme are set out on the new Reform Plan.  This includes over 200 specific actions with clear timelines for each.  As you will be aware, I also published a Progress Report on 14 January, which sets out the considerable progress made to date on Public Service Reform.  Both documents are available at www.reformplan.per.gov.ie.  Finally, my statement on the Reform Plan to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform last week is available at  </p></reply>

In recent months, I met with all of the party leaders in the Executive and with the British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg MP as well as with the Independent Chair of the Panel of Parties, Dr Richard Haass, to discuss ways forward.  I have also visited the interface areas in Ardoyne, Carrick Hill and Short Strand and was briefed by the Apprentice Boys and the PSNI in Derry about their assessment of the situation.</p><p>  My officials in the British Irish Joint Secretariat in Belfast monitor the situation on the ground closely with their British colleagues, review legislative and judicial development and keep me advised. The legislative framework for parading is a key area of focus for my Department. Accordingly, we have strongly supported the work of the Parades Commission and the PSNI in maintaining the rule of law in Northern Ireland.  The Political Parties in the Northern Ireland Executive are currently discussing the Proposals, including those on Parades. They recognise the wide variety of other rights potentially affected by parades and other events and call for a new consensus based on rights, responsibilities, and relationships. Throughout the Talks, I have made clear the Government&rsquo;s view to all participants and stakeholders that there is now a unique opportunity to make further progress towards advancing reconciliation and the creation of a truly reconciled and prosperous society in Northern Ireland.    That remains the Government&rsquo;s view and we will continue our engagement with the Northern Ireland Political Parties and the British Government to that end.</p></reply>

I have since spoken and met with her informally, including since the publication of the da Silva Report in December 2012, and have indicated my ongoing availability to her and to the Finucane family.  Officials from my Department are in ongoing contact with members of the Finucane family.</p><p>  Most recently, I was represented by the Irish Joint Secretary to the British-Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat at a lecture in Queen&rsquo;s University, Belfast on 13 February 2014 to mark the twenty fifth anniversary of Pat Finucane&rsquo;s death.</p><p>  Both Governments accepted at Weston Park that certain cases from the past remained a source of grave public concern, particularly those giving rise to serious allegations of collusion by the security forces in each of our jurisdictions. Both Governments therefore committed to undertake a thorough investigation of allegations of collusion in the cases of the murders of Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent Bob Buchanan, Pat Finucane, Lord Justice and Lady Gibson, Robert Hamill, Rosemary Nelson and Billy Wright.    In line with Judge Cory&rsquo;s subsequent recommendations, a Tribunal of Inquiry into the murders of Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent Bob Buchanan was established by the Houses of the Oireachtas in 2005.</p><p>  With the publication of the Smithwick Report last December, the Government has fulfilled the commitments we entered into at Weston Park, specifically in this jurisdiction to carry out an inquiry into the murders of Chief Superintendent Breen and Superintendent Buchanan.  In line with this approach, we continue to call on the British Government for an independent public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane.  This is an approach which has cross-party support in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

My Department engages a range of external service providers in a number of areas where the required skills are not available in-house and it is more cost-effective to source them externally.  I have set out in the tables below details of payments to providers of external advisory services and the annual totals from 2011 to the end of 2013 in respect of Vote 28 (Foreign Affairs and Trade) and of Vote 27 (International Cooperation).</p><p>  These services are procured by competitive tender in accordance with EU and national rules and I am satisfied that this spend is in line with the overall value for money objective of my Department&rsquo;s remit, particularly in relation to the external services engaged for the independent monitoring and evaluation of  Ireland&rsquo;s programme of overseas development assistance, Irish Aid.   Given the overall scale, range and diversity of the Irish Aid programme, as well as the firm commitment to the highest quality, accountability and evaluation, it is necessary to complement the in-house capacity with specialised skills and advice. The level of expenditure on consultancy services is constantly monitored to ensure that it does not exceed the level required for the proper management, oversight, monitoring, evaluation and audit of the aid programme.</p><p>  With regard to legal services, my Department generally seeks advice on domestic legal matters from the Office of the Attorney General and/or the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office. Depending on the subject-matter, domestic litigation is dealt with on my Department&rsquo;s behalf by the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office, the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office or the State Claims Agency which engage lawyers to act for the Department where necessary and pay their fees. My Department has a Legal Division, which deals with matters of public international law, human rights law, and European Union law and other relevant legal issues. The Division also acts as agent for the Government before certain international courts and tribunals, such as the European Court of Human Rights. In this regard, it works closely with the Office of the Attorney General, which pays the fees of external lawyers.  The Department&rsquo;s Missions abroad engage local legal advisers from time to time to deal with a range of miscellaneous matters. At HQ, the Department has not engaged external private sector legal advice for any of the years 2011 to 2014 to date.</p><p><table><tr><th><b>Vote 28: Payments to External Advisory Service Providers in 2013</b></th><th><b>Value &euro;</b></th><th><b>Purpose of Contract </b></th></tr><tr><td>ISAS LTD</td><td>205,949</td><td>High-level ICT Security services </td></tr><tr><td>PT CONSULTING</td><td>105,782</td><td>Software consultancy service in providing online accreditation system for the EU Presidency (on behalf of all Departments) </td></tr><tr><td>RED DOG DESIGN</td><td>61,622</td><td>Graphic Design Services </td></tr><tr><td><b>Total Vote 28 2013</b></td><td>373,353</td><td></td></tr></table></p><p><b>Vote 28 (Foreign Affairs and Trade)</b><table><tr><th>Vote 28: Payments to External Advisory Service Providers in 2012</th><th>Value &euro;</th><th>Purpose of Contract</th></tr><tr><td>ISAS</td><td>371,687</td><td>High-level ICT Security services.  </td></tr><tr><td>RED DOG DESIGN</td><td>256,249</td><td>Graphic Design Services (including for EU Presidency requirements on behalf of all Departments) </td></tr><tr><td>PT CONSULTING</td><td>145,512</td><td>Development and operation of online delegate and press accreditation system for  EU Presidency (on behalf of all Departments)</td></tr><tr><td>Total Vote 28 2012 </td><td>773,448</td><td></td></tr></table><table><tr><th>Vote 28: Payments to External Advisory Service Providers in 2011</th><th>Value &euro;</th><th>Purpose of Contract</th></tr><tr><td>ISAS Ltd </td><td>174,768</td><td>High-level ICT Security Services </td></tr><tr><td>RITS Ltd </td><td>160,554</td><td>High-level ICT Security Services</td></tr><tr><td>Red Dog Design</td><td>109,827</td><td>Graphic  Design  Services </td></tr><tr><td>Total Vote 28 2011</td><td>445,149</td><td></td></tr></table></p><p><b>Vote 27 (International Cooperation) </b><table><tr><th>Vote 27: Payments to External Advisory Service Providers  in 2013</th><th>Value</th><th>Purpose of Contract</th></tr><tr><td>Heather Nesbitt</td><td>1,652</td><td>Training in the Analysis of Audit Accounts and other Financial Accounts of NGO for Development Education and Civil Society Section</td></tr><tr><td>Una Murray</td><td>37,500</td><td>Provision of Technical SupportIrish Aid - International Labour Organisation Partnership &ndash;

All successful applicants have to complete a probationary period of 6 months.  While it is not possible in the given timeframe to list all positions that the Central Bank has sought to fill since 1 January 2013, the Central Bank has informed me that 289 roles were filled in 2013, of which 46% were by external candidates and 54% through internal transfers or promotion.</p></reply>

All businesses are required to keep proper books and records and to retain such books and records for a period of six years.  In particular, any farming or other business that claims a tax deductible expense for any expenditure must have a satisfactory record of that expenditure.</p><p>  As I outlined previously, I am conscious that the need to tackle the shadow economy is balanced against imposing additional administrative burdens and costs on business.  New measures to improve tax compliance are always considered and it is important that any new measures are proportionate.  I am of the opinion that the introduction of a new system of receipts to tackle the shadow economy in the agricultural contractor sector is not a matter for the EU and, as I further explained on 16 January last, I will respond positively where Revenue makes a persuasive case for further powers or new obligations on businesses that will strengthen their hand in dealing with shadow economy activity.</p><p>  I have previously advised farm contractors that if they have specific details of non-compliance or tax evasion, these should be passed to Revenue where they will be fully investigated.  Contact details for a specific individual in Revenue with responsibility for this area were supplied.  In this context, I would ask the Deputy to encourage anyone or any representative body that has information on non-compliance or tax evasion to pass this information on to the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

Apollo Global Management believes following CCMA is in the best interests of both and forms part of its core strategy.</p><p>  A number of the purchasers of mortgage loan books are abiding by the Central Bank Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears on a voluntary basis.  I accept that this is not the same as the consumer having the right to the free service provided by the Financial Services Ombudsman; such a consumer would have recourse to the Courts in the usual manner.

Based on content of the Director s email of the 15th February 2014, the Revenue officer is now satisfied with the background giving rise to the amended claim.</p><p>  However, the Revenue officer is still awaiting the purchase listing for the period.  This was first requested in a telephone conversation with the Director of the company on the 10 January 2014 and again on 21 February 2014.  It is important that this listing is now submitted as it is not possible to validate the amounts claimed until it is received and examined by Revenue.  Until this purchase listing is received the VAT repayment cannot be made.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-26a.135.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022600069#WRE01000"><p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there were various schemes of accelerated capital allowances in operation from the late 1990's until 2010 and 2011 in relation to expenditure incurred on the construction of registered nursing homes, convalescent homes and certain residential units associated with registered nursing homes.  The allowances were claimed at the rate of 15% per annum over 7 years (10% in the final year).  It is likely, therefore that some of these allowances are still being claimed in respect of pre 2011 expenditure.   At the present time, expenditure on the construction of these types of buildings does not qualify for any capital allowance.</p><p>  The Employment and Investment Incentive (EII) is provided for in Part 16 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Income tax relief is given to individuals investing up to a maximum of &euro;150,000 per annum through the purchase of shares in qualifying small and medium sized trading companies.  The relief is restricted to investments which are used by the company for the purposes of carrying on relevant trading activities.  The limitation of the relief to trading activity excludes the application of the relief to capital investment such as the acquisition or construction of nursing homes.  Additionally the definition of &quot;relevant trading activities&quot; in the legislation specifically excludes &quot;operating or managing nursing homes&quot;.</p><p>  Services consisting of the development of non-residential immovable goods are, in general, liable to VAT at the reduced rate, currently 13.5%, in accordance with paragraph 15 of Schedule 3 of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010.  The Deputy suggests that a lower rate of VAT be applied to a sub-set of non-residential development, namely, construction of nursing homes.  The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  A change in VAT rates must be in compliance with the EU VAT Directive.  The European Court of Justice (CJEU), which is the final arbiter on VAT matters, has ruled in a number of cases, most recently in the Bridport &amp;amp; West Dorset Golf Club Limited case (C-495/12), that the application of VAT must be uniform across all categories of recipients of services.  Therefore, it is not possible to provide for a lower rate of VAT on construction services for a specific category of recipient only, such as, the nursing home sector.</p></reply>

This scheme came into operation on 25 October 2013 and will run until 31 December 2015.  It provides for tax relief for homeowners by way of a tax credit at 13.5% of qualifying expenditure incurred on repair, renovation or improvement work carried out on a principal private residence.</p><p>  Qualifying expenditure is expenditure subject to the 13.5% VAT rate.   The work must cost a minimum of &euro;5,000 (inclusive of VAT).  Where the cost of the work exceeds &euro;30,000 (exclusive of VAT) a maximum credit of &euro;4,050 will apply.  The credit is payable over the two years following the year in which the work is carried out.  The scheme will be administered through Revenue s online systems.  Contractors will be required to inform Revenue in advance of details of works to be carried out and will also be required to notify Revenue in relation to any payments received in respect of the works.  Homeowners will be able to view the information provided to Revenue by the contractor through the Revenue electronic systems and will also claim the relief through those systems.  It is anticipated that this system will 'go live' in early April 2014.  Contractors will need to enter the details of works carried out within 28 of the electronic system becoming available.  Until the system is live and details of works carried out are entered, there are no figures available on the incentive.</p><p>  Full details of the scheme are available on the Revenue website at  along with a newly produced Guide for Homeowners.

An exemption from Income Tax will be provided on profits up to a maximum of &euro;40,000 per annum for the first two years of trading.  However, USC and PRSI will continue to be payable.  If a loss is incurred then loss relief will be available in the normal manner.  The business must be un-incorporated i.e., it must not be registered as a company. In order to claim this relief, the individual must file a tax return notwithstanding that there may be no liability to tax.  This initiative is an employment activation measure that provides a much-needed incentive for people to start their own business and to reduce their dependence on welfare payments.  There is no requirement for an individual to register in order to claim the relief. Instead, the individual will claim the relief by completing the relevant boxes in his or her annual income tax return.  Therefore, until the individuals who avail of this relief file their tax returns for the 2014 tax year next year, it will not be possible to know how many individuals are availing of this relief.

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.  The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support.  The deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p><p>  The NCSE has published details of all of their allocations for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2013/2014 school year on their website www.ncse.ie, which detail the allocations made for each school on a per county basis.  Schools can contact the NCSE if they have enrolled children who were not considered at the time that the revised SNA allocations were made to schools, or where they are seeking a revision to the quantum of SNA support which has been allocated to them. In general, a revision to SNA allocations will only be made in circumstances where schools have enrolled new pupils, or where schools can demonstrate that they do not have sufficient SNA posts to cater for the care needs of all of the qualifying children in their school.</p><p>  The NCSE will shortly be inviting schools to make applications for SNA support for the coming 2014/15 school year and will consider applications for support for new pupils enrolling to schools.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.  As the Deputy's question refers to an application for SNA support for an individual child, I have referred this question to the NCSE for their consideration and direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The remit of the Home School Community Liaison Service (drawn in the main from the teaching profession) is to work with families with children from pre-school age up to school leaving age.

The preferred approach is that children with autism are educated in school settings where children may have access to individualised education programmes (IEPs), fully-qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants, the appropriate school curriculum with the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils.</p><p>  As each child with autism is unique they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers who may draw from a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA), Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS).  My Department supports the use of ABA and training is provided for teachers in its use. However, my Department does not accept, based on research, advice and best practice, that ABA should be the only approach used. While ABA helps to improve behaviour, other approaches, such as TEACCH and PECS are just as important in developing children's communication and speech skills. It is important that children have access to a range of approaches so that their broader needs can be met.  There is no specific circular governing the use of ABA.</p><p>  My Department's child centred policy is based on advice received from NEPS; the Inspectorate and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism and takes full account of advice from a range of international experts on autism, including persons with expertise and qualifications in ABA.  The various contributors who have informed this policy are too numerous to mention but the Deputy may wish to note that the Task Force for Autism Report is available on my Department's website and includes a detailed bibliography.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that I have asked the NCSE to provide policy advice specifically on the educational provision for children with autism spectrum disorders. The NCSE has advised that the policy advice will be delivered in the spring of 2015 and will draw upon findings gathered from an extensive consultation process which has already commenced. The advice will also draw upon new research commissioned by the NCSE for this purpose as well as any other research which may be available and which the NCSE considers merits consideration. It will be open to all interested parties to contribute to the consultation process for the policy advice and I expect that the NCSE final report will reflect the broadest possible range of views and provide recommendations which will assist the development of policy for future years.</p></reply>

Central to this is the Special Education Support Service (SESS) which was established in September 2003. The brief of the SESS is to enhance the quality of learning and teaching of students with special educational needs through the provision of CPD and support for teachers in mainstream schools, primary and post-primary special schools, and special classes.</p><p>  My Department has satisfied itself that research does not support the exclusive usage of any one approach as a basis for national educational provision for children with autism. It is for this reason that the preferred policy is for a child centred approach based on the individual child's needs. This approach is supported by ongoing monitoring of educational objectives to determine whether a child is benefiting from a particular intervention or range of interventions and to allow for appropriate adjustment to objectives and strategies. Reflective of the important role of CPD, my Department, through SESS, has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions including Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS).</p><p>  Provision by SESS for CPD in relation to Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA), within the learning and teaching context is as follows: </p><p>(a) Contemporary Applied Behaviour Analysis (C-ABA) Course - this course provides an introduction to ABA for practising teachers in special education settings in Irish schools. The course teaches teachers the skills to 'design, implement and evaluate' interventions to change the behaviour of students in their care.  This course does not purport to prepare teachers for any level of ABA-specific qualification. In terms of academic discipline this course presents behavioural concepts and principles through the educational lens. It is a course for teachers who are enabled to combine their educational qualifications and experiences, of which psychology is a central element, with concepts and principles of ABA for application in the learning and teaching of pupils with special educational needs including pupils with ASDs. It addresses the management of behaviour that interferes with children's learning and the provision of curricular experiences that are concerned with the holistic development of each child.

In the present economic situation this incentive is no longer considered appropriate and as part of Budget 2014 it was decided to cease this payment for participants commencing courses after 1 January 2014.  This is a decision taken in the context of the overall savings this Department had to find for 2014 and future years.  The implementation of this decision should not have any impact on the number of projects, including traveller projects, or places being provided in 2014.</p></reply>

Or they may enrol in a mainstream school and attend a special class, or they may enrol in a special school.</p><p>  The enrolment of a child to a school is a matter in the first instance for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school. My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools.</p><p>  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB will try to help parents to find a school placement if their child has been unable to secure a school placement to date. The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p><p>  In addition, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) can assist parents to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs.</p><p>  Parents may contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs and to seek assistance in identifying placement options, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  The NCSE also recently published a Guide for Parents and Guardians of Children and Young People with Special Educational Needs on Choosing a School. This guide is also available at www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  Finally, where a parent seeks to enrol their child in a school and that school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld, may the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.</p></reply>

My Department is currently liaising with the Patron of the school and a decision will be conveyed to the school authorities when this process has been finalised.</p><p>  The Deputy will however appreciate that my Department's over-riding objective is to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to cope with increasing school numbers.  To ensure that this is achieved, the delivery of new schools, together with extension projects, in areas where additional demographic need has been established, will be the main focus for capital investment in the coming years. The Five Year Construction Plan that I announced in March 2012 is focused on meeting those demographic needs and sets out the school projects that are planned to proceed to construction over the duration of the Plan.  My Department's assessment of any application for large scale capital funding will therefore take into account planned provision under the Five Year Plan and clear evidence of substantial pressure for pupils places in all schools serving the area.</p></reply>

Establishing suitability criteria that are appropriate to a particular contract is a matter for the contracting authority concerned since they are in the best position to understand the delivery requirements for that specific contract. Once appropriate suitability criteria are established it is important to apply proportionate minimum standards to these criteria. In this regard my Department has developed specific national guidelines for contracting authorities in relation to minimum standards for suitability criteria for construction contractors interested in tendering for public works projects, published as part of the Capital Works Management Framework (Guidance Note 2.3.1.3 Suitability Criteria for Works Contractors Minimum Standards refers. ). </p><p>  The Government recognises that the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector is very important to the economy and that public procurement can be a source of business for SMEs. In this regard, my Department has issued public procurement guidelines (Circular 10/10) to public bodies which are aimed at facilitating greater participation of SMEs in public procurement opportunities. In relation to suitability criteria, the guidelines stress that public bodies must ensure that any criteria/turnover levels set by them must be both justifiable and proportionate to the needs of the contract.</p></reply>

For works contracts the threshold is &euro;5.186 million; for supplies and service contracts awarded by Government Departments the threshold is &euro;134,000 and for the remainder of public bodies the threshold is &euro;207,000. The threshold for supplies and service contracts of entities operating in utility sectors (water, energy, transport and postal) is &euro;414,000. The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on the basis where a supplier is liable for tax purposes. There are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules. </p><p>  The main rules that apply to the calculation of the value of contracts are as follows:</p><p>  -  the calculation should be based on the total amount payable or the total value of the contract and, in the case of frameworks and contracts divided into lots, the amount is the total value of all potential contracts to be awarded under the arrangement;</p><p>  -  all financial and non-financial elements that may be paid are counted including payments from third party sources (i.e. co-funded projects); and,</p><p>  -  the estimated value of the contract must take into account the estimated total amount, including all options and renewals (even if those options or renewals are not subsequently exercised) and all other types of payment made to all candidates or tenderers.</p><p>  In relation to how VAT and other taxes are assessed when tenders are being evaluated, the position is as follows:</p><p>  -  Tender value is assessed exclusive of Value-Added Tax (VAT). This is because of the variety of VAT rates in operation across the EU. In this regard, it is worth noting that where a successful supplier is located in another EU Member State and the annual value of a foreign supplier's distance sales to this State exceeds &euro;35,000 the supplier is obliged to register for VAT in this State. </p><p>  -  All other taxes would be included in tender price.</p><p>  The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) is responsible for producing annual statistical information in relation to above-EU threshold procurement activity by the Irish public sector and for providing these statistics to the European Commission. The most recent data available on above EU threshold awards relates to 2011 and is as follows: </p><p>  -  Approximately 10% (valued at &euro;240M) of the total known awarded contracts above threshold by the State went to non-domestic companies. This represents less than 5% of the overall annual public procurement spend (approximately &euro;13.1 billion). </p><p>  It is important to remember that open tendering is a two way street and that it provides Irish companies with opportunities to compete abroad. The public procurement market in the EU is estimated to be valued in excess of &euro;2.4 trillion. In this regard, it is worth pointing out that the open market regime also offers opportunities for Irish companies to win business abroad and reliable EU studies indicate that many Irish businesses are successful in this regard.</p></reply>

The final report of the Implementation Body concluded that significant cost savings, amounting to &euro;1.8 billion, were delivered over its lifetime.  Building on this work, the Haddington Road Agreement will deliver a &euro;1 billion saving in the cost of the public service pay and pensions bill by 2016.   </p><p>  In terms of cost reduction, approximately &euro;300 million in savings, arising from the implementation of various measures under the Agreement, was incorporated into the various Votes in the context of the Revised Estimates for 2013.</p><p>  The measures and reforms implemented under the Agreement helped to ensure that spending remained in line with profile and resulted in Ireland delivering on our fiscal target for 2013.  </p><p>  Alongside a greater focus on achieving better outcomes for service users, the Government's new Public Service Reform Plan maintains a strong focus on delivering greater efficiency and further cost savings.   Some examples include:</p><p>-  The new Office of Government Procurement is leading a radical new approach to public procurement with a target of delivering savings in the region of &euro;500 million over the next 3 years;  </p><p>-  PeoplePoint, the Civil Service HR and Pensions Shared Services Centre became operational in March.  There are now over 24,000 employees serviced by PeoplePoint across 19 organisations.  Once PeoplePoint becomes fully operational, the savings are estimated at &euro;12.5 million annually;</p><p>-  A new single Payroll Shared Service Centre for the Civil Service (in 3 locations), which will consolidate and integrate payroll processes and practices from the 18 payroll centres currently providing payroll services to 53 Public Services Bodies, has commenced operation.  It is estimated that this initiative will achieve savings of &euro;5.6 million per annum when fully operational;</p><p>-  Laois County Council is leading the rollout of a payroll and superannuation shared service for the Local Government sector.   When fully operational, this will deliver savings of &euro;4.3 million per annum;</p><p>-  As already referenced, the Haddington Road Agreement will deliver a &euro;1 billion saving in the cost of the public service pay and pensions bill by 2016.</p><p>  These are just some examples of the ways in which reform will continue to drive efficiency and reduce costs in the Public Service.   The Government's new Public Service Reform Plan and a Progress Report on Public Service Reform can be seen at <i></i></p></reply>

Over the period from 2009 to 2013, the pay bill has been reduced from a peak of &euro;17.5 billion to &euro;14.1 billion, net of the pension related deduction.</p><p>   On the matter of the impact of retirement across the public service in the years ahead, this is something that public service managers deal with and manage every year in the normal course of events, and there will continue to  be scope to recruit or redeploy existing staff, taking account of existing number and pay ceilings, to address service delivery issues that may arise from retirements.   The identification of areas that are perhaps more sensitive or exposed to retirement in the coming years and responding to that is a matter for sectoral managers across the public service.   To support them in this are the new more flexible work conditions and additional hours provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement and initiatives such as the workforce planning framework, which my Department has supported and which provides for medium term staff resource planning.</p></reply>

This approach underpins the current programme of reform of public procurement and is one of the major projects of key strategic importance in the Government's Public Service Reform Plan.  Procurement of supplies and services accounts for around &euro;9 billion of current spending by the State per annum. This represents a very significant portion of overall spending and it is, therefore, essential that the Public Service achieves maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement.</p><p>  The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) is currently researching the area of insurance across the Public Service.  It is planned to identify the potential opportunities, savings and value for money that may be achieved in this area.</p><p>  On 1<sup>st</sup> January, 2014, the National Procurement Service (NPS) was subsumed into the OGP.

Recent figures confirm a growth in employment that is broad based with several sectors showing employment growth.  While these are encouraging signs for the economy, we must continue to build on this progress and support further job creation.</p><p>  My understanding is the issue of possible job losses in the company in question relates to an adjacent waste facility, which in their view, might have an impact on their business.  In this regard, I should point out that issues concerning the enforcement of waste management legislation are matters for the appropriate regulatory authority and should therefore be pursued with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or the relevant local authority, as appropriate.  </p><p>  I have nevertheless contacted Dublin City Council and I understand from them that they are satisfied that the waste facility in question is complying with the terms of its permit.</p><p>  I have been informed by the City Council that the waste facility concerned applied for, and received, planning permission in June 2011 for a change of use and fit out of an existing disused light industrial building, for the purpose of handling non-hazardous waste.  A Waste Facility Permit was granted in respect of the facility by Dublin City Council in March 2012.  Despite a public advertisement and a site notice, there were no third party objections to the issue of this permit.</p><p>   I have also been informed that the facility has been subject to a series of inspections by Dublin City Council staff.  I understand that a number of issues were identified by the council prior to June 2013.  However, I am informed that during six inspections since June 2013, no issues of concern were observed.  I understand that the City Council is satisfied that the waste facility concerned is complying with the terms of its permit.  While the company continues to raise concerns about the impact of the adjacent facility on its business my Department and its agencies have no power or role in the matter.</p><p>  Finally, I have also consulted recently with Enterprise Ireland.  I understand from Enterprise Ireland that they are continuing to liaise with the company concerned, as one of their client companies, and will continue to assist them in any way possible within the Agency&rsquo;s statutory remit.</p></reply>

The relevant legislative provisions vary from body to body.  For example, in certain cases the legislation provides for the appointment of persons nominated by specified stakeholders, such as employer or trade union representative bodies.  This can sometimes have a limiting effect on the scope to address gender imbalances.  In other cases there may be no such provisions. </p><p>  Appointments are also made based on the expertise and experience of individuals, the balance of skills and attributes in terms of the overall composition of the board, the gender balance of the board and the availability and commitment of people to serve on the board.  So, whilst achieving greater gender balance on State boards is an important goal, the overriding focus is on getting the best people for particular board appointments. </p><p>  To this end, I have since 2011 launched  public campaigns inviting expressions of interest from suitably qualified and experienced persons for appointment to the boards of the agencies under the aegis of my Department.  The purpose of the campaign was to broaden the pool of suitable candidates for consideration for appointment to boards.  I have made it clear that in considering applications that I would give due regard to Government policy on gender balance on State boards.  The current gender balance of the bodies under the aegis of my Department is set out in the following tabular statement.</p><p><b>DJEI Agency Board Gender Breakdown as at 31/01/14</b><table><tr><th>Agency</th><th>Male</th><th>Female</th><th>Current Membership</th><th>Vacancies</th><th>Total Board positions</th><th>% Male</th><th>% Female</th></tr><tr><td>NCA</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>11</td><td>0</td><td>11</td><td>45.5%</td><td>54.5%</td></tr><tr><td>SFI</td><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>12</td><td>0</td><td>12</td><td>58.3%</td><td>41.7%</td></tr><tr><td>PIAB</td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>11</td><td>0</td><td>11</td><td>54.5%</td><td>45.5%</td></tr><tr><td>EI</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>9</td><td>3</td><td>12</td><td>55.6%</td><td>44.4%</td></tr><tr><td>IDA</td><td>8</td><td>2</td><td>10</td><td>3</td><td>13</td><td>80.0%</td><td>20.0%</td></tr><tr><td>NSAI</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>12</td><td>2</td><td>14</td><td>66.7%</td><td>33.3%</td></tr><tr><td>HSA</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>7</td><td>4</td><td>11</td><td>85.7%</td><td>14.3%</td></tr><tr><td>IAASA</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>15</td><td>0</td><td>15</td><td>46.7%</td><td>53.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Forf&aacute;s</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>6</td><td>83.3%</td><td>16.7%</td></tr><tr><td>Shannon</td><td>9</td><td>1</td><td>10</td><td>0</td><td>10</td><td>90.0%</td><td>10.0%</td></tr><tr><td>ITI *</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>6</td><td>50.0%</td><td>50.0%</td></tr><tr><td>LRC</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>7</td><td>80.0%</td><td>20.0%</td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>73</td><td>41</td><td>114</td><td>14</td><td>128</td><td>64.0%</td><td>36.0% </td></tr></table></p><p>*  Nominated by Minister and approved by North South Ministerial Council</p><p>  As can be seen, in relation to the bodies to which I appoint members, over half of these exceeded  the 40% minimum gender balance target and in aggregate we are at 36% female and 64 % male representation.  I am satisfied, in the context of the constraints I have noted regarding nominating bodies and specialist skills needs, that the bodies under the remit of my Department in broad terms have good gender balance on their boards, albeit that in some individual cases the level of female representation could be improved.  The Deputy might further note that when Forf&aacute;s is dissolved and Shannon Development restructured, such that the existing board of both bodies will no longer exist, later this year, the gender balance of the remaining boards under my Department&rsquo;s remit will have, on average, 52% male and 48% female representation.

I am very aware of the serious challenges facing many pension schemes at this time and the efforts being made by both the trustees and the sponsoring employers of these schemes to meet these challenges.  The Deputy will be aware that I have introduced a number of legislative changes in recent years to assist both trustees and employers meet these challenges.</p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions (No.2) Act 2013 amended section 50 of the Pensions Act to broaden the options available to the trustees of a pension scheme in any consideration of a restructure of pension scheme benefits.  Prior to this change, the trustees of a pension scheme could restructure active and deferred scheme member&rsquo;s benefits and post retirement increases in pension benefits.  The change to section 50 of the Pensions Act extends the categories of benefits which can be considered in a restructure of scheme benefits to include a portion of pensioner benefits.  This change essentially provides for the sharing of the risk of scheme underfunding across all scheme members.  I should add that the recent changes protects 100% of pensions in payment up to &euro;12,000 per annum and 90% of pensions in payment between &euro;12,000 and &euro;60,000 per annum.</p><p>  Any consideration of a restructure of pension scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act must comply with the provisions in the Act and with guidance issued by the Pensions Board.  This guidance makes provision for the notification of all scheme members in advance of any application to the Pensions Board to restructure scheme benefits.  In such circumstances, scheme members will have at least one month to make a submission to the trustees of the scheme in relation to such a proposal.  The Pensions Board must be satisfied that all the provisions in the guidance are complied with before the Board will consider issuing a notice to restructure scheme benefits. </p><p>  The issue of how these changes might be applied will be a matter for the trustees of the scheme who are required under trust law to act in the best interests of all scheme beneficiaries.</p></reply>

The programme is funded by the Department with day-to-day management of contracts undertaken by Pobal.  Some 425 not-for-profit companies and co-operatives shared annual funding of &euro;46m from the programme in 2013.  Contract holders must deliver tangible services that are capable of generating non-public revenues from their operations by way of charging fees, sales and/or fundraising and other public funds.  The programme is not intended to represent full-funding for any operation.</p><p>  Each contract holder is responsible for their own budgets, income, financial and other liabilities.  Contracts are generally offered on a three-year cycle based on a business plan or similar submitted by the company.  Continued funding is subject to satisfactory compliance with the programme&rsquo;s operational requirements, financial position of the company, continued eligibility of the company and service, progress on delivery of the stated objectives in the business plan, and an assessment of a business plan for the following three year contact cycle.  A regular review process is undertaken to ensure compliance with contract obligations, audit issues, continuing capacity of the organisation to manage public funds, the need for and quality of service delivery, sustainability, and value for money.</p><p>  The company is involved in the provision of a range of services in North Kerry.  This particular CSP contract relates to the provision by the company of a low cost maintenance and minor repair service targeted specifically at the older community of North Kerry.  The operations were reviewed as part of a re-contracting process for the period 2014-16.  The process involves the submission of business plans by the company and a review of  performance by Pobal before recommendations are made to the Department for decision.  The company had been approved for a funding contribution to employ a full time manager post and four and a half full-time equivalent posts (FTE) plus an operational grant of &euro;5,000 up to end of 2013.  The total value was &euro;122,649 pa.  The business plan submitted by the company to secure a contract for 2014 to 2016 was considered to be generally weak and raised concerns about the activity delivered for the level of funds granted and the value being obtained.  There are also longer-term concerns about the sustainability of the services and its financial structure.

I am very aware of the serious challenges facing many pension schemes at this time and the efforts being made by both the trustees and the sponsoring employers of these schemes to meet these challenges. You will be aware that I have introduced a number of legislative changes in recent years to assist both trustees and employers meet these challenges.</p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions (No.2) Act 2013 amended section 50 of the Pensions Act to broaden the options available to the trustees of a pension scheme in any consideration of a restructure of pension scheme benefits. Prior to this change, the trustees of a pension scheme could restructure active and deferred scheme member&rsquo;s benefits and post retirement increases in pension benefits. The change to section 50 of the Pensions Act extends the categories of benefits which can be considered in a restructure of scheme benefits to include a portion of pensioner benefits. This change essentially provides for the sharing of the risk of scheme underfunding across all scheme members. </p><p>  Any consideration of a restructure of pension scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act must comply with the provisions in the Act and with guidance issued by the Pensions Board. This guidance makes provision for the notification of all scheme members in advance of any application to the Pensions Board to restructure scheme benefits. In such circumstances, scheme members will have at least one month to make a submission to the trustees of the scheme in relation to such a proposal. The Pensions Board must be satisfied that all the provisions in the guidance are complied with before the Board will consider issuing a notice to restructure scheme benefits. </p><p>  The issue of how these changes might be applied will be a matter for the trustees of the scheme who are required under trust law to act in the best interests of all scheme beneficiaries. </p><p>  In relation to the matter of representation by deferred scheme members in consideration of a change to scheme benefits, this is a matter which needs to be considered in a broader industrial relations context. I have written to my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in this regard.</p></reply>

It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company, in a position to provide a high quality, nationwide postal service and maintain a nationwide customer focused network of post offices in the community. </p><p>  That said, the Deputy should be aware that operational matters and the role of developing commercial strategies for the post office network are a matter for the Board and management of An Post and not one in which I have a statutory function.  As shareholder, however, I have a strong concern in relation to the ongoing commercial position of the Company and I regularly liaise with the Company in this regard. </p><p>  It is for that reason that I am very pleased that the decline in post office numbers has been arrested. Figures in the Grant Thornton report show that, although there were 197 closures between 2006 and 2010, from the end of 2010 to date 17 closures have occurred.</p><p>  The reports undertaken by the Irish Postmasters' Union and the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications on the future of the post office network are a comprehensive collection of thoughts, issues and opportunities concerning the post office network and set out many options for exploration in relation to the future development by An Post of the post office network. </p><p>  An Post has undertaken a programme of capital investment particularly in the computerisation of the post office network including the automation of all post offices. As a result, the post office network stands well positioned to become the front office provider of choice for Government and the financial services sector for both electronic transactions as well as the more traditional over the counter transactions. Any such developments would, of course, need to be subject to public procurement requirements as appropriate.</p><p>  On the 25th February, I welcomed the fact that the Government has agreed to my proposal for a whole-of-government consideration, encompassing central and local government and the wider public service, of the nature and extent of services that can be provided to the public using the post office network as a front office of government. This whole-of-government analysis will be undertaken in the first instance by the Cabinet committee on social policy with a view to a report to Government by that committee. This will afford an opportunity for a holistic review of the range of services which could be provided by the post office network and could perhaps yield synergies among the different agencies.</p></reply>

My Department takes a holistic approach to regeneration which requires rigorous analysis to select the right solution and strategic planning for a multi-faceted response involving all of the relevant State Agencies and stakeholders. Consultation with residents is a key element in the development of regeneration proposals and my Department provides funding for specialist personnel to engage with local communities to ensure that their views are fully considered and taken into account in the preparation of regeneration proposals. </p><p>  To qualify for regeneration funding, local authorities and regeneration agencies are required to prepare comprehensive evidence-based masterplans, which provide a vision for the physical, social and economic regeneration of the area concerned and set out a framework for delivering on the objectives of the plan. The plan should include detailed strategies and implementation arrangements for delivering all three strands of regeneration and for addressing the socio-economic and infrastructural deficits that contribute to the social exclusion of the community concerned. Beyond this, regeneration masterplans are project-specific and it is a matter for the local authority, in consultation with tenants, the local community and relevant statutory bodies, to determine the nature and extent of individual regeneration projects.  </p><p>  Having regard to the extensive levels of consultation with local communities in the preparation and delivery of regeneration projects, I have no proposals to introduce legislation in this regard. </p></reply>

Under the statutory framework of the Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2009, it is a matter for each local authority to decide upon the most appropriate public awareness, enforcement and clean-up actions in relation to both litter and illegal dumping, taking account of local circumstances and priorities. My Department also provides funding to local authorities to support their efforts in this area. </p><p>Under   the Anti-Litter Awareness Grant Scheme administered by my Department, local authorities may apply for grant funding for suitable projects including adopt-a- road schemes. Under the scheme in 2013 , I requested local authorities to examine and investigate the possible roll-out of adopt-a- road schemes in their functional areas, where practicable.   In 2013, my Department made total funding of &euro;900,000   available for schemes under the overall Anti-Litter Awareness Grant Scheme.  A total of over &euro; 876,000 was paid out, including over &euro;95,000 paid to 15 local authorities specifically in respect of adopt-a-road schemes.</p><p>  Funding for the Anti- Litter Awareness Grant Scheme is provided from t he Environment Fund and the 2014 allocations are currently being finalised. Once finalised, local authorities will be invited to apply for grant aid for projects which meet the criteria set out in the Scheme. As in 2013 , I will again be requesting local authorities to examine the further roll-out of additional adopt-a-road projects in their functional areas, where practicable.   </p><p>  Details of the individual allocations made available to local authorities under the Anti - Litter Awareness Grant Scheme in 2013 are set out in the table.   <table><tr><th>County Council</th><th>Amount (&euro;)</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>20,000</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>20,000</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>24,000</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>35,000</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>27,000</td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown</td><td>35,000</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>35,000</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>27,000</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>27,000</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>24,000</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>24,000</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>20,000</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>18,000</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>27,000</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>18,000</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>24,000</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>24,000</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>27,000</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>20,000</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>20,000</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>20,000</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>20,000</td></tr><tr><td>South County Dublin</td><td>35,000</td></tr><tr><td>South Tipperary</td><td>20,000</td></tr><tr><td>North Tipperary</td><td>20,000</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>18,000</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>20,000</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>27,000</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>24,000</td></tr><tr><td>City Council</td><td> -</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>35,000</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>70,000</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>35,000</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>30,000</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>30,000</td></tr><tr><td> TOTAL</td><td>900,000</td></tr></table></p></reply>

These changes were made on foot of the recommendations of a review group, established in 2013 by my Department, to examine the terms and conditions governing the suite of Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability . Membership of the group included the County and City Managers&rsquo; Association (CCMA), the Housing Practitioner Network, Local Authority personnel and my Department. Consultations were held with organisations working with older people and people with a disability. The aim of the review was to target the grants at those in greatest need, spreading the benefits as widely as possible and to ensure fairness and value for money in the operation of the schemes. A template for the revised application form was circulated to local authorities recently.   It is a matter for each authority to insert details of address, contact persons and logo etc. and to make copies of the forms available to potential applicants. </p></reply>

Meath County Council&rsquo;s overall allocation under the grant schemes for 2014 is &euro;572,776 compared to &euro;499,545 last year. Allocations in 2014 were determined on the basis of the level of grant activity in local authorities in 2013 and on population statistics with a weighting applied in respect of the numbers of persons aged over 65 years. </p><p>  Through careful management of my Department&rsquo;s housing budget in 2013, additional funds were made available to local authorities with high levels of grant activity, including Meath County Council. I will be applying the same close scrutiny to the capital budget for 2014 and, in the event of savings arising, these grants will be a priority for supplementary funding. </p><p>  In January 2014, some changes to the terms and conditions of the grant schemes were notified to local authorities. These changes are intended to spread the benefits of the schemes as widely as possible and to ensure fairness and value for money in their operation.

I would say, however, and I feel sure the Deputy would agree with me, that there can never be any justification for the criminal, violent taking of human life, no matter what the circumstances.  This was a brutal, violent killing and we all hope that its perpetrators can be brought to justice.</p><p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the investigation into this crime is ongoing.  As would be expected in the normal course of such an investigation, the Garda investigation team has retained certain items recovered at the crime scene which are relevant to their inquiries and for potential evidential purposes.</p><p>  I am aware that the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman is conducting an investigation into certain matters relating to the victim in this case and has sought the assistance of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  To the extent that it is possible for the Garda authorities to co-operate with the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman they will seek to do so.  They must, however, be conscious of the legal constraints applying given that they must ensure that the ongoing murder inquiry and the chances of a successful prosecution arising would not be compromised in any way.</p><p>  The Garda authorities have had the co-operation and assistance of their colleagues in the Police Service of Northern Ireland in matters that are relevant to the conduct of the Garda murder investigation from the outset of the investigation to date.</p><p>  At the outset of the investigation the Garda authorities established liaison directly with the victim's family.  The family subsequently indicated that it wished all communication to take place through its legal representatives and the Garda authorities have respected that request.  Contact with the legal representatives is maintained as necessary.</p><p>  I am aware that the Coroner's Inquest into this killing has been adjourned on a number of occasions since it opened and I can understand that this may be a cause of concern for the victim's family.  The Deputy will be aware, however, that such adjournments are provided for in cases where a criminal investigation is ongoing in order to ensure that the criminal investigation would not be compromised.  Any decision on a prosecution in this case, as in any other, is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions who is independent in the performance of her functions.</p></reply>

This remit encompasses a number of functions of relevance to the Deputy's question. The functions of the Authority as set out in the Act shall be to:  </p><p>  (a) increase public trust and confidence in the management and administration of charitable trusts and charitable organisations;</p><p>  (b) promote compliance by charity trustees with their duties in the control and management of charitable trusts and charitable organisations;</p><p>  (c) promote the effective use of the property of charitable trusts or charitable organisations;</p><p>  (d) ensure the accountability of charitable organisations to donors and beneficiaries of charitable gifts, and the public;</p><p>  (e) promote understanding of the requirement that charitable purposes confer a public benefit;</p><p>  (f) establish and maintain a register of charitable organisations;</p><p>  (g) ensure and monitor compliance by charitable organisations with this Act;</p><p>  (h) carry out investigations in accordance with this Act;</p><p>  (i) encourage and facilitate the better administration and management of charitable organisations by the provision of information or advice, including in particular by way of issuing (or, as it considers appropriate, approving) guidelines, codes of conduct, and model constitutional documents;</p><p>  (j) carry on such activities or publish such information (including statistical information) concerning charitable organisations and trusts as it considers appropriate; and</p><p>  (k) provide information (including statistical information) or advice, or make proposals, to the Minister on matters relating to the functions of the Authority.</p><p>  With respect to the Board of the Authority, I have indicated my intention to appoint the Members by Easter. In preparation for this, an open call for expressions of interest from suitably qualified persons who wish to be considered for appointment has been made. With respect to the staffing of the Authority, arrangements are being made by my Department to assign an initial staff to the Authority, from within existing resources, in line with sanctions received from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. This will include a Chief Executive Designate who, as provided for in the Act, will become the first Chief Executive of the Authority.</p><p>  An early priority for the new Authority will be the preparation and publication of a statutory register of charities. All registered charities will be required to provide reports to the Authority each year on their activities and these reports will be made available to the public. This will provide a much needed increase in transparency and accountability in the charitable sector, and will support the good practice in charity governance and management that is critical to a vibrant charity sector that commands the trust and confidence of donors and beneficiaries alike.</p></reply>

Garda management closely monitors the operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level to ensure that the optimum use is made of available resources and that the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</p><p>  Kinnegad Garda Station forms part of the Mullingar Garda District and I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of Kinnegad Garda Station and Mullingar Garda District, on the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 4 and 160 respectively.  The District is also supported by 16 Garda Reserves and 14 civilian staff.  Responsibility for the efficient deployment of official Garda vehicles in each Division is assigned to the Divisional Officer, who may allocate vehicles between stations, as required by operational circumstances.  The Deputy will appreciate that a degree of flexibility in allocating and re-allocating vehicles among stations, so as to best match the allocation of resources with policing priorities, is essential to the efficient management of the Garda fleet.</p><p>  I am, of course, conscious of the importance of the Garda fleet and, in that regard, the Deputy will be aware that I recently secured a further &euro;9m for investment in the fleet.  This investment resulted in the purchase of 305 new Garda vehicles towards the end of 2013, at a cost of &euro;5 million.  These were in addition to the 133 new Garda vehicles which had already been procured during the year. The remaining &euro;4 million has been made available for the purchase and fit out of Garda vehicles in 2014.  I understand that specific details in relation to the deployment of the new Garda transport have yet to be fully finalised but the Deputy can be assured that the vehicles will be allocated as effectively as possible in line with operational circumstances, including the requirements of area referred to by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The manual includes policy and procedures in relation to Organisation &amp;amp; Responsibilities, Driver Training and Health &amp;amp; Safety.  The Garda Roads Policing Manual will be reviewed on an annual basis, ensuring up-to-date policy and procedures are in place.  The roles and responsibilities of Garda members involved in pursuit incidents are clearly set out and the policy manual outlines the policies and procedures to be followed where an individual appears to be intent on harming themselves, with the safety of all those involved in such situations, including the general public, being paramount.</p><p>  As the circumstances of each incident will be unique, there is, no one size fits all, no &quot;formula based&quot; or set plan approach that can be applied from the perspective of the Garda driver who encounters such a situation.  Each potential case has to be dynamically assessed by the responding Garda driver, given the unique circumstances, (driver's mindset, location and proximity of nearest assisting Garda vehicle, vehicle performance, available reaction time etc) relevant to each potential case.  Since 2008, &quot;Specific Response Training&quot; (not to be confused with pursuit training) has been delivered through stages 2 and 3 of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Competency Based Driving Programme (C.B.D.).</p></reply>

The Scheme of the Criminal Justice (Corruption) Bill 2012, aims to strengthen the law on corruption and repeal and replace the existing provisions contained in the Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 to 2010.  In the context of the preparation of this anti-corruption measure, my officials take account of relevant recommendations made by the various organisations involved in this area, including the OECD, the Council of Europe GRECO Group, and the UN.  As regards the content of the Bill, the Deputy will note that the EU Report makes reference to the Scheme of the Bill incorporating various recommendations contained in the Report of the Mahon Tribunal.  These new provisions include, for instance, an offence of making reckless payments to a third party, while knowing or being reckless to the fact that that party intends to use the payments to pay  bribes.  It is intended that the Criminal Justice (Corruption) Bill 2012, which is currently with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for drafting, will be published later this year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-26a.501.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022600083#WRT01800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 194 and 201 together.</p><p>  Fishing through the winter is difficult in normal circumstances but I am acutely conscious that the severe weather has caused the fishing fleet to be tied up for quite an extended period, a longer period than would be the norm with more typical winter weather.  As the catching sector is by definition dependant on being able to go out and catch fish, and crews earn their living through a share of the catch, many fishermen have suffered financially because of this extended period restricted to port.  Thankfully, we had a long overdue break in the weather last week and many of the vessels that were harbour bound due to the severe weather were able to return to fishing and to some extent make up for lost time.  No doubt we will continue to have intermittent stormy conditions in the weeks and months ahead, as is normal for this time of year, but I am hopeful that fishermen will be able to put to sea on a regular basis so that they can put that difficult period behind them.</p><p>  As income from fishing is derived from landings of catch, the amount that can be caught and therefore the income from most fisheries is determined by the EU quotas which are restrictive, and made available under our management arrangements with catch limits set for whitefish each month.  The quotas are managed to allow for access to quota for the full twelve months of the year, as far as possible.  This may mean in many cases that the allocations made available for certain months are set at low levels, certainly less than Industry would like and would be capable of landing.</p><p>  I always work very closely with, and I am advised by industry when setting catch limits during the year.  Each month, a quota management advisory committee, involving Industry representatives and my Department, meets and examines available quota, uptake levels and the market situation and make recommendations to me on catch limits for the following month.  The quota uptake figures for January 2014 and for the first part of February are significantly down.  In order that vessel owners and their crews are enabled to compensate as early as possible for these low catch levels, allocations for March were set for a number of the key economic stocks at a higher level than in February.  The level recommended by industry took account of concerns not to glut the market with very high landings in a single month and on that basis the arrangements recommended and put in place involve modest increases in key whitefish stocks including cod, haddock and whiting in the Celtic Sea, monkfish and megrim in the Celtic Sea and the hake stock in the Celtic Sea and the north west.  These increased quotas and fishing opportunities for March will help to re-balance the landings to bring them more into line with planned annual spread of quota uptake.  They can be further adjusted in April to take into account of the low level of landings in the first 6 weeks of the year.</p><p>  In relation to any specific payments to compensate for lost earnings, the Minister for Social Protection has overall responsibility for funding income support to individuals and families who have been unable to work because of adverse weather conditions.  Minister Burton&rsquo;s Department runs a number of schemes to support people in circumstances of loss of income.</p><p>  While the co-legislators have reached political agreement on the proposed Regulation establishing the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, it will not be adopted in law until probably June this year.  My Department is working to prepare a new Operational Programme for the seafood sector under the EMFF.  That Programme is dependent on the progress of the proposed Regulation and so is likely to be finalised towards the end of the year.  Decisions on what to do with the finite resources available to Ireland under that Operational Programme will be a key element of that work and I am working closely with all stakeholders in making those hard choices between many competing and worthwhile investment priorities.  It is thus premature from both a legal and practical perspective to consider employing the EMFF to assist fishermen in the present situation.</p></reply>

This draft will then form the basis for detailed discussions over a number of months with the European Commission.

Persons who meet the definition of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; under the new Direct Payment Regulation will be eligible both to apply to the National Reserve for an allocation of new entitlements or a top-up on the value of existing entitlements and also to participate in the Young Farmers Scheme. The essential purpose of the &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; category under the Direct Payment Regulation is to assist young farmers in the initial stages of establishing a farming enterprise in their own name and to encourage generational renewal. It is for this reason that the payment is restricted to those who are establishing or have established such a holding in the previous five years. Based on the information supplied, it would seem that the person concerned does not meet the criteria to qualify as a young farmer for the purposes of Direct Payments. </p><p>  In January I also announced details in relation to the financing for the new Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014-2020 as well as proposals for support measures under the RDP.  The development of a new RDP will be a key support in enhancing the competitiveness of the agri-food sector, achieving more sustainable management of natural resources and ensuring a more balanced development of rural areas.  The proposed measures include specific support for young farmers undertaking specific capital investments.  However, a range of other measures have been proposed which will provide important supports for farmers regardless of whether they qualify as young farmers.  These include a new Agri-Environmental and Climate Change Scheme (GLAS), continued support for farmers in Areas of Natural Constraint (formerly known as Less Favoured Areas), a range of knowledge transfer measures, support for on farm capital investment, a major new Beef Data and Genomics Programme, as well as a number of supports for collaborative and quality focused schemes.  These proposed measures will provide key supports to farmers, including young farmers, and are currently the subject of an ongoing public consultation.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 400,000 young people and involve approximately, 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2014, funding of &euro;50.530m including &euro;750,000 for a new capital funding programme has been provided to my Department for these schemes. </p><p>  For&oacute;ige is in receipt of funding from my Department to support the provision of youth services throughout the country.  In 2014, this funding, under the various youth services schemes and programmes will amount to some &euro;7,054,419.  The establishment and development of the Big Brother Big Sister programme by For&oacute;ige was funded by philanthropic sources.  As this funding  came to an end, For&oacute;ige sought alternative funding for the programme.  </p><p>  My Department, as with all Government departments is required to deliver significant savings on the major funding schemes that it administers, including the youth services funding schemes.  In responding to requests for funding for the Big Brother Big Sister programme from For&oacute;ige, my Department has explained the very significant funding constraints applying to the youth services grants schemes.  My Department has nevertheless sought to assist For&oacute;ige to maintain the Big Brother Big Sister programme.  In 2011, For&oacute;ige following an internal review of the organisation's wide range of provision for young people, reprioritised its areas of youth provision.  This reprioritisation, which was proposed to my Department, enabled For&oacute;ige to strengthen their Big Brother Big Sister programme, nationally.</p><p>  For&oacute;ige decided to reallocate the funding provided by my Department from their youth information services to the Big Brother Big Sister programme.  In late 2013 For&oacute;ige briefed my Department that it was continuing to pursue other funding sources but that, in the absence of confirmation of these, decisions were imminent on the curtailment of the programme.  In this context, in November, 2013, an additional amount of &euro;360,000 was provided by my Department, as an exceptional measure and on a 'once-off' basis, to assist in maintaining the programme at an appropriate level while For&oacute;ige continues, for a limited period, to seek alternative ongoing funding to replace the philanthropic funding which has ceased.</p></reply>

As I have stated on a number of occasions it is important to note that complex legal and constitutional issues have arisen in the drafting of the Bill.  A particular challenge has arisen in the attempt to reconcile an adopted person's request for information about his or her identity with the right to privacy of his or her birth parent where consent has not been provided.  My Department is continuing to consult with the Office of the Attorney General on this and on a number of related issues.</p><p>  One reason for the discussions with the Attorney General is to continue to tease out precisely how this can be done in the context of what I must state is extremely strong legal advice about the constitutional protection of the rights of the natural mother to privacy.  A number of European court cases also have addressed this issue and highly complex legal and constitutional issues have arisen.  I continue to explore how far the Government can go in building into legislation that right of the adopted person to get access to information without breaching the Constitution.  This is the reason it is taking this length of time to draft the Heads of Bill. I intend to submit the Heads of Bill for Government approval as soon as these issues have been addressed.  </p><p>  I am not in a position to give a comprehensive account of the provisions of the proposed legislation until the Heads of Bill have been agreed by Government.  Once approved by Government, the Heads of Bill will be sent to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for its detailed consideration.  The process of sending the Heads of Bill to that Committee will ensure that the provisions of the proposed legislation will be subject to public scrutiny and it is of course open to that Committee to invite and encourage submissions from all interested  parties.  In the meantime I am open to any proposals or suggestions in relation to policy on this matter that assists in achieving as much access as possible in a manner that is legally and constitutionally sound.</p></reply>

The service referred to by the Deputy is participating in both of these programmes.</p><p>  Community childcare services qualify for funding under the CCS programme on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  The information provided in the parental declaration forms submitted to my Department is verified by the Department of Social Protection (DSP) and the HSE.  This information determines the level of subvention which applies to each individual qualifying parent and consequently the overall level of funding to which a service is entitled.  Following verification of the information, participating services are provided with a list of qualifying parents and confirmation of the subvention level applied to each parent.  Parents can appeal if they consider that they are entitled to a higher rate of subvention. </p><p>  In relation to the particular childcare service referred to, I can confirm that the appeal process for this school year has been completed and the service has been informed of the outcome.  The capitation payment for this year is based on a total of 45 children for whom parental returns were submitted by the service compared to 58 children for the year 2012/13.  This decreased enrolment has resulted in a significant reduction in the funding to which the service is entitled.  </p><p>  The ECCE programme provides for one year's free pre-school attendance for each eligible child before commencing primary school.   Funding of &euro;28,750 has been provided to date for this school year to this childcare facility under the ECCE programme and further payment will issue for the remaining terms of the school year.  This funding is also based on verified returns submitted by the service for the eligible children enrolled.  There is no provision under the CCS or ECCE programmes to provide additional funding over and above that generated by the returns submitted.</p></reply>

While these services are in the process of being reconfigured under the HSE&rsquo;s National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years), it is important to note that all HSE areas have significant services in place for children with disabilities aged up to eighteen years.  These are provided directly by the HSE or by voluntary service providers funded by the HSE.</p><p>  The aim of the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme is to achieve a national, unified approach to delivering disability health services so that there is a clear pathway to services for all children, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability.  An additional &euro;4m has been specifically allocated in 2014 to drive implementation of the Programme.  This equates to approximately 80 therapy posts.  </p><p>  Almost 60 geographic-based multidisciplinary teams have been established to date under the Programme as part of the reconfigured service model.  It is hoped that a further 30 teams will be reconfigured this year, bringing the overall total to approximately 90 teams by the end of 2014.  These figures reflect all children's disability teams that provide early intervention and school age services to children aged up to eighteen years.  The transition to this new model is taking place on a phased basis and, importantly, includes consultation and engagement with stakeholders, such as service users and their families.  </p><p>  Within this context I have asked the HSE to provide the Deputy with the detailed operational information requested concerning early intervention services for children with disabilities living in counties Monaghan, Cavan, Meath and Louth.</p></reply>

If an applicant&rsquo;s means are above the financial thresholds, as outlined in the National Assessment Guidelines, the HSE routinely considers whether the refusal of eligibility will result in undue financial hardship for the applicant or any dependants.  Eligibility may be granted, on a discretionary basis, if the applicant cannot arrange general practitioner, medical and surgical services, for themselves and their dependants, without undue financial hardship. </p><p>  Medical card or GP visit card eligibility is not granted solely on the basis of a person&rsquo;s medical condition (other than persons affected by the drug Thalidomide or persons affected by Symphysiotomy).  Medical card applicants or their dependants who submit supporting medical reports with an application for a medical card and who do not qualify for a medical card on an assessment of means, have the management of their medical condition considered during the assessment process to determine if the refusal of eligibility would result in undue financial hardship for the applicant or any dependants.</p><p>  Persons that have been granted a medical card under the &lsquo;financial hardship&rsquo; provisions of the medical card scheme are required, when the subject of a review assessment, to submit all relevant and up-to-date details material to making a determination of continuing eligibility. </p><p>  Where an applicant indicates on their review application that medical evidence has been previously submitted relating to a life-long medical condition, and this has been confirmed by the HSE,  the HSE will not request further medical evidence in this regard.

The Terms of Reference for this review are as follows:  </p><p>  Taking account of Government policy, demographic trends and the fiscal situation &ndash;</p><p>- To examine the on-going sustainability of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme,</p><p>- To examine the overall cost of long-term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating/setting prices,</p><p>- Having regard to 1. and 2. above, to consider the balance of funding between long-term residential care and community based services,</p><p>- To consider the extension of the scheme to community based services and to other sectors (Disability and Mental Health), and</p><p>- To make recommendations for the future operation and management of the scheme.</p><p>  It is expected that the Review will be completed by Q2 2014 and the report will then be made publicly available.  As the Scheme is statutory based, the implementation of recommendations arising from the review may require amendments to the NHSS Act 2009.  </p><p>  Residential care in Ireland is provided through a mix of public, voluntary and private provision.  It is worth highlighting that the budget for long-term residential care in 2014 is &euro;939m. It is estimated that this will support over 22,000 people this year in public, private and voluntary nursing homes.  In order to be an &lsquo;approved nursing home&rsquo; for the purposes of the NHSS, all private and voluntary nursing homes must negotiate and agree a price for the cost of care with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  This is a necessary feature of the Scheme due to the commitment by the State to meet the full balance of the cost of care over and above a person's contribution. The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of this function and, in carrying it out, it must ensure value for money for both the individual and the State. If price negotiations break down a three stage review process, developed by the NTPF, can be invoked. Details of the process are set out on the NTPF website.</p><p>  We are committed to the provision of a quality public nursing home service underpinned by a regulatory system of registration and inspection. It is the responsibility of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to assess whether residential services are providing high quality, safe and effective services and supports to residents, and to ensure that any issues or deficits are addressed to the satisfaction of the Authority.  In this context the HSE is concentrating on applying the limited funding available for capital works in the most effective way possible to meet residential need now and in the future.  </p><p>  While there will of course always be a need for long-term residential care, older people have consistently said that they want to be facilitated and supported to stay in their own homes and communities for as long as it is viable for them to do so, and it is Government policy to develop this approach.  Accordingly in 2014 there is an enhanced focus on home and community supports.  Provision for community and home-based services are being strengthened by &euro;23m to allow more people to stay in their own homes for longer. This is in addition to the budget of &euro;315 provided for home help and home care package services which are delivered to some 56,000 people at any one time.</p><p><i>  The Government for National Recovery, 2011-2016 </i>  commits to developing and implementing national standards for home support services, which will be subject to HIQA inspection. Primary legislation and resources will be required for the introduction of a statutory regulation system for home care services. This is being considered in the wider context of the licensing of Public and Private Health Service Providers.  In the meantime, the HSE is already progressing a range of measures to ensure that home care services, provided either directly by the HSE, or through external providers with HSE funding, operate to a high standard. These measures will have a very significant impact on overall standards. </p><p>  I would also like to advise the Deputy that one of the key priorities identified in the HSE's National Service Plan for 2014 is the implementation of a Single Assessment Tool (SAT) for older people. This standardised framework will uniformly assess dependency levels, allow resources to be targeted towards those with the greatest needs and enable supports and services to be designed in the most appropriate way possible. The first phase of implementation of the SAT will commence in 2014 with a minimum of 50% of all new entries to the NHSS, Home Care Package and Home Help Schemes assessed by the SAT in the last quarter of 2014, with full implementation of SAT by the end of 2015.</p><p>  The needs of our older people are, and will remain, a very high priority for this Government.  The funding that is available for services for older people must be balanced across all of the various service areas in a way that achieves the best possible outcomes for the greatest number of service users and prioritises areas of greatest need as far as possible. Resources that are available will continue to be applied to provide the best possible mix of supports and services.</p></reply>

The analysis and the report is about the quality of the selected indicators and data not the quality of care.</p><p>  This analysis of HIPE data was a process that involved ongoing discussion with the HSE. During 2011 the analysis highlighted a number of variations with a small number of hospitals being identified as outliers for certain indicators. There are a lot of possible explanations for these variations including issues relating to the coding of the principle diagnosis, coding of the healthcare records to the HIPE system, inclusion of confounding factors in the analysis of the indicators and quality of care. However, this analysis of the data does not allow for an underlying variation in the quality of care to be excluded. Therefore it was necessary for this information to be reflected back to the hospitals as only the hospitals are in a position to assess their data to determine the reasons for the variation. This information was communicated through the Quality and Patient Safety Directorate, HSE to the hospitals in mid 2011.</p><p>  My Department has been assured by the HSE that the hospitals have had the opportunity both to correct their data and address any quality of care issues.</p><p>  This report confirms the value of the HIPE system as a resource for the development of indicators of quality of care in our hospitals but it also shows that hospital data and the indicators need to be further refined before they can be used for this purpose.</p><p>  Measuring the quality of our healthcare and publicly reporting how our services are performing is part of my Government&rsquo;s commitment to improved accountability and continued improvement in our health services.</p><p>  It is my intention that my Department will publish a report on quality healthcare indicators at national, regional and hospital level later this year which will be based on corrected data and will identify hospitals.</p></reply>

BreastCheck has a clear commitment to providing transparent information to women invited for screening - with the benefits and limitations of screening clearly explained. Breast cancer survival in Ireland has improved significantly in recent years due to the combined approach of screening, symptomatic detection and improved treatment.  Breast cancer 5 year survival is now estimated at 81.8% for people diagnosed between 2003-2007, up from 76.8% for people diagnosed between 1998-2002.</p><p>  BreastCheck's &lsquo;Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Mammography Screening&rsquo; is available for public review and download from the publications section of . These guidelines are consistent with those of the European Reference Organisation for Quality Assured Breast Screening and Diagnostic Services which is the EU standard.</p><p>  BreastCheck utilises digital mammography as it is the most advanced method available, giving enhanced image quality and significant reductions in the radiation dose associated with screening examinations.  While not all breast cancers can be found by mammogram, breast screening helps to identify cancers at an early stage when it easier to treat the patient.  This leads to less extensive surgical treatment, a better chance of good recovery and improved quality of life.</p><p>  BreastCheck is fully audited against a range of quality-led criteria including those published in the BreastCheck Women&rsquo;s Charter.  BreastCheck seeks to achieve or surpass standards set down for breast screening, including those outlined in the Charter, and outcomes are reported in the BreastCheck programme report (most recent figures relate to 2011).  BreastCheck provides comprehensive and transparent information and encourages woman to share in decision-making regarding treatment.  They also highlight the woman&rsquo;s right to refuse treatment, obtain a second opinion or choose alternative treatment.</p><p>  The standardised detection ratio (SDR) is a useful composite score by which to measure the performance of an overall screening programme and it is used to benchmark radiological performance against other international programmes.  The most recently published figures for 2011 reflect an improved programme performance by BreastCheck.</p></reply>

A specialist BreastCheck multidisciplinary team provides the screening service.  Quality assurance standards in operation include the double reading of all mammograms by two specially trained radiologists.  Pathologists take part in external Quality Assurance and independent slide review.  The entire BreastCheck programme is subject to external review by EUREF, the European Reference Organisation for Quality Assured Breast Screening and Diagnostic Services, with the next review scheduled for Autumn 2014.</p><p>  Women who have an abnormality on screening will be recalled to an assessment clinic for triple assessment. Such clinics are attended by a radiologist, a breast surgeon, a breast care nurse and appropriate radiography staff.  Further imaging, including supplementary mammographic views and ultrasound, clinical examination and either needle biopsy or fine needle aspiration as required is carried out.</p><p>  A multidisciplinary meeting takes place on a regular basis at each unit to review individual cases.  Radiation oncologists and medical oncologists involved in the programme are normally involved in the medical review of all cases of diagnosed breast cancer.  Correlation of clinical, radiological and pathological results is performed and the outcome is documented.  Further clinical management as required is arranged immediately.</p><p>  The BreastCheck Women's Charter encourages women to share in decision-making regarding treatment.  The Charter highlights the woman&rsquo;s right to refuse treatment for whatever reason, to obtain a second opinion or to choose alternative treatment.  If she so wishes, the woman is encouraged to include a partner, friend or relative in any discussions.  Copies of their medical results can be obtained by all women.</p></reply>

Based on the success of the pilot, BreastCheck transferred to digital mammography.  Digital mammography gives enhanced image quality with improved visualisation of dense breast tissue. It allows images to be acquired more quickly and enables the manipulation of images to obtain better detail.  Digital mammography also involves a significant reduction in the radiation dose associated with screening examinations.  </p><p>   A research study sponsored by the US National Cancer Institute, Digital Mammographic Imaging Screening Trial (DMIST), provides evidence to support the efficacy and safety of digital mammography.  BreastCheck continues to review all relevant research as it is published.  The extensive independent breast screening review for the United Kingdom (Marmot Review) published in 2012 demonstrated that breast screening leads to a reduction in mortality.</p><p>  A clinical trial on digital mammography has not been carried out in Ireland.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for each local authority.</p><p>  Earlier this year I announced that &euro;332 million was being allocated to local authorities under the regional and local road grants investment programme (down from &euro;400m in 2013) .  The focus on road maintenance and repair this year comes against a backdrop of ongoing limited resources and an overall cut of 17% this year on the 2013 funding. As a consequence, new schemes which are focused on improvement rather than maintenance will be curtailed for 2014. Our priority is to maintain the existing road network, and unfortunately there is little scope for carrying out new road improvement projects. Accordingly no applications were sought from local authorities for new Specific Improvement Grant schemes (such as Moylaragh Relief Road) in respect of 2014.</p><p>  It is also important to re-iterate that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement local authorities in their spending in this area.  I note that Fingal County Council was allocated in excess of &euro;4.7m for regional and local roads in 2014. </p></reply>
