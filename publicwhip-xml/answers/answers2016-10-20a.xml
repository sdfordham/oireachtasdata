My responsibility relates to the conservation status of the hare.   In August this year, the Department issued licences under the Wildlife Acts to the Irish Coursing Club, covering its affiliated coursing clubs, to capture and tag hares for use at regulated hare coursing meetings for the 2016/17 coursing season, which extends from the end of September 2016 to the end of February 2017.  While no meetings have been monitored by officials of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department to date for the 2016/17 season, I should point out that only 8 out of a total of 70 scheduled coursing meetings have been held at this stage.   </p>  <p>  Hare coursing meetings are monitored, as resources allow, by conservation rangers of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department in order to ensure compliance with the conditions of the licences. A process is under way at present that will allow for the recruitment of additional conservation rangers by my Department over the coming months.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-20a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102000048#WRA00700"><p>The current underspend against profile within my Department's Vote has occurred principally because of delays in the drawdown of funding in relation to- the Arts Programme in respect of certain once-off Decade of Centenary projects; and </p><p>- the Rural and Regional Programme that transferred to my Department in June.</p><p>The Decade of Centenary projects where there have been some delays in drawdown are part of the &lsquo;Permanent Reminders&rsquo; component of the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme. They included Richmond Barracks, the new cultural centre at Pearse&rsquo;s Cottage at Ros Muc and the Tenement Museum in Henrietta Street. All of these are now either completed or very close to completion, and will take up all of their planned 2016 allocation by the end of this year. There were also unavoidable delays in some other cases &ndash; for example, the National Monument at 14-17 Moore Street and the major redevelopment at the National Archives. While some progress has been made on these projects, the full expected drawdown of funds will not now occur this year.</p><p>With regard to the Rural and Regional Programme, the main delay in drawdown is in relation to the LEADER Programme and is due to the fact that the new programme has only recently commenced.</p><p>All expenditure within my Department's Vote continues to be carefully monitored to ensure the best use of available financial resources. Public Financial Procedures provide that a maximum of 10% of the capital envelope of a Vote may be carried over by way of deferred surrender to the following year for spending in that year on priority capital programmes. For my Department, this means that a maximum of just over &euro;13&frac12; million in capital can be carried over into 2017, subject to the approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p><font color="#212100">It is too early to accurately forecast the end of year outturn at this point in time but no savings beyond those which can be carried forward by deferred surrender into 2017 are envisaged at present.</font></p></reply>

It will therefore become part of the baseline for the Arts division of the Department, meaning it will be available for future years. The Deputy may wish to note that Budget 2017 will include an additional &euro;5 million for the Arts Council, an 8% increase in its annual budget; increased funding for all of the National Cultural Institutions; an increase of &euro;2 million for the Irish Film Board and &euro;1 million for Culture Ireland as well as an additional &euro;1 million to the Heritage Council.  I have also obtained a new funding stream of &euro;5m for the implementation of a Culture 2025/Ireland 2016 Legacy Programme which will allow me to build on the positive legacy of the <i>Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme. </i>I will be announcing details of this new initiative shortly.</p><p>This represents real and substantial funding increases across the arts and cultural centre and has been welcomed across the sector. Indeed much of the funding initiatives announced in the 2017 budget should have a real impact on communities, artists and arts organisations across the country including in the Deputy's constituency of Donegal.  </p><p>It should be noted that the majority of the &euro;49m allocation to my Department to provide for the Commemorative Programme in 2016 went towards a series of capital projects, including the new visitor centre at the GPO, Richmond Barracks, the Kevin Barry Rooms at the National Concert Hall and the Athenaeum in Wexford.</p><p>Now that these projects have been completed, the capital funding provided for them will not be repeated in 2017.  These projects will, of course, continue and go on to leave a positive lasting legacy for the people of Ireland.  </p><p>All these measures for supporting culture re-affirm the commitment of this Government to progressively increase funding for the arts as the economy improves, as set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</p></reply>

I am advised by Waterways Ireland that this site is being considered for development in partnership with the private sector.  Development will be in accordance with the North Lotts &amp;amp; Grand Canal Dock Strategic Development Zone (SDZ) Planning Scheme for the area.The SDZ outlines the nature and extent of proposed developments permissible within this site with a use mix of 40% residential; 30% commercial and 30% community. Waterways Ireland believes there is an opportunity, in how the community element of the planning designation for the site is delivered, to celebrate and sustain the maritime and inland waterways heritage of the wider area and the graving docks. </p><p>The Waterways Ireland Action Plan for Grand Canal Dock and Spencer Dock sets out the body&rsquo;s proposals to ensure that both Docks are developed to deliver their full potential to the city of Dublin and to the wider canal network.  The plan is available on the Waterways Ireland website at: </p><p>Waterways Ireland has recently appointed a Programme Manager to drive forward delivery of this Action Plan and is committed to delivering the Grand Canal and Spencer Docks as amenities in the city, with the maximum recreational benefit to local people and visitors alike.</p></reply>

Under the Arts Act 2003, primary responsibility for the promotion and support of the arts, including music, throughout the country is devolved to the Arts Council.In this regard, I am pleased that I secured significant additional funding for the Arts Council as part of Budget 2017, which will see an increase in its allocation of &euro;5m, or 8%. This increase will enable the Council to enhance support to artists and arts organisations around the country, including musicians, in line with its strategy statement, <i>Making Great Art Work</i>, which prioritises support for the artist and public engagement. </p><p>In addition, my Department, through Culture Ireland, provides supports for Irish artists and musicians to travel abroad and develop their careers. I am pleased that I have increased the annual baseline funding for Culture Ireland from &euro;2.5m in 2016 to &euro;3.5m in 2017. </p><p>My Department also provides support for music through its funding of the Music Capital Scheme, which is delivered by Music Network, as well as providing significant funding to Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, the largest organisation in the State involved in the preservation and promotion of Irish traditional music. The IMRO report, entitled <i>The Socio-Economic Contribution of Music to the Irish Economy,</i>highlights the impressive contribution the music industry makes to the Irish economy. The report contains a broad range of recommendations for which several Ministers have responsibility.  The broader issue of cultural policy is also considered in the draft Framework Policy <i>&Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach/Culture 2025,</i>which was forwarded to the Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in July.  I will be happy to consider any response which the Committee makes to the draft document.</p></reply>

The Arts Council contributes funding to a number of organisations to assist in the delivery of arts in education projects in schools.  These include Poetry Ireland's Writers in Schools Scheme, where writers and storytellers visit primary and post-primary schools, as well as the Bringing to Book Artist-in-Residence Scheme, a Children's Books Ireland project.</p></reply>

However, the postal sector has been undergoing systemic change both nationally and internationally in recent years, with the increased use of electronic communications leading to the decline in core mail volumes year on year.In recognition of this changing business environment, the Post Office Network Business Development Group, chaired by Mr Bobby Kerr, was established in late 2014 to examine the potential for new and existing Government services to be transacted through the post office network and to identify new business opportunities for the network. </p><p>The final report of the Post Office Network Business Development Group, which was published in January of this year, made a number of recommendations to support the future sustainability of post offices. These include recommendations in relation to the renewal of the post office network, the development of a basic payment account, the provision of motor tax services, and the creation of hubs around which local economic and social activity could revolve. The report also recommended that An Post should, following appropriate consultation with postmasters and others, review and amend the five-year strategy for the post office network.</p><p>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>commits to acting on the recommendations in the report of the Post Office Network Business Development Group. A number of Working Groups have been established to progress the recommendations, including through the establishment of a Network Renewal Implementation Group, which is being independently chaired by Mr Kerr. This Group is examining the number and spatial distribution of post offices, branch modernisation, the streamlining of products and services, postmaster payments and contracts, and training and qualifications for post office employees. </p><p>I have separately established the Post Office Hub Working Group to identify potential models under which the post offices could act as community hubs, especially in rural areas.  My officials are also examining the potential for the post offices to deliver services such as motor tax payments and a basic payment account.</p><p>The Government is, therefore, taking a range of measures to support the post office network to adapt to the changed business environment in which it operates.  The network will, however, continue to operate within the context of An Post&rsquo;s commercial mandate.</p></reply>

With regard to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, an additional &euro;1m in once-off capital funding had been secured as part of the 2016 Revised Estimates.  This has been retained for next year, which means that &euro;6.687m is the new capital baseline in Budget 2017 for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta &ndash; an increase of &euro;1m on the baseline in Budget 2016. In addition, I have secured an additional allocation of &euro;2.4m for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s for capital projects in 2016.

This compares to a budget of &euro;51.21 million for 2016. The reduction is mainly attributable to a reduction in the capital allocation in 2017.

The projects themselves will, of course, continue to be a positive and lasting legacy for the people of Ireland.  </p><p>With regard to the reference to 0.6% of GDP quoted, I understand that the source of this is a Council of Europe research project and that many European countries, including ten EU member states, are not included in the data. I understand also that the data is not standardised and is not comparable across countries. For example, local authority expenditure on the arts, the artists' exemption tax relief, expenditure on public service broadcasting and the Irish language are not included in the figures for Ireland but comparable figures are included in the data for some other countries.  </p><p>I have previously stated that further research on this issue is warranted and my Department is considering the matter at present. The issue of a definition of culture and of capturing public expenditure on culture is an element of the draft <i>Culture 2025</i>framework policy, which was forwarded to the Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs for input in July last.</p></reply>

The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>contains over 80 commitments for delivery across a range of Departments and State agencies to revitalise rural Ireland and ensure that the benefits of economic recovery are felt in all regions.  These Departments and agencies have the statutory authority, budgets and expertise in their own particular areas to make a positive contribution to rural development.  It would not necessarily be effective or practicable to transfer all of these functions into a single Government Department. Indeed, the administrative processes required might not be cost-effective and could well delay the delivery of much-needed services to rural Ireland.A key to ensuring effective co-ordination of the effort to support rural development across Government will be the new Action Plan for Rural Development.  Progress is well under way in my Department in preparing this Plan, which will act as an overarching structure for the co-ordination and implementation of initiatives across Government which will benefit rural Ireland.  My objective is to publish the Action Plan by the end of the year.  </p><p>My Department will monitor progress on implementing the Plan on an on-going basis, and I will report progress to the Cabinet Committee on Regional and Rural Affairs, which is chaired by the Taoiseach.  I will also publish Progress Reports on a regular basis.</p><p>My own Department has, of course, responsibility for a number of important programmes and initiatives which impact positively on rural Ireland, including the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, the REDZ Scheme, CL&Aacute;R, the LEADER programme, the Rural Recreation and Walks Schemes, and Mountain Rescue.</p></reply>

The Plan comes under the remit of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Denis Naughten T.D.  However, as Minster with responsibility for the revitalisation of rural Ireland, I intend to ensure that there are no unnecessary delays in the roll-out of broadband to rural communities once the contacts for the areas to be covered by State intervention under the National Broadband Plan are awarded next year.</p><p>In this regard, I have established two Regional Broadband Action Groups, which involve all Local Authorities in the country, to ensure that there are no barriers to the deployment of broadband and to identify priority connection points for the advance roll-out of telecommunications infrastructure in each county.  The Action Groups will also assist with the development of local digital strategies to ensure that when each county is broadband-enabled, they can maximise the economic and social opportunity at their disposal.</p><p>Earlier this year, along with Minister Naughten, I also established a Mobile Phone &amp;amp; Broadband Taskforce to identify and recommend practical actions that can be taken in the short term to improve mobile reception and broadband access in Ireland.  The Taskforce will finalise its work shortly with a view to bringing forward a list of recommendations for the Government&rsquo;s consideration by the end of the year.</p></reply>

In addition, I have secured an additional allocation of &euro;2.4m for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s for capital projects in 2016.

This compares to a budget of &euro;51.21 million for 2016.  The reduction is mainly attributable to a reduction in the capital allocation in 2017.

The report contains recommendations concerning the existing non-conclusive boundary model which has been in operation in Ireland since 1892.</p><p>The statutory functions and procedures of the PRA are set out in the Registration of Deeds and Title Acts 1964 and 2006 and the Land Registration Rules 2012 - 2013.  Details of its Mapping Practice standards are available on its website, <i>www.prai.ie</i>.  The Authority's objective is to ensure that all maps lodged for registration comply fully with its mapping standards.</p><p>The recommendations set out in Chapter 7 of the 2014 Report advocate a move away from the State's long-standing property registration model and are at variance with current registration of title policy and existing legislative provisions.  The changes advocated in the Report would add significant additional costs to the conveyancing process, have the potential to disturb existing titles to registered property and exacerbate the risk of boundary disputes.  Moreover, implementation of such changes could increase the exposure of the State to compensation claims.</p><p>The Deputy's Question of 16 September 2016 raised matters concerning property boundary disputes and as I outlined in my reply at that time, I am advised that the PRA is not aware of any recent increases relating to boundary disputes.  While the PRA is aware of the report referred to by the Deputy and other studies, it is notable that no concerns relating to a perceived increase in boundary disputes have been raised via the PRA's Customer Focus Forum, a forum where the PRA engages with solicitors, surveyors, engineers and architects in relation to all matters pertaining to property registration.  I am assured by the PRA that it has in place robust structures whereby the registered owners of properties or their representatives can engage with the PRA in relation to matters pertaining to the mapped representation of the registration.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that a Government decision was taken to merge the PRA with Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Valuation Office to form a new statutory body, Tailte &Eacute;ireann, for which legislation is currently being drafted.  Among the issues to be examined in the context of the merger are the strategic goals and priorities of the prospective merged organisation.  It is anticipated that this will provide an opportunity to derive significant added value from the bringing together of the rich data holdings of the three organisations concerned.  Any potential changes to the mapping system as well as submissions or proposals from representative organisations could be considered in that context.</p></reply>

The Garda Commissioner has been asked to provide a report on all the issues raised in the correspondence received from the person.</p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that, as Minister for Justice and Equality, I do not have a direct role in relation to some of the issues that are raised in this complex case.  For instance, I am precluded from interfering in Garda operational matters or criminal investigations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or investigations by GSOC.

In the most recent review of progress in June, 91 recommendations were found to have been implemented; a further 49 recommendations were found to have been partially implemented or<b></b>were<b></b>in progress; and the balance remained under consideration. This represents significant progress in taking forward the Working Group recommendations, with 80% now implemented, partially implemented or in progress. I have committed to advancing the remaining 20%, taking into account the necessary resources that some of these will require. It should also be noted that a small number of the recommendations have been superseded by Government initiatives in the interim since the publication of the Report. The most recent status update is available on my Department's website and on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.</p><p>A key recommendation of the Working Group was the introduction of a single application procedure in the protection process. The International Protection Act 2015 provides for such a procedure. My Department is currently preparing all of the steps necessary to commence the Act. The Act responds to some 26 of the Working Group&rsquo;s recommendations and can be expected to positively address the crucial issue of the length of time that applicants spend in the protection process and in the Direct Provision system; another key concern of the Working Group.</p><p>In addition, significant efforts have been made to deal with those who are longest in the system and at this stage the vast majority of those who are over 5 years in the system and who don&rsquo;t have any impediments to progress, such as pending judicial challenges, have now had their cases processed to completion.  This has been a key achievement that has had a real impact on many people and families in the protection process. </p><p>A transition Task Force was also established last year which put in place important supports to facilitate people with status to integrate into the community. The Task Force reported that 87% of people granted status had moved into the wider community within six months. </p><p>Tangible progress in improving the daily lives of asylum seekers living in Ireland while their application is being processed is also being made. In January last, the former T&aacute;naiste and I announced an increase to the Direct Provision Allowance for children, the first such increase since the introduction of the payment some sixteen years ago. Prescription fees for Direct Provision residents, including children, have also been waived. I have also committed to extending the remit of the Offices of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children to include access for residents in Direct Provision centres. This requires amending legislation which will be processed as soon as possible. The Minister for Education and Skills has also announced a second year of their pilot support scheme for students in the protection system for the academic year 2016/2017.</p></reply>

The person referred to by the Deputy arrived in the State and registered in 2009.  This person accumulated 7 years in October 2016.  As such they do not qualify for a Stamp 4 status.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.  </p><p>I have been informed that on the 31 August 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 314 Garda&iacute;, 26 Garda Reserves and 26 civilians assigned to the Kildare Garda Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation), and the National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. In furtherance of this I announced last week that the Government has approved my proposal for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.  </p><p>Since the Garda College reopened in 2014 there will have been 1,200 trainee Garda recruited by the end of this year.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; and so far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of whom of whom 25 of these have been assigned to Kildare.  Another 150 will attest later this year and will be assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide. </p><p>In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; I was very pleased to announce the commencement of a new recruitment campaign on last September.  The campaign is being organised by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Garda Commissioner.  The existing recruitment campaign (launched November 2015) is ongoing and successful candidates will continue to be called from that campaign this year and into next year. It is expected that successful candidates from the new campaign will enter the Garda College from mid-2017. </p><p><b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>This accelerated recruitment of trainee Garda is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan. This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I expect that the Kildare Division, like all other Garda Divisions will benefit from these new resources becoming available.</p></reply>

Also, cases can be held up for a variety of reasons such as judicial reviews etc.</p><p>It is not possible to ascertain figures in relation to the number of applicants currently with the status of 'leave to remain' as there is a very wide range of persons granted permission to remain for various reasons and the statistics are not compiled in such a way that the number of those granted permission following an examination of whether or not to make a deportation order under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, following an unsuccessful international protection application, can be extracted from the overall figure.  Also, it is not possible to carry out the age analysis of applications requested by the Deputy. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the current system for processing international protection applications involves a number of sequential steps, namely: the first instance asylum decision made by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC), a potential appeal to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT) of a negative asylum decision, an application to ORAC for subsidiary protection and a potential further appeal to the RAT of a negative subsidiary protection decision, before a proposal to deport is issued to an unsuccessful protection applicant under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999.  The Deputy will also be aware that the International Protection Act 2015 provides for the introduction of a single application procedure for international protection, which is specifically aimed at addressing the length of time persons spend in the protection process. The new procedure will streamline and speed up the processing of protection applications and will significantly reduce the length of time that persons spend awaiting a decision on their protection application.</p></reply>

Forecasts of fiscal variables including available fiscal space are routinely updated in these publications. I have outlined previously (Parliamentary Question Number 239 of the 16/09/2016) that the fiscal space in 2017 was largely fixed but was subject to certain moving parts. In aggregate, revisions caused an increase in fiscal space of some &euro;200m or approximately &frac14; of a percent of the overall general government expenditure of &euro;76.6 billion forecast for 2017. These revisions are outlined in Box 1 of Chapter 3 of the Economic and Fiscal Outlook in the 2017 Budget book and for the Deputy's convenience below.</p>  <p>  For 2017, the reference rates and convergence margins were set by the European Commission in its Spring forecast published in May. However, the GDP deflator used is an average of the Commission's Spring and Autumn deflators. As the Commission's Autumn forecasts are not be published until after Budget 2017, this necessitated using the forecast for the Budget deflator from the Department of Finance's Autumn forecasts published on Budget day.  This deflator, reflecting the impact of the 2017 budgetary package, reduced fiscal space by &euro;75m. </p>  <p>  Revisions to the 2015 general government expenditure estimates were provided on a confidential basis to my Department following the first transmission of this data to Eurostat by the CSO. Revisions to the 2015 outturn have resulted in an update to the Department's estimate of the 2016 and 2017 expenditure base. Notably, the estimates of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) were revised for the period 2012 to 2015.  To avoid penalising spikes in government investment in GFCF, the European Commission allows this investment to be averaged over a four year period with the result that any changes to the levels of this investment will impact on available fiscal space. Data from the CSO, revenue and expenditure surveys of the Local Authorities and other general government bodies are returned as part of the budgetary process, these also include updated forecasts of GFCF expenditure in 2016 and 2017 updating further the Department's estimates of the expenditure bases used. The effect of these changes to the estimates of GFCF expenditure in 2016 and 2017 has increased available fiscal space in 2017 by approximately &euro;120m.  </p>  <p>  The changes in fiscal space referred to in Budget Box 1 as "Revised Carryover" were described in Parliamentary Question Number 198 of 18/10/2016 and has two elements. The first being the impact of the revisions to the Revenue Commissioners methodology regarding the calculation of first year and full year costs of potential Budget tax packages. The second element is the impact on the cost of indexation in 2017 of the revised tax base. These changes combined increased fiscal space by &euro;155m.</p></reply>

Changes to these regulations would have to follow the normal EU approach starting with a proposal from the Commission before consideration by Member States and the European Parliament.</p>  <p>  Having said that, it is important to note that there are existing provisions in the fiscal rules that are designed to promote capital expenditure.  For instance, within the expenditure benchmark pillar of the rules, capital expenditure is granted favourable treatment - as a result of four-year capital smoothing, only one quarter of the increase in capital expenditure must be funded in the first year from within the fiscal space. This provision means capital spending for housing and other purposes can be leveraged within the EU rules.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that there are also certain more explicit flexibility provisions within the rules, particularly with a view to encouraging capital expenditure.  These take the form of what is known as the investment clause and structural reform clause.  Specifically, these provisions allow for temporary deviations from the required structural budgetary adjustment if the spending can be shown to qualify for either the investment clause or the structural reform clause. Both of these provisions are subject to strict conditions; and while Ireland has not yet been in a position to apply given where we are in the business cycle, the situation is kept under constant review by my officials.</p>  <p>  The Government is very conscious of the need to boost the supply of critical infrastructure.  Investment in public infrastructure is vital for the medium and long-term competitiveness of the economy as well as for underpinning social cohesion through the provision of vital services to people in the form of schools, public transport, housing, etc. The public capital plan provides for &euro;42 billion of capital investment over the 2016-2021 period and the Government remains committed to this. Further to this the Government set out in the SES proposals for an additional cumulative &euro;5.1 billion in capital spending over the period 2017 -2021. This additional capital spending is aimed at addressing infrastructural bottlenecks and, in particular due to the obvious need for additional investment in housing, at tackling the housing crisis as detailed in the Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has been exploring the objective to create 'off-balance' mechanisms that bring investment into social housing which is additional to the funding being provided directly by the State.  There is ongoing engagement with a broad array of domestic actors and European authorities to explore achievable solutions.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would point out that we are still running a deficit and our public debt remains high by international standards.  The answer, therefore, is not simply about spending more; it is about getting more from each euro of taxpayers money that is spent.</p></reply>

The global portfolio has been restructured and is being sold over time to fund Irish investment commitments as they arise, in keeping with ISIF's mandate to invest, on a commercial basis to support economic activity and employment, in Ireland.</p><p>ISIF's total equity holdings in the Energy sector are valued at &euro;11 million (0.14% of ISIF's assets under management).  ISIF has also invested in circa. &euro;97 million of short term fixed income investments in energy corporations, representing just over 1% of ISIF's assets.</p><p>Such investments should be considered in the context of ISIF's Irish portfolio and its significant commitment to renewables.  ISIF's investment strategy is aligned with government policy and the State's commitment to make the transition to a low carbon, climate resilient and sustainable economy.  The strategy states that ISIF's &euro;800m energy allocation will include a significant element of renewables investment.  To date such investment commitments include:</p><p>- &euro;44 million for the &euro;500 million Dublin Waste to Energy project.</p><p>-  &euro;35 million commitment to NTR's onshore wind fund.</p><p>-  Investment in Bluebay SME credit fund which has made loans to Gaelectric and Mainstream, Irish headquartered renewable energy developers.</p><p>-  Being a cornerstone investor in the Irish Infrastructure Fund (IIF) which holds a number of Irish onshore wind assets, forestry, and a designer/manufacturer of high power density high efficiency power supplies. </p><p>As part of its on-going commitment to operate to high international standards ISIF has recently published its Sustainability and Responsible Investment Policy which is available online at: <i>www.isif.ie/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SustainabilityandResponsibleInvestingPolicyJuly2016.pdf.</i></p><p>The Policy emphasises climate change as part of the integration of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) into its investment decision making. </p><p>Many major funds internationally have made significant divestments from fossil fuels such as coal, while other such funds have adopted an approach of engagement with energy companies to establish their strategy and positioning for the transition to a low carbon economy.  ISIF continually reviews its carbon exposure and the investment case for companies that may not be aligned with the long term transition to a low-carbon economy.</p><p>The National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014, which established ISIF on a statutory basis provides that ISIF shall review its investment strategy after 18 months of operation and that in reviewing its investment strategy shall consult with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and that the Minister for Finance may consult with other Government Ministers, as appropriate.  This review will be completed in Q4 2016 and the issues of decarbonisation and Ireland's long term transition towards a low carbon economy are being considered as part of this process.  </p></reply>

All entitlements held by farmers under the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) expired on the 31 December 2014 when it was replaced by the Basic Payment Scheme under the EU Common Agriculture Policy (CAP).  Accordingly, any gains/losses arising on the disposal of entitlements prior to the abolition of the SPS fall within the scope of CGT in the same manner as chargeable gains/allowable losses made on the disposal of any other chargeable assets.</p>  <p>  Finance Act 2014 introduced section 604C in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in order to provide an exemption from CGT for certain farmers who were required to dispose of their single payment entitlements on foot of changes being introduced at that time under CAP.  The exemption is available in respect of any chargeable gains arising from the disposal by the owners of payment entitlements under the SPS where all of those entitlements were leased out in 2013 and where the owners, because of the change in CAP regulations, were advised by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to transfer their entitlements to an "active" farmer by 15 May 2014.  Losses arising on the disposal of payments entitlements in such circumstances are treated as allowable losses for CGT purposes in the normal manner.</p>  <p>  In addition, a claim for CGT relief may arise under section 538 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in respect of losses incurred by farmers as a result of the abolition of single farm payment entitlements where the entitlements were purchased by the farmers concerned.  The allowable loss is the capital loss equivalent to the amount incurred by the person when the entitlement was acquired. </p>  <p>  Where a claim for relief for an allowable loss is made, the amount of the loss can only be set off against other chargeable gains made by the farmer in that year or in any subsequent year.

Professor John McHale, Chair of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC), has noted that this is the appropriate approach.  The Department's Budget 2017 forecasts have been endorsed by IFAC.</p>  <p>  In the Fiscal and Economic Outlook published with the Budget the Department of Finance has highlighted currency developments as a particular risk noting that  "the euro-sterling rate has appreciated significantly over the past year, and further appreciation remains a distinct possibility with adverse implications for Irish exports to the UK (especially for the more 'traditional' sectors)." (Budget 2017 Fiscal and Economic Outlook, Table 19, Page C.40).</p>  <p>  Currency movements are volatile and hard to predict and that is the reason for the standard assumption about unchanged rates as of a particular cut-off date.  This is also recognised in a note to Table 2, External Assumptions, page C.11 of the Fiscal and Economic Outlook, which acknowledges that the euro-sterling bilateral rate has appreciated since the mid-September cut-off date.  The cut-off date used by the Department of Finance to fix its external assumptions, including exchange rate assumptions, is determined by the requirement to provide these assumptions to the IFAC as part of the endorsement process.</p>  <p>  A sustained appreciation of the euro against sterling, compared to the standard assumption in the Budget 2017 forecasts, would, all else equal, result in a deterioration in Ireland's competitiveness, with a consequent reduction in Irish exports and growth rates.  In this context, the Risk and Sensitivity Analysis chapter in Ireland's Stability Programme April 2016 Update (SPU) included an illustrative assessment of the impact of a 5 percentage point (pp) depreciation of sterling (SPU page 27).  The analysis suggested that such a shock would decrease Irish GDP growth by approximately 0.6 pp and 0.2 pp relative to baseline in the first and second years following such an event, i.e. 2017 and 2018, respectively.  Employment and export growth would also be negatively impacted.</p>  <p>  The Department of Finance will produce a revised set of macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts, including projections of fiscal space, next April as part of the Stability Programme Update.  These forecasts will incorporate information available at that time including exchange rate developments.</p></reply>

The basic rate at present is 41%.</p>  <p>  DIRT is a "final liability tax"   that is, it satisfies the individual's full liability to Income Tax in respect of deposit interest.  The individual may still be liable to PRSI on the interest.  Deposit interest subject to DIRT is not subject to the Universal Social Charge. </p>  <p>  As you are aware, in my Budget speech last week, I announced that the rate of DIRT will be cut by two percentage points for each of the next four years, so that it will have been reduced to 33% by 2020.</p>  <p>   It is estimated that the overall cost of each 2% reduction in the rate of DIRT is some &euro;9 million in a full year, so that by the time the full reduction is in effect in 2020, the annual full year cost is estimated to be approximately &euro;36 million.</p>  <p>  I am aware that in the past the rates payable on a series of other taxes, including Exit Tax, have tended to move in line with DIRT, however on this occasion I took a decision that those other rates would not be reduced.  I decided on this change for the following reasons. </p>  <p>  The cost of reducing the rates of the other taxes  (where the rates payable have tended to move in line with the rate of DIRT) by two percentage points was tentatively estimated by the Revenue Commissioners to be (allowing for rounding) about &euro;14 million per annum, or (allowing for rounding) about &euro;56 million per annum by 2020 the period over which DIRT is to be reduced.  It was therefore too costly to the Exchequer to reduce the rates applying to these taxes in the same manner as the reduction in DIRT.  </p>  <p>  When the rate of DIRT was originally increased, it was aimed at revenue raising and at encouraging consumer spending to boost economic activity.  As consumer expenditure has now increased significantly it is now possible to reduce DIRT rates to encourage saving and improve the return to the small saver.  I am conscious of the impact of DIRT rates on the small saver who invests in retail savings products and where there has been a long period of low interest rates and consequently a low rate of return on such products. </p>  <p>   In common with all taxes, Exit Tax is subject to ongoing review, and in this process the rate of tax as well as all reliefs and exemptions are carefully considered.</p></reply>

Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.  Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership, which is why they are not accorded similar treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law.</p>  <p>  The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. Attorney General (1980).  This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage.  The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.  </p>  <p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage.  Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.</p>  <p>  From a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners.  Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status.  It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting.  It would also be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased.  </p>  <p>  There would also be legal issues with regard to 'connected persons'.  To counter tax avoidance, 'connected persons' are frequently defined throughout the various Tax Acts.  The definitions extend to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners.  This would be very difficult to prove and enforce in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple has no legal recognition.  There may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the extended rate band and the ability to transfer credits.  However, their legal status has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for themselves and persons connected with them.</p>  <p>  The treatment of cohabiting couples for the purposes of social welfare is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Mr. Leo Varadkar TD.  However, it is also based on the principle that married couples should not be treated less favourably than cohabiting couples.  This was given a constitutional underpinning following the Supreme Court decision in Hyland v Minister for Social Welfare (1989) which ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting.</p></reply>

In order to minimise distortion of competition when goods or services are purchased from suppliers in different Member States, the VAT Directive restricts the flexibility of Member States in setting VAT rates, while ensuring the neutrality, simplicity and workability of the VAT system.  VAT rating is restricted with lower limits on the levels of the VAT rates and a list of the goods and services which could benefit from reduced rates. </p>  <p>  The VAT Directive provides that Member States must apply a standard VAT rate, generally between 15% and 27%. Ireland's rate is currently 23%.  The Directive also allows Member States to apply up to two reduced VAT rates to goods and services as listed in Annex III of the Directive.  The application of the 9% VAT rate to tourism activity is possible because of this provision.  Article 110 allows for the continuation of the application of a zero rate or a rate less than 5% to goods or services where that rate applied on and from 1 January 1991.  Ireland takes advantage of this provision in our application of the zero rate to most food, books, medicine and children's clothing, as well as our application of the 4.8% VAT rate on livestock.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, Article 118 of the Directive allows Member States to retain the application of a reduced VAT rate of 12% or more on goods and services not contained in Annex III that had applied at a reduced VAT rate on and from 1 January 1991.  The application of the 13.5% VAT rate in Ireland to domestic fuels, commercial construction and some labour intensive services is based on this provision. </p>  <p>  While the VAT Directive places restrictions on VAT rating to avoid distortion of competition where VAT is based on the origin system, the VAT system is in the process of moving towards a destination principle, where all supplies are taxed in the Member State of the consumer and not the supplier.  In such a scenario a consumer would pay the same VAT on purchases made from any Member State, and as such, there is less of a need for harmonisation of VAT rating among Member States.  In this context, the European Commission's Action Plan on VAT was adopted on 7th April 2016 and contains a proposal to look at VAT rate policy across the EU in 2017.  The Action Plan's proposal on rates may offer Member States more flexibility in the future in determining VAT rates applicable to goods and services.  This forum will provide an opportunity to discuss VAT rates applicable to goods and services, and my Department will engage fully in this process.  However, the Deputy will be aware that any proposed changes to the current EU VAT Directive would require unanimous agreement from all Member States.</p></reply>

This takes the form of a relief from corporation tax which is available for start-up companies in their first three years of trading.  The relief is granted by reducing the corporation tax payable on the profits of the new trade and gains on the disposal of any assets used for the purpose of the new trade. </p><p>The availability of the relief is linked to the amount of Employers' PRSI paid by a company in an accounting period, subject to a maximum of &euro;5,000 per employee and an overall limit of &euro;40,000.  Where the total corporation tax payable by a qualifying start-up company for an accounting period does not exceed &euro;40,000, the aggregate amount of corporation tax referable to income and gains of the qualifying trade in that period will be reduced by the amount of qualifying Employers' PRSI.  Any relief not availed of in the first three years of trading, due to losses or insufficiency of profits, may be carried forward for use in subsequent years.  This is subject to the amount of relief in any year not exceeding the Employers' PRSI contributions of the company, with relief for these contributions capped at &euro;5,000 per employee and &euro;40,000 in total for a year. </p><p>The overall limit of the relief is &euro;40,000 in each of the three years and marginal relief is available where the company has a corporation tax liability between &euro;40,000 and &euro;60,000.  No relief is available where the corporation tax payable is &euro;60,000 or more.  The maximum relief allowable over three years is therefore &euro;120,000.</p><p>The relief is not available in respect of certain activities, including where the trade consists of service company activities as defined in section 441 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  This includes companies whose business consists of carrying on a profession or the provision of professional services.</p><p>Employment &amp;amp; Investment Incentive (EII)</p><p>Small businesses, in their start-up phase, that need to raise additional capital may be entitled to do so under the Employment &amp;amp; Investment Incentive (EII).  Under EII, individuals who buy shares in qualifying companies are entitled to income tax relief.</p><p>Filing of returns on a quarterly basis</p><p>To further reduce the administrative filing burden and to improve cash-flow for small businesses where these businesses have annual PAYE/PRSI or RCT liabilities of less than &euro;28,800, these businesses are eligible to file returns on a quarterly basis rather than on a monthly basis.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-20a.241.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102000052#WRE03000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 and 104 together.</p><p>Estimates of the gross and net fiscal space for the period 2018 to 2021 can be found in Table A7 Annex 2 of the Budget 2017 book.  No fiscal or other estimates have been undertaken for 2022.  For the convenience of the Deputy, the gross and net fiscal space for the period 2018 to 2021 is set out in the following table. <table><tr><th>&euro;billions</th><th>2018</th><th>2019</th><th>2020</th><th>2021</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Gross fiscal space</td><td>1.8</td><td>3.2</td><td>3.5</td><td>3.6</td><td>12.1</td></tr><tr><td>Net fiscal space</td><td>1.2</td><td>2.7</td><td>2.7</td><td>2.7</td><td>9.3</td></tr></table></p><p>Gross Fiscal Space is simply the permitted fiscal space arising from applying the currently forecast benchmark growth rates to the projected expenditure aggregate for the preceding year.  These amounts are not final and are based on indicative projections for the GDP deflators, reference rates and convergence margins for each of the relevant years as set out in Budget 2017 (see Table A.7).  The actual GDP deflators, reference rates and convergence margins values used by the Commission to assess compliance with the rules each year beyond 2017 will be based on Commission estimates for each year compiled in their Spring forecast of the preceding year, and in relation to the GDP deflator, the Autumn forecasts as well, each year.  </p><p>Another source of potential variance relates to the precise composition of the general government expenditure outturn of the preceding year.  This is due to the fact that some items such as interest and the level of cyclical unemployment expenditure are excluded from the expenditure benchmark calculation while gross fixed capital formation is smoothed over a 4 year period.  With regard to cyclical unemployment, the Commission's estimates are based on their own data.  Given the volatility of estimates of structural unemployment for Ireland, which is used to derive cyclical unemployment, calculations of fiscal space are also subject to change due to this factor.</p><p>In the year after a Member State reaches its Medium Term Objective (MTO) set under the balanced budget fiscal rule, the convergence margin requirement under the expenditure benchmark ceases.  As outlined in Table 12 in Chapter 3 of the Budget 2017 book, my Department forecasts that Ireland will reach its MTO of a balanced budget in structural terms, defined as -0.5 percent of GDP,  in 2018.  As a result, the convergence margin would not be applied to the expenditure benchmark calculation from 2019 on.  This leads to a significant increase in the projected fiscal space from 2019 onward, based on the assumption that Ireland will meet its MTO in 2018.</p><p>The net fiscal space is the additional room available beyond spending assumptions included in the Budget's baseline spending projections whilst still complying with the upper limit posed by the Expenditure Benchmark.  The baseline spending projections shown in Table A7 are on an ex-ante basis and do not include the unallocated resources captured in the baseline expenditure projections set out in Table 12.  However, Table A7 does include pre-committed expenditures such as the annual cost of providing for demographic spending pressures together with a number of other anticipated elements such as the Public Capital P lan, the cost of the Lansdowne Road Agreement and a number of other calls on the Central Fund, including increases to the EU budget contribution.  Net fiscal space also takes account of discretionary revenue measures that increase or decrease general government revenue.  The additional revenue generated from a political decision not to proceed with indexation, estimated to yield just below &euro;450m, is included in the discretionary revenue measures set out in Table A7. </p><p>On the basis of the above assumptions, gross fiscal space for 2018 to 2021 amounts to a cumulative &euro;12.1 billion and net fiscal space amounts to a cumulative &euro;9.3 billion.  </p><p>With regard to 2018, the carryover effect of tax measures outlined in Budget 2017 will absorb some &euro;172.5m of the available &euro;1.2billion net fiscal space set out in the table above.</p><p>As set out on page 36 of the Expenditure Report 2017, published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, there is an estimated carryover impact into 2018 of approximately &euro;&frac12; billion arising from certain of the increases in Departmental expenditure included in the Budget Estimates for 2017.  Expenditure estimates in Table A7 will be updated as the details in relation to implementation of Budget measures are further developed.</p><p>The spending review, scheduled to be carried out next year in advance of Budget 2018, will among other issues, consider the policy options for meeting the additional cost arising in 2018 of the Budget 2017 expenditure measures. </p><p>Finally it is important to stress that the figures, as always, are work-in-progress estimates and will evolve over time.</p></reply>

Ireland has a successful track record of competing for, and winning, global foreign direct investment.  One of the key pillars of that success is the growth of the International Financial Services (IFS) sector, in particular over the past 30 years.  Ireland is now recognised internationally as a leading global centre for internationally traded financial services.  The appointment of Minister of State for Financial Services, Eoghan Murphy TD, is a clear signal that international financial services play a vitally important role in the Irish economy.  In March 2015, the Government launched the lFS2020 Strategy, a whole-of-government approach to driving the growth and development of the IFS sector in Ireland.  Following an action plan for 2016, a new action plan for 2017 is being developed in consultation with all key stakeholders which will take on board ongoing developments, both domestically and internationally.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is in a strong position to build on its successful track record and to compete for future mobile investments in the IFS sector.  In a post UK EU referendum environment, the Government will continue to implement the IFS2020 Strategy to drive growth in the IFS sector.  The Government will continue to promote the attractiveness of Ireland as a location of choice for mobile international investment and for talented people.  There will be opportunities for Ireland arising from the UK's decision to leave the EU.  We will of course seek to take those opportunities.  The IFS2020 Strategy, which has been in place long before the UK decision to leave the EU, provides a clear roadmap to maximise any opportunities that might arise.</p>  <p>  A key IFS2020 milestone is the hosting of the second annual European Financial Forum in Dublin Castle on 24th January 2017.  Given the result of the UK referendum and the potential implications for the financial services industry in that country, the Forum is an opportune time to bring more than 600 financial services executives and policy makers from around the world to Dublin.  The themes of EFF 2017 will focus on the challenges and opportunities for the European financial system as both a source and a provider of capital.  The keynotes and panel sessions will have a focus on Europe relative to the North American and Asian financial systems.  </p>  <p>  Over the last two months, Minister of State Murphy has undertaken two significant visits to Asia and North America.  The main purpose of these visits was to promote Ireland as a destination for financial services investment and to launch the IFS Ireland brand in the Asian and North American markets.  Minister of State Murphy will continue to promote Ireland overseas as the perfect European location for financial services investment as the IFS 2020 strategy moves into 2017, including during upcoming visits to the UK in November, and Beijing and Hong Kong in January 2017.</p>  <p>  Finally, Budget 2017 is the latest step to make Ireland "Brexit ready".  The measures announced in Budget 2017 help protect Irish businesses from Brexit volatility, enable them to compete internationally, and make Ireland increasingly attractive for investment.  Specifically in relation to the area of financial services, Budget 2017 included a number of measures to respond to the challenges of Brexit, to mitigate future risks, and to maximise any opportunities that might arise.  These include the reduced capital gains tax to help entrepreneurs, the Foreign Earnings Deduction (FED) extension and amendment, and the extension of the Special Assignee Relief Programme (SARP).  More information on these measures is available in the Budget documentation.</p>  <p>  In addition, Budget 2017 also provides for additional staffing for the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Enterprise Agencies to help them address the challenges and opportunities arising from Brexit.  This will help support the enterprise agencies achieve their growth targets across all sectors of the economy, including the IFS2020 target to create 10,000 net new IFS jobs.</p></reply>

The basic rate at present is 41%.</p>  <p>  DIRT is a "final liability tax"   that is, it satisfies the individual's full liability to Income Tax in respect of deposit interest.  The individual may still be liable to PRSI on the interest.  Deposit interest subject to DIRT is not subject to the Universal Social Charge. </p>  <p>  As you are aware, in my Budget speech last week, I announced that the rate of DIRT will be cut by two percentage points for each of the next four years, so that it will be reduced to 33% by 2020.</p>  <p>   It is estimated that the overall cost of each 2% reduction in the rate of DIRT is some &euro;9 million in a full year, so that by the time the full reduction is in effect in 2020, the annual full year cost (allowing for rounding) is estimated to be approximately &euro;36 million.</p>  <p>  I am aware that in the past the rates payable on a series of other taxes, including Exit Tax on life assurance policies, have tended to move in line with DIRT, however on this occasion I took a decision that those other rates would not be reduced.  I decided on that change for the following reasons. </p>  <p>  The cost of reducing the rates of other taxes (where the rates payable have tended to move in line with the rate of DIRT) by two percentage points  was tentatively estimated by the Revenue Commissioners to be (allowing for rounding) &euro;14m per annum or (allowing for rounding) about &euro;56 million per annum by 2020 the period over which DIRT is to be reduced.  It was therefore too costly to the Exchequer to reduce the rates applying to these taxes in the same manner as the reduction in DIRT.</p>  <p>  When the rate of DIRT was originally increased, it was aimed at revenue raising and at encouraging consumer spending to boost economic activity.  As consumer expenditure has now increased significantly it is now possible to reduce DIRT rates to encourage saving and improve the return to the small saver.  I am conscious of the impact of DIRT rates on the small saver who invests in retail savings and where there has been a long period of low interest rates and consequently a low rate of return on such products. </p>  <p>  In common with all taxes.  Exit Tax is subject to ongoing review, and in this process the rate of tax as well as all reliefs and exemptions are carefully considered.</p></reply>

There are, in all, three separate Group tax-free thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer.  The Group A tax-free threshold applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, step-child and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer.  Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.  As part of Budget 2017, I announced the raising of the Group A tax-free threshold from &euro;280,000 to &euro;310,000.  This higher threshold will take effect for all gifts and inheritances that are received on or after 12 October 2016.  The increased Group A threshold will be provided for in the Finance Bill. </p>  <p>  Any prior gift or inheritance received by a beneficiary since 5  December 1991 from within the same Group threshold is aggregated for the purposes of determining whether any tax is payable on a current benefit.  Tax at the rate of 33% is payable on any excess received over the relevant tax-free threshold.  As regards the scenario put forward by the Deputy, the position is that once the Finance Bill is passed into law, an individual who had already received aggregate benefits under the Group A category since 5 December 1991 of &euro;260,000 and who then receives a further benefit of &euro;50,000 under that same category on or after 12 October 2016 would not have exceeded the amended Group A tax-free threshold applicable at the date of the latest benefit (i.e. &euro;310,000) and would have no CAT liability.  Any further gift or inheritance from a Group A disponer  which brings the aggregate above this threshold sum would be subject to CAT at 33%.</p></reply>

The Strategy sets out the Government's commitment to improving and using skills for sustainable economic growth.  It outlines how we can develop a well-skilled, adaptable workforce that contributes to, shares in and benefits from opportunities of economic expansion. This strategy will ensure increased access to high quality and relevant education and training and skills development opportunities.  It will allow people to benefit from workplace learning and experience, and to enable effective participation by all in the economy and society. The Strategy states 'Students at all levels can be supported to apply their creativity and curiosity to scientific issues. They will be encouraged to consider science and technology within a wider context and to draw in insights from other studies such as the humanities, for example through cross-disciplinary project work. Options can also be offered for STEM students to take non STEM elective subjects that pique their curiosity. This crossover of arts-related subjects with STEM, sometimes referred to as STEAM, can make science more relevant to day-to-day situations and can help prepare students for the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of research activity (both within academia and industry). The Arts in Education Charter will support this approach at school level'. </p>  <p>  The Arts in Education Charter, launched in 2013, has been a landmark development in relation to the promotion of arts education and arts in education in Ireland.  The Charter is an initiative of my Department, the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, working in association with the Arts Council.  My Department is involved in ongoing liaison with the Department of Arts, Heritage Regional, Rural and  Gaeltacht Affairs on the implementation of the Arts in Education Charter objectives. The Programme for a Partnership Government also recognises the Charter as providing an unprecedented opportunity for children and young people to engage in a proactive and meaningful way with arts in education in Ireland and commits to its implementation. Good progress has been made on implementation of the Charter objectives, as set out below under a number of key headings.</p>  <p>  A &ndash; Under the auspices of the Charter, quality arts in education integration is teaching and learning in which arts learning and other academic learning are connected and deepened. Arts integration results in students engaging in a creative process which connects an art form and another subject area and meets evolving objectives in both while enhancing self-confidence, team working, risk taking and creative skills. Learning experiences in the arts contribute to the development of academic skills. Integrating the arts into the broader STEM curriculum provides pathways for personal meaning-making and self-motivation. It brings a cross-disciplinary, integrated focus on learning that engages and inspires students, brings students with diverse interests together in a team environment, and encourages imaginative, innovative, and critical thinking towards solving problems. </p>  <p>  B -The Arts in Education Portal (www.artsineducation.ie): Ireland's first Arts in Education Portal, the key national digital resource for arts in education in Ireland and a major resource for arts education in Irish schools, was launched in May 2015.  </p>  <p>  C - Teacher &ndash; Artist Partnership as a model for Continuing Professional Development (CPD) initiative: An important development is the more focused attention to helping artists and teachers to develop together their understanding, expertise and creative pitch for arts in education work for children at different age levels.  A significant initiative in this regard was the initiation in 2014 by the Charter Group of a pioneering programme of joint teacher - artist collaboration in continuing professional development.  The scheme, &lsquo;Exploring Teacher Artist Partnership as a Model of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for Supporting and Enhancing Arts Education&rsquo;, commenced in 2014. It is intended that the Education Centres, responsible for local delivery of national programmes of teacher professional development on behalf of my Department, will have the capacity to implement this model locally and regionally into the future. </p>  <p>  D - Artists in Residencies in Higher Education Institutions: Significant developments regarding arts in education for initial teacher education have also been taking place.   Higher education institutions, particularly colleges of education, have been extending their offerings of arts in education courses and experience for student teachers.  The provision of a set of 'artists in residency' bursaries by the Arts Council, for such institutions, has been a major boost to this work.</p>  <p>  E - Artists-Schools Guidelines: The Artists-Schools Guidelines were originally published in 2006. A number of changes have occurred in the arts in education landscape in Ireland since the Guidelines were first published.  A significant change arising from the Charter is the launch of a national digital resource for the arts in education at www.artsineducation.ie.   Given this changing landscape, the Arts Council, on behalf of the Implementation Group of the Arts in Education Charter, is currently reviewing the Artists-Schools Guidelines to examine whether and how they should be updated to continue to act as a useful resource.  </p>  <p>  F - ARIS &ndash; Arts Rich Schools: The Arts in Education Charter charges the Arts Council, in co-operation with the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht and my Department, with the promotion of Arts Rich Schools (ARIS).  According to the Charter &ndash; &lsquo;ARIS will incentivise and recognise those schools (primary and post-primary) which in a range of ways make the arts a key part of school life and place the arts centrally within the life of the school community affecting pupils primarily but also teachers, parents, other staff and community.&rsquo; A working group is assisting with the development of Ar&iacute;s and the development of a feasible implementation plan for a first phase of Arts over three years (2017-2019).  </p>  <p>  G - Music Generation: The Music Generation initiative is co-ordinated and managed by Music Generation Ltd. through its National Development Office. Between 2010 and 2015, 11 Music Generation Music Education Partnerships (MEPs) were established as part of Phase 1 of the initiative, with the aim to provide non-mainstream vocal and instrumental music tuition for young people. In 2015, Music Generation Ltd. announced Phase 2 of the initiative during which up to 9 additional new MEPs will be established over the period from 2016 up to 2020. Initial funding for 50% of Phase 1 of the Music Generation initiative came from philanthropic sources with the remaining 50% funding from MEPs, with the Exchequer taking up 50% funding after 3 years. Phase 2 will be similarly funded.</p>  <p>  H - Non-mainstream Music Education Bursary Scheme: The Department of Education and Skills also established the new Non-mainstream Music Education Bursary Scheme in February 2016, worth &euro;50,000. The Purpose of the scheme is to provide support by way of a cash grant to established, smaller-scale, non-mainstream music education/community music initiatives with limited or no access to other forms of public funding. </p>  <p>  I - School Policies: The Charter envisages that schools, in their school policies and plans, shall incorporate arts in education opportunities as an important aspect of enriching the curriculum and the wider life of the school.  Schools will be assisted by my Department in this aspect of their school planning and self-evaluation. Making provision for arts in education practice will also be reflected in the design and equipping of school buildings.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has also established reciprocal partnership with the Arts Council in the promotion of the arts in schools, as set out in the Charter.</p></reply>

I strongly support any measures that can be put in place to reduce costs for parents.  All schools must be sensitive to the financial pressures on parents in making decisions, not just about school uniforms or books, but about any matter that has cost implications for parents. </p>  <p>  In relation to school transport I wish to inform the Deputy that children who are eligible for school transport pay an annual charge of &euro;100, subject to a maximum of &euro;220 per family; the charge can be paid in two instalments in July and December.  These children are exempt from paying the annual charge if they hold valid Medical Cards (GMS Scheme).</p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Education outlines hundreds of actions to be implemented over the 3 year period 2016 to 2019.  Some of the actions as part of the plan are to strengthen the focus on reducing school costs for parents by:</p>  <p>  -  Restoring capitation funding over a three-year period as resources permit</p>  <p>  -  Increasing the financial support for book rental schemes, in order to reduce or eliminate school book costs for parents</p>  <p>  -  Issuing a new circular to school authorities and ETBs regarding school uniform policy and other costs and the need to put a greater emphasis on reducing the cost of school uniforms and other costs</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 represents the start of a major programme of reinvestment in education, and the first phase of implementation of the Action Plan for Education, aimed at becoming the best education system in Europe within a decade. </p>  <p>  It was not possible to provide additional funding in Budget 2017 in relation to this element of the Action Plan due to the many competing demands for the available funding.  However, this commitment remains a priority for me to address as soon as possible during the lifetime of the Action Plan.  It is important to note that the total allocation to this Department for additional policy measures, after demographics and Industrial Relations commitments, was &euro;130 million and of which all our commitments in higher and further education and primary and secondary schools had to be funded.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s position in relation to voluntary contributions is that they are permissible provided it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay.  I have no plans to alter this position so long as schools ensure that the contributions are sought in a manner that makes this clear to all concerned.</p>  <p>Separately, the Deputy will be aware that the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, which was published on 6th   July 2016, contains a provision prohibiting the charging of fees or seeking payment or contributions for an application for admission to a school or for the enrolment or continued enrolment of a student in a school.</p>  <p>  I also intend to introduce a stronger complaints procedure and a charter for parents.  It is important that schools should consult parents on matters relating to their children's education, including those matters which have cost implications, and schools should be responsive to the views and concerns of parents.  In that regard requiring schools to have a parent charter will ensure that schools will interact better with parent associations and with individual parents.</p>  <p>  I plan to make an announcement shortly on draft legislation that will replace Section 28 of the Education Act, 1998 and require every school to publish and operate a Parent and Student Charter in accordance with national guidelines. These guidelines will be published after consultation with the education partners. </p>  <p>  I believe that these actions will significantly strengthen the focus on reducing school costs for parents.</p></reply>

The Primary Curriculum (1999) makes it clear that both the development and the implementation of the curriculum in religious education in primary schools is the responsibility of the relevant church authorities. </p><p><b>Developing a curriculum for religious education in primary schools:</b></p><p>The Primary Curriculum documentation developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) in 1999 does not include a curriculum for Religious Education and my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate does not evaluate the religious education programme provided by a primary school. Religious education programmes delivered in denominational primary schools are designed by church authorities and multi-denominational schools (such as Educate Together schools and Community National Schools) take responsibility for designing their own programmes.</p><p>Currently, the NCCA is revising the primary curriculum. In September 2016, the new Primary Language Curriculum for junior infants to second class commenced implementation. This work will continue for all other aspects of the primary curriculum over the coming years.</p><p><b>Implementing a curriculum for religious education in primary schools:</b></p><p>The Primary Curriculum 1999 recognises the affective, aesthetic, spiritual, moral and religious dimensions of the child&rsquo;s experience and development. The Curriculum provides for the child&rsquo;s spiritual, moral and religious development through the breadth of learning experiences the curriculum offers, through the child&rsquo;s engagement with the aesthetic and affective domains of learning, and through the inclusion of religious education as one of the areas of the curriculum. </p><p><b>The basis on which teachers teach a religious education programme in primary schools:</b></p><p>The patron of the school determines its ethos and in a denominational school, it is the responsibility of the school management, through the teachers in the school, to provide a religious education that is consonant with its ethos. The board of management has responsibility for the overall management of the school and, within the resources available to it, the board provides support for the implementation of all aspects of the curriculum. The contract that a teacher signs with a board is a matter for that teacher and the board of management of the school and my Department does not have a role in that process.</p><p>When students are studying to become primary teachers, they study a programme that reflects the primary curriculum in order to graduate as teachers. In addition, colleges of education offer a certificate in religious studies. More recently, most colleges have developed new approaches to the methodology of religious education, which typically emphasise ethics, moral education and education about belief systems. Teachers employed in primary schools will be aware that some boards of management require a teacher to have satisfactorily completed the certificate course or equivalent in order to be considered for appointment. They will also be aware of the school&rsquo;s approach to religious education or alternative programmes offered, such as ethics, moral education and education about other belief systems.</p><p><b>Time in primary schools:</b></p><p>The Primary Curriculum 1999 provides a suggested minimum weekly time framework to assist teachers and schools in planning the implementation of the curriculum. The guideline framework includes time for secular teaching, including discretionary time which can be allocated, at the teacher&rsquo;s and at the school&rsquo;s discretion, to any of the six curriculum areas or to any of the subjects within them. A minimum weekly time allocation of 20 hours (including discretionary time) is recommended for each of the six curriculum areas. In addition, typically, 2.5 hours is allocated to religious education in the weekly time framework. The balance of the time in the week available provides for breaks and assembly time.</p></reply>

Responsibility for deciding on the quantum of educational supports and resources to be allocated to schools to support individual students with special educational needs, rests with the NCSE, in accordance with my Department's policy. </p><p>The role of the NCSE includes processing applications from schools for S support taking into account the frequency and extent of the care needs as referenced in the professional report, the manner in which they arise in a school setting and in this regard, the evidence the school can provide to support the application.  The NCSE can also consult with other professionals e.g. my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) and will allocate a level of S support to a school to ensure that the school has sufficient resources to cater for the significant care needs of the relevant children who are enrolled in the school for whom it has been indicated that there is a care requirement.  </p><p>The NCSE allocates S support to schools in accordance with the criteria set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014, which is available on my Department's website at: <i>www.education.ie</i>, in order that students who have care needs can access S support as and when it is needed.  It should be noted, however, that S allocations are not made to individual children, but are made to schools to support the care needs of children with assessed special educational needs in the school.</p><p>The professional assessment of children is not within the remit of the SENO, however, the consideration of professional reports is an integral part of determining the extent of supports to be provided for pupils with special educational needs.  Whereas professional reports provide valuable assistance to education providers in identifying a diagnosis or identifying appropriate interventions, health staff have been directed by the HSE not to include references to the specific quantum of educational resources in their reports, reports should state the outcome of assessments carried out and the range of needs of the child as clearly as possible.  While a medical or relevant professional report can indicate the care needs that a child may have, the Health professional will not have knowledge or awareness of the current resources available to a school to cater for these care needs, will not be aware of the layout of the school, or have had an opportunity to observe the child in class or observe their interaction with their teachers and classmates on an ongoing basis. </p><p>The NCSE has informed my Department that the child in question has been granted access to S support since May 2016.  Where a school wishes to appeal the S allocation which has been made to them, they may do so through the NCSE appeals process, details of which are set out at <i>www.ncse.ie</i>. The option to invoke the appeals process is open to the school and parents in question.  I am informed that the NCSE has no record of an appeal having been received in regard to the level of support allocated to the school. </p><p>All schools have the contact details of their local SENO.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on the NCSE website, <i>www.ncse.ie</i>. </p></reply>

The budget allocation will facilitate the remediation of approximately 400 dwellings under the scheme in 2017.</p>  <p>  In general terms, the cost of pyrite remediation is largely dependent on the dwelling type, the number of units in a project, the floor area of the dwellings, the depth of hardcore in the units and the presence or otherwise of under-floor heating systems.  Against this background, remediation costs can vary significantly and may not always be directly comparable across projects.  While my Department monitors overall expenditure under the scheme, the costs associated with individual projects are determined through competitive procurement processes conducted by the Housing Agency on behalf of the Pyrite Resolution Board.</p></reply>

The Directive requires all member states to define set periods when the land application of fertiliser , including slurry, is not allowed and in Ireland the closed season commenced on 15 October.  The closed periods in Ireland were decided following extensive consultation and were discussed with farming bodies and the European Commission when Ireland&rsquo;s Nitrates Action Programme was introduced.  The provisions of the Regulations are underpinned by scientific research and good agricultural practice.  The most recent scientific studies carried out on a diverse range of farm and soil types as part of Teagasc&rsquo;s on-going Agricultural Catchments Programme has provided further evidence in support of the efficacy of the prohibited spreading periods in reducing nutrient losses to waters.</p><p>Ireland faces considerable challenges in meeting the requirements of the Water Framework Directive to bring all waters back to good status at least.  Taking those challenges and the evidence in support of the benefit of closed periods into consideration, I am not proposing any blanket variation at the present time to the terms of the NAP.  However, where there is a risk to animal welfare due to circumstances outside the farmer's control, I understand that farmers with such concerns can contact the Nitrates Section of the Department of Agriculture at (053) 9163444 or by email to with details of the flooding situation, their herd number and other relevant data.</p></reply>

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least 1 year.  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the Scheme is determined by the relevant housing authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act.  In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, housing authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. In this case, a pensioner with a social welfare pension income of over &euro;22,000 a year would not be eligible to purchase a house under this Scheme as their primary source of income is from a social welfare payment.   </p>  <p>  In order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme, it is essential that an applicant&rsquo;s income is of a long-term and sustainable nature.  This is necessary to ensure that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government and reaffirmed in Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, it is intended that a review of the Scheme will be undertaken in January 2017 following the first 12 months of operation and any changes to the terms and conditions of the scheme which are considered necessary based on the evidence gathered at that stage will be brought forward.</p></reply>

In relation to the 2016 shortfall of &euro;181m, the Government decided that this will be met by a combination of: additional subvention, funded by savings of &euro;110m from the Water Conservation Grant; the conversion of an already planned 2016 working capital loan of &euro;58m, into subvention; and a reallocation of savings of &euro;13 million.  The 2017 shortfall of &euro;125m arising from the suspension of domestic water charges to 31 March 2017 will be metby a corresponding increase in public subvention. </p><p>The Government has established an Expert Commission to make recommendations for the sustainable long-term funding model for the delivery of domestic water and wastewater services by Irish Water.  The Commission will report to a Special Oireachtas Committee and consideration of recommendations on the funding model will ultimately be voted upon by the Oireachtas next year.  Pending the outcome of the Expert Commission on the funding of domestic water services and the consideration of the Commission&rsquo;s report by the Oireachtas, it is not possible to determine what financial implications may arise for Irish Water post March 2017. </p><p>As regards Irish Water&rsquo;s capital investment, the Programme for a Partnership Government reflects the overall commitment to a capital investment of &euro;5.5 million to end of 2021, as set out in Irish Water&rsquo;s Business Plan 2014-2021.  The investment programme for the period 2017-21 will be subject to review by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), and any Government funding will be subject to future budgetary decisions.</p><p>On 30 September last, the CER published its consultation on the level of Irish Water's allowed revenue, including proposals on operational and capital budgets, for the 2017 and 2018 period with a view to a final decision being made by the CER by end 2016.

This includes the domestic water metering programme.  The domestic metering contracts, awarded in 2013, had the objective of installing 1,050,000 domestic meters over a 3 year programme, which started in August of that year, supported by a budget of &euro;614m including VAT.  I understand from Irish Water that the expected capital expenditure under the programme will amount to &euro;465m, which will deliver 880,000 meter installations on completion.

As such, those with a stronger attachment to the workforce, who have paid more into that fund, are more likely to be paid under that scheme.  There are a number of criteria which must be satisfied in order to qualify for a State pension contributory.  These include that the person must be aged 66 or over, and that they have at least 520 paid contributions, i.e., a minimum of 10 years of paid contributions. Since 1961, when contributory pensions were first introduced, the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; contributions test has been used in calculating the level of pension entitlement, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life (from their entry into insurable employment up to the year prior to their reaching State pension age).  </p><p>Social insurance contributions (Class S PRSI) were introduced for self-employed people on 6th April 1988.  These contributions provide<font color="#004080"> </font>cover for self-employed people for long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widows/widowers pension (contributory).  In addition to the qualifying conditions above, a person must have paid self-employment contributions in respect of at least one contribution year prior to reaching age 66,<font color="#004080"> </font>and all self-employment contributions payable must have been<font color="#0000FF"> </font>paid in full. </p><p>There is also a State pension (contributory) half-rate pension for self-employed people.  The legislation providing for this partial pension came into effect from the 9th of April 1999 to provide a basic payment for groups who would not otherwise qualify for a contributory social welfare pension, and who did not satisfy the means test for the State pension (non-contributory).  In this case, the measure was designed to benefit self-employed people who were already over 56 years of age when compulsory self-employed social insurance was introduced in 1988, who had not paid other contributions (such as voluntary contributions, or other contributions while in employment), and who could not therefore satisfy the condition of having entered insurance 10 years before pension age.  The pension requires a minimum of 5 years contributions and is payable at 50% of the standard rate.  The pension was seen as a reasonable response to the position of the self-employed who were in their late 50s when Class S contributions were introduced, and I believe most would agree that it represents good value for the contributions made  <font color="#0000FF">.</font></p><p>It is worth noting that the most recently published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund found that the self-employed achieve very good value for money from the fund. </p><p>EU Regulations provide for the inclusion of social insurance periods a person has incurred in another Member State(s), in a combined Irish/EU record, for the purposes of state pension contributory (SPC) eligibility. Taking the combined record into account, and subject to their satisfaction of the standard SPC eligibility conditions set out in domestic legislation, a claimant may qualify for a reduced-rate &lsquo;pro-rata&rsquo; EU state pension (contributory) under EU Regulations. These arrangements apply to all countries covered by EU legislation, including EEA countries Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.</p><p>All such applications are first assessed under Irish legislation, on the basis of the claimant&rsquo;s Irish contributions record only, then separately under EU legislation, using the pro-rata calculation method. If the eligibility conditions are satisfied, the most financially beneficial pension entitlement is awarded.  <font color="#0000FF"> </font></p><p>There are also a series of Social Security Agreements which apply to other countries not covered by EU regulations, including the United States of America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, the Republic of Korea and Switzerland. These agreements protect the pension entitlements of Irish people who go to work in these countries and they protect workers from those countries who work in Ireland.  They allow periods of Irish social insurance and depending on the legislation in the other country, periods of residence/contributions which are completed in the second country to be taken into account so that the worker may have his/her entitlement to a pension determined.  They also include arrangements for posted workers who are sent on temporary work assignments from one country to the other by deciding which country's social security legislation will apply to the workers.</p><p>Where a person<font color="#0000FF"> </font>is unable to meet the qualifying conditions for a State pension (contributory), or is only eligible for a reduced rate of contributory pension, they may alternatively apply for State pension (non-contributory) amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate which is subject to a means-test. Alternatively if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

They are designed to be a temporary fixed-term activation intervention as a stepping stone back to employment. However, the work experience does not represent paid sustainable employment in the open labour market.</p><p>JobPath is a new approach to employment activation that supports people who are long-term unemployed and those most distant from the labour market to secure and sustain full-time paid employment.  Participants on JobPath receive intensive individual support to help them tackle barriers to employment and to assist them in finding jobs.  Each person is assigned to a personal adviser who assesses a person&rsquo;s skills, experience, challenges and work goals.  The personal adviser works with the jobseeker to agree a personal progression plan that includes a schedule of activities, actions and job focused targets.  Participants are also provided with a range of training and development supports including online modules, career advice, CV preparation and interview skills.  They spend a year on JobPath and if they are placed into a job they will continue to receive support for at least three months and up to twelve months while in employment.</p><p>The following table sets out the number of people on the Live Register as at end September for the locations in question. It also shows the number of people who were in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) payment for more than one year and it also shows the number of people who have been referred to Seetec. <table><tr><th>Office</th><th>Live Register</th><th>JA&amp;gt; 1 year</th><th>Referred to Seetec</th></tr><tr><td>Ballinrobe</td><td>570</td><td>280</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>Clifden</td><td>772</td><td>450</td><td>197</td></tr><tr><td>Galway (includes Oughterard)</td><td>7,580</td><td>4,045</td><td>2,470</td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>8,922</td><td>4,775</td><td>2,742</td></tr></table>It is not possible to provide figures for the number of people available in each area who might qualify for the community employment scheme as the range of eligibility criteria is very broad and data is not readily available.  Having regard to the eligibility criteria for T&uacute;s, the number of people who are in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for more than one year less the number of people on JobPath is indicative of the numbers who could be eligible for T&uacute;s i.e. c. 2000.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the deputy.</p></reply>

They were:  Language skills; Experience of election observation; Knowledge of human rights and / or governance issues; and Experience of living in challenging environments.  Following the appraisal process, a new roster comprising of 200 individuals with a strong mix of skills and experience came into effect on 15th May 2013. </p>  <p>  For each election observation mission, the EU or OSCE set out their specific requirements and, on the basis of expressions of interest from roster members, the Department draws up a list of applicants.  In selecting nominees to be put forward, the specific criteria set by the EU or OSCE, including relevant local and regional experience, language proficiency, gender and length of time since serving on a mission, provide the main basis for decision-making.  In many cases, the EU and OSCE also invite Member States to nominate new observers or observers with limited experience and this is also factored into the nomination process.  Following consideration of the applicants, a draft list of nominees is submitted for Ministerial approval.  </p>  <p>  In the case of EU election missions, the final selection of observers from the list of approved nominees submitted by the Department rests with the European Commission.  In the case of OSCE election missions, all the observers nominated by the Department are usually selected. Overall, Irish nominees have a high success rate and by the end of 2016, a total of more than 60 observers will have participated in Election Observation Missions, compared to 46 in 2015.</p>  <p>  Ireland participates actively in the European Commission and European External Action Service-led Election Observation network, which brings together election observation Focal Points from all 28 EU Member States, together with Canada, Switzerland and Norway.  The network facilitates exchange of information and best practice on all aspects of election observation monitoring, and helps to ensure that we are acting in accordance with that best practice.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the Irish nominees who have a strong mix of skills and experience, are of the necessary standard to participate in international election observation missions.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the Agreement there is no difference in the rate of overtime for those on salaries up to &euro;35,000. </p><p>For those who were required to work additional hours under the terms of the Agreement, the denominator for the calculation of overtime increased and the overtime rate reduced accordingly. </p><p>As there was no increase in hours for those who worked a 39 hour net week, as a compensating measure, an hour of overtime worked each week was unpaid until 31<sup>st</sup>March 2014.</p><p>Details of the revised overtime arrangements are available on my Departments website </p></reply>

As set out in the summary response to the Committee's report published last week on the Budget 2017 website , the Government is committed to increasing investment spending in a managed and sustainable manner that ensures value-for money from increased public investment.  The Programme for a Partnership Government makes clear that the existing Capital Plan is the starting point for increased investment in priority areas over the coming period.  The Mid-Year Expenditure Report set out the cumulative total additional capital of &euro;5.14 billion over and above that allocated in the Capital Plan for the period to 2021.  The review of the Capital Plan will assess how additional funding is to be allocated across Departments to meet investment priorities.  </p><p>Finally, in light of the level and GDP share of capital spending in the period to 2009 set out in the table, I would also draw the Deputy's attention to Figure 6 on page 6 of the Expenditure Report which highlights that gross voted expenditure grew by 57 per cent, 26 per cent and 38 per cent over the three three-year intervals 1999-2002, 2002-2005 and 2005-2008 respectively.  This highlights the extent to which growth in public expenditure growth was unsustainable over that period, culminating in the fiscal collapse that followed.  This draws attention to the importance of ensuring, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Partnership Government, that growth in public spending - including both current and capital expenditure - is consistent with the requirements of the EU Fiscal Rules.</p></reply>

I will be announcing details of this new initiative shortly.</p><p>All of this represents real and substantial funding increases across the arts and cultural area and has been welcomed across the sector.  It also reaffirms the commitment of this Government to progressively increase funding for the arts as the economy improves, as set out in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>. </p><p>It should be noted that the majority of the &euro;49 million allocation to my Department for this year's Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme was capital funding that went towards a series of 'Permanent Reminder' projects, including the new 'Witness History' visitor centre at the GPO, the refurbishment of Richmond Barracks, the Kevin Barry Rooms at the National Concert Hall and the Athenaeum in Wexford.  With the completion of the various 'Permanent Reminder' projects, the capital funding provided for them will not be required in 2017.  The projects themselves will, of course, continue to be a positive and lasting legacy for the people of Ireland. </p><p>I understand that the source of the reference to 0.6% of GDP quoted by the Deputy is a Council of Europe research project and that m any European countries, including ten EU member states, are not included in the data.  I understand also that the data is not standardised and is not comparable across countries.  For example, local authority expenditure on the arts, the artists ' exemption tax relief, expenditure on public service broadcasting and the Irish language are not included in the figures for Ireland but comparable figures are included in the data for some other countries.</p><p>I have previously stated that further research on this issue is warranted and my Department is considering the matter at present.  The issue of a definition of culture and of capturing public expenditure on culture is an element of the draft <i>Culture 2025</i>framework policy, which was forwarded to the Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs for input in July last.</p></reply>

The process included full public consultation and an in-depth review of all proposed candidate sites.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, my Department has engaged with local authorities and local groups from the areas with proposals on the Tentative List to gauge the extent of the support available to advance the proposals and to clarify the work and resources required for that purpose.  The fundamental requirement is that each site must be capable of demonstrating Outstanding Universal Value to UNESCO. </p>  <p>  Technical evaluations have been produced for each of the six sites forming part of the Royal Sites serial nomination which are currently being reviewed by experts.  My Department is examining a draft of the Burren evaluation document which will be completed as quickly as possible to allow the evaluation itself to proceed. In the case of the Historic City of Dublin proposal, this is being advanced by Dublin City Council and my Department is represented on the Steering Committee </p>  <p>  The next steps will involve developing Management Plans for each site (a UNESCO requirement) and the designation of core and buffer zones in each case.  At each stage local consultation is required.  This process will also have to take into account the fact that some sites will be managed by the Office of Public Works, others by local authorities and that two monuments on the Royal Sites list are privately owned.  Another - Eamhain Macha in Armagh - is in Northern Ireland.  The culmination of these steps will be the creation of the full nomination documents for each site for submission to UNESCO. </p>  <p>  I am committed to supporting the current proposals in every way that I can but the process is a lengthy one and all of the work at every stage must be supported and developed from the local level up with stakeholder buy-in and commitment at each and every stage.  While this adds to the timescale, it is infinitely preferable than a top down approach that fails to engage with local communities.  It also ensures a far better chance of best care and support for the protection and preservation of these sites into the future.</p></reply>

As set out on that reply, the question of access to second-level education through Irish is primarily a matter for the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>In the context of its responsibility for coordinating the implementation of the <i>20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030, </i>however, my Department works in close cooperation with a number of key stakeholders, including the Department of Education and Skills.  In that regard, my Department maintains regular contact with these stakeholders with regard to progressing the implementation of a number of important measures, including educational measures, under the Strategy. </p><p>Given the critical role of education in achieving the objectives detailed in the 20-Year Strategy, I can assure the Deputy that this close co-operation will continue to be a priority and I look forward to further engagement with my colleague, Richard Bruton, TD, Minister for Education and Skills, in relation to these matters.</p><p>In this regard, I should say that the Cabinet Committee on Arts, Irish, the Gaeltacht and the Islands is working to ensure coherence and focus in the range of activities, both ongoing and in planning, to support and promote the Irish language within the wider context of national identity, culture and creativity.  I am pleased to be a member of that Committee and I look forward to working with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, within that framework.  Indeed, I am particularly pleased that he will shortly publish his new <i>Policy on Gaeltacht Education</i>, which will set out how the education system will contribute to supporting and promoting the future use of Irish as a living indigenous language in the Gaeltacht.  I know that this policy has been the subject of extensive consultation with the various stakeholders &ndash; including my own Department - and I am confident that it will be widely welcomed.</p></reply>

As I mentioned in these replies, by way of supporting the maintenance and development of the Irish language as a community and household language in the Gaeltacht, the implementation of the <i>20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 </i>is recognised as a key priority in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>.  Other measures outlined in the Programme include:</p><p>- A focus on job creation in the Gaeltacht, through &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta;</p><p>- Encouraging the attendance by children in Irish-medium pre-schools or na&iacute;onra&iacute; in Gaeltacht areas;</p><p>- Recognising the importance of the status of Irish as a full working language of the EU institutions and working towards ending the derogation, as circumstances allow; and </p><p>- Increasing the investment in the Irish language.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that my Department, together with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, administers a wide range of schemes, programmes and initiatives targeting language and economic development in Gaeltacht areas.  Further details are available on my Department's website at and on the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta website at<i></i>.</p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that in order to further underpin the implementation of the 20-Year Strategy and the language planning process, as set out in Acht na Gaeltachta 2012, a specific allocation of &euro;1m has also been provided in the current year.  As announced in Budget 2017, this allocation is being increased to &euro;1.25m for next year and will further enable my Department, acting in co-operation with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and relevant stakeholders at community level, to implement a range of specific and practical measures aimed at both supporting the implementation of the Strategy, as well as the language planning process in Gaeltacht areas. </p><p>A further increase of &euro;1m in current funding provided in Budget 2017 for the Irish Language, Gaeltacht and Islands programme area will enable my Department to allocate extra resources to Gaeltacht support schemes such as the Irish Language Colleges and Gaeltacht community groups funded by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.</p><p>In relation to the economic development of the Gaeltacht, as Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht, I very much appreciate the importance of job creation in helping to retain sustainable communities in Gaeltacht areas.  In that context, I wish to acknowledge the very important enterprise and employment function of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta as the regional economic agency for the Gaeltacht. In its regional enterprise role in the Gaeltacht, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland and the IDA, will continue to work towards attracting investment to the Gaeltacht, in addition to supporting micro-enterprises and developing the skills base in the Gaeltacht.  In order to enable &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to fulfil its job creation and job retention role in the Gaeltacht, an overall allocation of capital funding totalling &euro;6.687m has been provided by the Exchequer to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s in 2016, in addition to its own resources from the sale of assets and investments.  I have also secured &euro;2.4m in additional capital to an t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s in 2016.  This additional funding will allow an t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s to progress a number of capital projects on hand, thereby protecting existing jobs and assisting in the creation of new jobs in the Gaeltacht.  As announced in Budget 2017, a capital funding baseline of &euro;6.687m will be provided by the Exchequer to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s in 2017.</p></reply>

It, in tandem with a number of local authorities and village communities, prepared a toolkit which was launched in October 2012 at the inaugural community-led VDS workshop.  The toolkit sets out a step-by-step guide to undertaking a community-led VDS in Ireland, using a collaborative and participative process, and has been developed in accordance with the UNECE Aarhus Convention and the European Landscape Convention (ELC).  The Heritage Council, in collaboration with a number of local authorities, has since been proactive in helping interested communities to develop VDS.  In many ways, the approach followed is similar to the Historic Towns Initiative (HTI) framework, also developed by my Department in collaboration with the Heritage Council, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and relevant local authorities, although it is focussed on smaller communities.  Given the limited scope for funding, my preference is for the continued fostering of a community-led approach rather than the development of a nationwide plan, while considering the possibility of a prioritised targeted approach to towns and villages with a view to not only protecting their character and heritage, but also contributing to regional development through encouraging economic growth and employment.</p><p>However, all approaches are still under consideration as I seek to further strengthen the protection of our built heritage, which I recognise cannot be achieved without the full engagement of the respective local authorities, local communities and interested organisations.</p></reply>

This serves to raise the global awareness of the strong reputation of the Irish arts sector, generate new career opportunities for Irish artists and develop new audiences abroad for Irish artists.  My Department continues to work with the Global Irish Network , which has to date made many significant achievements in relation to highlighting Ireland's creativity on the world stage.  I consider that this is the most appropriate vehicle in which to highlight the achievement of Irish creativity as part of a wider cross- sectorial partnership.  Most notable in terms of this collaborative approach have been <i>Irish Design 2015, </i>with which my Department had a significant engagement in relation to the international programme, and the <i>Imagine Ireland</i>programme in 2011.</p><p>This model of supporting major arts initiatives internationally continues this year with the <i>I am Ireland </i>programme &ndash; the international arts element of the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme, which includes over 550 separate performances and exhibitions with a special focus in key territories - United States, Great Britain, Canada and Australia.  This programme reflects that interest in Irish artistic excellence continues to grow internationally and recognises that this centenary year offers a unique opportunity to build on Ireland's cultural connections and share the talents of Irish artists through many special and diverse events around the world.</p><p>I anticipate that my Department will be closely involved with the Second Global Irish Civic Forum, which the Minister of State for Diaspora Affairs and International Development, Joe McHugh, TD, has convened to meet in Dublin Castle on 2-3 February 2017.  The Civic Forum seeks to bring together representatives of the multitude of organisations working with the Irish diaspora around the world to share ideas and to discuss issues of common concern.  I understand that it is proposed that the Second Civic Forum will look at a number of issues of interest to Irish communities around the world, including culture and the role of cultural heritage in engaging with our Global Irish.</p></reply>

Some of these recommendations had a direct associated programme cost, while others related to policy initiatives that could be taken to support rural economic development.</p><p>The priority recommendation made by CEDRA was the need for a co-ordinated approach to rural development across Government.  The assignment of responsibility to my Department for regional and rural development addresses this key recommendation.  The forthcoming Action Plan for Rural Development will provide an overarching structure for the implementation of initiatives across Government which will benefit rural Ireland.</p><p>Other policy measures across Government that support the recommendations in the CEDRA report include the creation of the Local Enterprise Office network as a &ldquo;first-stop-shop&rdquo; for micro-enterprises, the preparation for the roll-out of high speed broadband, and the provision of loans for small businesses through the Microfinance Loan Fund.</p><p>Programmes under my own Department&rsquo;s remit that can be directly related to the recommendations in the CEDRA report include the Rural Economic Development Zones (REDZ) pilot initiative in 2015, the 2016 REDZ programme, and the Town and Village Renewal Scheme.

Within these allocations, the Arts Council is the primary State agency for funding the arts. In this regard, I secured significant additional funding for the Arts Council as part of Budget 2017.  This will see an increase in the Arts Council allocation of &euro;5 m or 8%.  Details of the Council's funding decisions can be found on its website at the following link <i>www.artscouncil.ie/Who_we_funded/.</i></p><p>Direct funding from my Department for arts primarily relates to capital funding for individual projects, as well as the promotion of Irish arts and culture abroad through Culture Ireland.  A small number of summer schools and similar events receive funding from my Department.  Details of these are on my Department&rsquo;s website at .</p><p>In addition, my Department&rsquo;s support for commemorative events can cover many artistic and cultural responses to the Decade of Commemorations.  This year in particular the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme is providing a rich and inclusive diversity of events both nationally and internationally, to commemorate the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government committed to the publication of Culture 2025 as a priority and the draft Framework Policy Culture 2025 /&Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach was forwarded to the Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in July.</p><p>The Culture 2025/&Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach framework policy sets out: </p><p>-a series of high-level objectives under the heading of Enrich, Engage, Participateto establish Government vision in relation to culture and society in Ireland;</p><p>-  a set of key values including the intrinsic value of culture, the right to participate in the cultural life of the nation, and the role of culture in fostering a more sustainable future in Ireland; and</p><p>-  A series of priority measures for implementation across Government and public bodies.</p><p>I believe that it is important to continue momentum in terms of delivery of the priorities set out in the framework policy and to build on the positive legacy of the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme.</p><p>My Department has, therefore, been developing a cross-Government initiative to mainstream culture and creativity in the life of the nation and to promote individual, community and national well-being.  This will focus on boosting cultural provision and participation in communities and harnessing the goodwill and engagement generated by the commemorative programme this year.  It will also act as the main vehicle to take forward the priorities identified in Culture 2025.</p><p>I have secured funding of &euro;5m in Budget 2017 to underpin this new initiative and I intend to announce further details in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, provides for the protection of architectural heritage.</p>  <p>  The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures.  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.</p>  <p>  The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, administered by my Department, seeks to identify, record, and evaluate the post-1700 architectural heritage of Ireland, uniformly and consistently as an aid in the protection and conservation of the built heritage.  As Minister, I recommend structures rated as being of regional importance or above to the planning authorities for inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures.  However, the making of an addition to, or a deletion from, a Record of Protected Structures is a reserved function of the relevant planning authorities.</p>  <p>  The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, supports a wide range of programmes and initiatives which have a considerable impact in terms of heritage conservation, promotion and raising local community awareness.  These includes schemes like the Heritage Management Grants scheme for the protection and preservation of the built heritage, support for heritage education through the Heritage in Schools Programme and the new heritage tourism trail on the Wild Atlantic Way.  Further information on this work is available on their website www.heritagecouncil.ie.</p>  <p>  There are a number of ways in which my Department acts in respect of possible heritage sites/buildings deemed to be at risk.  Financial support has been provided by my Department through a number of structured schemes for the repair, conservation, preservation or safeguarding of protected structures, sites or monuments.  Such schemes are administered through the local authorities.</p>  <p>  The Structures at Risk Fund seeks to encourage the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and to help to secure the preservation of protected structures, in both private and public ownership, which might otherwise be lost.</p>  <p>  The Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS) was developed to assist with the repair and conservation of structures that are protected under the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended).  In certain cases, the scheme is also available for the conservation of structures within Architectural Conservation Areas (ACAs) where, in the opinion of the local authority, a need for works to enhance the character and appearance of an ACA has arisen and has been demonstrated.</p>  <p>  My Department also has measures at its disposal to facilitate the maintenance and restoration of major historical or cultural sites.  Under the provisions of the National Monuments Acts 1930-2014, my Department has established and maintains the Record of Monuments and Places, which affords legal protection to over 120,000 recorded archaeological sites and monuments in the State.</p>  <p>  As Minister, I am the owner or guardian under the National Monuments Acts of approximately 1,000 national monuments located at approximately 750 sites and in such cases there is a statutory duty to maintain the national monument.  Such maintenance is undertaken by the Office of Public Works (OPW).  Local authorities are responsible under the National Monuments Acts for maintaining the national monuments of which they are owners or guardians.</p>  <p>  My Department is also providing &euro;350,000 of funding to the OPW in 2016 to assist in the conservation and presentation of historic buildings and national monuments in State ownership.</p></reply>

However, the postal sector has been undergoing systemic change both nationally and internationally in recent years, with the increased use of electronic communications leading to the decline in core mail volumes year on year.</p>  <p>  In recognition of this changing business environment, the Post Office Network Business Development Group, chaired by Mr. Bobby Kerr, was established in late 2014 to examine the potential for new and existing Government services to be transacted through the post office network and to identify new business opportunities for the network.</p>  <p>  The final report of the Post Office Network Business Development Group, which was published in January of this year, made a number of recommendations to support the future sustainability of post offices.  These include recommendations in relation to the renewal of the post office network, the development of a basic payment account, the provision of motor tax services, and the creation of hubs around which local economic and social activity could revolve.  The report also recommended that An Post should, following appropriate consultation with postmasters and others, review and amend the five-year strategy for the post office network.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to acting on the recommendations in the report of the Post Office Network Business Development Group.  A number of Working Groups have been established to progress the recommendations, including through the establishment of a Network Renewal Implementation Group, which is being independently chaired by Mr. Kerr.  This Group is examining the number and spatial distribution of post offices, branch modernisation, the streamlining of products and services, postmaster payments and contracts, and training and qualifications for post office employees.</p>  <p>  I have separately established the Post Office Hub Working Group to identify potential models under which the post offices could act as community hubs, especially in rural areas.  My officials are also examining the potential for the post offices to deliver services such as motor tax payments and a basic payment account.</p>  <p>  The Government is, therefore, taking a range of measures to support the post office network to adapt to the changed business environment in which it operates.  The network will, however, continue to operate within the context of An Post&rsquo;s commercial mandate.</p></reply>

The Board supports and promotes the Irish screen industries at major international markets and festivals, promotes inward investment, the use of Ireland as a location for international production and provides support for companies filming in Ireland.  The Film Board also liaises with IDA Ireland and Tourism Ireland in terms of maximising joint opportunities for promotion of Ireland as a location for film productions.  Examples of this could be seen during Ireland&rsquo;s success at the Oscars this year and the promotional activity around the shooting of Star Wars in Ireland.</p>  <p>  In terms of the film industry in general the Programme for a Partnership Government contains a very important commitment to work to progressively increase funding to the arts, including the Arts Council and the Irish Film Board, as the economy continues to improve.  The Deputy may wish to note that Budget 2017 will include an increase of &euro;2 million for the Irish Film Board.  This will bring the Film Board&rsquo;s annual funding to over &euro;16.5 million, and represents a 14% increase in its annual budget.  The increase in funding will allow the Board to invest in even more Irish talent in the year ahead, and it follows on from a very successful year for the Irish film sector in 2016.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s investment will also help to maximise the benefits brought about by the Government&rsquo;s enhancement of the Section 481 film tax credit system, including the decision to increase the cap for eligible expenditure on film projects to &euro;70 million, as announced as part of Budget 2016.</p></reply>

I also invited the Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to provide an input to the development of the Plan. </p>  <p>  Over the last few weeks, my Department conducted an extensive consultation process through a series of workshops around the country, to seek the views of people living and working in rural Ireland on potential measures for inclusion in the Action Plan.  My Department has also held a series of bilateral meetings with key stakeholder groups. </p>  <p>  My officials are currently working through the many suggestions received arising from the consultation process and my objective is to publish the Action Plan for Rural Development before the end of the year.</p>  <p>  My Department has already implemented a number of initiatives which will form part of the multi-annual Action Plan and which will be built on in 2017 and beyond.  These include the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, the REDZ Initiative, the LEADER programme, and the CL&Aacute;R Programme.  Their combined impact, along with other initiatives across Government, will make a real and sustainable difference to rural Ireland.</p></reply>

Prior to deciding whether to reimburse a medicine, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria, including clinical need, cost-effectiveness and the resources available.</p>  <p>  The decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) of pharmaceutical products for the HSE, and can make recommendations on reimbursement to assist the HSE in its decision-making process.  The NCPE used a decision framework to systematically assess whether the drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  I am informed that, following a request from the HSE, the NCPE carried out an assessment of the manufacturer's economic dossier submitted in March 2016 on the cost effectiveness of lumacaftor-ivacaftor (Orkambi).  This dossier included details on all relevant costs and relevant cost offsets including hospitalisation, disease management costs, intravenous antibiotics, adverse events and any additional costs arising in patients not taking Orkambi.</p>  <p>  The NCPE has completed its HTA and submitted it to the HSE. The NCPE determined, following an evaluation of the economic dossier, that the  manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug.  The NCPE have confirmed that  all relevant costs were included in the analysis.</p>  <p>  The HSE has since had further engagements with the manufacturer in an effort to secure significant price reductions for Orkambi.  The HSE will consider the outcome of these engagements and any other, together with the NCPE recommendation, in making a final decision on reimbursement.</p>  <p>  Decisions on pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products within public health systems are a national competence for EU Member States.  However, the issue of pricing and reimbursement of medicines and patient access to affordable medicines has been addressed at European level.  In June of this year the EU Council adopted conclusions on strengthening the balance in the pharmaceutical systems in the EU and its Member States.  Those conclusions invited Member States to explore opportunities for cooperation on pricing and reimbursement of medicines and to identify areas for cooperation which could contribute to higher affordability and better access to medicines.  I have indicated my support for these measures and I welcome the opportunity for Member States to cooperate by sharing information so that we can achieve affordable and sustainable access to medicines.</p></reply>

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health. The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice. </p>  <p>  Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers. Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests. NIAC recommended that the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine be given to all girls aged 12-13 in 2009 and in September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools.  </p>  <p>  By January 2016, over 200 million doses of Gardasil had been distributed worldwide. In Ireland over 580,000 doses of Gardasil have been administered and over 220,000 girls have been fully vaccinated against HPV since it was introduced in 2010.</p>  <p>  No medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, there is therefore on-going pharmacovigilance and monitoring of medicinal products once they are authorised for use. The safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised.  In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the statutory regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  While no medicine (including vaccines) is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level.  </p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women. It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition. It is important to reassure people that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services. The HSE are currently working to put in place a clinical care pathway appropriate to the medical needs of this group.  </p>  <p>  In November 2015, the European Medicines Agency completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine. The review, which the HPRA participated in, specifically focused on rare reports of two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome associated with heart rate increase. The outcome of the review which was carried out by the EMA Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions examined. The European Medicines Agency has advised health care professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of HPV vaccines as there are no new safety concerns regarding HPV vaccines. Healthcare professionals should therefore continue using the vaccines in accordance with the current product information. </p>  <p>  On 12 January 2016, the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the European Medicines Agency stating that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information. This final outcome by the Commission is now binding in all member states.</p>  <p>  The Deputy refers to vaccination policy in Japan. While it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the vaccination policy of another country I note that the controversy over HPV vaccination in Japan has led to much confusion among health care professionals and parents. HPV vaccination was approved in Japan in 2009. Free vaccination began in December 2010 for Japanese girls aged 12&ndash;16 years, and since April 2013 the vaccine has been included in the national immunisation programme. However, in June 2013 the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare suspended pro-active recommendations for the HPV vaccine after unconfirmed reports of adverse events following vaccination appeared in the media. In January 2014 the Vaccine Adverse Reactions Review Committee in Japan investigating these adverse events concluded that there was no evidence to suggest a causal association between the HPV vaccine and the reported adverse events after vaccination. Consequently Japan's regulatory authority has not removed this vaccine. It is still categorised as a publicly subsidised routine vaccination and is available to those who request it. </p>  <p>  I encourage the parents of all eligible girls to ensure that their daughters receive this important cancer preventing vaccine.</p></reply>

It is imperative that existing GP services in these areas are retained and that general practice remains an attractive career option for newly qualified GPs.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government emphasises the need to focus on enhancing primary health care services, including building up GP capacity and increasing the number of therapists and other health professionals in primary care.  The annual GP training intake has increased from 120 prior to 2010 to 172 this year and I am anxious to achieve further increases in future years.</p>  <p>  I am cognisant of the need for a new GP services contract which will help modernise our health service and develop a strengthened primary care sector, and health service management have already progressed a number of significant measures through engagement with GP representatives. The GP contracts review process will, inter alia, seek to introduce further measures aimed at making general practice a fulfilling and rewarding career option into the future.</p>  <p>  Progress to date includes: </p>  <p>-  Changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate flexible/shared GMS/GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday, and</p>  <p>  -  An enhanced supports package for rural GP practices has been introduced in 2016 and includes a change in the qualifying criteria for rural supports and an increase in the financial allowance from &euro;16,216 to &euro;20,000. The number of GPs benefitting from such rural practice supports has increased from 167 to over 300.</p>  <p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion in relation to the introduction of legislation for compulsory service from newly qualified GPs in exchange for student grants or other incentives is not currently under consideration.  However, I am open to considering any innovative proposals that may be tabled in the context of the development of future GP service contracts.</p></reply>

The standards provided for in Irish legislation in relation to the approval of ships for livestock transport are higher than those which apply in other EU Member States and are recognised by the EU Commission as being amongst the most effective and stringent legislation in force as regards the transport of animals by sea.</p>  <p>  The structural requirements are set out in the Regulations under Schedule 1 (Specifications and Equipment for Vessels).  The specifications are designed to ensure that the structure of the vessel is sturdy enough to withstand oceanic forces encountered while voyaging and the vessel must meet the stability requirements outlined in the schedule.  The schedule also sets out requirements for the internal divisions and structures on individual decks carrying livestock which must be of prescribed strength and be of material capable of protecting livestock from injury and exposure to weather and sea.  Additionally drainage, fresh water provision and the design of pens and passageways must be capable of meeting the animals physiological needs whilst also allowing access to individual animals at all times.  Different structural requirements apply depending on the type, class and size of animal transported and also depending on the ultimate destination and the length of journey to the destination.</p>  <p>  The rules set out in the Carriage of Livestock by Sea Regulations 2016 also provide for the inspection and approval of livestock vessels which comply with specified criteria, the loading and care of livestock on vessels, conditions in relation to weather and the submission of voyage reports.  Detailed inspections by both an independent Marine Surveyor and a Department Veterinary Inspector are required before approval is given to ships transporting animals.</p></reply>

The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team, and bidders, during the procurement process.

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005.  This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg.  The 2013 target is based on the average of emissions for the years 2008-2010.  The target for each of the years 2014 through 2019 is on a straight-line trajectory between the targets for 2013 and 2020, and surpluses in one year can be used to cover deficits in any subsequent year.  The average incidence of these targets is a 12% reduction relative to 2005.     </p>  <p>  In March 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published projected emissions for 2020 which indicate that Ireland&rsquo;s emissions at that stage could be in the range of 6-11% below 2005 levels.  On a cumulative basis over the period 2013-2020, Ireland is projected to have a deficit of between 3 and 12 Megatonnes Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (MtCO2e).    </p>  <p>  The extent of this challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU and international commitments, is well understood by the Government, as reflected in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development, published in April 2014, and now underpinned by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 which was enacted in December 2015.  The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050.  Statutory authority for the plans is set out in the Act.    </p>  <p>  In accordance with Section 4 of the Act, and in line with responsibilities assigned to me as Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I intend to make a draft National Mitigation Plan available for public consultation by the end of the year followed by submission of a final plan to Government for approval by June 2017.  Work is well underway on the development of the National Mitigation Plan, the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional measures in the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050.  The first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address the challenge to 2020 but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures will be in place beyond that.</p>  <p>  The ultimate objective of successive National Mitigation Plans is to incrementally achieve the long-term vision of low carbon transition, set out in the National Policy Position, by 2050.  In that context, the National Mitigation Plan will have regard to Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the current 2009 Effort Sharing Decision, the Paris Agreement and any likely future EU and international obligations that may arise, including new national targets to be agreed under the 2030 climate and energy package.   </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the efforts outlined above to address the challenge to comply with the 2020 targets, in the event that a gap to target still exists in 2020, retirement of Annual Emissions Allocations and units from the Kyoto Protocol Flexible Mechanisms carried forward from 2008-2012 can be offset against the deficit.  In the event that this would not fully address any potential deficit, further carbon units could be purchased.  It is not possible to accurately quantify the cost to purchase  notional carbon units at this stage as the cost is dependent on both the quantum and price of carbon units to be purchased at the time.   </p></reply>

This means we have to make energy savings of just under 32,000 gigawatt hours (GWh) by 2020.  At the end of 2015, energy savings of 17,300 GWh had been reported, bringing us over the half way point.  While this national target is not legally binding, the EU Energy Efficiency Directive does require Ireland to make energy savings of 1.5% of annual energy use each year between now and 2020.  This is being done through a combination of measures including the Energy Efficiency Obligation Scheme, the Better Energy Programme and regulatory measures such as building standards.</p><p>The White Paper on energy policy<i>, Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future 2015-2030</i>, sets out a vision for transforming Ireland's fossil fuel based energy sector into a clean low carbon system by 2050.  The Programme for Government also sets out important objectives that build on this vision.  For 2017, I have secured over &euro;100 million in Exchequer support for energy measures, which will permit continuation and expansion of support under the existing  grants and community focused efficiency schemes, and importantly, will enable piloting of a range of innovative trials and pilots to determine how we can encourage more households and enterprises to engage in deep energy efficiency measures.  A critical focus will be on identifying behavioural change mechanisms to support and motivate action to energise greater investment in energy efficiency.  I also intend to bring forward in 2017 a Renewable Heat Incentive which will be designed to ensure that it is complementary to both energy efficiency and renewable heat objectives.  There is a clear strategic perspective to advance energy efficiency as demonstrated by the significantly increased Government support to the sector in Budget 2017.</p></reply>

Ireland aims to meet this target mainly through the increased use of sustainable biofuels, with electric vehicles also making a small contribution.  Provisional data from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland indicates that 5.7% of the energy in transport was from renewable sources as at end 2015. </p>  <p>  Ireland's third National Energy Efficiency Action Plan to 2020, published in 2014, estimated that approximately 50,000 electric vehicles (EVs) could form part of the transport fleet in 2020.  Though the rate of growth has been slower than expected, we have seen increasing numbers of EVs registered in Ireland in 2015 and 2016.  However, apart from general macroeconomic considerations, technology advancement, affordability and consumer choice are the most important levers in triggering consumers to move from petrol and diesel to electric vehicles.  Notwithstanding substantial exchequer support of &euro;10,000 to each electric vehicle, the reality of a halving of the price of oil and the pace of technology improvement has  very significantly impacted  electric vehicle market penetration. </p>  <p>  Since 2011, the Electric Vehicle Grant Scheme has been supporting and incentivising, through grants of up to &euro;5,000, the deployment of EVs in Ireland.  These grants are in addition to tax incentives such as the Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) reliefs of up to &euro;5,000, which apply to EVs and Accelerated Capital Allowances (ACA), which allows companies to offset the cost of investment in qualifying technologies including EVs.  The purchase of 1,662 new EVs has been supported since the Grant Scheme commenced.  Of these, 572 have been grant aided to date this year which is an increase from 2015 when 555 were grant aided over the full year.  The Grant Scheme will remain in place for 2017.  In addition, it was announced in Budget 2017 last week that the VRT reliefs would continue until 2021 for Battery Electric Vehicles and until 2018 for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles.</p>  <p>  My Department and the Department of Transport Tourism and Sport are in the final stage of discussions to establish a Low Emissions Vehicles Task force within a matter of weeks, one of whose tasks will be to examine as a matter of priority what further actions are necessary to further stimulate EV sales and other low emission vehicles to 2020 and beyond.</p></reply>

In addition, the Programme for Government sets out a range of priority climate actions and interventions, a number of which have a direct bearing on the energy efficiency and the renewable energy sector.

Over the period 1990 to 2014 the carbon intensity of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity dropped by 49% from 896 g CO2/kWh in 1990 to a new low of 456 g CO2/kWh in 2014.  However, the long term trend can and does vary in individual years because of supply and market effects, such as dislocation in fuel supply or generation capacity and for 2015, CO2/kWh  increased by 2.5% to 467.5 g CO2/kWh. </p><p>The SEAI analysis attributes the 2015 increase in carbon intensity of electricity to the following additional factors:</p><p>- 45% increase in oil used in generation (albeit at a 1.9% share of fuel inputs); </p><p>- decrease in net imports of electricity;</p><p>- 3.7% reduction in natural gas generation (42% share of inputs); and</p><p>- 10.2% reduction in other renewable (biomass and landfill gas) inputs to electricity generation (2.6% share of inputs).</p><p>Countering the above were:</p><p>- 13.8% increase in hydro generation (1.5% share of inputs);</p><p>- 27.9% increase wind generation (12.6% share of inputs).</p><p>The report referred to by the Deputy can be downloaded at .  </p></reply>

This review, which will be completed in Q4 2016, addresses the issues of decarbonisation and Ireland's long term transition towards a low carbon economy. ISIF shareholdings with fossil fuel exposure include certain investments inherited from its predecessor the National Pension Reserve Fund (NPRF).</p><p>These particular shareholdings are in companies based outside Ireland and, as such, are held in ISIF's global portfolio.

ISIF has also invested in circa. &euro;97 million of short term fixed income investments in energy corporations, representing just over 1% of ISIF's assets.</p><p>As part of its on-going commitment to operate to high international standards ISIF has recently published its Sustainability and Responsible Investment Policy which is available online at: </p><p>The Sustainable and Responsible Investment Policy emphasises climate change as part of the investment decision making process.  Many major funds internationally have made significant divestments from fossil fuels such as coal, while other such funds have adopted an approach of engagement with energy companies to establish their strategy and positioning for the transition to a low carbon economy.  ISIF continually reviews its carbon exposure and the investment case for companies that may not be aligned with the long term transition to a low-carbon economy.</p><p>The issues of decarbonisation and the long term transition towards a low carbon economy are central to the Paris Agreement to the UNFCCC, which was agreed by over 195 countries and Parties at COP21 in 2015 and will enter into force on 4 November 2016.

The specific details of the contribution to be made by each Member State to this overall ambition remain to be finalised, and Ireland is currently examining proposals made by the European Commission in this regard.  The Paris Agreement also provides that developed country Parties shall provide financial resources to assist developing country Parties with respect to both mitigation and adaptation in continuation of their existing obligations under the Convention.  To date, Ireland&rsquo;s contributions of climate finance to developing countries has been Exchequer funded primarily through climate oriented spending via the Official Development Assistance Vote and separate contributions to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) which will initiate later this year.</p></reply>

The National Smart Metering Programme, which includes both electricity and gas meters, is managed by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). The EU&rsquo;s Third Energy Package sets out the need to roll out smart meters based on economic assessment and provides that in the case of electricity, &ldquo;where roll-out of smart meters is assessed positively, at least 80% of consumers shall be equipped with intelligent metering systems by 2020.&rdquo; In the case of gas, there is no specific target but any roll out is subject to economic assessment.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, the key determinant of the scale, scope and timing of the roll-out of smart meters is a cost benefit analysis that is currently being developed by the CER. The results of this CBA are expected in the first half of 2017.</p>  <p>  In previous statements, I have indicated that the roll-out of smart meters will commence in late 2018 at the earliest. The &lsquo;go live&rsquo; date of smart services will follow once a significant number of smart meters have been rolled out. </p>  <p>  The CER commenced a re-planning process of the NSMP in July 2016 with ESB Networks, Gas Networks Ireland and other relevant stakeholders in order to bring more clarity and certainty regarding the timelines for implementation of the programme. This re-planning process, which will conclude later this year, may lead to the timelines being extended.</p>  <p>  Smart meters will make time of use tariffs, which offer a different price for electricity at different times of the day, available to customers. This is similar to the current day/night meters but with the potential for more than two charging periods in each day allowing people to manage their electricity cost by changing when they use electricity.</p>  <p>  Following a public consultation, the CER has determined that energy suppliers will be required to offer time of use tariffs to customers within 12 months of receiving a smart meter and smart services going live. It will be the customers&rsquo; choice whether to opt-in to use the time of use tariffs or remain on their existing tariff.</p>  <p>  Over time, as consumers become informed regarding the potential savings that they can make, time of use tariffs are likely to become the norm. The CER intends to monitor developments in the market with a view to phasing out flat-rate tariffs in the future. However, no date has been decided for such a phase-out.</p>  <p>  The CER plans to launch a comprehensive public awareness campaign in the run up to smart meter roll out and educating the public about the benefits of time of use tariffs will form a substantial part of that campaign.</p></reply>

This Scheme provides funding for private roads and laneways, the maintenance and improvement of which is, in the first instance, a matter for the relevant landowner.  While the LIS does not have a ring-fenced allocation in 2016, local authorities may use a proportion of State grant funding (15% of the Discretionary Grant) for LIS should they wish to do so.</p>  <p>  While 2017 will see a modest increase in funding for roads, it will take some years yet under the Capital Plan to restore "steady state" funding levels for regional and local roads. The primary focus in 2017 will, therefore, have to continue to be on the maintenance and renewal of public roads.  I do, however, expect that local authorities will continue to be able to use a proportion of their Discretionary Grant for the local improvement scheme.</p>  <p>  In light of the provision in the Programme for Government indicating that, as the economy recovers, the Government will promote increased funding for regional and local roads, I will be raising the issue of increased funding in the context of the planned Mid-Term Review of the Capital Plan.</p></reply>

However, negotiations on price are a matter for the contracting parties as is the case in any commercial relationship.</p>  <p>  The CCPC is an independent statutory body responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection and competition law and I, as Minister, have no direct role in such matters.  Any allegations of breaches of the legislation should be referred directly to the CCPC.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-20a.838.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1272" speakername="Pat Breen" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102000069#WRW00300"><p>Apart from public sector employees, where certain statutory retirement ages may apply, there is no statutory retirement age for employees in Irish legislation.  A contract of employment will generally contain a retirement age but this is a matter of contract between the parties.    </p>  <p>  The upper age limit for bringing claims under the Unfair Dismissals Acts was removed by a provision in the Equality Act 2004.  It is now the case that a person of any age, when dismissed, may take a case under the Unfair Dismissals Acts unless she or he has reached the &ldquo;normal retiring age for employees of the same employer in similar employment&rdquo;, if one exists.  In such circumstances, the burden of proof is on the employer to prove the normal retiring age.  Furthermore, the upper age limit of 66 years for receipt of statutory redundancy payments was removed by the Protection of Employment (Exceptional Collective Redundancies and Related Matters) Act 2007. </p>  <p>  As the issue that arises around compulsory retirement at a given age is whether this entails discrimination on age grounds, the more usual avenue of redress for employees compulsorily retired is to take a claim, under the Employment Equality Acts, to the Workplace Relations Commission.  Responsibility for employment equality legislation rests with the Minister for Justice and Equality. </p>  <p>  I understand from my colleague the Minister for Social Protection that the retirement age for all Community Employment (CE) Participants and Supervisors is the age they can avail of the State Pension, therefore they can work on CE up to the working day before the relevant birthday providing they meet the CE eligibility criteria.  Participation on Community Employment has an upper age limit of the age at which the State Pension becomes available to that person, as per Section 7 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011, i.e.: </p>  <p>  - 66 for those born before 1 January 1955. </p>  <p>  - 67 for those born on or after 1 January 1955. </p>  <p>  - 68 for those born on or after 1 January 1961. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that an Inter-departmental Group (IDG), chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER), was established by the Government earlier this year to consider policy around retirement age in both the public and private sectors.  The IDG concluded its work during the summer and the Group&rsquo;s report was published in August by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The IDG made a number of recommendations, one of which related to my specific area of responsibility.  On foot of that recommendation I wrote to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) to request them to prepare a Code of Practice under Section 42 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990 around the issue of longer working, which should set out best industrial relations practice in managing the engagement between employers and employees in the run up to retirement, including requests to work beyond what would be considered the normal retirement age in the employment concerned.</p></reply>

We have made substantial progress since the Action Plan for Jobs process was first introduced in 2012 with the unemployment rate falling from 15.1% at the start of the Action Plan for Jobs process to 8.6 percent in Q2 2016, and over 176,000 extra at work since early 2012. </p><p>The Programme for Partnership Government commits to maintaining the OECD-endorsed Action Plan for Jobs process and also sets out a target to create an additional 200,000 jobs over the period 2016 to 2020, informed by the statement on enterprise policy, Enterprise 2025. </p><p>Building on the success of the Action Plan for Jobs process, we are focused on ensuring that we can support new job creation in every region in the country, through the implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs.  A key objective of the plans is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the aim, as set out in Enterprise 2025, of having the unemployment rate of each region within one per cent of the national average. </p><p>The Regional Action Plan initiative brings the different stakeholders in each of the regions together to identify a range of innovative and practical actions, to be taken across a range of Departments and agencies, with clear timelines for delivery over the period 2015 &ndash; 2017. </p><p>Each Plan is being monitored and driven in each region by a Regional Implementation Committee, with membership drawn from industry, local authorities, Enterprise Agencies, education sector and other key stakeholders and agencies.  Collaboration between the private and the public sector has been a core element in each plan&rsquo;s development, and will be central to each plan&rsquo;s delivery.  The first Progress Reports on the implementation of the Plans, covering the period to end-June 2016, will be completed and published in Q4 2016. </p><p>The targets for additional jobs to be created in each of the 8 regions covered by the Regional Action Plan initiative are set out in the table below.  By delivering on the full potential of the Plans, the aim is to deliver a total of 246,000 jobs by 2020.  In keeping with the medium to longer term ambition of the Regional Plans, these plans are not broken down on a yearly basis.</p><p>Achieving these ambitious targets at regional level will require a renewed focus on collaborative efforts to build on regional strengths, assets and areas of competitive advantage to develop the attractive and competitive environments for business to start, grow and succeed on international markets and to attract inward investment.  <table><tr><th><b>Region</b></th><th><b>Published Regional APJ targets by 2020</b></th></tr><tr><td>North East/North West</td><td>28,000</td></tr><tr><td>Midland</td><td>14,000</td></tr><tr><td>West</td><td>25,000</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>66,000</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-East</td><td>25,000</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-West</td><td>23,000</td></tr><tr><td>South-East</td><td>25,000</td></tr><tr><td>South-West</td><td>40,000</td></tr><tr><td>State Total</td><td>246,000</td></tr></table></p></reply>

However, I have been further advised that a review by the Defence Forces into 179 non-service related deaths among members of the Defence Forces in the period 2000 to 2012 shows that 30 were apparently of self-inflicted injuries.  Of these 30 deaths by apparent self-inflicted injury, 14 had previously been prescribed Lariam, 16 were not prescribed Lariam and 4 of these had not served overseas.  </p><p>The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has informed my Department that since Lariam was first licensed for use in Ireland in 1989, the HPRA has received a total of 120 reports of suspected adverse reactions/events associated with its use.  The HPRA further advised that there is no requirement to provide information on a person&rsquo;s occupation in reports of suspected adverse reactions submitted to the HPRA.  Statistics on reports associated with either current or ex-members of the Defence Forces are not therefore available.</p><p>While there is no mandatory legal requirement on an individual or medical practitioner to report adverse reactions to any medication, it is open to anyone to report issues relating to safety and quality of healthcare products to the HPRA.  This includes patients, carers, other members of the public and healthcare professionals.  I can confirm that individual Defence Forces Medical Officers have reported adverse reactions to the HPRA in accordance with standard practice. </p><p>The health and welfare of the men and women of the Defence Forces is a high priority for me and the Defence Forces<b>.  </b>The Defence Forces, through their Personnel Support Services (PSS), engage in extensive suicide awareness and education programmes for all members of the Defence Forces.  These programmes include:- </p><p>- Issuing an &ldquo;Information Guide on Mental Health and Well Being in the Defence Forces&rdquo;; </p><p>- Issuing and giving presentations on &ldquo;Defence Forces Guidelines on Suicide&rdquo;; </p><p>- Running courses on &ldquo;Suicide and Self Harm Awareness&rdquo;; </p><p>- Providing access to &ldquo;Mental Fitness&rdquo; programmes through the Defence Forces Intranet; </p><p>- Providing WRAP (Wellness Recovery Action Plan) training to all PSS personnel;</p><p>- Conducting STORM (Skills Training on Risk Management in suicide and self harm mitigation ) training with all overseas units; </p><p>- Providing ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training) training in conjunction with the HSE; </p><p>- Conducting Safe Talk training within the Defence Forces; </p><p>- Providing CISM (Critical Incident Stress Management) training for all personnel; and </p><p>- Issuing a PSS Booklet entitled &ldquo;Defence Forces Suicide and Self-Harm Prevention&rdquo;</p><p>There is a PSS office in every major military installation, with one or more qualified Barrack PSS Officers.  The role of the Barrack PSS Office includes providing information, assistance and counselling on a range of matters including interpersonal problems, stress , bereavement, housing, education, taxation, social welfare and retirement.  As part of the PSS office civilian social workers are also available to support Defence Forces personnel and their families.  In addition an independent and strictly confidential 24 hour care-line, manned by trained counsellors, is available to all Defence Forces personnel.</p></reply>
