In recent weeks, both the Taoiseach and I have had intensified contacts with the parties and the British Government on the political difficulties that were threatening the continuation of the Executive.</p>  <p>  It was clear, immediately following the resignation of the deputy First Minister, that the prospect of a resolution ahead of the triggering of an Assembly election was slim.  However both Governments, in their capacity as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, made full use of the narrow window available to ensure that any avenues for resolution between the parties prior to an election were fully explored.</p>  <p>  In the event, an Assembly election has been triggered and it is important to emphasise that this eventuality is one covered by the legislation governing the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland.  When parties in an administration cannot agree, an election is the consequence and the outcome of that is now for the electorate in Northern Ireland to determine. </p>  <p>  The Secretary of State and I have agreed that both Governments should continue to work closely together in the weeks to come, looking ahead to the post-election period, when a new power-sharing Executive will need to be formed.  We have also urged the parties to approach the election campaign in calm and respectful terms, conscious that polarising rhetoric and frayed relationships will damage the prospects of forming an Executive after the votes have been counted. </p>  <p>  We must all be mindful that effective devolved Government, underpinned by a genuine spirit of partnership, is what the people of Northern Ireland voted for in 1998 and what they expect their politicians to deliver.</p>  <p>  After the election, it will therefore fall to the parties to form a power-sharing Executive and this will require the parties to find a way forward on issues which contributed to the calling of the election.  The Government is of course always ready to support and assist the parties in any way we can. Our commitment as a co-guarantor of the Agreement is a constant one &ndash; in good times and bad.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to work with the British Government and the political parties to support the fulfilment of the full promise of that Agreement and to advance political stability, reconciliation and economic prosperity in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

Some 70 countries and international organisations participated in the meeting, which was a follow up to the first conference held in Paris in June 2016, which I also attended.  This &ldquo;French Initiative&rdquo; was aimed at reviving a stalled peace process, and reaffirming international support for the two state solution to the conflict between Israel and its Arab and Palestinian neighbours. Contrary to intentions, the meeting did not include the parties themselves, as Israel refused to attend or to engage in any way with the French initiative.  This was regrettable and mistaken.</p>  <p>  The conference adopted a Declaration which clearly expressed the view of the broad international community that the two state solution was the only way forward.  This followed on and reinforced the similar message in Security Council Resolution 2334, adopted in December, which I welcomed at the time. </p>  <p>  However, there was also great concern among all participants about threats to the viability of that solution, stemming principally from the settlement policy of the Israeli Government. The Middle East Peace Process has been effectively stalled for three years, and there is no clear view on how to renew it.  Uncertainty about the direction which the new US Administration will take was, of course, one factor in that regard.</p>  <p>  The Paris Conference, and the initiative taken by France during 2016, can be said therefore to have been partially successful, particularly in maintaining an international focus on the issue at a time when other events in the Middle East have been dominating attention.  France is to be commended for initiating and persevering with this challenging work, despite the many and clearly anticipated difficulties inherent to it. The wider ambition, of helping to restart the peace process, remains to be achieved, and is a task for the whole international community. Ireland will continue to argue for the European Union to play its full part in that.</p>  <p>  It is too soon to tell what positions the new US Administration will take in relation to Israeli-Palestinian issues. I have addressed the specific issue of the location of the US Embassy in reply to an earlier Question today (No. 53).</p></reply>

My officials in the Belfast Secretariat monitor this and other cases as part of their ongoing work around prison issues generally in Northern Ireland.  The circumstances of the individual in question, have been raised with the Northern Ireland Office.  The Deputy will be aware that the person concerned was detained in March 2016 when the release licence granted to him under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement was revoked by the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers.</p>  <p>  I am informed that as part of the revocation process, the independent Northern Ireland Parole Commissioners carry out a full review of the case.  The Parole Commissioners are charged with taking into account the obligations on the State of the European Convention on Human Rights in making their recommendation.  This includes assessing the risk to the public should the person remain at liberty. </p>  <p>  Those whose licence is revoked under this process are provided with a copy of the independent Parole Commissioners recommendation, which sets out the reasons the licence was revoked.  </p>  <p>  Deputies will be aware of my concern about prison conditions generally in Northern Ireland.  I had a useful discussion on this wider issue with Claire Sugden MLA, the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice when she visited Dublin recently.  Minister Sugden does not have any role in the revocation of licences issued under the Good Friday Agreement which remain a matter for the Secretary of State.</p></reply>

The Government is doing everything it possibly can to ensure that the Egyptian authorities are in no doubt about our determination to see this young man returned to his home and his family.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge and express my appreciation to the Ceann Comhairle, and to all of the members of the cross-party delegation that went to Cairo recently to meet this citizen and to hear his story at first-hand, and to press the case for his return to Ireland with the Egyptian authorities at the highest levels.  These messages have been clearly and repeatedly conveyed by the Government, and it is very useful that the Egyptian authorities are clear on the fact that there is absolute unanimity across D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on this matter.  </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has been in direct contact with Egyptian President el-Sisi on numerous occasions and has called on him to exercise his powers under Egyptian law to resolve this case and return this young man to Ireland.  He has done so in face-to-face meetings on two occasions and also by telephone and by letter.  The Taoiseach most recently wrote to President el-Sisi about the case in November.  For my part, I have engaged continuously on this case with my Egyptian counterpart, Foreign Minister Shoukry, and I once again raised this case with him when I met him in Paris at the Middle East Peace Conference on Sunday, January 15th.   </p>  <p>  The trial in which our citizen is a defendant along with more than 400 others was back in court for a further hearing on 17 January.  The hearing saw witnesses called and cross-examined for the first time since the trial began.  This may be an indication that the trial has now, at last, moved into a substantive phase and that a conclusion may finally be in prospect.  The Irish Government has been present at and has observed every hearing in the trial to date and our Embassy was again represented at the hearing on 17 January.  The next hearing will be on 14 February and the Embassy will once again be present on that occasion to observe the proceedings.</p>  <p>  The Egyptian President has consistently advised us that the separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary must be respected, and that the Egyptian Government cannot intervene until after the trial has concluded.  The President has also consistently made clear to us that he is anxious to resolve this issue as soon as he can, and that he will be able to intervene in the case once the trial has ended.  I welcome the fact that he reiterated this to the Oireachtas delegation when they met with him in Cairo on January 11th.</p>  <p>   I and my colleagues in Government and our officials at every level will continue to do everything possible and appropriate to engage with the authorities in Cairo on this citizen&rsquo;s behalf both directly and through and with EU and international partners.</p></reply>

In 2016, Ireland supported the EU-led resolution on the situation of human rights in Myanmar/Burma at the 31st session of the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) in March 2016.  This resolution conveyed the HRC&rsquo;s serious concerns over human rights violations in the country, including the situation in Rakhine State and particularly with respect to religious and ethnic minorities, including the Rohingya minority. Ireland also raised this issue in a statement at the 32nd session of the HRC in June 2016 and during the review of Myanmar&rsquo;s human rights record at the HRC&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review in November 2015.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also supported the inclusion of this issue in the EU&rsquo;s contacts with the Government of Myanmar, including in the most recent EU-Myanmar Human Rights Dialogue which took place on 22 November 2016.  </p>  <p>  I am particularly concerned about the recent outbreak of violence in Rakhine State, which began in the wake of attacks on police posts in October 2016.  I support the concerns expressed by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra&rsquo;ad Al Hussein in December 2016, in which the Commissioner called for access by independent monitors and an independent investigation of allegations of human rights violations by the security forces in their response to these attacks. Ireland has also actively called for the restoration of access for humanitarian aid to the region. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to raise these concerns in our contacts with international bodies, in the context of our membership of the EU and the UN, as well as in our bilateral contacts with the Government of Myanmar.</p></reply>

I am conscious of multiple reports, including from civilians in Mosul, claiming that Daesh is deliberately using civilians as human shields.  I would also note that the liberation of Mosul, from a terrorist group which a UN body has found responsible for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, has been legally mandated by the UN Security Council under resolution 2249, which calls on UN Member States to &ldquo;<i>prevent and suppress terrorist acts committed specifically by ISIL</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>to eradicate the safe haven they have established over significant parts of Iraq and Syria</i>&rdquo;.  Security operations taking place against Daesh inside Iraq are also conducted under the legal authority of the sovereign Government of Iraq.</p><p>The Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952, gives the Minister for Foreign Affairs primary responsibility for the regulation of activity by foreign military aircraft in Ireland.  The practical implementation of this provision is guided by and reflects Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality. </p></reply>

The Government remains deeply concerned about the ongoing violence in Rakhine State in the wake of attacks on police posts near Myanmar/Burma&rsquo;s border with Bangladesh in October 2016.  Ireland has called for an immediate end to violence in the region, and for an impartial, independent investigation into serious allegations of human rights violations committed by security forces in response to the attacks. Also critical is full restoration of access for humanitarian aid to Rakhine State, to ensure vulnerable communities receive the support they need.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been active in raising our concerns at bilateral level with the authorities in Myanmar/Burma and in the context of our membership of the EU and the UN. Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador to Thailand, who is accredited to Myanmar/Burma, raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns regarding the situation in Rakhine State with Minister of State for Foreign Affairs U Kyaw Tin during a visit to the country earlier this month.  The Embassy continues to monitor the situation closely.</p>  <p>  Ireland welcomes the democratic transition which is currently underway in Myanmar/Burma following elections in November 2015.  We recognise the positive steps that the new Government of Myanmar/Burma has taken in pursuit of peace and reconciliation, democratic reforms and economic growth.  The Irish Government is of the view that respect for human rights and the rule of law for all people in Myanmar/Burma remains central to the long-term success of these goals.  Addressing the underlying root causes of tensions in Rakhine State, in a manner that takes account of the concerns of the Rohingya and Buddhist communities, and led by the Government of Myanmar/Burma, is critical in this context.</p></reply>

It is disappointing to see Bahrain revert to using the death penalty, which they have not done since 2010.  This move is a backwards step in Bahrain&rsquo;s efforts to improve its human rights record, and only serves to reinforce the concerns that I have expressed in this House about the human rights situation in Bahrain of late.</p>  <p>  I am also aware that last week&rsquo;s executions triggered public protests and demonstrations.  I call on the protesters and the Bahraini authorities alike to exercise restraint, for the protesters to express their views peacefully and for the authorities to permit them to do this.  I remind the Bahraini Government that preventing people from expressing their views does not quash people&rsquo;s grievances; it only reinforces them.</p>  <p>  Ireland is unequivocal in its stance on the death penalty.  We oppose and condemn its use in all circumstances, and in particular in cases where there are allegations of unfair trials preceding its implementation.  The abolition of the death penalty is one of Ireland&rsquo;s international priorities, and my Department regularly conveys our stance on this issue to all countries where the death penalty is still in use.  </p>  <p>  These executions are a worrying development, as they coincide with an overall deterioration in the human rights situation in Bahrain, in particular targeting those who express dissent or criticism of the Bahraini Government.  This is despite repeated statements from the Bahraini authorities of their commitment to improving the human rights situation in that country.  Ireland made specific reference to Bahrain in our Item 4 Statement at the Human Rights Council in Geneva last September, expressing concern about &ldquo;restrictions on freedom of expression, assembly and association aimed at silencing the voice of civil society and human rights defenders in countries including Bahrain&rdquo;.  </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, who is accredited to Bahrain as we do not have an Embassy there, recently met with the Bahraini Deputy Minister for International Affairs, Abdullah Bin Ahmed Al Khalifa, and they discussed human rights.  My Department will also specifically raise the renewed use of the death penalty with Bahrain at the next available opportunity, and we will continue to call on Bahrain to live up to its commitments to improve the human rights situation for all Bahrainis.</p></reply>

He did so when he met the President face-to-face to discuss this case in New York in September 2015, and again in Paris in November 2015.  The Taoiseach restated the Government&rsquo;s position on the case again when he spoke to the President by telephone last July.  The Taoiseach has also written to President el-Sisi on a number of occasions about this case, including in a letter in August 2016 and again, most recently, in a letter dated 17 November 2016.</p>  <p>  In all of these contacts, the Taoiseach has  underlined our concerns about the continuing detention of this young man, who has been in prison for more than three years without having been convicted of any crime, and who is part of a group trial that has been adjourned on many occasions.</p>  <p>  For my part, I have been in continuous contact with my Egyptian counterpart, Foreign Minister Shoukry, about this case since my appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I have met the Minister face-to-face on several occasions to discuss the case including, notably, during a visit to Cairo last June and in New York in September 2016.  I discussed the case most recently with Minister Shoukry when I met him in Paris on Sunday, January 11th.  </p>  <p>  I have also spoken with the Minister by phone on many occasions about the case.

What we can do and what we are working very hard to do is to secure this citizen&rsquo;s release by the Egyptian authorities at the earliest possible time so that he can return home to his family in Dublin, and to provide every possible consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention. </p>  <p>  All of the sustained and focused actions that have been taken by the Government, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and our Embassy in Cairo throughout this case have been aimed at furthering these two objectives, and importantly, avoiding any action that could be counterproductive or detrimental to this citizen&rsquo;s best interests.</p></reply>

The discussion will cover a wide range of issues of concern, including human rights, regional stability, terrorism and economic developments. </p>  <p>  The discussion on Ukraine will be a good opportunity to review overall relations with a key neighbouring country.

These messages have been clearly and repeatedly conveyed by the Government, and it is very useful that the Egyptian authorities are clear on the fact that there is absolute unanimity across D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on this matter.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has spoken directly and personally with Egyptian President el-Sisi on numerous occasions now calling on him to exercise his powers under Egyptian law to resolve this case and return this young man to Ireland.  He has done so in face-to-face meetings on two occasions and also by telephone and by letter.  The Taoiseach most recently wrote to President el-Sisi about the case in November.  For my part, I have engaged continuously on this case with my Egyptian counterpart, Foreign Minister Shoukry, and I once again raised this case with him when I met him in Paris at the Middle East Peace Conference on Sunday, January 15th.</p>  <p>  The trial in which our citizen is a defendant along with more than 400 others was back in court for a further hearing on 17 January.  The hearing saw witnesses called and cross-examined for the first time since the trial began.  This may be an indication that the trial has now, at last, moved into a substantive phase and that a conclusion may finally be in prospect.  The Irish Government has been present at and has observed every hearing in the trial to date and our Embassy was again represented at the hearing on 17 January.   The next hearing will be on 14 February and the Embassy will once again be present on that occasion to observe the proceedings.</p>  <p>  The Egyptian President has consistently advised us that the separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary must be respected, and that the Egyptian Government cannot intervene while the case remains before the courts.  The President has also consistently made clear to us that he is anxious to resolve this issue as soon as he can, and that he will be able to intervene in the case once the trial has ended.  I welcome the fact that he reiterated this to the Oireachtas delegation when they met with him in Cairo on January 11th.  </p>  <p>  I and my colleagues in Government and our officials at every level will continue to do everything possible and appropriate to engage with the authorities in Cairo on this citizen&rsquo;s behalf both directly and through and with EU and international partners.</p></reply>

The situation is being closely monitored by my Department and by the Embassy of Ireland in Mexico, which is accredited to Colombia.  I condemn unreservedly any intimidation or violence perpetrated against human rights defenders in Colombia or elsewhere.  I firmly believe that the Colombian peace process, which aims to create a virtuous circle between peacebuilding and respect for human rights, provides the framework in which the endemic violence which has afflicted Colombian society can successfully be addressed.</p>  <p>  I had the opportunity to discuss the peace process in Colombia with my EU colleagues and with the President of Colombia, Mr Juan Manuel Santos, at the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on 12 December.  The EU Special Envoy to the Colombian Peace Process, Mr Eamon Gilmore, also participated in our discussion.  I made clear the importance Ireland attaches to supporting the implementation of the peace agreement, and noted the need for all parties to the process to maintain momentum and to ensure that the citizens of Colombia begin to see evidence of a peace dividend.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is a founder member and one of the largest contributors to the EU Trust Fund for Colombia.  We have committed to providing &euro;3 million in funding over the lifetime of the Fund, which aims to support the implementation of the peace agreement.  Ireland has been closely involved in discussion of its strategic direction and advocated a strong human rights perspective for the Fund, in keeping with our commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights internationally. We will continue to prioritise this issue as the agreement between the Government of Colombia and the FARC is implemented in the months and years ahead. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department regularly meet representatives of human rights organisations active in Colombia.  Most recently, in November 2016, they hosted a delegation from Peace Brigades International to discuss the worrying increase in violence against local leaders and human rights defenders in Colombia to which the Deputy refers. </p>  <p>  Officials from our Embassy in Mexico also regularly interact with organisations working to promote and defend human rights in Colombia. Ireland has provided more than &euro;5 million to international and local civil society organizations in Colombia since 2009, including to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and Christian Aid, amongst others. In addition, Ireland regularly raises issues relating to human rights directly in Bogot&aacute; and via the UN and European Union.</p></reply>

This commitment is reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government, which makes specific reference to pursuing the issue of the Dublin Monaghan bombings.</p>  <p>  The All-Party motion on the 1974 Dublin Monaghan bombings adopted in this House on 25 May last year has, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011, been conveyed to the British Government.  These motions call on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the bombings.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of these all-Party D&aacute;il motions, and has consistently raised the issue with the British Government.  The Taoiseach has raised the issue with Prime Minister May, emphasising the Government&rsquo;s continued support for the D&aacute;il motions.  I have also raised the matter on a number of occasions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, most recently at our meeting in Belfast on 19 January.</p>  <p>  In our discussions, I have advised Secretary of State Brokenshire that the D&aacute;il motions represent the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin Monaghan atrocities.  I have also underlined to the Secretary of State that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government and indeed this House, and emphasised the urgent need for a response from the British Government.</p>  <p>  Secretary of State Brokenshire has acknowledged the importance that the Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann attach to this case, but indicated that the British Government is still considering how it could respond in a way which would adequately address the motions and be consistent with its obligations.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to pursue this matter with the British Government, urging them to provide a satisfactory response to the motions that have been adopted by this House.  </p>  <p>  There are many families throughout these islands and beyond who continue to deal not only with the awful pain of losing a loved one, but also with the struggle for answers decades after these traumatic events.  Accordingly, the establishment of a new comprehensive framework for dealing with the past, as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement, is a priority for the Government.</p>  <p>  I am continuing to engage with the Secretary of State and with the Northern Ireland parties to ensure the Executive is up and running as soon as possible after the upcoming Assembly elections, so that a way can be found to achieve a final agreement on legacy issues at political level.  There has been positive work and discussions ongoing over the last number of months.  There remain a number of outstanding issues, but there is an urgent need to achieve progress, so that the institutions can be established and start working to meet the needs of victims and survivors and support broader societal healing and reconciliation.  The Government will continue its engagement to achieve the establishment of these legacy institutions at the earliest possible opportunity following the Assembly election.</p></reply>

Despite recent progress made by Nigerian and regional armed forces, violence by Boko Haram remains a serious threat to the peace and security of Nigeria and to the wider Lake Chad region.  This conflict has resulted in the displacement of millions of people and has caused a humanitarian crisis affecting some 14 million people.</p>  <p>  Since 2015, the Government has provided over &euro;3.1 million in humanitarian assistance for those affected by this crisis.  Last year, we provided &euro;1 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross and &euro;1 million to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation for their response in the region.  We also provided &euro;430,000 to our NGO partners, Oxfam Ireland, MSF, Plan International Ireland and the International Rescue Committee.  In addition, Irish Aid deployed six specialists last year to work with UN agencies in the region under the Rapid Response initiative. </p>  <p>  We are also working closely with our partners in the EU, which has pledged up to &euro;50 million to the Multinational Joint Taskforce, which supports 8,700 troops from Nigeria and neighbouring countries in promoting regional security.

We continue to be committed to these aims notwithstanding the changed political context in the United States. </p>  <p>  The Government has raised the issue of immigration reform with US interlocutors &ndash; including at the highest levels &ndash; on many occasions.  I personally raised the issue when I met then-Secretary of State John Kerry in Co. Tipperary, on 30 October 2016.  I also raised it when I spoke to Speaker Paul Ryan by telephone on 23 November 2016.</p>  <p>  The Government has also availed of every opportunity to sensitise the incoming Administration to our concerns and interests regarding immigration reform, and the plight of the undocumented Irish in particular.  The Taoiseach raised the matter in his separate telephone conversations with President Trump and Vice-President Pence in the days following the Presidential election.  Immigration reform will be high on my agenda for my planned visit to Washington DC in early February.  Moreover, the forthcoming St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day engagements will provide a further opportunity to express to senior figures in the new Administration and Congress our aims and concerns in relation to the undocumented.  </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to use high-level visits to and from the US, as well as Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic representation in the United States, to advance these aims.  The Embassy in Washington has worked closely with members of the US Congress - in both the House of Representatives and the US Senate, and on both sides of the aisle &ndash; to advance progress on this matter and will continue to do so.  We are fortunate to be able to draw on the assistance of the Friends of Ireland in Congress and the many representatives of Irish-America, who appreciate our concerns.</p>  <p>  In addition to these political efforts, our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates throughout the United States will continue to engage with Irish community groups in relation to their concerns.  In recent days, Ambassador Anderson convened a meeting of senior immigration stakeholders at our Embassy in Washington in order to hear directly from those who work most-closely with the undocumented Irish.</p>  <p>  We will also continue to support organisations that deliver frontline advisory services and community care to Irish emigrants through the Emigrant Support Programme.  More than 70% of the funds allocated through this programme are directed towards welfare services, including in support of the undocumented Irish in the U.S.  In the last funding round for the Emigrant Support Programme, organisations in the U.S were allocated more than &euro;2.3 million in funding.

The Taoiseach was able to raise issues of Irish interest, and President Trump extended an invitation to the Taoiseach to visit the White House on the occasion of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day 2017.  A similar call was also made by the Taoiseach to then Vice President-Elect Pence.  A new Administration in the White House is accompanied by a large number of new appointments at the highest levels of the US Federal Government and institutions.  This means there can be a significant period of change &ndash; both in terms of policy and personnel - while the shape of the new Administration emerges.  Our Ambassador and her team in Washington have been very active in establishing working relationships with the incoming Administration, monitoring the various confirmation hearings in the US Senate and reporting on the preliminary indications of the new Administration&rsquo;s policy agenda, especially on those aspects which directly impact on our bilateral relationship with the US.</p>  <p>  I am due to travel to Washington, D.C., at the end of January and expect to have an opportunity to meet with figures in both the Administration and Congress and review with them matters of particular interest to Ireland.  These would include recent developments in the Northern Ireland Peace Process &ndash; which has been supported by successive US administrations &ndash; as well as immigration reform, the unique challenges posed for Ireland by Brexit, and strengthening economic engagement between our two countries.</p></reply>

The Security Council stated unambiguously its support for a two state solution to the conflict, and focused particular attention on the issue of Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory.  I welcomed the Council&rsquo;s reiteration that settlements, and actions to alter the demographic balance in the occupied areas, are illegal and an obstacle to peace.  These are not new developments: these have been the positions of Ireland, of the EU, of the UN and of the international community as a whole for many years.</p>  <p>  The Middle East Conference in Paris on 15 January, which I attended, provided the opportunity for the broader international community in turn to confirm its full support for the two state solution.  I have reported in more detail on this Conference in my earlier reply to Question 56. </p>  <p>  These two steps have been important and timely precisely because the Middle East Peace process has been effectively suspended for almost three years now. It is fair to say that among the Ministers I met at Paris there was very little optimism about the prospects for restarting the political process at this time. The demands of the concurrent crises in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East are a major factor in this view. Much will depend, as it always does, on the positions and priorities of the new US Administration.</p>  <p>  For our part, Ireland will continue to review what additional steps might be taken to encourage political progress and stands ready to support any efforts to restart a political process, as we have done in the last year to assist the French initiative.  In particular, we will continue to argue, as I have done, that the international community as a whole needs to exert more pressure on the parties themselves to re-engage.</p></reply>

Ireland has not taken a position on the future status of the territory, so long as that status is decided in a genuine exercise of self-determination.</p>  <p>  At present, Western Sahara is a non-self-governing territory. Under international law, the economic resources of a non-self-governing territory may only be exploited for the benefit of the people of the territory, on their behalf or in consultation with their representatives.  Any exploration and exploitation activities that proceed in disregard of the interests and wishes of the people of Western Sahara would be in violation of the principles of international law applicable to natural resource activities in non-self-governing territories.</p>  <p>  I would expect that any Irish company operating abroad would have due regard to the principles of international law and the rights of the inhabitants of the territory in which it is operating.  My Department has committed to develop a National Plan on Business and Human Rights, which will assist companies in advancing the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) adopted by the Human Rights Council in 2011.  </p>  <p>  The National Plan is designed to help Government departments, State agencies, Irish companies, Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) operating in Ireland and Irish enterprises operating abroad adhere to and promote the UNGPs.  Following the publication of the Working Outline of the National Plan on Business and Human Rights in late 2015, my Department engaged in an extensive consultation process with the aim of ensuring the broadest possible participation in the development of the Plan.  Work on the Plan is nearing conclusion and I expect that it will be published within the next three months. </p>  <p>  Ireland continues to engage in EU and UN discussions aimed at promoting the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

Ireland provided over &euro;150 million in humanitarian funding in 2016, to provide assistance to people affected by crisis and conflict around the world.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian assistance is targeted at where needs are greatest and we ensure a focus on crises and conflicts that are sometimes ignored in the media.  We work particularly at EU and UN level to advocate for increased humanitarian access, more effective means of providing assistance, and respect for international humanitarian law.  </p>  <p>  Ireland contributes strongly to the European Commission&rsquo;s humanitarian action outside the EU, which has an annual budget of approximately &euro;1 billion.  Ireland&rsquo;s UN partners lead the coordination of international appeals for humanitarian assistance, including through the UN Central Emergency Response Fund.  Ireland is the eighth largest donor to this Fund, which has provided $4.6 billion in life-saving assistance to people affected by crises since 2005.</p>  <p>  In May last year, the UN Secretary General convened the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul, in an effort to address the current scale of global humanitarian crisis.  I delivered Ireland&rsquo;s National Statement, making a number of commitments on effective humanitarian action, including through our support to conflict affected states and our approach to peacekeeping.  These commitments will remain a top priority in 2017.</p>  <p>  Providing safe havens within conflict zones is extremely difficult, especially where civilian protection is not prioritised. Safe havens require UN mandates and robustly-equipped peacekeeping personnel.  Political will is lacking in many conflicts today, including from some on the UN Security Council. However, in other places, the UN is active and there are twice as many UN peacekeepers deployed today as 15 years ago.  Ireland continues to play its part, with more than 570 personnel in UN-mandated missions overseas. </p>  <p>  In 2017, Ireland will remain a strong advocate for a more effective UN response and for respect for international humanitarian law.</p></reply>

I met in Belfast with the Secretary of State on 14 December, 12 January and 19 January.  We have also spoken by phone on a number of occasions.  It was clear, immediately following the resignation of the deputy First Minister, that the prospect of a resolution ahead of the triggering of an Assembly election was slim.  However both Governments, in their capacity as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, made full use of the narrow window available to ensure that any avenues for resolution between the parties prior to an election were fully explored.</p>  <p>  In the event, an Assembly election has been triggered and it is important to emphasise that this eventuality is one covered by the legislation governing the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland. When parties in an administration cannot agree, an election is the consequence and the outcome of that is now for the electorate in Northern Ireland to determine. </p>  <p>  The Secretary of State and I have agreed that both Governments should continue to work closely together in the weeks to come, looking ahead to the post-election period, when a new power-sharing Executive will need to be formed. We have also urged the parties to approach the election campaign in calm and respectful terms, conscious that polarising rhetoric and frayed relationships will damage the prospects of forming an Executive after the votes have been counted. </p>  <p>  We must all be mindful that effective devolved Government, underpinned by a genuine spirit of partnership, is what the people of Northern Ireland voted for in 1998 and what they expect their politicians to deliver.</p>  <p>  After the election, it will therefore fall to the parties to form a power-sharing Executive and this will require the parties to find a way forward on issues which contributed to the calling of the election. The Government is of course always ready to support and assist the parties in any way we can.  Our commitment as a co-guarantor of the Agreement is a constant one &ndash; in good times and bad.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to work with the British Government and the political parties to support the fulfilment of the full promise of that Agreement and to advance political stability, reconciliation and economic prosperity in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

Our policy for international development, &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo;, clearly articulates our commitment to the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) in Official Development Assistance (ODA), as economic conditions allow.  In the current Programme for Government we have set out our ambition to make progress towards the UN target as resources permit.  Progress needs to be made in a sustainable and manageable way, which continues to strengthen Ireland's recognised role as a reliable and effective partner in providing humanitarian assistance and contributing to the fight to end global poverty and hunger.</p>  <p>  During the very difficult economic circumstances of recent years, the Government managed to stabilise and largely protect allocations to ODA.  Since 2011 we have made annual contributions in excess of &euro;600 million and have cumulatively allocated over of &euro;4.5 billion in the period 2011 to 2017.  This represents a  remarkable commitment of public funds towards the fight to eradicate global hunger, reduce extreme poverty and provide humanitarian assistance to some of the world&rsquo;s most vulnerable people. </p>  <p>  Over the past two year we have again commenced increasing funding allocations for ODA in a sustained and measured way, providing an additional of &euro;40 million in 2016 and a further &euro;10 million for 2017.  The total 2017 allocation for ODA will be &euro;651 million.   </p>  <p>  Based on current Department of Finance forecasts for GNP we anticipate the ODA/GNP percentage outturn for 2016 to be in region of 0.3% with a similar level projected for 2017.  The reduction in the percentage has been affected by the step change in the measurement of Ireland&rsquo;s GNP. </p>  <p>  We remain committed to making incremental, sustainable progress towards achieving the 0.7% UN target by 2030, over the period of the Sustainable Development Goals.</p></reply>

Against a background of unprecedented uncertainty and change, Ministerial travel in and around St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day is a particularly valuable opportunity to convey our views and interests to our partners abroad.</p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will this year, as in previous years, announce a St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day programme of Ministerial visits designed to ensure that we make the best possible use of this exposure to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s visibility internationally, to deepen bilateral relations, to promote our trade, tourism and investment interests, and to strengthen ties with the Irish diaspora.</p>  <p>  In recent weeks my officials here in Dublin, in close consultation with the Embassy network and colleagues in the State agencies and other Government departments, have devised a list of recommended destinations and itineraries for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day 2017.  These have been determined to provide the greatest promotional and political opportunities in line with our current priorities and with our strategic goals.  I will be bringing this list of recommendations to Cabinet for consideration shortly and will announce our finalised programme in due course.</p>  <p>  Over the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period last year, the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, seven Ministers and two Ministers of State undertook an extensive programme of visits to seventeen cities in six countries.  As in previous years, Ireland&rsquo;s strong links with North America were reinforced through our St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day celebrations, with 41 political, economic and cultural events hosted by our Embassies and Consulates in thirteen cities across the United States and Canada over the period. </p>  <p>  This programme of events included a meeting at the White House between the Taoiseach and the President of the United States, a tradition that in some form dates back to 1952 and is a significant symbol of the warm relationship enjoyed by our two peoples.  President Trump has already informed the Taoiseach of his intention to continue this tradition, and the Government is committed to engaging with the new administration in the interests of our long-standing and mutually beneficial ties.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s firm position is that the Good Friday Agreement and the successor Agreements must be implemented in full, and this is reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  The Agreements, and the principles and values underpinning them, are at the core of the Government&rsquo;s approach to peace, reconciliation and prosperity on this island.</p><p>On a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland, the Government advanced the view during the 2014 Stormont House talks, that a Bill of Rights could set out precisely and formally the rights upon which a shared society for Northern Ireland could be based. While there was not sufficient consensus to take this forward at that time, the final Agreement did provide that the parties commit to: &ldquo;serving the people of Northern Ireland equally, and to act in accordance with the obligations on government to promote equality and respect and to prevent discrimination; to promote a culture of tolerance, mutual respect and mutual understanding at every level of society, including initiatives to facilitate and encourage shared and integrated education and housing, social inclusion, and in particular community development and the advancement of women in public life; and to promote the interests of the whole community towards the goals of reconciliation and economic renewal&rdquo;.</p><p>The Stormont House Agreement provide<font color="#004080">s</font>for regular review meetings with the participation of the Government, the British Government and the Executive party leaders.  At the last two Review Meetings &ndash; most recently in December &ndash; I specifically raised the outstanding commitments references in the Stormont House Agreement &ndash; including on human rights - and suggested regular consideration of them at the Review meetings to ensure that they remain on the political agenda.</p><p>The Government recognises the importance of the human rights aspects of the Good Friday Agreement.  This is reflected in my convening of a sectoral consultation on 13 February, as part of the All-Island Civic Dialogue on Brexit, on the human rights aspects of the Good Friday Agreement.  Human rights are central to the peace process and must be protected and sustained, regardless of the UK&rsquo;s status in the EU.  </p><p>The Government views as a solemn responsibility our role and mandate as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Government will continue to work with the British Government and the political parties to fulfil the full promise of the Good Friday Agreement and to advance political stability, reconciliation and economic prosperity in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

Under this programme, the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons into the State by the end of 2017, 2,622 through the EU  relocation mechanism established by two EU Council Decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece, and 1,040 (519 by the end of 2016 and the remainder in 2017) under the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focussed on resettling refugees from Lebanon. </p><p>In a further gesture of humanitarian assistance towards the most vulnerable caught up in the migration crisis and following a debate in the D&aacute;il, the Government  also committed to taking up to 200 unaccompanied minors from France who were previously resident in the migrant camp at Calais.  Further information in relation to this cohort is being included in the response to PQ No. 95 for answer today.  These initiatives therefore leave just a small residual balance to be allocated from the Government decision to take 4,000 persons.</p><p><i>Resettlement strand of the programme</i></p><p>Taking account of the situation in the Middle East, and the plight of the refugees, the T&aacute;naiste announced that Ireland would accept 520 persons for resettlement over an 18-month period to the end of 2017.  This was almost double the figure proposed for Ireland by the European Commission and was delivered a year ahead of the Commission deadline.</p><p>In addition, the Government recently announced that it is extending the resettlement programme to take in a further 520 refugees from Lebanon in  2017, most of whom are of Syrian origin.  260 refugees have already been selected during a selection mission to Lebanon in October 2016 and are expected to arrive in Spring 2017.  Most of these refugees are also Syrian.  A further selection mission to Lebanon will be arranged in the coming months to select the remaining refugees due to come to Ireland in 2017 under the resettlement programme.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p><i>Relocation strand of the programme</i></p><p>Ireland has to-date taken in 241 people from Greece.  In November, IRPP officials travelled to Athens and interviewed a group of 84 people who, once cleared for travel, are expected to arrive in February.  An IRPP mission to interview 80 people took place in Athens from 12 &ndash; 16 December.  A further mission has already taken place in January which interviewed 61 people.  The intention thereafter is to sustain the pace of intakes throughout 2017 at the levels required to allow Ireland to meets its commitments to Greece within the time frame envisaged by the  Programme. </p><p><i>Table of Total Numbers under Government Decision</i><table><tr><th>Relocation Strand</th><th>Numbers</th></tr><tr><td>Council Decision 2015/1523</td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>Council Decision 2015/1601</td><td>2,022</td></tr><tr><td>Total Relocation</td><td>2,622</td></tr><tr><td>Resettlement Strand</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Government Decision 09/06/15</td><td>520</td></tr><tr><td>Government Decision 06/07/16</td><td>260</td></tr><tr><td>Government Decision 29/11/16</td><td>260</td></tr><tr><td>Total Resettlement</td><td>1,040</td></tr><tr><td>Total Unaccompanied Minors Calais</td><td>200 (up to)</td></tr><tr><td>Mechanism as yet undecided</td><td>138</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>4000</td></tr></table></p><p><i>Unaccompanied minors</i></p><p>In announcing the IRPP, the Government recognised the importance of prioritising family groups and addressing the position of unaccompanied children.

Following the approval by Government of the appropriate legal mechanism and the identification of considerable resources needed, officials from my Department, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency  positively engaged with the French authorities in Paris in early January with a view to identifying these unaccompanied minors.  There has also been ongoing contact with the NGO sector. </p>  <p>  Subsequent to the officials meeting, the first mission to meet unaccompanied minors took place last week and included representatives of Tusla, which has statutory responsibility for the care and accommodation of unaccompanied minors in the State.  The Tusla officials were accompanied by a member of staff from the Irish Refugee Protection Programme Office of my Department and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who carried out security assessments.  Four unaccompanied minors were assessed during this initial mission and will be relocated in the near future subject to the completion of the security assessment process.  The next mission to another centre in France will take place very shortly to interview another six young people wishing to come here. Irish officials have drawn up detailed questionnaires to rapidly progress the identification of these young people.  I also understand that NGO's have this week identified a total of six young people to my Department.  Separately, two young people identified by the French Red Cross as having a relative here have already been processed and have arrived safely in Ireland.  Although decisions regarding numbers and dates for future missions are matters for Tusla to determine in cooperation with the French authorities, it is anticipated that approximately 60 young people could be identified by the authorities and processed over the course of the coming months as willing to come to Ireland and we have committed to accept all of these on a phased basis, as soon as resources come on stream and subject to the aforementioned security process.  The best interests of the child is central to this partnership process with the French authorities.  </p>  <p>  The intention is to rapidly process these young people by using some of the yet unallocated numbers included in the original decision to welcome 4000 refugees here and does not impact on the commitments entered into in relation to the EU Relocation or Resettlement Programmes.</p></reply>

The Residential Property Price Register, available at www.propertypriceregister.ie, is produced by the PSRA in accordance with the provisions of Section 86 of the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011.  The purpose of the Register is to bring transparency to house prices in Ireland.  The Register is a list of property prices and it is not a &quot;property price index&quot;.  The details made available on the register are limited to price, address and date of sale and do not include such details as property size or number of rooms.  It is simply designed to provide, on an ongoing basis, accurate prices of residential properties purchased at a particular date.</p><p>The Register contains information on residential properties purchased in Ireland since 1 January 2010, as declared to the Revenue Commissioners for stamp duty purposes, and forwarded by the Revenue Commissioners to the PSRA for publication.  I am informed that VAT at 13.5% is only chargeable on new properties, it is not charged on second hand properties.  Stamp duty in respect of new properties is paid on the property price exclusive of VAT.  Accordingly, the prices given to the PSRA by the Revenue Commissioners for new properties are VAT exclusive.  The Information Note on the first page of the Residential Property Price Register clearly states that if the property is a new property, the price shown is exclusive of VAT at 13.5%. </p><p>From the foregoing, it should be clear that the position currently is that all prices on the Property Price Register are VAT exclusive.  In other words, the prices quoted on the Register exclude the 13.5% VAT applicable in respect of new properties.  As indicated above, VAT is not payable in respect of second hand properties.  I understand that there are no plans to alter this at this time, but that the PSRA plans to review the explanatory text on the property price register website with a view to enhancing its clarity for the general public.</p></reply>

I am deeply conscious of the serious issue of road safety and mindful of the increase in 2016 of road traffic fatalities.  I am also mindful of the traumatic impact of road traffic collisions on those directly affected and their families, as well as the impact of dangerous driving more generally on the quality of life of residents in local communities across the country. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that I have no direct role in the enforcement of Road Traffic legislation, which is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner.  However, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the following table shows the number of Garda Mandatory Alcohol Checkpoints recorded in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) North Garda Division for the period 1 December 2016 to 17 January 2017 and for the same period for 2015 /2016 and 2014 / 2015.  </p><p><b>Number of Garda Mandatory Alcohol Checkpoints in DMR North Garda Division for the period 1 December 2016 to 17 January 2017*</b><table><tr><th>2014 / 2015</th><th>2015 / 2016</th><th>2016 / 2017</th></tr><tr><td>124</td><td>58</td><td>125</td></tr></table></p><p><b>*Figures are provisional, operational and liable to change and are valid to 23 January 2017</b></p><p>Road safety is a shared responsibility, one which the Government takes very seriously.  Ireland's current Road Safety Strategy (2013 - 2020) aims to place Ireland consistently on the list of safest countries in the EU and beyond.  To achieve this, we are continuing to work together in partnership with all relevant stakeholders.  I attended a meeting of the Ministerial Committee on Road Safety this month, along with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Road Safety Authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Attorney General and other agencies.  This Committee oversees the implementation of the Road Safety Strategy and provides a forum for high-level discussion of road safety issues. The Committee generally meets later in the year, however, in light of the 2016 increase in road fatalities, the meeting was brought forward to January.  The purpose of the meeting was to bring together all stakeholders to see what immediate actions could be taken to reverse the upward trend in road fatalities.  During this meeting, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicated that there will be an additional 10% increase in the traffic corps during the course of 2017, which should also lead to better outcomes in relation to road traffic enforcement.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also informed the meeting that it was intended to have a stronger focus on road traffic enforcement in the training provided to new recruits at Templemore.</p><p>Following this meeting, my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport announced that his Department will review Section 29 of the Road Traffic 2010 with the intention of ensuring that all drivers, if caught drink driving, will, in future, receive a mandatory disqualification.</p></reply>

Instances of crime and anti-social behaviour are monitored by local Garda management with the assistance of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service, which results in periodic operations aimed at anti-social behaviour on and around public transport routes.  I am further advised that there is effective communication with the respective control centres and that access to good quality CCTV has also been of great assistance in the investigation of complaints.   </p>  <p>  Having regard to the above, I have no plans for the development of separate policing arrangements for trains or transport services generally. Instead, investment is being made in enhancing the resources available for policing generally, including a very substantial provision of &euro;88.5 million for Garda overtime in 2017 which will strengthen the capacity to respond to changing crime trends.  Underpinning the Government's approach is the commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  The Government's plan is to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 new Garda&iacute; and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan within in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Approximately 300 appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve.</p>  <p>  I trust that the Deputy will agree that the increased resources which are now coming on stream will undoubtedly benefit policing in relation to train and other transport services in all areas of the country.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-01-25a.147.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017012500069#WRB04500"><p>I have recently set out the current position in relation to the coming into operation of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority in my Written Reply to Question No. 164 of 17 January 2017 which I shall, therefore, largely reiterate on this occasion.  The setting-up of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority has in fact been under way since 19 July 2016 when, under S.I. No. 383 of 2016, I commenced those provisions of Part 1 and Part 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 as necessary to get the new Authority up and running, particularly in terms of its membership and appointment.  On 29 September 2016, I signed the Order appointing 1 October 2016 as the official &ldquo;establishment day&rdquo; of the Regulatory Authority as provided under section 7 of the 2015 Act - S.I. No. 507 of 2016 refers.  In conjunction with these initial steps the nomination, approval and appointment procedures for the members of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority set out in Part 2 of the 2015 Act were also completed.  This has included the required resolutions approving such appointment having been passed by each House of the Oireachtas.  Dr. Don Thornhill has also been appointed as Chairperson of the Regulatory Authority in accordance with the Act.</p>  <p>  The Authority, which has eleven members including a lay majority and lay-Chairperson, held its inaugural meeting on 26 October 2016 and has been meeting monthly since then with its most recent meeting having taken place on 19 January 2017.  Initial office accommodation has been provided for the Authority by my Department along with the secondment of an officer at Assistant Principal level in support of its start-up phase.  Funding support of &euro;1 million has also been provided to the new Authority by my Department in December on a strictly recoupable basis as the new Authority will be self-funding by levy.  In the building up of capacity and resources to become fully operational, the Legal Services Regulatory Authority has recently appointed a person to fulfil the duties of its Chief Executive on a solely interim basis to drive the initial start-up phase.  At the same time this will enable the Authority to prepare the way for the public recruitment of a full-time Chief Executive in the coming months having had the opportunity to more clearly identify its existing and future management needs and capacities in real time.</p>  <p>  As part of the commencement of Part 2 of the 2015 Act, the Law Society, the Bar Council and the Honorable Society of the King's Inns have furnished the Legal Services Regulatory Authority with copies of their professional codes as required within one month of the Authority's establishment under section 23(6)(a).  On 5 December 2016, under S.I. No. 630 of 2016, I also commenced sections 118 to 120 of the 2015 Act.  These provisions set statutory delivery deadlines for the completion of public consultations and reports on the specified matters concerned.  These relate to Legal Partnerships, Multi-Disciplinary Practices and certain restrictions on barristers in relation to direct access on contentious matters and the holding of clients' monies.  The working focus right now is on the managed roll-out of the Authority's remaining functions in tandem with the phased commencement during the year of the various remaining Parts and provisions of the 2015 Act. </p>  <p>  Against this background, it is intended that the phased commencement of the remaining Parts of the 2015 Act will be implemented in the first half of this year.  The current focus includes the phased commencement of respective sections or Parts of the 2015 Act such as those dealing with the introduction of a more transparent legal cost regime, the establishment of a Roll of Practising Barristers and the separate introduction under the Act of Pre-Action Protocols.  It also includes the transition of the Office of the Taxing-Master to that of the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator which is a substantial structural reform of an office of the High Court and for which I have also introduced and commenced additional supporting measures under the Courts Bill which was enacted on 28 December 2016.  Following these steps the key provisions centred around Part 6 of the Act dealing with the new public complaints and professional conduct and disciplinary procedures, and the appointment of the new Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal, will be commenced. </p>  <p>  These are tasks for which I know the new Authority, with the direct engagement of its interim Chief Executive, is actively building up its working resources in the short term.  My Department and the new Regulatory Authority will, therefore, continue to liaise closely to ensure that we can successfully coordinate the commencement, from my side as Minister, and delivery, by the Authority as the new independent statutory regulator, of the various provisions concerned.</p></reply>

Details of the number of residential mortgages currently held by non-bank entities, including retail credit firms and unregulated loan owners, are presented in table 4 on page 11 of the Central Bank Q3-2016 bulletin. Details of buy-to-let mortgages held by non-bank entities are presented in table 5 on page 12.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the  Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2015 introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Under the Act, purchasers of loan books must either be regulated by the Central Bank themselves or else the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm that is regulated by the Central Bank. The significant point is that that the focus of regulation is directly at the point of contact with the customer. Therefore relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which came into operation in July 2016. It is also important to highlight that the transfer of a loan from one entity to another does not change the terms of the contract or the borrower's rights and obligations under the original contract.</p></reply>

Of these, 2,723 were ineligible or terminated during the process, 217 have been completed and 635 are being actively progressed.  The reasons why a case has not progressed are varied and can depend on the lender, the property, the household and the ability of the Approved Housing Body sector to increase their involvement in the scheme.  Statistical information relating to the Mortgage to Rent Scheme since its inception, including statistics on cases that have been terminated and the reasons for same and a breakdown of cases per County, is available on the Housing Agency&rsquo;s website at the following weblink:   . </p><p>A number of amendments were made to the MTR Scheme in July 2015 to enable more properties to qualify and to make the scheme more flexible and accessible to borrowers.</p><p>Notwithstanding the amendments already made, the Government is committed to supporting households in long-term mortgage arrears to remain in their homes and has included a review of the MTR Scheme as an action in <i>Rebuilding Ireland: An Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>.

The Plan is available at the website www.rebuildingireland.ie.  The Plan is divided into five pillars, with each targeting a specific area of the housing system for attention.</p><p>On 13 December 2016, Government approved the publication of a <i>Strategy for the Rental Sector</i>, which delivers on a commitment made under Pillar 4 of <i>Rebuilding Ireland.</i>The strategy is structured around 4 key areas: security, standards, supply and services.  The measures under these four headings will be implemented through the 29 actions contained in the Strategy.</p><p>In terms of supply, the focus in the strategy is on maintaining existing levels of rental stock and encouraging investment in additional supply. The overarching objective of the strategy is to increase supply and support the development of a stable, strong and viable rental sector offering true choice for households, investment opportunities for providers and reflecting the rights and responsibilities of tenants and landlords.</p><p>There are shortages in the supply of rental accommodation in key locations, particularly in urban areas. In some of these areas there is also significant demand for transitory short-term accommodation.  In this context, easier access to short term rentals at higher prices may be an attractive option for landlords.</p><p>However, a recent determination by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in a particular case has determined that the exclusive use of a residential apartment for short-term holiday lettings is a material change of use requiring planning permission. </p><p>My Department has, by way of Circular letter PL12/2016 of 22 December 2016, brought this determination to the attention of all planning authorities to ensure that they are aware of:</p><p>- the grounds on which the Board reached its decision,</p><p>- the planning implications in terms of the requirement for such commercial use of residential units to be the subject of an application for planning permission, and</p><p>- the importance of a proactive approach to planning enforcement generally in this regard.</p><p>A copy of the Circular letter is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .</p><p>The implications of this case have raised a number of regulatory and other related issues, such as tax liability, residential tenancy regulation, support for tourism, and planning.  The issue was considered in the preparation of the recently published <i>Strategy for the Rental Sector</i>and, with a view to providing more information on the scale and nature of the issue and full clarity regarding the appropriate regulatory approach to be adopted by relevant statutory authorities in relation to short-term tourism-related lettings, my Department, as provided for in the strategy, is establishing a working group, comprising representatives of relevant stakeholders including local authorities, relevant Departments, public bodies and other interests in the area, to consider the disparate issues involved and report in Quarter 2 2017.</p></reply>

The tender process concluded recently and contracts were signed with the successful tenderers. I understand that Irish companies were successful in four of six lots.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the new contracts will come into effect in the coming months as the existing contracting between suppliers and library authorities expire.

Within my Ministerial remit, fire services in Ireland are provided by local authorities in accordance with the provisions of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 and 2003. Dublin City Council provides fire services for the city and county of Dublin which are resourced by the four Dublin Local authorities, through Dublin Fire Brigade (DFB).</p>  <p>  Dublin City Council through Dublin Fire Brigade also provides an ambulance service on behalf of the HSE.  This service is provided under section 25 of the Fire Services Act 1981 which enables local authority fire services to carry out or assist in any operations of an emergency nature.  However, it does not provide a legislative basis for fire services to provide a substitute or alternative ambulance service operating outside of the State&rsquo;s health services provided by the HSE.</p>  <p>  A Health Information and Quality Authority ( HIQA ) report of December 2014 highlights patient safety issues arising from two ambulance services operating in the same domain and points clearly to the need for enhanced integration of service provision in the greater Dublin area between DFB and the National Ambulance Service (NAS).</p>  <p>  While I have not discussed this matter directly with my colleague the Minister for Health, discussions are taking place between our Departments.  Both Departments have requested implementation/action plans in relation to service and governance issues that could be expected to arise from the need to meet HIQA&rsquo;s concerns, while continuing to meet statutory fire service requirements.</p>  <p>  While I have no remit in relation to the provision of ambulance services, from my perspective, as Minister with responsibility for fire safety and the provision of fire services by local authorities, I am concerned that local authority and fire services resources are not diverted from their statutory fire service and fire safety responsibilities where they are providing assistance for another public body.  Available local authority resources should be prioritised for community and other fire safety initiatives as well as their statutory fire service response functions.</p>  <p>  By placing the citizen in need of medical services at the centre of considerations and with flexibility from all the stakeholders concerned, I am confident that a robust over-arching plan can be put in place which will see the infrastructure and staff of Dublin Fire Brigade in a position to provide commissioned ambulance services on behalf of the HSE in the Dublin area on the basis of cost recovery and appropriate governance arrangements, while still meeting their range of fire service responsibilities as a priority.</p></reply>

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme.  To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p><p>The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the Scheme is determined by the relevant housing authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act.  In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, housing authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. </p><p>In order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme, it is essential that an applicant&rsquo;s income is long-term and sustainable in nature.  This is necessary to ensure that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p><p>In line with the commitment given in <i>Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>, my Department is currently carrying out a review of the first 12 months of operation of the scheme.

My Department will spend approximately &euro;232 million this year on HHB for over 424,000 customers.</p>  <p>  The package is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to some people under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  Therefore anyone aged less than 70 years of age must be in receipt of a qualifying payment from the Department or satisfy a means test in order to qualify for HHB.  </p>  <p>  People in receipt of HHB aged under 66 are generally in receipt of payments such as Invalidity Pension, Disability Allowance or Carers.  These payment types mean that the recipients are unable to work full time and earn additional income.  This is not the case for people in receipt of widow&rsquo;s contributory payment who are aged less than 66.  These recipients are of working age and may take up full-time employment, at any level of remuneration, without losing entitlement to their widow&rsquo;s contributory payment.  </p>  <p>  In general, widow&rsquo;s pension only becomes a qualifying payment for HHB once the recipient reaches the age of 66 (State pension age) to ensure alignment with secondary benefits that are available to people in receipt of the State pension. </p>  <p>  The concession whereby widows aged between 60 and 65 years, whose late spouse/civil partner received HHB from my Department, may qualify for the package was introduced at a time when State pension age was 65 and this cohort of widows were seen as less likely to be in a position to take up employment than those of a younger age.</p>  <p>  Any decision to extend the concession to widows aged less than 60 or to allow recipients of widow&rsquo;s pension of any age to qualify for HHB would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.  It would also be necessary to consider whether they would be a priority group for the extension of such benefits ahead of other groups such as the unemployed or lone parents.</p>  <p>  The mortgage interest supplement (MIS) scheme was closed to new entrants from 1 January 2014.</p>  <p>  The original purpose of the MIS scheme was to provide short-term support to eligible people who were unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which was their sole place of residence.  It is important that people experiencing difficulty meeting their home mortgage repayments engage with their lender to explore sustainable solutions.   </p>  <p>  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service, under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, assists people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems, in particular those on low incomes or living on social welfare payments.  As part of its free services, MABS provides a dedicated mortgage arrears advisory service to help and advice those in mortgage arrears and a court mentoring service to assist those facing repossession proceedings.  Additionally, the Government has recently put in place a scheme, known as Abhaile, to help people who are insolvent and in mortgage arrears on their home to access free, independent, expert advice.  Borrowers can access one or more of the free financial and legal advice and assistance services by contacting the MABS helpline 0761072000 or any MABS office.  </p>  <p>   I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

At the end of December, there were 3,490 CA applications awaiting decision.

The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. </p><p>Under SWA, my Department can make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. The Government has provided &euro;31.5 million for the exceptional and urgent needs schemes in 2017. </p><p>Under the ENP scheme payments can be made to support temporary accommodation where required. Statistics are not maintained on the numbers of adults and children supported with accommodation costs through the ENP scheme.  There are many reasons why a person might seek support with temporary accommodation costs, for example when travelling with a family member to access medical treatment in another location. </p><p>The overall responsibility for the response to homelessness rests with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the local authorities.  There are some historical arrangements in place in some areas of the country, for example in Cork City, where Community Welfare Service staff co-ordinate access to homeless accommodation on behalf of the local authority.  These cases are recorded on the PASS system.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

They also support the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s commitments contained in the Comprehensive Employment Strategy (CES) for People with Disabilities, which seeks to address the multiple barriers faced by people with disabilities in obtaining employment. </p>  <p>  Under the CES, the Department is progressively rolling out its full Intreo service to people with disabilities who wish to avail of the service on a voluntary basis.  In such cases, people with disabilities who present at an Intreo Centre will be offered an interview by an employment support officer with a view to agreeing a suitable action plan.  To date, over 60 officers in Intreo Centres have received training to enable them to interact effectively with people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  The DSP also provides a wide range of work related supports for people with disabilities.  One of the principal supports is the EmployAbility service, which provides job coach support to people with disabilities in accessing jobs in the open labour market.  Other supports include the provision of employment subsidies through the Wage Subsidy Scheme, Workplace Adaptation Grants and specialist training courses that are specially designed for people with disabilities.  Funding is also provided to AHEAD (Association for Higher Education Access and Disability) for the Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) programme, an employment placement programme for graduates with disabilities. </p>  <p>  Most recently, Budget 2017 provided funding of &euro;2 million for projects which will deliver pre-activation supports for people with disabilities.  This is a new scheme, the objective of which would be to help bring people with disabilities who are not work-ready closer to the labour market through engagement in training and personal development activities.  This would be followed by an incremental exposure to suitable work. </p>  <p>  On aggregate, employment related supports for people with disability provided by DSP are estimated to cost almost &euro;55 million in 2017. Furthermore, people with disabilities have access to most of the standard employment supports available to other jobseekers such as the Community Employment Scheme and Springboard.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This was an increase of 62 officers compared to 2015.  It is expected that passport application volumes will continue to increase in 2017.

This should reduce the volume of customer queries to the Passport Service and allow more staff to be allocated to application processing.</p>  <p>  Public messaging on the Passport Service website and in media contacts has been revised to underline the importance of applying at least six weeks in advance of travel and reminding that the Passport Express service is still the cheapest and most efficient means of applying for a passport.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to closely monitor the volume of applications. Resources will be re-deployed as needed to deal with any significant increases and the need for additional resources will be kept under active review.</p></reply>

This further deepens my grave concerns about human rights, democracy, the rule of law and freedom of expression in Turkey.</p>  <p>  While I have not had the opportunity to raise the most recent decrees with my Turkish counterpart, I have been explicit about my concerns regarding the situation in Turkey and I have detailed them at every opportunity, including at the specially-convened meeting of the Council of Europe in September, at which Foreign Minister Mevl&uuml;t &Ccedil;avu&thorn;o&eth;lu was present.</p>  <p>  My concerns are eased only slightly by my understanding that new decrees issued on 23 January go some way to reversing or lessening some of the more extreme measures taken under the state of emergency - for example, the period for detention without charge has been reduced to 7 days, and a commission examining complaints regarding arrests, detentions and closures of organisations, including media organisations, has been established.  The state of emergency involves a derogation from the European Convention on Human Rights, which is allowable under the Convention in these circumstances. </p>  <p>  We do not underestimate the challenges facing Turkey: the attempted coup in Turkey of 15 July 2016 was a criminal act and an attack on democracy, and the country also been the victim of dozens of horrific terrorist attacks, carried out predominantly by the outlawed PKK, their affiliates or ISIS.  While the Turkish authorities clearly need to defend their democratic institutions and combat terrorism vigorously and effectively, they must also maintain a measured and proportionate response which adheres to democratic principles.</p></reply>

Mr. Baldenegro is the second recipient of the Goldman environmental prize to be killed in the space of 12 months, and in that context I would also like to pay tribute to the memory of Berta C&aacute;ceres, the Honduran activist and Goldman prize recipient, who was killed in March 2016.</p>  <p>  The trend towards violence against environmental rights organisations in parts of Latin America is of great concern and is being monitored closely by my Department.  My officials engage regularly with civil society partners, including from the Latin American region, on these issues.  I do not hesitate to condemn any intimidation or violence perpetrated against human rights defenders in Mexico or elsewhere.</p>  <p>  On 20 January 2017, the European Union Delegation in Mexico along with the Ambassadors of EU Member States resident in Mexico, including Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador Hyland, issued a statement expressing their sincere condolences to the family and loved ones of Mr. Baldenegro L&oacute;pez and urging the Mexican authorities to make every possible effort to expedite the investigation into his murder and bring the perpetrators to justice. </p>  <p>  Ireland and other EU Member States engage with the Mexican authorities on human rights on an ongoing basis.  In particular the EU uses the High-Level Dialogue on Human Rights, the High-Level Political Dialogue and the Security and Justice Dialogue, to raise issues related to human rights, rule of law and security with the Mexican authorities in open and frank discussions. </p>  <p>  EU Member States including Ireland are to the fore in funding projects led by national and international NGOs aimed at improving the protection of human rights in Mexico.  Ireland has also provided support to civil society and missionary organisations for development projects to improve, amongst other things, the human rights situation in Mexico.  In addition, since 2005 my Department has provided over &euro;1.2 million in funding to the IACHR, whose mission is to promote and protect human rights in the American hemisphere.</p></reply>

From the outset of our preparations we have been clear about our priorities, which remain: minimising the impact on trade and the economy; protecting the Northern Ireland Peace Process; maintaining the Common Travel Area; and influencing the future of the European Union.</p>  <p>  A critical part of our work is ensuring that our priorities are heard and understood across Europe and are reflected in the EU&rsquo;s position for the forthcoming negotiations.  To that end, an extensive programme of engagement with all other EU Governments and the EU institutions, including the European Commission&rsquo;s Brexit Negotiations Task Force, is under way.  To date, there has been over 60 engagements at either political or senior official level. </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach is in regular contact with EU leaders and travelled to Madrid last week for a meeting with the Spanish Prime Minister.  He will visit Warsaw on 9 February for a meeting with the Polish Prime Minister.  For my own part, I have spoken with each of my EU Foreign Minister counterparts in the period immediately following the result of the referendum in the UK.  I have now began a second round of discussions with my EU colleagues.  Most recently, I met with the Spanish Foreign Minister and I am planning to have bilateral discussions with my Luxembourg and Finnish counterpart in the weeks ahead.  Minister of State Murphy is visiting Romania and Greece on 30 January to 1 February while meetings with France, Poland, Slovakia, Latvia and Lithuania at senior official level will take place in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  Engagement with the European Commission&rsquo;s Task Force on Brexit and the Commission&rsquo;s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has also been a central part of the Government&rsquo;s programme of engagement.  The Government&rsquo;s position on Brexit was outlined in meetings with Mr. Barnier in Dublin on 12 October.  Engagement with the Commission&rsquo;s Task Force at a technical level has been regular and is ongoing.  There have been a number of exchanges on key aspects of the negotiations process and the Irish-specific aspects, including on the Common Travel Area and on border issues. </p>  <p>  Feedback to date from this comprehensive engagement has been very encouraging.  There is as sound understanding among EU partners of the unique circumstances which pertain on this island and a strong willingness and openness to work closely with Ireland on addressing our issues.  As a clear demonstration that the Government&rsquo;s efforts are working, I would note that in his first official comments, Michel Barnier, the lead negotiator for the Commission, highlighted the need to address Ireland&rsquo;s issues.</p></reply>

A critical part of our work is ensuring that our particular position and priorities are understood across Europe: therefore engagement with our EU partners and with the EU institutions is critical.  This programme of intense engagement at political and official level is continuing to ensure that the EU&rsquo;s approach to the forthcoming negotiations reflects our priorities.  Ireland looks forward to working with our fellow Member States to deliver the best possible result for Ireland and for the EU.</p>  <p>  A central part of this programme of engagement is meetings with the European Commission.  In addition to meetings with the chief negotiatior, Michel Barnier, intensive bilateral discussions to the taskforce working with him continue.  In our engagement with the Taskforce we have made them aware that Brexit is already having an impact on the Irish economy, and of the disproportionate consequences posed by Brexit to the Irish economy overall in comparison to other Member States.  This message has also been emphasized in more than sixty meetings at political and official level with other Member States.</p>  <p>  In working to minimize the damage to Ireland our first priority is to contribute to the achievement of a close and mutually beneficial relationship between the EU and UK.</p>  <p>  Second, we recognize that the economic challenge posed by Brexit, while very great in itself, also one of a number of factors to be taken into account in our overall economic policy.  State agencies are actively pursuing opportunities for increased investment, business and job creation in Ireland, while as chair of the Export Trade Council, I am working to support Irish companies to expand and diversify their markets, including through support from our Missions.</p>  <p>  The Government is also committed to pursuing a opportunities for Ireland which might arise from Brexit.  Therefore,  work continues on bids for the relocation of the European Medicines Agency and the European Banking Authority from London to Dublin.  Preparatory work on both is advancing within the relevant Government Departments.</p></reply>

It provides a timely and welcome framework through which to develop outward-looking policy settings which encompass foreign and security policy and which mobilise all aspects of the EU&rsquo;s external action in pursuit of concrete and meaningful objectives grounded in the Treaties.  These objectives are to be pursued through a comprehensive approach using the range of instruments available to the European Union, including political, diplomatic, economic development, trade, peace-keeping and crisis management tools.</p>  <p>  Five priority areas have been identified for implementation of the EU Global Strategy.  These include strengthening the EU&rsquo;s capacity, through its Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), to promote international peace and security within a rules-based global order underpinned by the United Nations.</p>  <p>  Since the presentation in June 2016 of the EU Global Strategy by the High Representative/Vice-President (HRVP), Federica Mogherini, work has been taken forward in the Council.  </p>  <p>  The June European Council welcomed the presentation of the Strategy and invited the HRVP, the Commission and the Council to take the work forward.  Implementation of the Strategy in the area of security and defence was discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council meetings in October, and again in November when Foreign Ministers met in joint session with EU Defence Ministers.  </p>  <p>  The European Council in December 2016 endorsed the work of Council on implementing the EU Global Strategy in the area of security and defence, and called for comprehensive follow-up by the HRVP and Member States.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is a strong supporter of initiatives, through the CSDP, which improve the capacity of the Union to contribute to international peace and security, particularly in support of the UN.  We support cooperation with international partners where this adds value and contributes to the achievement of these objectives.</p>  <p>  The discussion of the Global Strategy, and cooperation with other organisations in this area is grounded within the EU Treaties, and the Lisbon Protocol which protects Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality.</p></reply>

Despite the cessation of hostilities since 30 December 2016, the situation remains extremely fragile and the humanitarian crisis persists for many Syrians.  Humanitarian access and the protection of civilians are binding legal obligations for all parties and must be observed.</p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has provided &euro;67.5 million in humanitarian assistance to Syria and the region, including more than &euro;25 million during 2016.  This is Ireland&rsquo;s largest ever response to any humanitarian crisis.  Ireland&rsquo;s support is channelled through UN, Red Cross and NGO partners, who are best placed to respond and ensure that Irish funding goes to those who need it most.  The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in particular has proven capacity and expertise in reaching the most vulnerable communities in conflict situations and gaining access to besieged and hard-to-reach areas, where other organisations cannot operate.  During 2016 alone, Ireland&rsquo;s funding supported the work of the ICRC to carry out 55 cross-frontline operations to bring food, clean water and essential aid to millions of Syrians. </p>  <p>  In line with a coordinated, &ldquo;Whole of Syria&rdquo; approach, bringing together international humanitarian efforts inside Syria and those in the neighbouring countries of Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) sets out annually the principal needs and objectives of the humanitarian response, and monitors progress towards these objectives.  These are to save lives and alleviate suffering, enhance the protection of civilians and build their resilience.  Ireland&rsquo;s support to the UN in Syria has been provided through pooled funding managed by OCHA in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.  The Jordan and Turkey funds in particular prioritise cross-border assistance to vulnerable communities, supporting local partners to target hard-to-reach areas. </p>  <p>  Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response in Syria, which amounted to &euro;445 million in 2016.  The EU and its Member States are collectively the lead provider of international aid to the people of Syria.  Since the launch of the EU&rsquo;s Humanitarian Initiative for Aleppo on 2 October 2016, the EU has a leading role in ensuring minimum conditions for humanitarian access and for the security and safety of medical staff and humanitarian workers.</p>  <p>  We continue to monitor the situation closely, and are ready to provide further assistance in support of the Syrian people as needed.</p></reply>

In 2016 approximately one third of the contributions to UNHCR came from the EU.  The EU recognises and is supportive of the work of these agencies in helping vulnerable people on the move and in assisting the EU and its Member States in meeting the needs of these people.  For example the EU will contribute a total of &euro;62 million in humanitarian funding over the 2016-2017 period to UNHCR, to support its work with the Greek government in providing protection and assistance to refugees and migrants in mainland Greece.</p><p>In broader terms, the EU and its Member States are the world&rsquo;s leading providers of development and humanitarian assistance and this assistance, including through the UN system, is crucial in addressing the root causes of forced displacement.  Ireland plays a strong role in policy terms, through our aid programme and through our bilateral and multilateral development assistance.  The EU is also a major contributor to UN peacekeeping, and EU military capabilities play an essential role in permitting UN peace operations to engage more effectively around the world.  This type of collaboration is clearly fundamental to addressing the conflicts that are at the origin of major flows of refugees and displaced people.</p><p>In addition to being a key EU partner the UN is an indispensable global forum for tackling these global challenges.  Ireland, through our role as co-facilitator, played a central role in last year&rsquo;s UN discussions on how to address this and similar crises in the future, in a long-term and sustainable manner.  The outcome of those discussions was adopted at last September&rsquo;s UN Summit on addressing large movements of refugees and migrants.  The EU is now working with the rest of the international community to implement the outcome of the Summit.</p></reply>

In 2017, the UN estimates that 92.8 million people are in need of some form of humanitarian assistance, over 65 million people are displaced from their homes across the world, and $22.2 billion is needed to fund the global humanitarian response.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian response has been consistent to some of the world&rsquo;s most severe crises, some rarely mentioned in the media, such as the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan, as well as the crises in Syria, Yemen and Iraq.  The core objective is to save and protect lives, alleviate suffering and maintain human dignity.  Our assistance is focused on where needs are greatest, providing support to the most vulnerable and hard to reach populations, and we place particular emphasis on gender equality and protection. </p>  <p>  In 2016, Ireland provided over &euro;150 million in humanitarian assistance, reaching people affected by conflict and natural disasters.  This amount includes Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the European Commission&rsquo;s humanitarian action outside the EU, which has an annual budget of approximately &euro;1 billion.</p>  <p>  Ireland works with a range of partners to deliver our humanitarian assistance including NGOs, the UN and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.  Ireland&rsquo;s UN partners lead the coordination of international appeals for humanitarian assistance, including through the UN Central Emergency Response Fund.  Ireland is the eighth largest donor to this Fund, which has provided $4.6 billion in life-saving assistance to people affected by crises since 2005.  Ireland is also a strong supporter of the UN pooled funds located in countries of particularly severe crisis in Africa and the Middle East.</p>  <p>  The international community came together at the World Humanitarian Summit in May last year to reflect on how donors can deliver on the then Secretary General&rsquo;s &lsquo;Agenda for Humanity&rsquo; and the Sustainable Development Goals.  Over 3,140 commitments were made by Governments and implementing partners, to strengthen humanitarian action, create sustainable solutions for those affected by crises, and ensure adequate humanitarian financing.  I delivered Ireland&rsquo;s national statement at the Summit making 35 specific commitments to achieve more sustainable and effective humanitarian action.  We will continue to work closely with our international partners to ensure that the global humanitarian response is increasingly coordinated and effective.</p></reply>

In 2017, the UN estimates that 92.8 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, with over 65 million people displaced by conflict worldwide.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian response is channeled through UN, Red Cross or NGO partners who are best placed to respond.  Ireland is the eighth largest donor to the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund.  It enables UN agencies to swiftly allocate funds to sudden crises, such as earthquakes and tsunamis, in order to kick start emergency responses.  Ireland also supports the European Commission&rsquo;s relief efforts through our EU budget allocation. </p>  <p>  Ireland has responded swiftly and effectively in recent years to devastating natural disasters.  Ireland was one of the first countries to respond to Typhoon Haiyan, which hit central Philippines in November 2013.  More than US$865 million was contributed by the international community, including &euro;40 million from the European Commission.  Ireland provided &euro;7.1 million.  </p>  <p>  More recently, Ireland responded to the earthquake in Nepal in 2015, allocating &euro;1.65 million to NGO partners and distributing 100 tonnes of emergency supplies.  In total, the international community contributed over $533.8 million, exceeding the UN appeal of $421 million.  This included &euro;22.6 million from the European Commission.</p>  <p>  Ireland provided a total of &euro;25.9 million in humanitarian and development funding for Haiti between 2010 and 2016.  This includes over &euro;2 million in response to Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and nearly &euro;14 million in assistance following the Haiti earthquake in 2010.  The European Commission has provided a total of &euro;273 million since 2010 to assist victims of the earthquake.  </p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made in recent years to improve the scale and effectiveness of the international community&rsquo;s response to major disasters and humanitarian crises.  Lessons learnt from previous crises such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2010 Haiti earthquake have informed the improvement of systems under the leadership of the UN, to ensure the most effective, efficient and rapid delivery of aid possible.</p></reply>

It does this primarily through the UN Security Council which has a variety of tools at its disposal to address threats to international peace and to contribute towards the resolution of conflicts: it has the power to authorise military action, deploy peacekeeping and political missions, and to impose sanctions against non-compliant States.</p>  <p>  The blockages at the Security Council in recent years have prevented the international community from acting together in a way that would allow civilians in conflict zones to be afforded greater protection.  I believe that, in addition to the terrible consequences for civilian populations, this inaction has resulted in considerable damage to the standing of the Security Council.</p>  <p>  As a member of the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency (ACT) group of states, Ireland advocates for reforms to the membership and working methods of the Security Council, including the use of the veto which, on some occasions, has led to inaction by the Security Council at critical moments.  Ideally, Ireland would like to see the veto rights of the existing permanent members of the Security Council ended.  In 2015, Ireland associated itself with a declaration presented by France and Mexico calling on permanent members of the Security Council to voluntarily waive their right to exercise their veto in cases of mass atrocity.</p>  <p>  While decisions of the Security Council, which are key to the maintenance of international peace and security and the welfare of civilians in conflict zones, are the preserve of Member States, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Guterres, who took office on 1 January, has announced a number of measures aimed at improving the working of the peace and security architecture of the UN Secretariat.  </p>  <p>  These measures include steps to remove structural and bureaucratic barriers in the UN Secretariat with the objective of better integrating the efforts of staff who carry out work in relation to conflict zones.  Mr. Guterres is to appoint an internal team to take stock of the recommendations from three major peace and security reviews which were completed in 2015.  Ireland engaged fully with all three reviews, calling for the recommendations to be discussed and implemented as part of our broader calls for UN reform.  We will continue to engage on these reviews in the period ahead.  Mr. Guterres has also announced that he intends to enhance the role of the UN Operations and Crisis Centre so that this crisis hub can better collate and consolidate information from across the UN system in a timely manner.  </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to advocate, including with the new Secretary General, for reform of the UN to ensure that it is equipped to respond to the challenges of the twenty-first century and to fulfil its critical role in the prevention, reduction or resolution of conflict, and more broadly in the maintenance of international peace and security. </p></reply>

These efforts have been supported by the international community.  The EU has pledged up to &euro;50 million in support of the Multinational Joint Taskforce, which supports 8,700 troops from Nigeria and neighbouring countries to promote regional security.  Despite recent progress by Nigerian and regional armed forces, violence by Boko Haram remains a serious threat to the peace and security of Nigeria and the wider Lake Chad region.  Ireland has consistently condemned the violence and human rights violations perpetrated by Boko Haram.  Last year, we provided &euro;3.1m in humanitarian assistance for the crisis in the region, and our Embassy in Abuja has been active in monitoring developments.</p>  <p>  The release of women and girls kidnapped by Boko Haram continues to be a priority for the international community.  Ireland has consistently called for the release of the Chibok schoolgirls who were abducted in April 2014.  We welcomed the news in October 2016 of the release of 21 girls following talks facilitated by the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Swiss Government.  Since then, the Nigerian army has also reported finding another schoolgirl in the north of Borno state.  These girls should be provided with all possible assistance to support their full reintegration into society and their return to education.</p>  <p>  The group Al-Shabaab remains a threat to the peace, stability and prosperity of Somalia and neighbouring countries in the Horn of  Africa.  The international community plays an important role in containing the violence and instability caused by its actions. </p>  <p>  The United Nations, African Union and European Union are all engaging actively in Somalia.  The African Union peacekeeping Mission in Somalia, AMISOM, is mandated by the UN Security Council to reduce the threat posed by Al-Shabaab and to enable the gradual handover of security responsibility to Somali security forces.  The United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM) is tasked with supporting peacebuilding and state-building in Somalia.  The EU contributes through the funding of AMISOM, as well as supporting two missions in Somalia, the EU Training Mission in Somalia and EUCAP Somalia, which aims at strengthening Somalia's maritime security and capacity to effectively govern its waters. </p>  <p>  Ireland has responded consistently to humanitarian needs in Somalia.  Last year, we contributed just under &euro;6 million in humanitarian assistance to Somalia.  During my visit to Kenya last month, I held discussions in Nairobi on the situation in Somalia and the wider region and on the assistance which Ireland might provide in the future.</p></reply>

The aims of the Eastern Partnership are to promote peace and stability in the region and to enhance economic and political integration between the participating countries and the EU.  The model of cooperation with each of the participating states has been tailored to meet their needs and priorities and those of the EU.</p>  <p>  The EU provides substantial support to Ukraine, and has committed &euro;3.14 billion to the country in macro-financial assistance since 2014.  At the most recent EU-Ukraine summit in November, the EU agreed on a support package for reform in Ukraine worth over &euro;300 million.  The EU also provides practical support to Ukraine through programmes such as the EU Advisory Mission on civilian security sector reform.  Cooperation can be expected to deepen upon entry into force of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement, the trade part of which is provisionally in force since 1 January 2016.  Ukraine is already seeing the economic benefits of the free trade area which has resulted in a 7.5% increase in trade volumes between the EU and Ukraine in one year.</p>  <p>  Georgia signed an Association Agreement and a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with the EU in 2014 which entered into force on 1 July 2016.  By removing customs tariffs and quotas and by comprehensively approximating trade-related laws and regulations to the standards of the European Union, the Agreement offers Georgia a framework for boosting trade and economic growth.  As part of this process, Georgia has committed to undertaking a number of reforms, including on democratic development and fundamental freedoms, on constitutional and parliamentary reform, and anti-corruption reforms.</p>  <p>  In December 2015, negotiations began on a framework agreement between the EU and Armenia covering political, economic and sectoral cooperation.  This will replace the current EU-Armenia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement which dates from 1999.  Armenia receives considerable funding from the EU, including between &euro;140 and &euro;170 million for the period 2014-2017.  This is focused on supporting private sector development, and reforms in public administration and justice systems. </p>  <p>  Post-Brexit, Ireland will remain a committed member of the EU and of the Eurozone.  Now, more than ever, our membership of the EU must remain at the heart of our engagement with the world.  Continuing access to a Single Market of 500 million consumers is vital to the well-being of the Irish people and EU membership has been central to Ireland&rsquo;s economic and social development.  To this end, membership of the EU also includes trading arrangements with third countries such as those with Ukraine, Georgia and Armenia. </p>  <p>  One of the consequences of Brexit for the Irish economy will be the need for Ireland to diversify its markets.  The Government is committed to pursuing any opportunities for Ireland which might arise from Brexit.  &euro;3m has been allocated specifically to Enterprise Ireland and IDA to help market diversification and new investments.</p></reply>

Foreign Ministers have consistently underlined that ultimately there will be no defeat of Daesh without a political solution to the crisis in Syria.  This is reflected particularly in the comprehensive conclusions on a &lsquo;<i>Regional Strategy for Syria and Iraq as well as the Daesh threat</i>&rsquo;, which were adopted by the Council in May last year.</p><p>Foreign Ministers have also focused on the contribution that the EU can make through external action to preventing and countering terrorism.  Engagement with third countries to prevent violent extremism and to strengthen their capacity to detect and prevent terrorism, in full compliance with international law and human rights, is at the heart of the EU&rsquo;s strategy and is reflected in a substantial increase in assistance to third countries in this respect.</p><p>The EU&rsquo;s approach is guided by, and is consistent with, the approach taken by the UN to countering Daesh and by the principles and measures set out in relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, including UNSCR 2161 (2014) on freezing funds and other assets of terrorist groups, and UNSCR 2178 (2014) on measures to suppress the recruiting, organising, transporting or equipping of individuals who travel to another State to plan or carry out terrorist acts or training. </p><p>The former UN Secretary General&rsquo;s comprehensive <i>Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism</i>, presented in January last year, and his related reports are an important and welcome contribution to addressing the threat posed by Daesh, and to highlighting the measures being taken against them in areas such as countering their financing, preventing and disrupting the travel of foreign terrorist fighters, countering recruitment and preventing violent extremism.</p><p>Ireland supports the comprehensive approach being taken at EU level to preventing and countering terrorism.  At meetings of the Council, I have stressed the need to tackle underlying factors that contribute to radicalisation and terrorism and in particular the importance of the link between security and development.  I have also emphasised the need to ensure a joined-up approach in relation to the discussions of Foreign Ministers and those of our Justice and Home Affairs counterparts.</p><p>Increasing the effectiveness of information and intelligence-sharing and enhancing border security have been priority themes at recent meetings of the EU Justice and Home Affairs Council.  A series of measures is being rolled out to strengthen cooperation and to develop the EU's legal framework for information-sharing, combating terrorism and controlling illegal firearms.

We have seen deep economic crises which have affected a number of member states, including Ireland; there have been terror attacks in some of our major cities which have caused appalling suffering for individuals and communities.  The Continent has been grappling with the biggest movement of people seen in peacetime coming from our southern neighbourhood and further afield.  Parties from the far-right have made electoral inroads in a number of EU states and for the first time in the Union&rsquo;s history, a member state has decided to leave.</p><p>Despite these enormous challenges, Europe has not disintegrated.  27 Heads of State and Government meeting in Bratislava in September issued a declaration stating that the Union was &ldquo;indispensable&rdquo; for them and pledging to offer EU citizens in the upcoming months a vision of an attractive EU they can trust and support.  The Future of Europe which will be on the agenda of EU Heads of State and Government meeting in Valletta on 3 February and for the 60th Anniversary of the Treaty of Rome in Rome in March.  Ireland will work with its partners, as a committed EU member, to bring the vision promised at Bratislava to fruition.  We will succeed only if we maintain the unity of purpose to which the Deputy refers.</p></reply>

The HSE has been requested to develop the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List Action Plan in conjunction with and supported by, the NTPF's proposal for utilisation of the remaining &euro;10m of 2017 funding for patient treatment.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-01-25a.497.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1337" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017012500074#WRG02100"><p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) is a system of financial support for those in need of long-term nursing home care.  Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  A financial assessment is carried out by the HSE to determine how much a participant in the Scheme will contribute to the cost of their care.  </p>  <p>  Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held. In the case of a couple, the applicant&rsquo;s means are assessed as 50% of the couple&rsquo;s combined income and assets.  The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment.  The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care.  This is known as the three year cap.</p>  <p>  The Scheme has a number of important safeguards built into the financial assessment which ensures that:</p>  <p>  -  Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care;</p>  <p>  -  An applicant will keep a personal allowance of 20% of his/her income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater.  This is in recognition of the fact that, although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing;</p>  <p>  -  If an applicant has a spouse/partner remaining at home, he/she will be left with 50% of the couple&rsquo;s income or the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater;</p>  <p>  -  If both members of a couple enter nursing home care, they each retain at least 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater;</p>  <p>  -  Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account for the financial assessment, including health expenses, payments required by law, rent payments and borrowings in respect of a person&rsquo;s principal private residence;</p>  <p>  -  A person&rsquo;s eligibility for other schemes, such as the Medical Card Scheme or the Drug Payment Scheme, is unaffected by participation in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme or residence in a nursing home.</p>  <p>  In addition to these safeguards, where an applicant&rsquo;s assets include land and property held in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from their estate.  This is known as the  Nursing Home Loan (Ancillary State Support), the purpose of which is to ensure that a person does not have to sell their home during their lifetime to pay for long-term nursing home care.  A nursing home resident can apply for this deferral at any stage. </p>  <p>  When the Nursing Homes Support Scheme commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  A number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies, including recommendations in relation to improving and simplifying the application process, and recommendations relating to the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.</p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress certain recommendations contained in the Review.  This Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners, and when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  </p>  <p>  Significant progress has already been made in relation to the implementation of recommendations relating to the administrative reforms to the Scheme.  The IFA made a submission to the Working Group on the treatment of farms for the purpose of the Scheme.  These proposals are currently being considered.</p></reply>

The Strategy is a cross cutting area of public policy and service delivery, which requires a coordinated response to tackling the drug problem, involving the statutory, community and voluntary sectors.  The overall objective of the Strategy is to tackle the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on the five pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research.  Prevention programmes constitute a significant part of the Government's response to the drug problem, particularly among young persons.  </p>  <p>  As the nature and extent of the drug problem has changed since the commencement of the current Strategy in 2009, Government is committed to putting a new drugs strategy in place this year, when the current policy expires.  A Steering Committee has been established to advise me on a new Strategy, with a view to developing an integrated public health approach to substance misuse, defined as the harmful or hazardous use of psychoactive substances, including alcohol and illegal drugs. </p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made in developing the evidence-base for the new Strategy.  This includes a high level review of the current Strategy by an international panel of experts, a review of systematic evidence reviews of interventions to tackle the drug problem and a trends analysis of the drugs situation in the past 10 years.  In addition, multi-stakeholder focus groups have given their views on measures to address gaps in the current response to the drugs problem and a public consultation process has taken place, which has resulted in over 2000 submissions.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the new Strategy will be based on a health-led approach to the drug problem and build on progress achieved under previous drug strategies.  I understand that the Steering Committee is continuing with its deliberations and is expected to submit its final report to me by the end of March.  I hope to be in a position to bring my proposals to Government on the new Strategy thereafter.</p></reply>

The strategy was developed in response to a recommendation of the National AIDS Strategy Committee on the need to establish clear leadership within the health sector around the area of sexual health.  The Strategy contains 71 recommendations that address all aspects of sexual health and a Sexual Health Action Plan for 2015-2016 that contains 18 priority actions for immediate attention.</p>  <p>  One of the priority actions identified in the Action Plan for 2016 is to 'Prioritise, develop and implement guidance to support clinical decision making for STI testing, screening and treatment and on the appropriate use of antiretroviral therapy in HIV prevention&rsquo;.  An Implementation Group has now been established within the HSE as an outcome of this action.  This group will make recommendations on the appropriate use of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in the overall context of the national approach to HIV prevention. </p>  <p>  As the matters referred are service issues, these questions have been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

Indeed, this is all the more relevant after the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU, which presents significant new challenges for the agri-food sector in particular. </p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa and the Gulf region.  This is where our efforts will be focused for the foreseeable future, particularly given the need to diversify our markets and to reduce our reliance on traditional destinations such as the UK.  </p>  <p>  In keeping with the priorities outlined in Food Wise 2025, I and Minister Doyle led trade missions to China, Singapore, Vietnam and South Korea in September 2016.  In November I also led a trade mission to Morocco which was extended at senior official level to include Algeria.  Earlier in 2016, senior officials accompanied a Bord Bia trade mission to Iran, and travelled on to Turkey and met with officials to discuss trade of live animals.  </p>  <p>  I will lead a Trade Mission to the Gulf Region at the end of February.  This will cover the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.  My Department is currently working with Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland to finalise the arrangements for this mission, which will include participants from across the agri-food sector and will feature extensive trade contacts as well as political discussions with my counterparts in the host countries.  </p>  <p>  The mission will serve to enhance and improve our existing levels of market access in Saudi Arabia and the UAE.  It will also promote Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a producer of high quality, safe and sustainably produced meat and dairy products in the Gulf region.  I am also considering a range of other destinations for the remainder of 2017, although no decision has yet been made in terms of content or timing.  Again, markets in Asia, Africa and America are likely to feature prominently in these considerations, and I am of course ready to respond as appropriate to other opportunities that may arise.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s ultimate goal in relation to the agri-food sector is to be able to continue to trade freely with the UK in both directions.  This trade should be carried out without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures.</p>  <p>  The most immediate impact of the vote on Irish farming has been the effect of exchange rate volatility, with sectors such as mushrooms and forestry particularly exposed due to their high dependence on the UK market.  In response, my Department and its agencies have implemented a range of measures, including the new low-interest agri-cash flow fund of &euro;150m, agri-taxation measures, increased funding of Bord Bia and BIM, investment in R and D and innovation, and increased expenditure on the Rural Development Programme and the Seafood Development Programme.</p>  <p>  A number of additional issues arise over the longer term, mainly in the context of the potential future trading relationship between the UK and the EU, but also in the related areas of standards, and veterinary and certification requirements.  There is a particular North-South dimension to these issues which will need to be addressed also and there are separate, and potentially severe, implications arising from the loss of the UK contribution to the EU budget, and from future access to fisheries stocks.  </p>  <p>  I consider it vitally important that our key message of remaining as close as possible to the current trading arrangements is heard and understood across Europe, and for that reason the extensive consultations currently being undertaken with our EU counterparts at political and official levels will continue, and indeed intensify, over the coming months.</p></reply>

This commitment builds upon the recognition in the 2015 Energy White Paper of the long-term strategic importance of diversifying Ireland's energy generation portfolio and largely decarbonising the energy sector by 2050.  Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low carbon energy future will ultimately involve moving to lower emissions fuels (e.g. moving initially from peat and coal to gas), and ultimately towards a greater reliance on renewable energy, including biomass.  It is important to note, however, that the fuel used in power stations is a matter for the operators involved and I have no role or function in this regard.</p><p>However, I am aware that there is substantial co-firing of biomass with peat taking place at the Edenderry plant operated by Bord na M&oacute;na.Currently, this plant is receiving support under REFIT 3.  I have been informed that in 2016 the total biomass usage at the Edenderry Power Plant was 317,962 tonnes, of this 99,022 tonnes was imported.  The two ESB operated plants cited by the Deputy are not presently receiving support under REFIT 3, yet I understand that they have been undertaking trials with different forms of biomass.  </p><p>The Bioenergy Scheme administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine previously provided once-off capital grants to facilitate the establishment of willow for use in renewable energy production.  However, uptake on the Scheme was poor and attracted only four applications in 2015.  The continuation of a support scheme to grow bioenergy crops is now under review.</p><p>In addition, Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte Teoranta are presently developing proposals to establish a partnership, to be known as Bioenergy Ireland, which would seek to stimulate both the demand and supply sides of the biomass market with a range of company-led initiatives.</p><p>In 2016, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) published its report &lsquo;Bioenergy Supply in Ireland 2015-2035&rsquo; in which a number of bioenergy resources were examined in detail, including straw.  This report can be downloaded from the SEAI website at<i></i></p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.</p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.</p><p>Currently, approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband from commercial service providers and investment by the telecoms sector is continuing to expand this footprint. </p><p>The proposed State intervention under the NBP represents a potentially very significant capital investment project for the State and the Government is firmly committed to delivering this investment, as evidenced in the National Broadband Plan itself and in the Programme for Government, the Action Plan for Jobs and the Statement of Government Priorities.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>shows the current extent of the State Intervention area.  The map shows Ireland with two colours, BLUE and AMBER.  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The AMBER areas on the map show the target areas for the State intervention which are the subject of the current procurement process.  It is intended that premises within this area will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.  </p><p>Under EU State Aid rules, public investment in a commercial market has to be targeted at areas where there is evidence of market failure.  Therefore, the Government's proposed investment under the NBP will apply to those parts of the country that are unlikely to be served commercially. </p><p>A formal procurement process is now in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  This provides for a future proofed solution for the  25 years of the contract and beyond.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.  </p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. </p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In a further positive initiative, last July, I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague Minister Humphreys to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.  The Taskforce report which was published in December, is available at the following link:</p><p>I recently signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with the allocation of spectrum in the 3.6GHz band, in early 2017.  This will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.  I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, to provide enhanced mobile services.  </p><p>These investments should assist in significantly improving the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country, including Co Kerry.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides that a number of schemes, including the Athy Distributor Road, targeting bottlenecks in the road network will be progressed subject to necessary approvals.  In this context the project has to meet the requirements of the Public Spending Code and my Department's Common Appraisal Framework for Transport Projects as well has obtaining planning approval.  It is a matter for Kildare County Council to progress the scheme through the approval process.</p>  <p>  As regards the planning approval process, the Council has advised my Department that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) Screening report has been prepared and it concludes that an EIS is required.  I understand that the Council has sought An Bord Ple&aacute;nala's direction under Clause 50(1) (b) of the Roads Act, as amended, for the preparation of an EIS.  The Council is to inform my Department when a direction from An Bord Ple&aacute;nala is received.</p>  <p>  In relation to the project appraisal process, the Council has submitted the project Business Case and Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) documentation for consideration by my Department.  Consideration of the project appraisal documentation involves a number of steps.  As the project has an estimated cost in excess of &euro;20 million, my Department's Economic and Financial Evaluation Unit in liaison with the Central Expenditure and Evaluation Unit (CEEU) in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will need to review the CBA for compliance with the Public Spending Code and my Department's Common Appraisal Framework.  The overall Business Case will then need approval.</p>  <p>  The project appraisal procedure will be progressed as soon as possible taking into account available resources.  I can confirm my support for this project and have made available an allocation of &euro;1 million as part of yesterday's announcement on Regional and Local roads grants to progress this project.</p></reply>

This Strategy sets out very ambitious targets to grow the level of exports by &euro;5bn to &euro;26bn per annum with over two-thirds of those outside of the UK.</p>  <p>  EI&rsquo;s export strategy is twofold &ndash; it has a specific focus on consolidating exports in the UK and it will remain an important market for Ireland.  EI will be implementing a UK Market Development plan which focusses on sustaining exports in key sectors such as construction, agritech, aerospace and engineering and also identifying new growth opportunities in financial services, infrastructure/public sector.  EI&rsquo;s trade mission programme, which will be launched in the coming weeks, outlines a number of trade missions to the UK focussing on some of these key sectors.  EI is also working with companies heavily focussed on the UK, at a sector by sector and one to one basis, through its UK office, on improving their competitiveness and innovation capabilities to sustain and grow exports.</p>  <p>  The second part of the strategy focuses on increasing exports to markets beyond the UK. EI&rsquo;s plans have a specific emphasis on markets, including the Eurozone, where it plans to increase exports by 50% to 2020, the USA/Canada, Asia and the Middle East.  EI&rsquo;s international trade &amp;amp; events programme, which will be launched shortly, focusses on trade missions, market study visits and inwards buyer visits from markets with specific sectoral opportunities. </p>  <p>  To drive this strategy, 39 posts will be created in a number of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s overseas offices and in the Irish based team.  On foot of 2015 export figures, there is immediate opportunity and potential for strengthening our foothold in existing established markets and for diversified export growth.  In 2015, sales to North American grew by 27%, Northern Europe by 8% and Asia-PAC by 11%. </p>  <p>  Extra staff will be placed in EI&rsquo;s overseas offices with sectoral knowledge and expertise such as in engineering, food, life sciences and construction.  This will drive export growth to other international markets where there are known opportunities and reduce reliance on the UK.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the UK will continue to be a priority market due to Ireland&rsquo;s size, geographic proximity and cultural ties.

The programme was then expanded by reducing the age of eligibility to 3 years and by increasing the number of entry points to three throughout the programme year (September, January and April).  This means that children can begin to avail of their free place on the pre-school programme as soon as possible after they reach the age of 3.  Eligibility for the ECCE programme is bounded at the upper end by the requirement that children begin primary education from the age of 6.  Providing free pre-school for children from the age of 3 was a key recommendation of the <i>Expert Advisory Group on the Early Years Strategy.</i></p><p>We must also be cognisant of children's levels of development, as the scheme contains both a care and education component.  Participation in ECCE provides children with their first formal experience of early learning, the starting-point of their educational and social development outside the home.  Children who avail of pre-school are more likely to be ready for school and a formal learning and social environment.</p><p>I would also note to the Deputy that plans are currently in train to provide for a new national scheme of financial support for parents towards the cost of their childcare entitled the Affordable Childcare Scheme, which will replace the existing targeted childcare subsidisation schemes with a single, streamlined and more user-friendly scheme.  The new scheme will provide a system from which both universal and targeted subsidies can be provided towards the cost of childcare.  In the case of targeted subsidies, these will be payable for children from 6 months of age up to 15 years of age.  The level of subsidy will depend on the investment available and on a family&rsquo;s income.  The new Affordable Childcare Scheme does not replace ECCE as it is intended to provide &ldquo;wraparound‟ care for pre-school and school-age children.</p></reply>

The new Scheme will provide a system from which both universal and targeted subsidies can be provided towards the cost of childcare.  This new Scheme will replace the existing targeted childcare programmes with a single, streamlined and more user-friendly scheme and will include &ldquo;wraparound‟ care for pre-school and school-age children.</p>  <p>  The universal element of the Scheme will be available to all families with children between the age of 6 months and 36 months (or until the child qualifies for the free pre-school programme if later than 36 months).  The targeted element of the scheme will involve a progressive system of income-related subsidies for parents with children between 6 months and 15 years, with eligibility based on net parental income.  The Scheme will be available in childcare providers who are registered with Tusla, including both centre-based childcare providers (e.g. cr&egrave;ches, preschools and daycare centres) and child-minders.</p>  <p>  The Scheme is designed to be flexible, with the ability to adjust income-thresholds and subsidy rates over time as additional state investment becomes available.  The policy paper on the Scheme was approved by Government in October 2016.  A report on the national public consultation on the scheme, which was carried out in November 2016 and yielded 4,000 responses, will be completed in February 2017.  The Heads of Bill and General Scheme were approved by Government on 24th  January 2017.

This is the final stage of a process that has been ongoing since early 2016 focused on sustainability issues directly related to the impact of the childcare regulations, whereby Community Employment workers without FETAC Level 5 qualifications in childcare are no longer counted towards staff:child ratios in services.</p>  <p>  Good-faith engagement of services with this project, including completion of all project documents, is an absolute requirement in order for funding to be considered, and my Department cannot assess incomplete applications, or applications for funding, falling outside these criteria.</p>  <p>  The Affordable Childcare Scheme sets out to provide for a childcare subsidy to parents that will support an affordable childcare cost at different income thresholds.  It is envisaged that the scheme will make a significant positive contribution towards the sustainability of many community childcare services, particularly because the proposed maximum subsidy under the scheme will be significantly greater than the current maximum subsidy under the Community Childcare Subvention.  It is estimated that 77% of beneficiaries of current targeted schemes will receive the maximum subsidy rate under the new scheme.  </p>  <p>  Given the importance of financial sustainability for the provision of quality childcare, the Irish Programme for Government commits to conducting and publishing an independent review of the cost of providing quality childcare in Ireland.  This commitment aligns closely with work on the design and development of the Affordable Childcare Scheme and is currently being progressed in that context.</p>  <p>  Department officials are reviewing previous published research and analysis on the cost of childcare provision, are assessing available data sources and are scoping the precise requirements for the independent review.  Issues that the review may consider include (1) the total average cost of quality childcare provision, (2) variation in cost and the reasons for same, (3) the link between cost and quality, (4) the cost of providing childcare services in disadvantaged communities and (5) the likely impact of future cost pressures, including the ongoing professionalisation of the sector.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2016, funding of &euro;51m was provided to my Department for these schemes.  As the Deputy is aware, Budget 2017 has provided an additional &euro;5.5m in current funding to my Department to support the provision of youth services.  This will bring the total youth funding in 2017 to &euro;57.4m.  This additional funding will be used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services.  My Department is working with national organisations and local services to identify service development needs for 2017 and to agree the 2017 allocations.  Every effort will be made to complete this process as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  In 2016, an amount of &euro;500,405 was allocated for the projects and services under Kildare Youth Services, which operates under Youth Work Ireland.  My Department provides funding to Kildare Youth Services under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme in respect of six local youth projects in Athy, Naas, Leixlip, Newbridge, the Curragh and Kildare town and a Youth Information Centre in Naas.   </p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department is currently engaging with Kildare Wicklow ETB with regard to the provision of a full time youth officer for County Kildare.  In the interim, the county shares a youth officer with Wicklow, who is very active in both counties.</p></reply>
