    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-12-14a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121400068#WRA00500"><p>I should first explain that Public Private Partnerships are already subject to a strong public investment management methodology, which includes appraisal. The Deputy may be referring to a recommendation made as part of the recent IMF PIMA report, to the effect that appraisals should be published on a more systematic basis.</p>  <p>  The National Development Finance Agency was established in 2003 under the National Development Finance Agency Act 2002.  The role of the NDFA is to advise State Authorities on the optimum means of financing public investment projects in order to achieve value for money and to provide advice in relation to all aspects of financing, refinancing and insurance, including risk analysis, of public investment projects.  All PPP projects involving the use of private finance must be referred to the NDFA.  In addition, all projects valued at &euro;20 million or above, whether traditional or PPP, must be referred to the NDFA for advice.</p>  <p>  The Public Investment Management Assessment (PIMA) mission to Ireland was undertaken by the IMF in July this year.  The final report was published on my Department&rsquo;s website (www.per.gov.ie) on 10 November 2017.</p>  <p>  The report and its recommendations are the work of an expert team from the IMF who were invited to assess our public investment institutions to evaluate the design and effectiveness of the institutions that shape decision-making at the three key stages of the public investment cycle:</p>  <p>  - planning investment; </p>  <p>  - allocating investment to the right sectors; and</p>  <p>  - implementing investment. </p>  <p>  The PIMA report concluded that, overall, Ireland manages its public infrastructure relatively well.  It highlights both strengths and weaknesses and contains a number of recommendations to improve future performance in terms of the efficiency of public capital investment. </p>  <p>  One of the recommendations in the PIMA report is for the publication of the results of cost-benefit analysis on Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects, and the criteria used to select them.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, PPPs are subjected to the same robust and rigorous project appraisal process as traditionally procured projects.  In ensuring Departments obtain the best value-for-money from public capital investment PPPs, just as traditionally procured projects, are subject to the requirements contained in the Public Spending Code.</p>  <p>  The Public Spending Code encompasses guidance on a variety of issues related to the management of expenditure at each stage of the expenditure lifecycle.  This includes central guidance on the application of appraisal and evaluation methodologies including cost benefit analysis. This methodological guidance aims to enhance consistency across sectors through common approaches and the use of key technical parameter values needed for quantifying costs and conducting economic appraisals.</p>  <p>  While there is already significant guidance and data published on PPPs I acknowledge that the publication of cost-benefit analysis on PPP projects would provide greater transparency in reporting on PPP projects.  However, in assessing the implementation of the PIMA recommendation, it would be important to take into account the commercial sensitivity of specific data included in the appraisal of PPPs.  </p>  <p>  An inter-Departmental and Agency Group was established earlier this year to make recommendations on the future role of PPPs, in the context of the new 10 year capital plan.  The group comprises relevant officials from the Departments and agencies with experience of procuring projects by PPP.  As part of its work, the group is considering the recommendations made in the PIMA report that relate to PPPs, including the recommendation in relation to publication of CBAs for PPP projects, to inform future decision-making on these matters.  I expect the Group's deliberations to be completed alongside the finalisation of the new 10-year capital plan, which is currently being developed by my Department to support the implementation of the Ireland 2040 Plan detailing the new National Planning Framework.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-12-14a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121400068#WRA00900"><p>Each Minister is ultimately responsible for appointments to boards under their aegis and must have regard to the <i>Guidelines on Appointments to State Boards</i>.  Relevant issues relating to the effective operation of each board, including those such as diversity, gender balance and mix of expertise and skill sets are for each Minister to consider. </p><p>As set out in the Guidelines, compliance with the Government Decision of 23 July 2014 on Gender Balance on State Boards is an essential requirement. </p><p>These requirements include:</p><p>- Each Department should prepare a plan to reaffirm and achieve the target of at least 40% for representation of each gender on State Boards within its remit during the lifetime of the present Government. </p><p>- Departments should maintain a particular focus on those Boards on which either women or men are currently significantly under-represented and should actively seek to appoint candidates of the under-represented gender from the PAS short list.  </p><p>- Departments should in the case of Boards which have already achieved the 40% target seek to move towards 45% of each gender as a new target for gender equality.  </p><p>Indications are that 48% of State boards have reached the target of a minimum of 40% female membership set by the Government and indeed that some 35% of boards have met the higher 45% target.  This compares very favourably with the private sector, with a figure of somewhere around 13% female participation.  The position on individual State boards is a matter for the relevant Minister.</p><p>Up to the end of September this year, over 500 appointments have been made under the new system.  Some 30% of over 8,700 applications received for state board appointment came from women, who made up some 45% of the appointments made. </p><p>The Board of the Public Appointments Service (PAS) is the only State Board under the aegis of my Department.  The Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004, which established PAS, specifies that the chairperson and ordinary members of the Board shall be appointed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in consultation with the Minister for Health, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Minister for Justice and Equality.  </p><p>The Act also specifies that in appointing persons as members of the Board the Minister shall ensure that:</p><p>- at least 2 of them have either or both  civil service and other public service experience and knowledge which the Minister considers relevant, and</p><p>- at least 2 of them have expertise in human resource management, customer service and recruitment outside the public service which the Minister considers relevant.</p><p>Up until recently, five of the nine members (or 55%) were women, including the 3 positions recruited through the State Board process operated by PAS.  However, two of these three positions are currently vacant but are in the process of being filled through the PAS process and the issue of gender balance will be considered along with other issues.  There is also a third vacancy which is normally filled following a recommendation from the Minister for Justice and Equality. </p></reply>

This was the first cycle of a series of selective reviews of the current expenditure base that will remain in place for a 3-year period, thereby informing the preparation of the next two Budgets.</p>  <p>  In advance of Budget 2019, the Spending Review in 2018 will examine the next phase of expenditure topics.  It is planned that the remaining phase of current expenditure topics will be covered the following year.  The primary objective of the Spending Review in 2018 is to build on the work completed in 2017 and continue to reinforce the use of data, evidence and analysis to support decision-making in the Estimates process.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, there are a number of significant risks - both internal and external - to the sustainability of our current growth and fiscal performance.  These require that Government secure the continuation of sound public finances to underpin sustainable economic growth. The experience from recent years is that this is best achieved by allocating scarce resources in the most efficient and effective way.  The Spending Review is a key tool that can enable the achievement of this goal.</p>  <p>Preparations for the second cycle of spending review are underway and the process will formally begin in January 2018.</p></reply>

Generally, the third point of 1 November 2013 pay scale is equivalent to the first point of the pre 2011 scale.  Certain allowances, previously available to new entrants, were also restored under the flexibility provided for by the Lansdowne Road Agreement.</p>  <p>  In general, there are no new entrant scales anymore, there are new scales that start at a lower point i.e. the two initial points on the merged scales. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the benefits of the new Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, now ratified by the Public Services Committee of the ICTU, are progressively weighted in favour of new entrants.</p>  <p>The PSSA also recognises the issues of concern in relation to the salaries of new entrants and commits all parties to an examination of these matters within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement.  The first, exploratory meeting, with the full complement of Trade Unions and staff associations, took place on 12 October.  This meeting, based on the contributions of all parties, agreed an outline process of oversight and data gathering.  This process will be overseen by the Oversight Body for the PSSA. Further engagement will be undertaken over the coming months with those parties that have signed up to the Agreement.</p>  <p>  An amendment to the Public Service Pay and Pensions Bill 2017 was agreed during Committee Stage on Tuesday 5 December.  This allows for a report to be prepared and laid before the Oireachtas on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service, within three months of the passing of the Act.</p></reply>

The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of Flood Risk Management Plans. </p><p>The Programme is focussing on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, identified as being at potentially significant risk of flooding.  </p><p>The CFRAM programme has examined flood risk in the towns of Mountmellick and Portarlington and has identified proposed feasible measures to protect properties assessed as being at risk.  This entails the construction of flood defences, consisting of embankments and walls. The OPW has consulted with communities in Mountmellick and Portarlington to ensure their knowledge, views and concerns in relation to flood risk are taken on board.  There was an extensive response to the public consultation on the draft Flood Plans and constructive and wide-ranging observations were provided.</p><p>The Government has agreed an increased allocation of funding for flood relief activities totalling &euro;430m in its Capital Investment Plan for the period 2016-2021 with the annual budget allocation rising from &euro;45m to &euro;100m by 2021.  The capital allocation included in the Plan for flood risk management in 2018 is &euro;70m and in 2019 is &euro;80m.</p><p>The final Plans are currently undergoing an independent review of the environmental assessments by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I would hope early in 2018, to seek the approval from the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform for the Flood Risk Management Plans developed under the CFRAM process.</p><p>Thereafter, I would hope to announce the proposed structural measures contained within those Plans that will be taken, through a prioritised approach over the coming years, to detailed design to protect those communities at assessed risk<font color="#008250">.</font>This detailed design will include further environmental assessments, public consultation and cost reviews to ensure the project level measures are sustainable and cost beneficial. The OPW will work closely with Local Authorities to progress the effective implementation of these projects and, in certain exceptional circumstances, such as in Mountmellick, will engage proactively with the Local Authority in considering an appropriate response to address urgently the flooding in the town. In this regard I understand that the Chief Executive of Laois County Council has written to the OPW in relation to the recent flooding in Mountmellick and a meeting is to be arranged shortly to discuss the matter.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-12-14a.28.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1363" speakername="Kevin  Moran" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121400068#WRA02400"><p>The primary objective of Government policy on coastal protection is to ensure that in areas identified as being at greatest risk of damage or loss of economic assets through coastal erosion or flooding, appropriate and sustainable measures are identified by Local Authorities to protect those assets.  Where such measures are economically justified on cost benefit grounds and compatible with all required environmental and other statutory requirements, they are implemented subject to the availability of resources.</p>  <p>The Office of Public Works (OPW) has undertaken a national assessment of coastal erosion (including erosion rates) under the Irish Coastal Protection Strategy Study (ICPSS) and the results of this study have been published on the OPW website.  The relevant reports and associated predictive erosion hazard mapping (to 2050) may be viewed at www.opw.ie  .</p>  <p>  This Study has surveyed and assessed the coastal erosion risk along the entire national coastline and this information is available to all Local Authorities to enable them to develop appropriate plans and strategies for the sustainable management of the coastline in their counties including the identification, prioritisation and, subject to the availability of resources, the implementation of coastal protection works both of a structural and non-structural nature.</p>  <p>  The Local Authorities may carry out coastal protection works using their own resources.  If necessary, they may also put forward proposals to the relevant central Government Departments for funding of appropriate measures depending on the infrastructure or assets under threat.   </p>  <p>  Given an intervention within a coastal area may cause problems further along the coast, any proposed intervention measures by a Local Authority are best developed in conjunction with a formal coastal erosion risk management study which has carefully investigated the problem and explored the full range of management options. </p>  <p>  The OPW operates the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme, under which applications for funding from local authorities are considered for measures costing up to &euro;750,000 in each instance.  Funding for coastal erosion risk management studies may also be applied for under this scheme.

Over 20,000 of those were recruited in the Health and Education sectors.  Adjusting for transfers of functions between Departments, both the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills have higher staffing levels now than in 2008.</p><p>Furthermore there has been a shift from administrative staff to front-line service delivery.  For example in Health since 2008 there has been a reduction of approx 5,000 management, admin and general support staff numbers and an equivalent increase in doctors, dentists, health and social care professionals.  In education there are over 8,000 more teachers than 2008.</p><p>This level of recruitment has largely been possible because of the certainty provided to fiscal planning by the Lansdowne Road Agreement and its successor the Public Service Stability Agreement.  By phasing the unwinding of the emergency legislation over a number of years with ring-fenced allocations, sufficient resources were available to make progress on other societal priorities such as providing significant additional front-line staff in our schools and hospitals.</p><p>Looking forward the <i>Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020</i>provides for the Public Service Pay Commission to engage in a comprehensive examination of certain specialist areas within the public service where recruitment and retention issues may be arising.</p><p>Where a difficulty is identified, the Commission will examine the full range of causal factors including matters such as the totality of the current remuneration package, planned future pay adjustments, alleviations from current rates of the PRD as provided for in the PSSA and FEMPI pay unwinding post 2020.</p></reply>

The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of Flood Risk Management Plans. </p>  <p>  The Programme is focussing on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, identified as being at potentially significant risk of flooding.  Inchigeelagh and Ballingeary are AFAs under the Programme.</p>  <p>  The proposed feasible measures, both structural and non-structural, identified for AFAs are outlined in the final Flood Risk Management Plans that propose feasible flood relief works for each of Inchigeelagh and Ballingeary including flood walls and embankments . A Ballingeary Hydrometric Monitoring Regime is also proposed, to include the installation of hydrometric gauges on the Bunsheelin River and River Lee.

The plan forms part of the Government&rsquo;s wider public service reform programme.  The Plan sets out a vision and 3 year action plan to achieve it.  It outlines 25 practical actions that will create a more unified, professional, responsive, open and accountable Civil Service that can provide a world-class service to the State and the people of Ireland. The actions included in the Plan build on the existing strengths of the Civil Service and identifies areas which require improvement to enhance the capacity and capability of the system to meet existing and future challenges.  Its latest progress report, published in June 2017, details the progress made on implementation to date.  </p><p>Significant achievements to date include: the introduction of a new Corporate Governance Standard for the Civil Service; the development of a new People Strategy; the introduction of talent management programmes; a programme to improve project management capacity; a continuous programme of open recruitment; a new Disciplinary Code and revised performance management ratings system; a programme of organisational capability reviews and ongoing staff communications and engagement including through the Civil Service Employee Engagement Surveys.</p><p>A new shared model for learning and development, <i>One Learning,</i>has also been introduced to provide tailored training solutions and development opportunities for staff.  New Civil Service wide mobility schemes are being implemented across the Civil Service to enhance workforce capability, support career development and facilitate relocation of staff.  The Renewal Programme also encompasses the implementation of the ICT Strategy and major transformation programme for Shared Services in the Civil Service.  Work has also progressed to promote the value of the National Data Infrastructure (NDI) in meeting known and emerging data needs in the Public service.</p><p>These actions combined are enabling the Civil Service to build strong and agile organisations, to continue to develop staff and thus improve the services provided to the Government and to citizens. </p></reply>

There are 18 actions in the framework which is built on three key pillars as follows:</p><p><b>Delivering for Our Public</b>focuses on ensuring that outcomes for the public are central to service delivery.  This will be achieved by involving the public in the design and delivery of services, by improving how we listen and communicate, and by ensuring services are cost-effective.  By making better use of new technology and data we will also improve service quality and accessibility . The five actions under this pillar will build on existing progress in areas such as shared services and procurement.  The development of digital services and eGovernment is key to improving service delivery as is making better use of data and sharing data more effectively between organisations.</p><p><b>Innovating for Our Future</b>has six actions that will enable the development of innovative, robust and joined-up strategies and policies related to the delivery of public services.  This pillar will also support collaboration across the public service and help make the most of existing skills and experiences, and data.  It will also promote a culture of evaluation.  The public service needs to be increasingly innovative and collaborative to effectively respond to the complex challenges facing Ireland now and into the future.</p><p><b>Developing Our People and Organisations</b>has seven actions which will support public servants and the organisations in which they work.  The pillar aims to improve human resource management and to ensure the right mix of skills and tools are there to support public servants in delivering quality services.  The actions in this pillar will help to build strong and agile public service organisations.  Actions focus on sharing best practice and experience in areas such as strategic human resource management, workforce planning, employee engagement, public service culture and values, and equality, diversity and inclusion. </p><p>Implementation will be supported by promoting shared ownership of actions across the public service and by ensuring a strong emphasis on evaluating reforms.</p></reply>

Accordingly, it is difficult to estimate the impact of this measure in the future.  However, high level analysis carried out by my Department indicates that in the region of 1,300 public servants recruited before 1 April 2004 reach the age of 65 in a given year and would potentially benefit from the measure.  Also, based on existing retirement behaviour of public servants, it would be expected that as these employees will be in a position to retire on pension from age 65, there will be a continuing trend towards retirement over subsequent years.  On this basis, it is expected that numbers within the cohort will steadily reduce over time between the ages of 65 and 70.</p></reply>

This was a cross-vote analysis of disability related expenditure across the Health, Education and Social Protection Votes.  The Health chapter outlines the trend in Disability spend in recent years and highlights the substantial increase in funding that the service area has received since 2014.  The paper identifies the main expenditure areas and provides some commentary on the way in which disability services are currently provided.

However, this aggregate underspend versus profile has been impacted by almost &euro;0.4 billion by certain timing issues in relation to the Local Government Fund.</p>  <p>  Current expenditure in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is over &euro;260 million below profile.  This is due to the fact that full draw down from the Local Government Fund sub-head will be completed in December instead of November.</p>  <p>  Net Capital expenditure in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is &euro;147 million below profile primarily due to the timing of a receipt of &euro;129 million from the Local Government Fund.  This amount was received in November but had been profiled for December.</p>  <p>  Excluding these items, net current expenditure at the end of November is just under &euro;70 million below profile and net capital expenditure is &euro;326 million below profile.  As outlined in the Appropriation Bill 2017, published on 7 December, a sum of &euro;70.3 million in capital underspends from 2017 is available for spending in 2018 under the multiannual capital envelopes carryover facility.  However, given the aggregate level of underspends at the end of November, after taking account of the timing issues and capital carryover, it is likely that there will be amounts surrendered by Departments at the end of the year. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Deputy may wish to note that due to the scale of overall expenditure, and the cash basis of Government accounting, Supplementary Estimates can be required arising from policy decisions, overruns, timing issues or shifts in expenditure requirements.  As we are operating under the fiscal rules that apply under the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, Supplementary Estimates need to be accommodated within the requirements of the fiscal rules.  Additional expenditure requirements in one Department may be offset by underspends in other areas.  In this context, underspends surrendered to the Exchequer at the year-end will mitigate the impact of the Supplementary Estimates approved by the D&aacute;il last week. </p></reply>

The initiative was designed to bolster the capacity of our Mission network in selected locations to support economic promotion under the Department&rsquo;s &lsquo;Prosperity&rsquo; high level goal.  Its focus was to improve our capacity to support market diversity.  The selection of Missions for this pilot was based on a number of criteria, including the need for a variety of markets conditions, the strength of the submission by the relevant Mission in support of such an appointment, cost effectiveness, and the potential to support the economic state agencies in advancing our trade goals.</p>  <p>  Under the initial phase of the pilot scheme attach&eacute;s were appointed in Mexico City, Brasilia, Buenos Aires (also covering Chile), Bucharest (also covering Bulgaria), and Jakarta. Economic Development Officers are also in place in Abuja, Nairobi, and Hanoi.  The post in Mexico City is currently vacant due to a change in personnel but is expected to be filled by a new officer in the New Year. </p>  <p>  Working closely with the economic state agencies and with Trade Division within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the posts have facilitated trade promotion in such areas as market access, visibility, contact and information, market intelligence, and support to businesses.  Under the direction of the diplomatic officers, they have enabled the Missions to advance their economic goals.  </p>  <p>  The Commercial Attach&eacute;s and Economic Development Officers participated in the recent Team Ireland Conference at Croke Park.  The Conference, jointly hosted by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation involved representatives from the Departments and economic state agencies involved in economic promotion overseas.</p></reply>

A representative of the Embassy in Ankara tried without success to gain access to the court when Figen Y&uuml;ksekda&eth;&rsquo;s trial opened in July and, when Selahattin Demirtas&rsquo;s trial opened on 7 December, a number of European Union and like-minded Embassies tried unsuccessfully to gain access to the court.  Neither was Selahattin Demirtas allowed access to the court, since the authorities would only make a video-link available to him.</p><p>Notwithstanding the sensitive security situation in Turkey following the attempted coup in 2016, it is vital that the rule of law, freedom of expression and democracy should prevail.  The arrest and detention of elected members of Parliament is especially worrying and I have repeatedly said that all those facing trial in Turkey must be afforded full due process, including the presumption of innocence and the right to a free and fair trial.  The pre-trial detention of Selahattin Demirtas has already been lengthy and I am concerned that the level of transparency implicit in the right to due process is not being observed in this case.  The Embassy in Ankara has regular contact with other HDP members of Parliament<b></b>and will continue to monitor both trials as closely as feasible.</p><p>In the meantime, I would reiterate earlier calls to the Turkish authorities to engage in dialogue so that outstanding issues can be resolved by political means.  Turkey is a candidate country for membership of the European Union and, as such, is committed to adhering to European values. The Turkish authorities need to continue to engage in constructive dialogue on human rights and rule of law issues, including with the Council of Europe. </p></reply>

The meeting was an informal breakfast meeting, essentially an exchange of views, and so there was no formal outcome as such.  High Representative Mogherini hosted the meeting, and a similar encounter with Palestinian President Abbas has been scheduled for January.</p>  <p>  Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed himself in particular on regional security issues in the Middle East, and on the opportunities to improve relations and trade between the EU and Israel.  In the light of the announcement by the United States on Jerusalem, which took place after the meeting had been scheduled, he also restated Israel&rsquo;s longstanding position on Jerusalem as its capital, and hoped that EU countries would follow the US lead.</p>  <p>  Led by HR Mogherini, the EU and its Member States restated our firm commitment to a two state solution which must include finding a way through negotiations for Jerusalem to serve as the future capital of two states &ndash; Israel and Palestine.

On Irish-specific issues, the Government achieved the goals we set out to achieve in this phase.  They included maintenance of the Common Travel Area, protection of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process, including avoiding a hard border, and the protection of EU citizenship and other rights.</p>  <p>  We were consistently clear in seeking tangible commitments from the UK. We now have a written guarantee that a hard border will be avoided and commitments as to how this will be achieved.</p>  <p>  In the event that it is not possible to resolve the border issue as part of a wider EU-UK future relationship agreement, which has always been the Irish Government&rsquo;s preference, or through specific solutions proposed by the British Government, there is a commitment that the UK will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Customs Union and Single Market which support North South cooperation, the all-island economy and protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.  Moreover, such an arrangement must be compatible with the UK&rsquo;s guarantee of avoiding a hard border, which is an &lsquo;overarching requirement.&rsquo;</p>  <p>  The agreement between the EU and UK on Irish-specific issues set out in the Joint Report represents, as do the other elements of the Progress Report, a set of very strong political commitments and guarantees.  These must now be reflected in the Withdrawal Agreement which will be legally binding and must be concluded before the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU on 29 March 2019.  The Joint Report makes clear that progress in the Phase Two negotiations, including on the framework for future relations between the EU and UK, will only be possible if commitments made in Phase One are being honoured through the elaboration of the formal Withdrawal Agreement.</p></reply>

Our policy for International Development, &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo;, clearly articulates our commitment to the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Income (GNI) in Official Development Assistance (ODA), as economic conditions allow.</p>  <p>  The current Programme for Government sets out our ambition to make progress towards the UN target as resources permit.  This progress needs to be made in a sustainable and manageable way, building on Ireland's recognised role as a reliable and effective partner in contributing to ending global poverty and hunger, and in providing humanitarian assistance.  For 2016 &ndash; the most recently published OECD statistics, Ireland contributed 0.33% of GNI to Official Development Assistance.</p>  <p>  In line with EU member states, we remain committed to making incremental, sustainable and manageable progress towards achieving the 0.7% UN target by 2030, over the period of the Sustainable Development Goals. Reaching this target will involve significant increases to the ODA budget and requires careful planning and consultation with other Government Departments and stakeholders.  This ambitious pathway towards making greater but sustainable progress on the UN target w  ill be informed by the new White Paper on Ireland&rsquo;s development assistance programme which will be produced next year. </p></reply>

Preliminary results released by the country&rsquo;s national electoral institute suggested that the ruling party of President Maduro, the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), won a significant majority of available seats.  The electoral process was partly boycotted by the opposition and the rate of participation by the electorate was low.  This followed on from gubernatorial elections in October, the results of which were not recognised by a large part of the opposition amidst numerous reported incidences of irregularity.</p>  <p>  In parallel, attempts to foster meaningful dialogue between the government and the opposition, aimed at bringing about political stability and addressing the severe challenges facing the country, are continuing.  The talks are being hosted by the Dominican Republic and accompanied by six countries of the region acting as guarantors of the process. We consider this a step in the right direction and are fully supportive of regional efforts to find a lasting solution to the crisis.  </p>  <p>  Presidential elections are due to take place in December 2018. Ireland and its EU partners have called for concrete action to ensure the full respect and independence of Venezuela&rsquo;s democratic institutions, notably through the holding of free and fair elections supervised by a balanced Electoral Council and involving independent international observation. </p>  <p>  On 13 November last, at a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers, which I attended, it was agreed unanimously to adopt restrictive measures, underscoring our concerns at the situation in the country.  These measures consist of an embargo on arms and on related material that might be used for internal repression, as well as a legal framework for a travel ban and assets freeze.  The measures are designed to be scaled up or down on a gradual basis to respond to developments in Venezuela, of which respect for the electoral timetable and process will represent an important barometer.  We will continue to monitor the situation closely in concert with our European partners.</p></reply>

We also want to see transition arrangements which preserve the status quo in terms of British rights and obligations, other than in relation to membership of the EU institutions and agencies.  They should be in place for a period long enough to allow for an orderly Brexit.</p>  <p>  It will also be important to maintain a clear focus on the unique challenges faced by Ireland.  All aspects of the Irish specific issues will continue to be worked on in a distinct stream of work in phase 2.  The EU27, including Ireland, will therefore need to be satisfied that the principles and commitments agreed on Friday are delivered upon and reflected in the withdrawal agreement. </p>  <p>  There is no question that Brexit poses very significant and serious challenges to Ireland&rsquo;s economy and trade, as well as across a range of other sectors.  While in recent years we have been diversifying increasingly to other markets, Ireland is still heavily reliant on the UK as a trading partner.  A number of key sectors will also be impacted significantly, including, but not limited to, agri-food, fisheries, financial services, transport, energy, enterprise and trade more generally.</p>  <p>  In this regard, Ireland&rsquo;s approach to phase two of the negotiations will continue to be informed by the detailed sectoral work being done by individual Departments, and through cross-Departmental coordination structures chaired by my Department.  These represent a very active channel through which all relevant Departments are providing their research, analysis and overall policy input to the Government&rsquo;s overall response to Brexit, including its priorities for the next phase of the Article 50 negotiations. </p>  <p>  Since taking up office, engagement on Brexit with Michel Barnier and his Taskforce, and with other EU partners, has been a central element of my work and that of my Department and our Missions.  This approach has yielded clear results in ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s unique issues and concerns have been fully understood by our EU27 partners and have been reflected in the EU&rsquo;s negotiating position and the outcome of Phase 1.  As the negotiations move to a new phase in 2018, we will continue working closely with the Commission Task Force to advance Irish priorities. </p></reply>

This is a service which my Department provides so that the media can easily and freely avail of photography where their own staff photographers cannot be fully accommodated.  Events such as the visit of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall in May 2017 and those by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada in July 2017 and UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in November 2017 resulted in positive overseas media coverage of Ireland.</p><p>Through the Office of Government Procurement an updated Multi-Supplier Framework Agreement for the provision of Professional Photography and Videography is now in operation.  My Department procures the services of external photographic agencies via this Framework where necessary.</p><p>In addition, my Department continues to avail of in-house resources for photography whenever possible.</p><p>In relation to photography costs for the period March 2011 to December 2016, I would refer the Deputy to the reply issued to Question No. 349 of 13 December 2016. </p><p>The cost of photography to my Department for events which took place in 2017 is listed in Table 1.  A small number of invoices for photography at events held during 2017 have yet to be received.  In the time available, it has not proved possible to compile a breakdown of photography costs associated with events organized by Ireland&rsquo;s network of 80 diplomatic missions abroad. </p><p><b><i><i>Public Relations</i></i></b></p><p>My Department has not incurred expenditure on external public relations services since March 2011. Expenditure has, however, arisen in the context of specific initiatives under Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development programme for which we have from time to time commissioned companies with a public relations and communications background to provide other professional services such as project management, logistics and event management.  The information requested by the Deputy in this area is set out in Table 2.</p><p>DHR Communications has been contracted to manage and administer grants to journalists reporting on international development issues under the Simon Cumbers Media Fund (SCMF) and to manage and administer annual Africa Day celebrations. </p><p>The SCMF involves managing three funding rounds each year, including the annual SCMF student competition.  This typically involves the following activities: </p><p>- Convening national and regional information workshops;</p><p>- Managing and administering the application process;</p><p>- Organising the judging process</p><p>- Providing detailed feedback to all applicants;</p><p>- Processing grant payments and keeping detailed administrative and financial records;</p><p>- Maintaining and updating the SCMF website.</p><p>It should be noted that expenses paid to third parties account for approximately 30% of the total paid to DHR for managing and administering the Simon Cumbers Media Fund.  This includes costs associated with maintaining and updating the SCMF website, facilitating the judging process and raising awareness of the Fund among journalists.</p><p>Following a competitive tendering process, DHR has also been engaged to plan, manage and execute a national Africa Day flagship event in Dublin.  This includes the administration of a small grants scheme for regional events which DHR managed on behalf of the Department in partnership with a number of local authorities.  DHR also worked to raise public awareness of the Africa Day events, including through the use of social media and the Africa Day website. This public awareness work represented a very minor element of the overall project and was conducted in close cooperation with my Department&rsquo;s communications office.</p><p>Africa Day events have been hosted by the Department in Iveagh Gardens in 2009 and 2010, in CHQ in George&rsquo;s Dock in 2012 and at the Farmleigh Estate annually since 2013. In 2011, the Department supported a series of smaller-scale performances, family events, art exhibitions, debates and educational activities instead of hosting a flagship event.</p><p>In relation to the expenditure on Africa Day, expenses paid to third parties accounted for between 70% and 80% of the total costs listed below. This included expenditure on security, sanitation, venue set-up, health and safety issues and small grants to facilitate the participation of community groups.</p><p>DHR also previously provided short-term management support services for the Review of the White Paper on Irish Aid, including the logistical management of the nationwide public consultation activities.</p><p><b><i>Table 1:

The outdoor transport campaign ran over two two-week cycles in May and June.  The digital units in Dublin and Belfast Airports ran from May to August.

Local public banks in Germany are called Sparkassen.  They are only permitted to operate in specific geographic regions.  Their aim is also not to maximise profits, but rather promote economic development and financial inclusion in the regional area in which they operate.  Additionally, the business model of Sparkassen involves building close relationships with local SMEs.</p>  <p>  The investigation of local public banking has consisted of a consultation process with stakeholders and interested parties.  There has also been analysis of a detailed proposal on the Sparkassen model and its possible implementation in Ireland.  This proposal was put forward by Irish Rural Link and the Savings Banks Foundation for International Cooperation (SBFIC), the international development wing of the Sparkassen group.  There have been a number of meetings between their representatives and my officials. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have been working closely together with their colleagues in the Department of Community and Rural Development.  They have now finalised the report on the findings of their investigation and I have received this report and am currently reviewing and considering it.</p>  <p>  Along with my colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Michael Ring T.D., I will bring this report to Government, for approval. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that there are already significant Government measures in place to support access to finance by Irish SMEs.  These include the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), the Supporting SMEs Online Tool, the Microenterprise Loan Fund, Local Enterprise Offices, the Credit Review Office and the Credit and Counter Guarantee Schemes. </p>  <p>  Additionally, my Department is working with other Government departments to develop tailored and innovative schemes to meet the evolving needs of Irish SMEs, such as the Agricultural Cashflow Support Loan Scheme and the Brexit Loan Scheme I announced in Budgets 2017 and 2018 respectively.</p></reply>

No loss of VAT arises where gift vouchers are not redeemed as no supply of goods or services has taken place.</p>  <p>  Revenue has no estimate of the amount of VAT that would accrue to the Exchequer if unredeemed gift vouchers were in fact used.</p></reply>

Something had to be done to preserve and boost jobs and it is an unavoidable fact that difficult economic situations require hard and very often unpopular decisions.  All sectors of the economy had to contribute to the recovery plan and the levy was designed to claw back a small amount of the very generous tax reliefs that those contributing to pension arrangements had benefitted from over many years. </p>  <p>  The original 0.6% stamp duty levy on pension fund assets ended in 2014.  The additional levy of 0.15% which my predecessor introduced for 2014 and 2015, mainly to help continue to fund Jobs Initiative, also ended in 2015.</p>  <p>  The position is that the equivalent value of all of the money raised from the stamp duty levy has been used to fund the wide range of measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative to protect existing jobs and to help create new jobs and the Initiative has been a success in this regard.  The measures introduced include expenditure measures such as the JobBridge and Springboard schemes, as well as a number of tax and PRSI incentives such as the reduction in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% for the tourism and hospitality sectors and the temporary halving of the lower employer PRSI rate. </p>  <p>  Under the legislation, the payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled where needed to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy.  It is up to the trustees or insurer to decide whether, when and how the levy should be passed on and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible.  However, the legislation also includes safeguards aimed at ensuring that should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, it must be applied in an equitable fashion across the different classes of scheme members that could include active, deferred and retired members.  In no case may the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levy.  Where pension scheme trustees or an insurer took the decision to treat the levy as an expense of the pension scheme, they would have adjusted current or prospective benefits payable to members under that scheme.  The consequence of this treatment by the trustees or insurer could be a permanent reduction in members' benefits.</p>  <p>  The value of the funds raised by way of the levy have been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State.  Taxpayers to whom the impact of the levy may have been passed on by the chargeable persons responsible for the payment of the levy (the pension scheme trustees, etc.) will benefit from the changes which my predecessor began in Budget 2015 and which have continued in subsequent Budgets to reduce the tax burden on low and middle income earners.</p></reply>

SES 2016 also presented an indicative split between expenditure and taxation uses of these amounts as well as the provision for contributions to the Rainy Day Fund (RDF).  This was subsequently updated in the SES 2017 to take account of the decision to increase capital expenditure in 2019, 2020 and 2021 by &euro;500m by reducing the planned contributions to the RDF by the same amount.  The figures given were adjusted to take into account the arithmetic set out in the Budget 2018. </p>  <p>  The current forecasts of general government revenue and expenditure include this allocation of fiscal space along with the measures introduced in Budget 2018.</p>  <p>  The detailed estimates of gross and net fiscal space updated in SES 2017 resulted in additional unallocated fiscal space in each of 2019, 2020 and 2021, which was described as the margin of compliance.  Based on Budget 2018 forecasts, indications are that the margin is expected to increase when the estimates of fiscal space are updated in the SES 2018 following the publication by the European Commission, in May of next year, of the reference rate, convergence margin and GDP deflator to be used for the calculations in relation to 2019. </p>  <p>  Net fiscal space also takes account of discretionary revenue measures that increase or decrease general government revenue such as, for example, mortgage interest relief.  Further, the additional revenue generated from a political decision not to proceed with indexation of the tax bands is included in the discretionary revenue measures.  The amounts set out in my previous response are inclusive of these.</p>  <p>  Before addressing the specific issues raised, I want to stress the importance of the fiscal stance rather than the fiscal space.  The economy is performing very strongly at present and full employment is now within sight.  In these circumstances, it would be completely inappropriate to adopt pro-cyclical budgetary policies that simply add fuel to the fire.  So, regardless of what fiscal space is available, it is my intention to do what is correct for the economy and I will not repeat the mistakes of the past.  Steady, sustainable improvements in public services are what is required, not boom and bust.</p>  <p>  Now, turning to specific issues.</p>  <p>  Changes announced in Budget 2018 that are recognised in 2018 go into the expenditure and revenue base and have no further effect on fiscal space.  However, as set out in Table 7 of the Expenditure Report 2018, the carryover impact of Budget 2018 measures is estimated at approximately &euro;192 million.  These costs would have to come out of the unallocated fiscal space in the 2019 forecasts.  Tax carryover is &euro;14m and would need to be met out of the &euro;590m fiscal space available for tax reductions in 2019.</p>  <p>  The Public Service Stability Agreement (PSSA) has been ratified and the costs are included in the forecasts.  The amounts are &euro;370m in 2019, &euro;340m in 2020, and &euro;230m in 2021.</p>  <p>  The tapering of mortgage interest relief (MIR), decided in Budget 2018, results in a revenue yield to the Exchequer that represents a positive discretionary revenue measure, increasing fiscal space, of &euro;46m in 2019, &euro;41m in 2020, and &euro;37m in 2021.  This is already included in the tax revenue forecasts.   </p>  <p>  The existing forecasts make provision for tax reductions of &euro;590 million, &euro;620 million and &euro;610 million for 2019 &ndash; 2021 respectively. </p>  <p>  If a decision is taken to index the income tax bands then the revenue reductions included in the forecasts could be utilised for this purpose without impacting the tax forecasts for fiscal space. If social welfare payments were to be indexed then the unallocated fiscal space within the current forecasts could be utilised in the first instance.</p>  <p>  The capital envelope is included in the baseline forecasts.  As such, when calculating fiscal space, the provision for smoothing of gross fixed capital formation applies.</p>  <p>  Irish Water&rsquo;s planned expenditure as per its 2015 business plan was incorporated in the general government forecasts for 2015-2021.  The reform of the funding of Irish Water due to the Water Services Act 2017 is neutral in overall general government terms and thus has no impact on calculations of fiscal space in the years 2019 &ndash; 2021. Further details on these changes were set out in chapter 7 of the Economic and Fiscal Outlook document as part of Budget 2018.</p>  <p>  The baseline forecasts include demographic effects.  These amount to &euro;500m in 2019, &euro;480m in 2020, and &euro;480m in 2021.</p>  <p>  With regard to Local Property Tax (LPT), this policy is not settled and the revaluation date has been postponed to 2019.  The position in 2019 and beyond is a matter of active consideration by Government.  In that context, my Department and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners will consider issues relating to the implementation of the recommendations in the Report prepared by Dr Don Thornhill.  The Government will make its position clear so that households will know well in advance what its plans are for LPT. In that regard, the forecast for LPT as set out in Budget 2018 of &euro;470 million for 2017 remains unchanged over the forecast horizon.</p>  <p>  As a result, there are no discretionary revenue measures relating to LPT policy changes in 2018 and no assumptions can be made in this regard for 2019 and subsequent years until the policy process described above is completed.  Accordingly, the impact of potential LPT changes on the forecasts of fiscal space out to 2021 is not included. </p></reply>

It is important to point out that exiting our investments in a measured way that will optimise value for our citizens, will take a number of years, but I do not propose to set out a rigid timeline for disposal.  To do so would potentially impact the value we can achieve.

This is where a certain quantum of shares is sold into the market effectively overnight with very little advance notice given to investors.  In these circumstances, signalling our intention to trade in advance could jeopardise the State's ability to achieve the best price on the day.</p><p>Clearly in the case of AIB, in order for me to proceed with another disposal next year I would need to obtain Cabinet approval as there is a restriction in the 'Programme for a Partnership Government', preventing any further sales of shares in that bank before the end of 2018.</p></reply>

Where the enterprise and the investment meet certain conditions, it can raise financing from individual investors, who can claim tax relief in respect of the amount invested. Relief is granted in two tranches: the first portion of the relief (currently 30/40 and previously 31/41) is given at the time of investment while the second portion (currently 10/40 and previously 11/41) is given if, after 3 years, the company has increased employment or spent all of the money on qualifying research and development.  </p><p>Details on EII from its introduction to 2016 are as follows:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Cost of EII &euro;m</th><th>Number of companies</th><th>Number of investors</th><th>Average investment per company &euro;</th><th>Average investment per investor &euro;</th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>4</td><td>78</td><td>352</td><td>172,100</td><td>35,700</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>12.7</td><td>190</td><td>1,028</td><td>222,800</td><td>37,100</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>18.8</td><td>239</td><td>1,395</td><td>261,900</td><td>37,900</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>22.2</td><td>279</td><td>1,530</td><td>265,500</td><td>40,600</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>32.5</td><td>261</td><td>1,768</td><td>415,900</td><td>49,700</td></tr><tr><td>TOTALS</td><td>90.2</td><td>1,047</td><td>6,073</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></p><p>Details on the size of investments made under EII from its introduction to 2016 are as follows:The most recent complete figures for the EII scheme are for 2016.

In some respects, it broadened the category of companies who are eligible while in others it narrowed it; it introduced the requirement to consider all associated companies rather than the applicant company on a stand-alone basis; it introduced the requirement that relief under EII is only given for investments made on foot of a viable business plan and that follow-on investments are only eligible for relief where they were foreseen in the business plan first used to raise EII supported financing.  This increase in complexity means that there are additional checks which must be carried out by Revenue prior to approving the relief.</p><p>The volume of claims (including claims for both the first and second tranches of relief and outline applications) dealt with in the last 24 months is:</p><p><b>EII 1 / EII 1A / EII outline applications received</b><table><tr><th></th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>Total for three years.</th></tr><tr><td>January</td><td>N/A</td><td>52 </td><td>69 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>February</td><td>N/A</td><td>68 </td><td>47 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>March</td><td>N/A</td><td>54 </td><td>60 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>April</td><td>N/A</td><td>62 </td><td>56 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>May</td><td>N/A</td><td>64 </td><td>64 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>June</td><td>N/A</td><td>75 </td><td>60 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>July</td><td>N/A</td><td>59 </td><td>66 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>August</td><td>N/A</td><td>59 </td><td>50 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>September</td><td>N/A</td><td>72 </td><td>58 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>October</td><td>N/A</td><td>82 </td><td>72 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>November</td><td>N/A</td><td>66 </td><td>74 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>December</td><td>41 </td><td>46 </td><td>-</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Totals</td><td>41 </td><td>759 </td><td>676 </td><td>1,476</td></tr><tr><td>Processed</td><td>41</td><td>748</td><td>516</td><td>1,305</td></tr><tr><td>Rejected</td><td>4</td><td>65</td><td>77</td><td>146</td></tr><tr><td>On hand at year end</td><td>0</td><td>11</td><td>171</td><td></td></tr></table></p><p>It is not possible to give an average time taken to issue a decision.  Where a full application is received with all supporting documentation, a decision will issue more quickly than a case where additional information and clarifications must be sought.  Equally, it takes less time to carry out the level of examination required in respect of a claim by a company with a simple corporate structure than a claim in respect of a complex corporate grouping.  At present, in respect of the more complex cases, it can take up to three months for a reply to issue.  A revised outline application form is now in use which should ensure that all applications received are accompanied by all supporting information required, and a revised EII claim form will be published, once it is translated into Irish.  These two new forms should reduce the time taken to process each application.</p><p>I am also advised by Revenue that, as relief is granted at the taxpayer&rsquo;s marginal rate of tax, the tax value of the amount invested depends on the circumstances of each the individual investor.  As the tax relief is claimed in individual tax returns which are filed in October / November each year, it is not possible to calculate the cost per month.</p><p>I am further advised by Revenue that as the claims processed include a mixture of outline applications and actual claims, it is not possible to determine the value of these claims.  While outline claims, for example, may include an indication of the amount of capital to be raised, this is only an indication and the actual value of the claim can only be determined when the actual claim is made.  As such, Revenue does not record this information in relation to applications.</p><p>Companies in respect of which claims for relief under EII were first made in 2012 and 2013 that either increased employment or spent all of the funds raised on qualifying research and development are in a position to claim the balance of relief (the 11/41s in respect of those years).  To date, Revenue have processed claims by 25 companies showing an additional 200 employments (with a mean increase of 8 employments for these companies) and by 19 companies who expended the full amount raised on qualifying research and development.  These are preliminary figures as companies may still submit claims in respect of these periods.</p><p>Finally, as the Deputy will be aware from the recent debates during the passage of Finance Bill 2017, I indicated that a review of the EII scheme would be carried out in the course of 2018 to ensure, among other things, that the incentive continues to meet its objectives within the context of my Department's Guidelines on Tax Expenditures and EU state-aid rules.</p></reply>

Relief has expired for qualifying mortgages taken out prior to 2004 and, with some limited exceptions, the relief ceased for new borrowings with effect from January 2013.  Prior to Budget 2018, MIR was scheduled to cease entirely at the end of 2017 for all remaining relief holders.  </p>  <p>  The time-limited, tapered extension of MIR will allow mortgage holders time to adjust to the change in their mortgage repayments as the relief is gradually withdrawn over the next three years.  Budget 2018 provides for the continuation of 75 per cent of the existing relief into 2018, 50 per cent into 2019 and 25 per cent into 2020.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that, to date in 2017, there are 417,834 individuals availing of MIR across 286,325 loans.  It is estimated that MIR will cost around &euro;175 million in 2017.</p>  <p>  The Budget 2018 changes to MIR act to extend the relief for all current recipients on a tapered basis.  Therefore, the number of recipients in 2018 will be broadly similar to the number in 2017, with a slight downward trend as some qualifying mortgages are redeemed each year. It is projected that the cost of MIR in 2018 will be approximately &euro;124 million.</p></reply>

It is important to point out that the key income tax component, i.e. PAYE income tax, which accounts for around 65 per cent or &euro;13.1 billion of total income tax receipts is broadly in-line with target at end-November, down just &euro;34 million or just under 0.3 per cent.  This represents robust year-on-year growth of 8.8 per cent or &euro;957 million which reflects solid wage growth and continued strong increases in full time employment.</p><p>In relation to USC, overall receipts are on target at end-November.</p><p>Of the remaining components of income tax, some relate to unearned income and are not directly impacted by employment or wage developments (e.g. Deposit Interest Retention Tax and Life Assurance Exit Tax).  The majority of these components are below target at end-November, and therefore having a &lsquo;drag&rsquo; on overall income tax receipts at end-November 2017. </p><p>The other main contributing factor to the overall shortfall is the Schedule D income tax provisional receipts, which are &euro;119 million or 6.6 per cent below target but up 2.3 per cent in year-on-year terms.  </p><p>The position is that the final Schedule D returns in respect of 2016 incomes were only due to be filed in November this year and Revenue is still in the process of reviewing these.</p><p>Schedule D income earners were also required to pay preliminary tax in respect of 2017 in October/November this year.  However, the associated final returns are not required to be filed until October/November 2018.  It will only be then that Revenue can fully advise why receipts from this cohort of income earners was below expectations. </p><p>The table provides a breakdown of the various income tax components on a Revenue net receipts basis at end-November against provisional collection targets.  It is important to point out that the &ldquo;Revenue net receipts&rdquo; reported by the Revenue Commissioners represent matured tax liabilities and this reporting arrangement is more of an accounting concept. As a result, tax receipts reported on an Exchequer cash basis can differ from Revenue&rsquo;s &ldquo;net receipts&rdquo; at any given time for accounting and timing reasons.<table><tr><th>Tax-head</th><th>End-November 2017 Outturn &euro;m</th><th>End-November 2017 Target &euro;m </th><th>Excess/Shortfall &euro;m</th><th>Excess/Shortfall % </th></tr><tr><td>Income   Tax (PAYE)</td><td>11,876</td><td>11,910</td><td>-34</td><td>-0.3</td></tr><tr><td>USC   (PAYE &amp;amp; Schedule D)</td><td>3,430</td><td>3,430</td><td>0</td><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><td>Income   Tax (Schedule D)</td><td>1,666</td><td>1,785</td><td>-119</td><td>-6.6</td></tr><tr><td>Life   Assurance Exit Tax /DIRT</td><td>302</td><td>413</td><td>-111</td><td>-26.9</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>1,035</td><td>987</td><td>+48</td><td>+4.8</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Agency announced in October that it had redeemed all of its &euro;30.2bn in Senior Debt which was guaranteed by the State.  However, notwithstanding the successful achievement of this primary and important objective, three years ahead of schedule, there is still a significant body of work yet to be completed by NAMA.  Subject to current market conditions prevailing, this includes redemption of NAMA&rsquo;s subordinated debt of &euro;1.6 billion by March 2020 and completion of its Dublin Docklands SDZ and residential funding programmes.  Successful completion of these major NAMA objectives will produce a significant economic and social contribution to the State, by addressing supply shortages. </p>  <p>  I would also refer the Deputy to the announcement in my Budget statement in October of the establishment of Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI), which is intended to increase the availability of debt funding on market terms to commercially viable residential development projects.  In order to enable HBFI to get up and running quickly, it is my intention that it will draw on the expertise and experience in residential development funding that resides in NAMA.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of NAMA&rsquo;s expectation that, once its work is completed in 2020, it will return to the Exchequer a terminal surplus, currently estimated at &euro;3 billion, subject to current market conditions prevailing.  I am advised that NAMA&rsquo;s residual loan portfolio will require intensive case management and asset management if the projected terminal surplus is to be realised and as such, I do not envisage setting a shorter timeframe which could adversely affect the amount of the surplus ultimately realised, which is very important for the State. </p>  <p>  In relation to the NAMA portfolio, I would advise the Deputy that the latest information on the Agency&rsquo;s remaining loan portfolio is available in the Agency&rsquo;s Section 55 quarterly accounts for Quarter 2 of 2017 which is available on the NAMA website.  As outlined in these accounts, the carrying value of NAMA&rsquo;s loan portfolio at 30 June 2017, net of cumulative impairment, was &euro;3.7 billion.  It is expected that updated information will be available after I receive NAMA&rsquo;s Section 55 report and accounts for Q3 in the coming weeks. I expect to lay that report before the Oireachtas as soon as possible thereafter.</p></reply>

Portfolio sales are considered as part of normal supervisory engagement where they are sufficiently material. </p>  <p>  Typically with an asset loan sale, in circumstances where there are permissible contractual terms which allow the sale of the loan, the Central Bank would be aware of the transaction planning, and would be notified for good order by the bank once the transaction is completed. The Central Bank monitors the capital and financial implications of an asset sale on the bank meeting its regulatory obligations. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that legislation and regulations have been implemented by the Oireachtas and Central Bank to protect SMEs when dealing with regulated and unregulated firms. Insofar as a loan is captured by the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015, then the protections of that Act will apply.  These include the protections of Irish financial services legislation, including Central Bank Codes where they apply for the type of loan in question.  Also, under Provision 6.1 (c) of the Authorisation Requirements and Standards for Credit Servicing Firms 2015, a credit servicing firm is required to notify the Central Bank in advance of a new loan portfolio or client being taken on which results in it conducting credit servicing activities covered by the Act.</p>  <p>  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'.  This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes issued by the Central Bank of Ireland.</p>  <p>  Under the 2015 Act, therefore, purchasers of loan books must either be regulated by the Central Bank themselves or else the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm who is regulated by the Central Bank.  Furthermore, it is important to highlight that the transfer of a loan from one entity to another does not change the terms of the contract or the borrower's rights and obligations under the original contract.</p>  <p>  Also, following a review in 2015 of the Central Bank Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Sized Enterprises, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 were made.  They came into operation for regulated financial service providers (other than credit unions) on 1 July 2016 and, in the case of credit unions, on 1 January 2017.</p></reply>

Therefore, as things stand information on hire purchase agreements and similar type loans cannot be collected at this time.  However, my Department is currently considering ways to address this lacuna, and it is hoped that it will be in a position to bring forward a legislative proposal to deal with the issue early in the new year.</p></reply>

This process identifies on a case by case basis, both current and upcoming resource requirements in the Department and the best method to fill each vacancy.  The timescale for filling vacancies from open or interdepartmental competitions varies and is dependent on the availability of panels from the Public Appointments Service (PAS).  The absence of a PAS panel will generally delay the filling of a vacancy. Internally run competitions in the Department generally have a quicker turnaround time.  To date in 2017 62 new staff have joined the Department and we currently have 9 vacancies as follows: 1 Principal Officer, 2 Assistant Principal Officers, 3 Executive Officers and 3 Clerical Officers. We are expecting to receive candidates to fill these posts in early January 2018.</p></reply>

These include requirements to conduct a proper creditworthiness assessment. </p>  <p>  As I previously said in relation to a similar question last year (reference 23864 of 21 July), prior to offering a product or service, a regulated entity must gather and record sufficient information from the consumer appropriate to the nature and complexity of the product or service and must carry out an assessment of affordability to ascertain the personal consumer's likely ability to repay the debt over the duration of the agreement, in accordance with the requirements of the Consumer Protection Code 2012.</p>  <p>  On the issue more generally, in the case of all mortgage products provided to personal consumers, the assessment must include consideration of the results of a test on the personal consumer&rsquo;s ability to repay the instalments, over the duration of the agreement, on the basis of a 2% interest rate increase, at a minimum, above the interest rate offered to the personal consumer.  This test does not apply to mortgages where the interest rate is fixed for a period of five years or more.  Where the lender offers an introductory interest rate, it must carry out the 2% interest rate test on the variable interest rate to be applied after the introductory period has ended if known at the time of the offer of the introductory interest rate, or on the current variable interest rate, if the variable interest rate to be applied after the introductory period has ended is not yet known. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations 2010 apply to the provision of certain credit for amounts between &euro;200 and &euro;75,000.  Part 2 of the Regulations include an obligation on creditors to assess the creditworthiness of consumers, on the basis of sufficient information obtained from the consumer.  </p></reply>

The Credit Institutions Resolution Fund (CIRF)</p>  <p>  The CIRF was established under Section 10(1) of the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011 (2011 Act).  The Government contributed &euro;250 million to the Fund in December 2011 to provide a source of funding for the resolution of financial instability in, or an imminent serious threat to the financial stability of an authorised credit institution, and in particular:-  </p>  <p>  - To reimburse the Minister for any provision of a financial incentive pursuant to section 46;</p>  <p>  - To provide funds for any payment required pursuant to section 37(1), 42(5), 48 or 98; </p>  <p>  - With written consent of the Minister, to provide capital for a bridge-bank; and </p>  <p>  - To meet the Bank's expenses in discharging its functions under this Act.</p>  <p>  The CIRF Levy commenced in October 2012 and levies collected from credit unions to date amount to &euro;36.8 million. To date circa &euro;31 million has been provided to support resolution actions in the credit union sector. </p>  <p>  2. The Stabilisation Fund</p>  <p>  In accordance with Part 4 of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 credit unions contribute annually to a statutory Stabilisation Fund.  The Stabilisation Fund, contained within the Credit Union Fund, is available to all credit unions with a reserve ratio equal to or greater than 7.5% of the credit union&rsquo;s total assets and less than 10% and where the Central Bank assesses the credit union as viable.  Stabilisation support will be provided to address short-term problems at credit unions that are viable but undercapitalised.  Payment of an annual Stabilisation Levy commenced in 2015 (for a period commencing on 1 October 2014) and to date levies collected  amount to &euro;9.9 million. There have been no drawdowns, to date, from the Stabilisation Fund. </p>  <p>  A review of the Stabilisation Levy was carried out in October 2017 and is due to be published shortly.</p>  <p>  3. The Credit Union Fund</p>  <p>  The Credit Union Fund was established under section 57 of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 (2012 Act) for a number of purposes including the provision of stabilisation support, but primarily to provide a source of financial support for the restructuring of credit unions under the Credit Union Restructuring Board (ReBo) and to meet the expenses of ReBo in discharging its functions.  The Government provided &euro;250 million? to the Credit Union Fund specifically for restructuring under ReBo.  The Restructuring Levy (ReBo Levy) is provided for under section 47 of the 2012 Act and commenced in 2014.  Levies collected up to and including 2017 from the credit union sector amount to &euro;11 million, circa 50% of ReBo's total gross expenditure.  Approximately &euro;22.6 million has been drawn from the Credit Union Fund for restructuring purposes.  ReBo concluded its restructuring work on 31 March 2017 and is currently being wound down. </p></reply>

It is important to point out that the key income tax component, i.e. PAYE income tax, which accounts for around 65 per cent or &euro;13.1 billion of total income tax receipts is broadly in-line with target at end-November, down just &euro;34 million or just under 0.3 per cent.  This represents robust year-on-year growth of 8.8 per cent or &euro;957 million which reflects solid wage growth and continued strong increases in full time employment.</p><p>In relation to USC, overall receipts are on target at end-November.</p><p>Of the remaining components of income tax, some relate to unearned income and are not directly impacted by employment or wage developments (e.g. Deposit Interest Retention Tax and Life Assurance Exit Tax).  The majority of these components are below target at end-November, and therefore having a &lsquo;drag&rsquo; on overall income tax receipts at end-November 2017.</p><p>The other main contributing factor to the overall shortfall is the Schedule D income tax provisional receipts, which are &euro;119 million or 6.6 per cent below target but up 2.3 per cent in year-on-year terms.  </p><p>The position is that the final Schedule D returns in respect of 2016 incomes were only due to be filed in November this year and Revenue is still in the process of reviewing these.</p><p>Schedule D income earners were also required to pay preliminary tax in respect of 2017 in October/November this year. However, the associated final returns are not required to be filed until October/November 2018.  It will only be then that Revenue can fully advise why receipts from this cohort of income earners was below expectations.</p></reply>

This will allow for the collection of the alleged State aid from Apple. The Deputy may be aware of a recent public announcement on progress in this respect. Officials and experts from across the State have been engaged in intensive work to ensure that Ireland complies with all its recovery obligations as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  With regard to the appeal, the Government profoundly disagrees with the European Commission&rsquo;s analysis in the Apple State aid case. An appeal is therefore being brought before the European Courts. Such an appeal takes the form of an application to the General Court of the European Union (GCEU), asking it to annul the Commission&rsquo;s Final Decision. </p>  <p>  The Attorney General prepared the legal grounds in support of the annulment proceedings and the application was lodged in the GCEU in 2016.  As is normal practice, a summary of these have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union. They were also published on the Department of Finance&rsquo;s website in December 2016. </p>  <p>  The case has been granted priority status and is progressing through the various stages of private written proceedings before the GCEU.  It is at the discretion of the Court to determine if there will be oral proceedings, either in public or in private.  It will likely be several years before the matter is ultimately settled by the European Courts.  </p>  <p>  As this is the subject of open legal proceedings, it will not be possible to comment further, in particular on any of the individual elements of the State&rsquo;s legal case in defence of our position. This is important to ensure that we do not prejudice our own legal case. </p></reply>

Where there is poor or non-engagement then Revenue is left with no alternative but to use its enforcement powers to secure collection, including statutory interest where applicable.</p>  <p>  The person in question has a very poor tax compliance record and has accumulated significant tax debts over a number of years.  The person has also failed to file their most recent VAT return, which has resulted in estimates being raised in respect of that period.</p>  <p>  Revenue has confirmed to me that it has already made every effort to engage with the person over an extended period of time but unfortunately has received no response to date.  Revenue also confirmed that it previously provided the Deputy with the contact details of an official who would work with the person to advance matters and has assured me that this arrangement is still available.</p>  <p>  To move the issue forward I would urge the Deputy to advise the person to make immediate contact with the nominated official. If the person fails to make contact, Revenue will be left with no alternative but to continue with debt collection/enforcement action.</p></reply>

As well as being of benefit to individual borrowers, this can be beneficial to overall financial stability, including through positive effects on consumption and consumer confidence and by aiding housing mobility.</p><p>In addition it is worth pointing out that a total stock of over 120,000 PDH mortgage accounts were classified as restructured at end-June 2017.  At end-June 2017 87 per cent of restructured accounts were deemed to be meeting the terms of their arrangement.  For BTL a total stock of over 23,000 mortgage accounts were categorized as restructured at end-June 2017.  87 per cent of the total stock of restructured accounts were meeting the terms of their current restructure.  This shows that engagement by borrowers with their lenders works.</p><p>I would also like to draw the Deputy's attention to recent progress made by the Government in assisting those in mortgage arrears.  The Abhaile service helps borrowers in arrears to find the best solutions and keep them, if possible, in their own homes.  This is assisting borrowers, particularly those in longer term arrears.  A dedicated adviser will work with borrowers in arrears and their lender to find the best solution for them.  </p><p>Borrowers can get free advice from an expert financial adviser who can help them to work through their financial situation and where possible help them to remain in their home.  An Expert adviser could be from MABS or a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) or an accountant.</p><p>Borrowers may also need legal advice and under Abhaile and they can have a free meeting with a solicitor.</p><p>If called to court to face repossession proceedings on their home, they will be able to meet a Duty Solicitor at the court.  A MABS staff member will also be present at court to help them.</p><p>A Helpline is available Monday to Friday and a face-to-face service which is completely free, confidential and independent is also available in more than 60 MABS locations nationwide.</p></reply>

NAMA will focus on completing its ongoing deleveraging, its Dublin Docklands SDZ and residential funding programmes in the interim period to 2020.  It is through the successful completion of these objectives that NAMA currently projects a surplus in the region of &euro;3bn to be returned to the State once it completes it work.</p>  <p>  As per section 60(2) of the NAMA Act 2009, NAMA may use surplus funds to redeem and cancel its senior and subordinated debt. Surplus funds may only be returned to the Central Fund once NAMA's debt has been redeemed in full.</p>  <p>  Any NAMA surplus paid, while Exchequer positive, will not impact the general government balance, in line with Eurostat rules.  It will be a decision for the Government as to how any surplus returned by NAMA will be utilised within the framework of the fiscal rules.</p>  <p>  It has always been the Government's intention to use such receipts from the resolution of the financial sector crisis to pay down our debt and help reduce our debt servicing costs. Given the uncertainty around the specific timing of or the amount that will be realised, such receipts have not been included our debt forecasts.  Debt reduction underpinned by our national debt long term target of 45 per cent of GDP, will increase the resilience of the public finances to deal with any potential shocks which may emerge.</p></reply>

It is not possible to predict the length of time it will take for a Bill to be drafted and pass through both Houses of the Oireachtas given the need for meticulous drafting, ongoing detailed policy considerations, and the scheduling requirements of the Houses of the Oireachtas. However, I have asked the Attorney General to prioritise the drafting of this legislation so that the new compulsory retirement age will become effective as soon as possible which reflects the recent Government Decision on the matter.  </p>  <p>  In order to make some accommodation for public servants who reach the age of 65 in the period between the Government Decision on 5 December and the commencement of the necessary legislation, the Government approved some limited interim arrangements which became effective from the date of the Decision.  The interim arrangements allow affected public servants who reach the age of 65 in that period,  to remain in employment until they reach the age of eligibility for the State Pension (Contributory), which is currently 66.

To assist insurance companies to take into account the protection provided by completed OPW flood defence schemes, the OPW has a Memorandum of Understanding with Insurance Ireland, the representative body of the insurance industry. This Memorandum sets out principles of how the two organisations work together to ensure that appropriate and relevant information on these completed schemes is provided to insurers to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, the availability to the public of insurance against the risk of flooding. Insurance Ireland members have committed to take into account all information provided by OPW when assessing exposure to flood risk within these protected areas. To date OPW has provided details to Insurance Ireland on 18 completed schemes nationally and Insurance Ireland surveys its members to ascertain the extent to which flood insurance cover is available in these areas. </p>  <p>  The insurance industry has recently confirmed that it accepts that flood defence schemes that utilise demountable defences provide protection against 1 in 100 year flood events. The insurance industry however do have concerns in relation to the human element in the deployment of these demountable defences, specifically in relation to any liability for flooding arising due to the incorrect or late installation of the defences. A separate working group including members of Insurance Ireland the Department of Finance and the OPW are discussing how best to address these concerns. This group last met on November 13th and is scheduled to meet again in January. </p>  <p>  These meetings are in addition to the regular quarterly meetings where the OPW and the Department of Finance engage with Insurance Ireland in respect of the Memorandum of Understanding. The most recent of these meetings took place on December 8th 2017 with the next meeting scheduled for March 2018. I am satisfied that my officials, along with officials from the Department of Finance, will continue to work with the insurance industry to progress this issue. </p>  <p>  The decision on whether to offer insurance, the levels of premiums charged and the policy terms applied are matters for individual insurers. Insurance companies make commercial decisions on the provision of insurance cover based on their assessment of the risks they would be accepting on a case-by-case basis. </p>  <p>  Any person with an insurance-related query or complaint can contact Insurance Ireland's Insurance Information Service (01 676 1914 or iis@insuranceireland.eu).  In addition, the Financial Services Ombudsman (1890 88 20 90) deals independently with unresolved complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with all financial service providers.</p></reply>

As reported in the Department of Finance Fiscal Monitor, at the end of November overall gross voted expenditure of &euro;51.5 billion was 1.3% below profile with current expenditure of &euro;48.2 billion under profile in 15 out of 17 Ministerial Vote Groups.</p><p>However, given the cash basis of Government accounting and the scale of gross voted expenditure, over &euro;58 billion in aggregate for 2017, there can be a need for Supplementary Estimates arising from policy decisions, overruns, timing issues or shifts in expenditure requirements. In aggregate, Supplementary Estimates of &euro;0.49 billion have been presented to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for approval this year and are set out in the table.</p><p><table><tr><th>Supplementary Estimates by Vote</th><th>&euro;m</th></tr><tr><td>Vote 5 &ndash;   Director of Public   Prosecutions</td><td>0.4</td></tr><tr><td>Vote 12 &ndash;   Superannuation and   Retired Allowances</td><td>6.5</td></tr><tr><td>Vote 17 &ndash;   Public Appointments   Service</td><td>0.7</td></tr><tr><td>Vote 20 &ndash;   An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na</td><td>44.2</td></tr><tr><td>Vote 26 &ndash;   Education and Skills</td><td>124</td></tr><tr><td>Vote 34 &ndash;   Housing, Planning and   Local Government</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Vote 35 &ndash;   Army Pensions</td><td>10.7</td></tr><tr><td>Vote 37 &ndash;   Employment Affairs and Social Protection</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Vote 38 &ndash;   Health</td><td>195</td></tr><tr><td>Vote 30 &ndash; Agriculture, Food and the Marine</td><td>0.001</td></tr><tr><td>Vote 31 &ndash; Transport, Tourism and Sport</td><td>0.001</td></tr><tr><td>Vote 32 &ndash; Business, Enterprise and Innovation</td><td>0.001</td></tr></table></p><p>As we are operating under the fiscal rules that apply under the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, Supplementary Estimates need to be accommodated within the requirements of the fiscal rules. Additional expenditure requirements in one Department may be offset by underspends in other areas. In this context, taking account of the overall expenditure position at the end of November, it can be expected underspends surrendered to the Exchequer at the year-end will mitigate the impact of the Supplementary Estimates.</p><p>Looking forward to 2018, taking into account the increased expenditure allocations set out in the Budget Estimates published on Budget day in October this year, and the key fiscal objective of achieving the structural deficit of 0.5% of GDP, it is important that Departments continue to manage expenditure within their allocations.</p><p>Sustainable public finances are necessary to support growth in the economy and build resilience to respond to potential adverse economic and fiscal developments.  Budget 2018 sets out prudent sustainable growth in public expenditure. On Budget day, I announced an additional allocation of capital expenditure of &euro;4.3 billion over the next four years up to the end of our existing Capital Plan. This additional capital investment is central to our response to Brexit and will allow major infrastructure projects to be planned over the medium term.</p><p>Education is vital to keeping our economy competitive and attracting investment. The allocation of over &euro;10 billion for education is a new peak for the sector. Additional capital funding is also being provided over the period out to 2021 to address the infrastructure needs of the higher and further education sectors.</p><p>In conclusion, the increased expenditure set out on Budget day for schools, hospitals housing and public transport will continue to support economic growth, enhance the economy's resilience and help maintain its international competitiveness in terms both of trade and attractiveness to foreign direct investment.</p></reply>

The reform programme has been delivering for the Irish public for 6 years &ndash; since the first reform plan was launched in 2011. We have achieved much to transform our public services in that time and are building a resilient and responsive public service that can meet the challenges of the future while delivering quality services. However, the world is changing fast. Today&rsquo;s uncertain and unpredictable global environment poses significant challenges for Ireland.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, a new phase for public service reform was set out in the framework <i>Our Public Service 2020 </i>published earlier this week. <i>Our Public Service 2020</i>aims to deliver better outcomes for the public, to support innovation and collaboration and to build public service organisations that are resilient and agile. Implementation of the actions in <i>Our Public Service 2020</i>will have an ongoing positive impact on economic performance in the future.</p><p><i>Our Public Service 2020</i>aims to strongly link expenditure with reform. This is to ensure that real reform is delivered and that there is a continued emphasis on ensuring value-for-money principles are adhered to across the public service. Ensuring value for the taxpayer is an important element of managing the costs of public services and maintaining stable public finances.</p><p><i>Our Public Service 2020</i>, allows the public and businesses to have greater input into the planning, design, implementation and review of public services. Public service reform remains part of the Government&rsquo;s economic strategy and will enable us to continue to improve outcomes for the public.</p><p>Shared ownership of the framework and committed leadership will be essential to ensure successful delivery of the actions in the new framework. For this first time, both civil service and public service leaders are directly involved in the public service reform governance structures. I believe that this will be key to ensuring the successful implementation of the new framework and to achieving the best possible outcomes for our economy and for the public.</p></reply>

This Bill provides for the implementation of the terms of the PSSA.  </p><p>The PSSA will run from 2018 to 2020 by which point pay will be fully restored to all public servants earning up to &euro;70,000 which is equal to almost 90 per cent of public servants. Benefits to different income groups are progressive and weighted towards the lower paid with pay increases ranging from 7.4 per cent to 6.2 per cent over three years.</p><p>This Agreement achieves the right balance between addressing the legitimate expectations of public service workers for increases in their pay and ensuring that the Government continues to exercise a prudent approach to the overall management of our public finances while securing industrial peace to support the ongoing delivery and reform of our public services.  </p><p>The improvements in pay provided for in this Agreement mark another important step in the gradual normalisation of our collective bargaining approach to pay arrangements in the public service through the process of unwinding the FEMPI legal framework on pay that has been in place for the last number of years.  </p><p>A copy of the Agreement can be found on the Department's website: <i>.</i></p></reply>

As non public servants, the staff of such organisations, which may exceed 100,000 in number, did not, for example, fall within the application of the FEMPI legislation involving as it did the reduction in pay and increase in pension contribution for public servants. It is correspondingly the case that current  public service pay policy does not extend to such organisations.   </p>  <p>  It will be appreciated that such entities are accordingly self governing and accountable for the management of their own internal financial resources. While it is the case that certain or indeed, in some cases, all of these financial resources may come from government funding it remains the position that decisions on pay expenditure issues arising in such entities are matters that are determined at the discretion of the management authorities of each of the organisations concerned. The issue of pay is just one important challenge within a complex mix of other challenges and demands that the individual organisations concerned are required to decide upon and manage.  Having regard therefore to these circumstances it is a matter for each of these private sector organisations to resolve the financial challenges that they may face in accordance with the financial resources available to them, whatever the source may be of such funding arrangements.</p>  <p>  It is also important to note that in respect of Section 39 organisations, which are private sector concerns and a significant part of this sector, funding of almost &euro;1billion was provided by the State in 2016. It is furthermore the case that Exchequer funding for Section 39 organisations has increased by over 15% between 2014 and 2016. </p></reply>

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.</p><p>Procurement reform is a key element of the Government's overall reform programme and is aimed at delivering increased value for money, more accurate and timely data and improvement in the capacity and capability of procurement across the public service.  The fragmented procurement arrangements across the public service facilitated amongst other things suppliers charging different public service bodies different prices for the same goods and services.  This was not sustainable, as the State could not afford to continue to purchase works, goods and services in a manner that undermines the efficient delivery of services.</p><p>The central procurement frameworks and contracts established by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) have been designed to optimise benefits including savings to the State through the strategic aggregation of its buying power.  Aggregation arrangements such as multi-supplier frameworks can, where appropriate, address local supplier issues.  </p><p>The reform of public procurement in Ireland is being carried out in a manner that recognises the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises in this country's economic recovery.  The aim is to drive fair, transparent and open competition in the marketplace but also to work with business to ensure that government procurement policies are business friendly</p><p>Given the budgetary pressures facing the public service, public procurement enabled savings can support the dual objectives of meeting our fiscal targets and of maintaining/improving services for the public. The strengthening of procurement professionalisation will in turn provide public bodies who use the contracts and frameworks with increased certainty and reduced risk by providing them with compliant sourcing solutions.  </p><p>The Government has committed in the Programme for Partnership Government to refining the new procurement structures in place and to make adjustments according to best international practice and in conjunction with Irish business.  </p><p>The SME Advisory Group chaired by my colleague, Minister of State Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan in accordance with the Programme for Government, meets on a quarterly basis to address issues concerning SME participation in public procurement.

Minister of State Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan also launched the Office of Government Procurement&rsquo;s (OGP) <i>Public Service Spend and Tender Analysis Report for 2015 </i>report in September.  This is the OGP&rsquo;s third annual report that analyses expenditure and tendering activity on goods, services and minor works across public service bodies in Ireland.  I would point out that the analysis is encouraging, indicating that 94% of the State&rsquo;s expenditure is with firms within the State.</p><p>Finally, it is also important to remember that open tendering is a two way street and that it provides Irish companies with opportunities to compete abroad. Public expenditure on goods, works, and services representing approximately 14% of EU GDP with an annual value of nearly &euro;2 trillion. The open market regime offers opportunities for Irish companies to win business abroad and reliable EU studies indicate that many Irish businesses are successful in this regard.</p></reply>

Since then, a policy of delegated sanction for management of staff numbers has been applied to most Government Departments. Under this policy, subject to remaining within their pay ceilings, Departments can recruit or promote in grades up to and including Principal Officer or equivalent without seeking central approval. Departments with delegated sanction may also introduce similar arrangements with public service bodies under their aegis. The policy gives Departments a greater degree of flexibility to respond to staffing needs as they arise.</p>  <p>  Since the ending of the moratorium, the number of full-time equivalent staff employed in the Public Service and delivering services on behalf of the State has grown by just over 25,000 and stands at approximately 315,000 as of Q3 2017.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that recent growth in public service numbers has taken place in the key sectors of health, education and justice in line with increased investment by Government in these services with these three areas accounting for over 85 per cent of the increase in staffing since the end of 2014. This, in addition to the further planned recruitment in 2018, reflects the Government's response in terms of prudent and sustainable increases in public spending to key service needs reflecting, for example, demographic developments.</p></reply>

During this period, members coordinated on the delivery of many elements of the Outline Implementation Plan for the 2004 Flood Risk Management. These included the publication of planning guidelines, actions in respect of forecasting and the launch of the website resources <i>www.flooding.ie, www.floodmaps.ie and www.waterlevels.ie. </i></p><p>The Group was reconvened in July 2015 and has subsequently met 7 times; the Group met twice in 2015, four times in 2016, and once in 2017. In addition to these meetings of the full Group, there have been a number of other meetings involving members of the Group in relation to individual aspects of the national flood policy. </p><p>In November 2016 Government agreed an interim report from the Interdepartmental Flood Policy Coordination Group setting out progress on its work and making appropriate recommendations for consideration by Government. This report is available to view on the OPW website at <i></i></p><p>Progress has been made against all the key recommendations contained within the interim report:</p><p>- The Government has approved the administrative arrangements for a targeted and prioritised once of Voluntary Homeowners Relocation Scheme for those properties worst affected by the flooding of Winter 2015/2016. </p><p>- The Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine have commenced study to determine the feasibility of any future once-off targeted scheme for Voluntary Farm Building Relocation. </p><p>- Work is continuing on the Government strategy to improve the availability of flood risk insurance cover by prioritisation of investment in flood defences by the OPW and Local Authorities and improved channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry including the sharing of data.</p><p>At the Group&rsquo;s most recent meeting last September members reported on progress in their areas in national flood policy including updates in relation to Community Resilience, the Climate Action Plan, the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme and the associated Flood Risk Management Plans. </p><p>It is currently envisaged that the Group will next meet early in the new year.</p></reply>

Through their primary and post primary education students are taught the key skills and knowledge to enable them to make healthier life choices and to develop the resilience to reject negative options.  This can be seen across in the curriculum, through subjects such as Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE), and Home Economics as well as in Physical Education.  It is also an important component of Wellbeing, the new area of learning introduced to all first year students from September 2017, as part of the implementation of the new Framework for Junior Cycle. </p>  <p>  Another significant development in this area is the introduction of the specification for a new examinable Leaving Certificate Physical Education subject and a new non-examinable Framework for Senior Cycle Physical Education which were approved by me in February 2017, following development by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA). </p>  <p>  Both the examinable subject and the Framework are being introduced on a phased basis from September 2018 . This is in keeping with the strong emphasis from my Department on promoting and encouraging Healthy Lifestyles for all students and commitments in the Programme for Partnership Government and the National Physical Activity Plan, reflecting the concern to ensure that all young persons in our schools engage in some form of physical activity.  The work in schools also supports the Government's Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013 - 2025 - Healthy Ireland.</p>  <p>  The 2015 Lifeskills Survey indicates that 92% of primary schools surveyed reported that they had a healthy eating policy in place.  This is similar to the level reported in 2012. 3% reported that they were in the process of developing a healthy eating policy, and 5% reported having no healthy eating policy in place. </p>  <p>  100% of primary schools reported that they taught pupils about the importance of a balanced diet and 99% include the food pyramid as part of these lessons. </p>  <p>  At Post primary 32% of schools reported having a healthy eating policy in place and a further 30% reported that they were in the process of developing one. 93% of schools reported that they promoted healthy lunches with their students compared with 66% in 2012.</p></reply>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has overall responsibility for the Bill. The PSSA provides a framework for further negotiation on a number of issues, including new entrant pay. </p>  <p>  Public service agreements have already delivered on a number of issues through structured negotiations and engagement with concerned groups. Through this process a 15-22% pay increase was negotiated for new teachers. The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale. </p>  <p>  As a result of these changes and taking into account the proposed pay measures under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the starting salary of a new teacher from 1 January 2018 will be &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511.</p>  <p>  Further to this, newly recruited teachers benefit from the terms of the Ward Circular which reduced the qualifying period from a CID and the removal of the career break and secondment categories of objective grounds which had previously prevented some teachers from gaining CIDs. In addition to earlier permanency, other measures of benefit to newly recruited teachers included a revised sequence for the filling of posts to enable fixed-term and part time teachers to gain permanent, full-time jobs more quickly and easier than before. These benefits were achieved through continued engagement and collective bargaining. </p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;130 million. Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher. </p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs in 2018, and over 1,000 extra teachers in 2018. </p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the recently concluded Public Service Agreement 2018-2020 includes a provision in relation to new entrants which states that an examination of the remaining salary scale issues in respect of post January 2011 recruits at entry grades covered by parties to the Agreement will be undertaken within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement. An initial meeting on new entrant pay under this process took place on 12 October 2017. Further progress has been made in this regard through the amalgamation of the post-2011 and post-2012 pay scales as of 1 January 2018.</p></reply>

Schools with the highest concentration of disadvantage based on updated information will be included in the programme, subject to resources.</p></reply>

I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no function in decisions in this regard. </p>  <p>  The Valuation Act, 2001 as amended by the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 provides that all buildings used or developed for any purpose, including constructions affixed thereto, are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the Act. Such exempt buildings would principally include those used for public worship, education and health care provided on a not-for-profit basis, and charitable purposes. In general, the Act maintains the long-standing position that all commercial properties - including all private childcare facilities such as play schools, pre-schools, cr&egrave;ches and Montessori schools - are liable for rates. </p>  <p>  Inconsistency in the approach to the exemption from rates for childcare and education facilities and calls to exempt all such providers were among the issues raised at a number of stages during the passage of the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015. As a result, the Government approved an amendment to the Bill, to insert into Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001, an exemption from rates for properties occupied by parties that provide early childhood care and education on a not-for-profit basis. This extension of the childcare and education exemption removed an anomaly that previously existed where those that provided childcare and education on a charitable basis were exempt but those that did so on a not-for-profit basis were not.  </p>  <p>  The decision taken by Government in the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 to extend the exemption from rates for early childcare and education was taken having considered the views of stakeholders in the sector. As outlined in Oireachtas debates during the passage of the legislation, key valuation principles have to be respected to retain the integrity and equity of a system that is a significant source of funding for Local Authorities. One of those principles is that properties of occupiers that operate with the intention of making a profit are rateable. There is a variety of other more appropriate means through which Government can and does support the provision of such services. Making exception to core, long-standing valuation principles can have a far reaching negative impact on the rates system and consequently a far reaching impact on Local Government funding. </p>  <p>  In addition to the exemption of those that provide childcare and early education on a not-for-profit basis, paragraph 10 of Schedule 4 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 also exempts from rates childcare facilities that only provide the Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme. </p>  <p>  The Acts are quite specific about the range of exemptions that can be allowed by the Commissioner, who has no discretionary latitude to grant exemptions not covered by Schedule 4. As a matter of course, the Valuation Office examines all claimant cases on their individual merits by reference to the relevant statutory provisions governing the operation of the Valuation Acts as they relate to pre-school childcare facilities and all other categories of properties. </p>  <p>  Regarding the payment of rates by individual ratepayers, the Deputy will be aware that under Irish law there is a distinct separation of function between the valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates. The amount of rates payable by a ratepayer in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Valuation Office multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of the local authority. The latter is a reserved function of the elected members and the Commissioner of Valuation has no function in this regard. </p>  <p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) was consulted in the deliberations surrounding the extension of the exemption from rates for early childcare and education. Private childcare facilities which are operated for profit form part of the rateable valuation base on a nationwide basis. While I understand that this issue has been the subject of discussions earlier this year between the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and my own Department, there are currently no plans to provide for special treatment of these for profit facilities by their exemption from rateability under the Valuation Acts.  </p>  <p>  Finally, I should point out that there are a number of avenues of redress for an occupier of rateable property who is dissatisfied with a determination of valuation made under the provisions of the Valuation Acts, 2001-2015. Firstly, before a determination is made, there is a right to make representations to the Valuation Office in relation to a proposed valuation. Later in the process, if the occupier is still dissatisfied with the determination, there is a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal which is an independent body set up for the purpose of hearing appeals against determinations of the Valuation Office. There is a right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law. </p>  <p>  Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation, pursuant to the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015. The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. </p>  <p>  Commercial rates form an important element of the funding of all local authorities. The principle of local authorities levying rates based on an independent valuation is well established, and I understand that the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has indicated that there are no plans to change this. </p></reply>

The Directive is part of a package of measures aimed, inter alia, at addressing the underrepresentation of women in employment, and supporting women&rsquo;s career progression by creating improved conditions whereby they can reconcile their working responsibilities and family commitments. </p>  <p>  The specific objectives of the Directive are (1) To improve access to work-life balance arrangements and (2) To increase take-up of family-related leaves and flexible working arrangements by men. </p>  <p>  The key articles in the Directive are (1) Article 4, which provides for 10 days of paid paternity leave, (2) Article 5, which provides for four months parental leave, one month of which may be transferable between parents, in respect of children up to the age of eight, (3) Article 6, which provides for five days per annum paid carers&rsquo; leave, (4) Article 8, which provides that workers exercising rights in accordance with articles 4, 5 and 6 will receive payment or an allowance equivalent to national sick leave rates (at a minimum) and (5) Article 9, which provides for the right of a worker with caring responsibilities or the right of a parent (in respect of children up to 12 years of age) to ask his or her employer for flexible working arrangements. </p>  <p>  Working Group negotiations on the proposed directive have been underway since the initiation of the proposal, and will continue in January 2018 under the Bulgarian Presidency of the European Union.  It is expected that discussions on the Directive will not progress to general approach for at least several months so it would be premature to plan for the proposal&rsquo;s implementation at this stage. </p>  <p>  While supportive of the aims of the Directive, in common with many other member states Ireland recognises that there are significant cost implications associated with the proposed new Parental Leave scheme. These reservations have been expressed at working group level and also at the meeting of the Council of the European Union on Employment, Social Health and Consumer Affairs (EPSCO) on 7 December, 2017.  At that meeting the implementation of the Parental Leave scheme on a phased basis was suggested and discussed.  Given the cost implications and logistical issues arising, this is a reasonable position to adopt as it would allow member states to reduce the initial costs of introducing any new leave and benefit arrangements over a period of time and it would also give member states sufficient time to manage the logistics of any new schemes.  The Government is of the view that were the principle of phased implementation to be accepted, the focus should initially be on providing leave to parents of younger children and only subsequently expanded to parents of older children.</p>  <p>  Some of the goals of the proposed directive are already reflected in existing schemes in Ireland. For instance in 2016 a new scheme of two weeks of Paternity Leave to paid at the sick leave rate was introduced which satisfies the requirements of the proposed Directive in relation to paternity leave. The Programme for Government contains a commitment to expanding paid leave for the first year of a child&rsquo;s life, and work on developing proposals on how this expansion can be best achieved will formally begin in early 2018.  It is expected that the agreed scheme will be recognised as progress towards achieving the requirements of the Directive. </p>  <p>  My Department looks forward to continuing work on the Directive with the other key Government Departments and the EU Commission, Presidency and member states to shape it so that it is affordable, properly targeted, and effectively serves to improve the work life balance of parents and families.</p></reply>

Similarly, the International Protection Appeals Tribunal operate an email which can be contacted by individuals with any queries regarding their appeal application - info@protectionappeals.ie.</p>  <p>  Section 26 of the International Protection Act 2015, provides that it is an offence to identify an international protection applicant. The offence is punishable by summary conviction to a Class A fine or a term of imprisonment of 12 months or both. </p>  <p>  The Supreme Court judgment in the case of N.V.H. v. The Minister for Justice and Equality found, on 30 May last, that in an international protection system with no temporal limits as to when the application process will be concluded, an absolute prohibition on the right to work for international protection applicants is contrary to the right to seek employment under the Constitution.  The Court recognised that this is a matter for the Executive and Legislature to consider and accordingly adjourned consideration of the Order the Court should make for a period of six months. The Court in making its Final Orders agreed to a stay on the execution of the Order until 9 February 2018. My officials are actively engaged in ensuring compliance with the Order. </p>  <p>  Following the approval of Government, an Inter-Departmental Taskforce was established in July to examine the wide-ranging implications of the judgment, and to consider appropriate solutions.  The Taskforce was comprised of representatives from nine Government Departments, along with the Office of the Attorney General.  On 21 November 2017, the Government approved the recommendations of the Taskforce, including the key recommendation that the State should respond to the judgment by opting-in to the EU (Recast) Reception Conditions Directive (2013/33/EU).  The EU Directive provides for many matters including, of course, access to the labour market for international protection applicants.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice will move the required Motions to seek approval in the Houses of the Oireachtas for participation in the Directive at the earliest opportunity. Following the approval of both Houses, the opt-in procedure with formal notifications to the European Council and the European Commission will commence. The European Commission then has four months from receipt of this letter to confirm our participation.  During these four months, the State will be required to demonstrate to the Commission how it is compliant with each Article in the Directive. </p>  <p>  The Government has agreed to establish an Implementation Group to oversee the opt-in procedure and the practical arrangements for facilitating access to the labour market for eligible applicants. The Group will be drawn from membership of the Taskforce, supplemented by the participation of relevant operational areas in the Department of Justice and Equality and other Departments as required. </p>  <p>  In relation to access to further and higher education, a Pilot Support Scheme was introduced by the Department of Education and Skills in 2015 for students who are in the Protection System or at the Leave to Remain (but not deportation order) stage. This was one of the recommendations contained in the report by the Working Group on the Protection Process which was chaired by former High Court judge, Dr. Bryan McMahon. The scheme provides supports to qualifying students which are similar to those available in the Student Grant Scheme. Following a review of the Pilot Support Scheme in 2016, a decision was made to continue the scheme for the 2017/18 academic year and to undertake a further review in 2018.  To qualify for the pilot scheme, prospective students have to meet a number of criteria, including a requirement to:</p>  <p>  - Meet the definition of a protection applicant or a person at leave to remain stage (other than those at the deportation order stage);</p>  <p>  - Obtained their Leaving Certificate;</p>  <p>  - Have been accepted on an approved Post Leaving Certificate course or an approved undergraduate course;</p>  <p>- Have attended a minimum of five academic years in the Irish school system and have been part of an application for protection or leave to remain for a combined period of 5 years prior to the 31st   of August of the first year of their course.</p></reply>

Further consideration was also given to the inevitability of legal challenges to such action, the passage of time, and associated retirements, and poor data quality, which would all have additional delay, cost or other implications.  </p>  <p>  The Commissioner informed the Authority that the decision to take a future-focused, restorative approach allowed An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to focus on strategic reforms, changes to culture and embedding the Code of Ethics and performance management system, along with improving data quality. </p>  <p>  The Commissioner also confirmed that he will be issuing a personal directive to all members stating that distortion of data quality and data breaches will amount to a serious disciplinary matter and could, at the most serious level, result in dismissal. In addition, the Commissioner indicated that he would be specifically and individually writing to each Divisional manager to highlight their responsibilities in relation to supervision and accountability. </p>  <p>  The Government established the Policing Authority to ensure oversight of policing practices, shed light on problems and identify solutions through its structured engagement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Policing Authority's commentary on the Crowe Horwath report, where the Authority, in relation to this point, stated that "poor performance on a pervasive scale can seldom be appropriately addressed by disciplinary processes". The Authority further commented that the focus should be on implementing a meaningful performance management system for both Garda members and civilians in 2018, so that there is a framework for the delivery of policing plans and ensuring accountability.</p>  <p>  The Authority went on to indicate that, unless there is prima facie evidence of either a criminal offence or a disciplinary breach having been committed, the core focus for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should now be on rectifying the issues identified permanently across all dimensions, including procedures, technology, training, supervision and accountability.  I fully expect the Commissioner to urgently address the issues highlighted by myself, by Crowe Horwath and by the Policing Authority and I welcome the continuing  oversight of the Policing Authority in this respect. This Government has put in place significant Garda resources, both human and financial, but, as the Policing Authority has emphasised, cultural change within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is of critical importance.  This is why one of the Policing Authority&rsquo;s first acts was to introduce a Garda Code of Ethics. Adherence to that code must become a fundamental part of our policing.  I previously made clear to Commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in that Garda management must ensure that all members are committed to the values the Code sets out. I am confident that he and his colleagues understand the importance of ensuring that cultural change goes hand in hand with systemic improvements.  The Policing Authority has a critical role to play in supporting and overseeing this process. Moreover, it is important to remember that the expert Commission on the Future of Policing is undertaking a significant root and branch analysis of policing in Ireland.  I have no doubt that this report will inform the Commission's work to bring about the transformation of policing in this country. However, I fully acknowledge the vital work undertaken everyday by the women and men of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure the safety and security of the people of Ireland. I remain dedicated to doing everything in my power as Minister, in conjunction with the Policing Authority, to ensure ethical and excellent policing, robust oversight and the modernisation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure it can operate effectively and professionally in the public interest.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would draw the Deputy's attention to page 33 of Crowe Horwath's report, which contains a table, outlining the regional and divisional discrepancies in breath test data across An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during the period June 2009 to April 2017. Statistical information is also available in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's internal examination into the recording of breath tests at MATs, published in September this year (Pages 52-55 refer).   </p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, this Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.</p><p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  Garda numbers taking account of projected retirements, will increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - a net increase of 500 since the end of 2016.</p><p>  I am also pleased that Budget 2018 maintains this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensures that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College.  This will see Garda numbers reach the 14,000 mark by the end of 2018.</p><p>  In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p><p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, in the coming years.</p><p>  As the information requested by the Deputy, which relates to the period 2010 to 31 October 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, is very voluminous, I am arranging to have it forwarded in hard copy form.</p></reply>

Upon receipt of the requested information the case will be further processed and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.  </p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay.  While most straightforward cases are generally processed within six months, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process.  In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. </p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

It involves senior officers from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the PSNI, the Revenue Commissioners and HM Revenue and Customs; it also includes the Criminal Assets Bureau and UK National Crime Agency (who have the primary role in criminal assets recovery) as well as other appropriate law enforcement services (such as environmental protection agencies and immigration services) when required by the operations of the Task Force.  The establishment of the Joint Agency Task Force was a commitment of the Irish and British Governments in the 2015 <i>Fresh Start Agreement</i>and the Task Force has been operational since early 2016.  </p><p>The Joint Agency Task Force consists of a Strategic Oversight Group which identifies and manages the strategic priorities for combatting cross-jurisdictional organised crime and an Operations Co-ordination Group which co-ordinates joint operations and directs the necessary multi-agency resources for those operations.  </p><p>As the Joint Agency Task Force is a multi-agency coordination structure is does not have a defined staffing complement or budget.  Personnel from the participating agencies in both jurisdictions are assigned for specific operations.  Similarly, budget resources are deployed from the various elements of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Criminal Assets Bureau and other agencies as necessary for particular operational requirements.</p><p>I am very satisfied with the operation of the Joint Agency Task Force in the two years since its inception.  There have, for example, been specific operations targeting rural crime, child sexual exploitation and human trafficking for labour exploitation that have resulted in a number of arrests, the seizure of stolen vehicles, equipment and other goods, cash and drugs and the identification by the Revenue services of unregistered business interests.  In respect of rural crime, there was also a specific focus on awareness-raising and providing crime prevention advice at community level on both sides of the border.  </p><p>The Joint Agency Task Force is just one example of the extensive co-operation that is undertaken between police and criminal justice agencies in the State and in Northern Ireland.  I commend the work of all of the agencies involved in combatting cross-border criminal activity.</p></reply>

This Strategy is a whole of Government approach to improving the lives of people with disabilities both in a practical sense, and also in creating the best possible opportunities for people with disabilities to fulfil their potential. The Strategy focuses on eight vital areas, one of which is Employment. Five high level objectives in relation to Employment are identified as follows:</p><p>- People with disabilities are encouraged and motivated to develop to the maximum of their potential, with a view to participating in further education and employment.</p><p>- People with disabilities have the opportunity to work and have a career.</p><p>- People who become disabled are given the supports they need to remain in or return work if they so choose.</p><p>- People with disabilities are financially better off in work.</p><p>- Employers can easily access information about employing a person with a disability.</p><p>These objectives are underpinned by 11 specific, measureable and time bound actions. In particular I would bring the Deputy's particular attention to Action 47, &ldquo;We will fully implement the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for persons with disabilities.&rdquo; </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Comprehensive Employment Strategy was launched in October 2015. The Strategy sets out a ten-year cross-government approach that brings together actions by different Departments and State agencies in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on employment of people with disabilities. In tandem with that, it seeks to ensure there will be joined-up services and supports at local level to support individuals on their journey into and in employment. The Strategy's six strategic priorities are:</p><p>- Build skills, capacity and independence</p><p>- Provide bridges and supports into work</p><p>- Make work pay (the Make Work Pay Report was launched in April 2016 and many of its recommendations are already being implemented).</p><p>- Promote job retention and re-entry to work</p><p>- Provide coordinated and seamless support</p><p>- Engage employers</p><p>The Comprehensive Employment Strategy includes a range of practical measures to increase employment opportunities for people with disabilities.  For example, a national employer helpline was launched in January 2016 to provide expert guidance and peer support to employers in relation to the employment of staff with disabilities. There will be an increase in the public sector employment quota from 3% to 6% on a phased basis to 2024, and arrangements are also being put in place for dedicated recruitment channels for people with disabilities.<b></b></p><p>Given the complex cross-government nature of the strategy, an oversight implementation group was established in 2015 under the independent chairmanship of Fergus Finlay. This group is tasked with monitoring the progress of the six strategic priorities of the strategy, ensuring that each Government Department is fulfilling its obligations and meeting its targets. The Chair's first annual report is available here: .</p><p>The Chair will publish his second Annual Report in early 2018.</p></reply>

That Act transposes Articles 1 and 3 of Directive 2014/32 EU on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to the making available on the market of measuring instruments. The remainder of that Directive is being transposed by way of Statutory Instrument (S.I.) under section 3 of the European Communities Act 1972. On the advice of the Attorney General, the Act and S.I. must come into effect on the same date. Drafting of the S.I. is virtually completed. Accordingly, I hope to commence the Act and the S.I. later this month. </td></tr><tr><td>S. 98 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000</td><td>There is no intention to commence this section barring exceptional circumstances </td></tr><tr><td>S. 199 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000</td><td>There is no intention to commence this section barring exceptional circumstances </td></tr><tr><td>S. 247 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000</td><td>There is no intention to commence this section barring exceptional circumstances </td></tr><tr><td>Consumer Protection Act 2007 Sections 48 and 49  </td><td>Sections 48 and 49 of the Consumer Protection Act 2007 have not been commenced as the Attorney General has advised that their provisions are incompatible with the maximum harmonisation nature of the Directive on Unfair Commercial Practices which was transposed into Irish law by the Consumer Protection Act 2007. Section 48 prohibits traders, who accept payment for goods and services by different relevant methods (defined as cash, credit card, direct debit, or any other method prescribed by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation) from imposing an additional charge by reason of customers choosing to pay for goods or services by one relevant method as against another. Section 49 provides that, where it is permissible for a trader to impose a payment charge in accordance with section 48 (i.e. where the trader accepts only one relevant method of payment or imposes the same charge in respect of all relevant methods of payment), the trader must state the price of the goods or service as a single amount inclusive of any such charge. </td></tr><tr><td>Companies Act 2014 Section 4(2)               Section 1325</td><td>Section 4(2) in so far as it relates to Regulation 6 of the EuropeanCommunities (Mergers and Divisions of Companies) (Amendment)Regulations 2011 (S.I. No.306 of 2011) The full repeal of Regulation 6 of the European Communities (Mergers and Divisions of Companies) (Amendment) Regulations 2011 was not possible due to a difference in national law requirements on mergers concerning notice requirements and those provided for in the EU regulations on cross-border mergers.  The reason why this section has not commenced is because it would repeal the foundation documents of the Bank of Ireland. The section will only be commenced once Bank of Ireland decides to convert to a company incorporated under the Companies Act 2014. </td></tr><tr><td>Companies (Accounting Act) 2017 Section 80</td><td>Commencement of this section was delayed to ensure that the new filing requirements of unlimited companies that are registered outside of Ireland are aligned with the new filing requirements on unlimited companies that are registered in Ireland.  Section 80 of the 2017 Act amends the definitions of an &ldquo;EEA company&rdquo; and a &ldquo;non-EEA company&rdquo; in section 1300 of the Companies Act 2014. These definitions are for the purposes of Part 21 of the 2014 Act, which provides for &ldquo;external companies&rdquo;. An external company is a company incorporated outside of Ireland with a branch in Ireland. The main change is that the two definitions now extend to external companies registered as companies with unlimited liability but whose members&rsquo; liability is in fact limited. As a result, some unlimited companies incorporated outside of Ireland that do not qualify currently as external companies, will, once section 80 is commenced, become classified as external companies and so will be required to comply with the obligations on an external company almost. As a result, some of those companies could have had to provide financial information in respect of financial years earlier than those beginning on 1 January 2017. Under the commencement arrangements for the rest of the Act, a similarly structured company, registered in Ireland, is required to first file financial statements in respect of years that begin on or after 1 January 2017. Delay of section 80 will align the requirements for similar companies, whether registered in Ireland or not.  A revised order that will commence the section on 9 June 2018 is being prepared by the OPC.</td></tr><tr><td>Sections 65 to 70 of the Workplace Relations Act, 2015 </td><td>The Workplace Relations Commission was established on the 1st October 2015 under the Workplace Relations Act, 2015 and saw the merging of the activities of the National Employment Rights Authority, the Labour Relations Commission, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Labour Court and the Employment Appeals Tribunal into a new Body of First Instance - the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).  The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal were incorporated into an expanded Labour Court. Sections 65 to 70 inclusive of the Workplace Relations Act, 2015 relate to the dissolution of the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) and cannot be commenced until the legacy caseload of the EAT has been finalised. The legacy caseload relates to cases submitted prior to the commencement of the Act on 1 October 2015 and has decreased to the point that there are currently less than 100 cases on hands.</td></tr><tr><td>Subsections (5)(b) and (6) of section 15 of the Employment Permits (Amendment) Act 2014</td><td>Commencement of these provisions will be subject to the outcome of pending consultations. The provisions provide for a portion of the employment permit fee to be refunded to a person nominated by the applicant where the application is withdrawn or refused.  Currently, fees are refunded to the applicant only.  These provisions may commence when the necessary changes are made to the employment permits processing system to support such a policy change, subject to further consultations. The employment permit processing system has not yet been adapted to support the refund of fees to a person other than applicant.  If it is considered necessary to do so, consultation will need to take place with the relevant bodies as regards other legislation and any unintended impact of this provision, e.g. The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, as amended, etc.</td></tr><tr><td>Section 4(2) of Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 (No. 10 of 2005) in respect of the revocation of certain enactments </td><td>(i.)Mines and Quarries Act 1965 (in as much as it relates to Mines), Regulations to bring occupational safety and health for mines under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 are currently being settled by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and it is hoped will be introduced in 2018 to allow for the introduction of a Commencement Order to enact this subsection of the Act. (ii.)Dangerous Substances Acts 1972 and 1979, The Dangerous Substances regime is subject to an ongoing review and upon completion appropriate legislation will be introduced. (iii.)Safety in Industry Acts 1955 and 1980,  Regulations relating to certain work sectors remain to be finalised and brought under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, these are currently with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government for settlement and it is hoped will be introduced in 2018 to allow for the introduction of a Commencement Order to enact this subsection of the Act. (iv.) Safety, Health and Welfare (Offshore Installations) Acts 1987 and 1995. It is the intention to introduce Regulations under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 to ensure the sector specific provisions are protected and aligned under the umbrella of the Act.</td></tr><tr><td>Part II of the Dangerous Substances Act 1972 (No. 10 of 1972), Section 7 (1) and the Schedule to that Act in so far as they refer to the Towns Improvement (Ireland) Act 1854, the Explosives Act 1875, the Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1883, the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 and the Revenue Act 1909 Section 7 (2) of that Act, and any other provision of the Dangerous Substances Act 1972, to the extent that the provision is applicable to or for the purposes of explosives within the meaning of section 9 (1) of that Act</td><td>There is no intention to introduce a commencement order for these sections as the responsibility for legislation on explosives rests with the Minister for Justice and Equality</td></tr></table></p></reply>

State Aid rules did not feature on the agenda of these meetings.  The Competitiveness Council is a consultative committee and is not a forum for direct representations from Member States.  Nor does the Council propose changes to State Aid rules.</p>  <p>  Brexit was a central part of the discussions at meetings my predecessor, Frances Fitzgerald, had with both EU Commissioners and Ministers from other Member States.  This included a meeting with the EU&rsquo;s Chief Brexit Negotiator, Michel Barnier in July 2017 where the difficulties Ireland is facing as a result of Brexit were discussed.</p>  <p>  In addition, Officials of my Department have had discussions with senior officials from DG Competition to sensitise them to the potential difficulties to be encountered by Irish businesses in the UK market arising from the Brexit referendum result.  Furthermore, in November 2017, the then T&aacute;naiste met with Commissioner Vestager.  An outcome from this meeting was the establishment of a Working Group comprising representatives from DG Comp, the Department of Business, Enterprise &amp;amp; Innovation, Enterprise Ireland and Department of Agriculture.  The objective of the Group is to scope and design schemes to support enterprise impacted by Brexit in line with current applicable State Aid rules.  The work of this Group has already commenced and will continue into 2018.  Should issues arise that require an approach that does not fit within the existing State Aid rules, this will be raised as part of the Working Group discussions.</p>  <p>  A lot can be done within the existing EU State Aid Framework.  In October 2017, the then T&aacute;naiste announced a Brexit Loan Guarantee scheme for SMEs and in November 2017 the EU Commission approved a Rescue and Restructuring scheme for Ireland.  Both these schemes will operate within existing State Aid rules.</p></reply>

The number of applications at this stage means that a county by county analysis is not particularly meaningful.

Arising from this statutory function, the Central Bank can impose civil financial sanctions for non-compliance with regulatory requirements.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) does not have an equivalent regulatory function and accordingly does not have the statutory power to impose civil financial sanctions.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the Law Reform Commission published an Issues Paper entitled "Regulatory Enforcement and Corporate Offences" on 27 January 2016.  The Issues Paper invited views on the supervisory and enforcement powers of the State&rsquo;s main financial and economic regulators (including the CCPC) and the issue of civil financial sanctions was raised.  I understand the CCPC made a submission to the Law Reform Commission on 19 September 2017 in response to the Issues Paper requesting the power to levy such sanctions.  Any recommendations or proposals that may emanate from this exercise will be carefully considered by my Department.</p>  <p>  My Department has obtained advice on the issue of civil fines from the Office of the Attorney General to the effect that civil fines are not provided for in Irish law for anti-competitive practices.  This advice is based on Article 38.1 of the Constitution which provides that no person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law.  Therefore, any national legislation to introduce civil fines that would lower the burden of proof from beyond reasonable doubt to the balance of probability would pose constitutional difficulties due to the protection afforded in Article 38.1 of the Constitution. </p>  <p>  On 22 March 2017, the EU Commission published a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council to empower the competition authorities of the Member States to be more effective enforcers and to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market. One of the Directive&rsquo;s aims is to ensure that all National Competition Authorities are given the power to impose effective deterrent fines.  The proposal is currently being debated at the Council Working Group on Competition and is also being considered by the European Parliament. </p></reply>

A considerable amount of research into approaches in other jurisdictions has been carried out along with a consultation exercise with the medical community and key stakeholder groups. </p><p>This research and consultation has informed the key findings of the Commission&rsquo;s First Report.  The Commission suggest that adopting a standardised and internationally recognised approach to the diagnosis, treatment and report of soft tissue injuries, by medical practitioners who are appropriately competent and trained in the completion of personal injury medical reports, will improve the personal injuries environment in Ireland. This standardised approach should be along the lines of South Australia Clinical guidelines for best practice management of acute and chronic Whiplash Associated Disorder. </p><p>The Whiplash Associated Disorder (WAD) scale as developed by the Quebec Task Force (QTF) is an internationally recognised objective classification scale based on severity of symptoms and associated physical signs indicative of the seriousness of the injury sustained.  It comprises of five grades:</p><p>- Grade  0 (WAD 0) - no neck pain, stiffness, or any physical signs are noticed</p><p>- Grade  1 (WAD I) - neck complaints of pain, stiffness/tenderness but no physical signs</p><p>- Grade  2 (WAD II) - neck complaints and decreased range of motion and local tenderness in the neck</p><p>- Grade  3 (WAD III) - neck complaints plus neurological signs </p><p>- Grade  4 (WAD IV) - neck complaints and fracture, dislocation, or injury to the spinal cord.</p><p>The scale seeks to provide an objective basis for diagnosing whiplash.  It allows medical practitioners to classify patients&rsquo; injuries according to their level of severity.  This classification helps determine the type and extent of medical care patients will likely need to effectively treat the injuries and accompanying pain and discomfort.</p><p>The Personal Injuries Commission has included a medical reporting template in the Report to be used by all examining medical professionals in all relevant cases.</p><p>The Personal Injuries Commission has recognised that there are significant advantages in adopting the WAD scale in Ireland as it has been validated by research and is internationally used and recognised.</p></reply>

In addition, the advances in digital technologies continue apace, opening up new market opportunities, spawning new global business models and impacting on every sector of the economy. </p>  <p>  A senior-level Principal Officer forum was set up that includes representatives from a number of key economic government departments and the development agencies.

A more comprehensive review of enterprise performance over the past decade was also completed. Informed by this evidence base, my officials engaged with industry and other stakeholders to debate the extent to which our priorities remain robust or need a greater emphasis in today's environment. </p>  <p>  It is important to highlight that action is already being taken by Government, my Department and its agencies to respond to the challenges arising from Brexit in particular. </p>  <p>  I and my agencies remain focused very clearly on the stretch targets set out in Enterprise 2025, which include reducing unemployment in each region to within one percent of the State average by 2020; achieving export growth in Irish-owned enterprises of 6-8 percent per annum; an increase in the number of startups by 25 percent per annum &ndash; startups with better survival rates &ndash; this would see us with 15,700 enterprise births a year; a 30 percent increase in the numbers of exporters of scale; an additional 1,080 inward investment projects; a 60 percent increase in EI enterprises spending more than &euro;1m on R&amp;D and winning &euro;3.6bn in R&amp;D related FDI; and, a 25 percent uplift in direct economic expenditures by agency supported companies. </p>  <p>  The Review is at final draft stages and the aim is to publish the report in early 2018.  This review will be complemented by the Action Plan for Jobs 2018.</p></reply>

Many more of our older people with complex care needs are now being maintained at home, leading to increased demand for additional levels of service, and for services outside of core hours of Monday to Friday.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2018 a further &euro;41 million has been made available for older people services, comprising &euro;9m once-off funding in 2017 and &euro;32 million next year, to further strengthen supports for older people, particularly to facilitate speedier discharge from acute hospitals over the winter period. A significant proportion of this additional funding will go towards home care services.</p>  <p>  Home care is monitored on an on-going basis, to ensure that activity is maximised relative to individual clients&rsquo; assessed care needs and within the overall available resources for home care and having regard to demand throughout the year.     </p>  <p>  The resources available for home care services while significant, are finite.  Accordingly the services, and allocation of resources to individual clients, require prudent management on an on-going basis as demands for services increase. In this context, those clients who are assessed and approved for home care and who are not being provided immediately with a service are risk assessed and placed on a waiting list for a resource as it becomes available.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. </p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years. The Report of the Review was published in July 2015. Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies.</p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review. This Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners, and when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  These recommendations include examining the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme. The programme for a Partnership Government has also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination  against small businesses and family farms. It is important to remember that the NHSS is largely underpinned by primary legislation  and changes to the NHSS will require legislative implementation.</p>  <p>  On this basis, I have requested legal advice from the office of the Attorney General regarding potential changes to the legislation that will address this matter. My department has also been cognisant of this matter in the context of this years estimates process. I have recently met with representatives from the I.F.A and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association  to discuss various strategies that may assist with addressing their members concerns and have apprised them of the current progress. I remain hopeful to be in receipt of this legal advice before year end and  I am committed to this review of the position with regard to family farms and small businesses for the purposes of the financial assessment of the scheme. Any proposed changes will require primary legislation and I hope to be in a position to progress this in early 2018.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service. However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner. The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; is forecast at just over &euro;1.7 billion in 2017. </p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively. This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults. It was reimbursed in the community drugs schemes from 2010. The projected budget impact was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure has increased significantly, from &euro;9.4 million in 2012 to over &euro;30 million in 2016, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles. Currently, over 25,000 patients receive this item. </p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data and its value is uncertain for all other types of pain. The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, between 5-10% of prescribing of this product is for the licensed indication of PHN. </p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017. This process supports the appropriate use of Versatis, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment. The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.</p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster for three months. No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.</p><p>These patients were identified and automatically registered on the HSE-PCRS system for three months and continued to receive the treatment from their pharmacy until 30 November 2017. However, from 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients will no longer get this item under the community drugs schemes. The HSE has produced information leaflets for patients and advised GPs on treatment alternatives. </p><p>In exceptional circumstances, the product may be approved for supply through the community schemes for unlicensed indications. GPs apply for reimbursement for unlicensed indications through the online system. The MMP reviews applications before a decision is made and communicated to the GP.</p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at .</p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

Such assets are defined in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, 2009 as 'transferred assets' and 'transferred income'.  Under the legislation there are no exemptions in relation to transferred assets.</p>  <p>  Applicants to the scheme can request their financial assessment to be reviewed  if 12 months have passed since the original assessment or if the HSE is satisfied that their has been a material change to their financial assessment.

Government policy is therefore to co-locate all remaining maternity hospitals with adult acute services in order to provide optimal clinical outcomes.  Co-location of maternity services with adult services provides mothers with access to a full range of medical and support services should the need arise.  The availability of these services helps ensure the delivery of an optimum, safe service, particularly for high risk mothers and babies. </p>  <p>  Following the grant of planning permission for the new National Maternity Hospital on the St Vincent's University Hospital campus, the Design Team is continuing to work on the detailed design of the hospital and the preparation of tender documents.  This development will of course represent the flagship project of the National Maternity Strategy and will constitute the largest single investment ever made in maternity services in Ireland.  Work on a legal framework to protect the State's interest in the project is expected to conclude shortly.</p>  <p>  I have been advised that the Rotunda hospital has commissioned consultants to prepare a draft Design Brief.  In addition, I understand that work is nearing completion on a Development Control Plan for the Connolly campus and this will support the orderly development of future capital projects on that campus.

It will capitalise on the opportunities that every health professional has on a daily basis to support patients to make healthy lifestyle choices for chronic disease prevention and the self-management of existing chronic diseases.  Implementing this programme will result in patients being routinely asked about the main lifestyle risk factors for chronic disease - tobacco use, alcohol &amp;amp; substance use, diet, and physical activity.</p><p>A five year implementation plan has been developed for the Framework which will be implemented at a strategic and operational level under the following areas:</p><p>- Leadership; </p><p>- Staff Engagement, Training and Support; </p><p>- Partnership and Cross Sectoral Working; and</p><p>-  Monitoring and Evaluation.</p><p>As implementation of the MECC is an operational matter for the Health Service Executive, I have forwarded the question to the Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-12-14a.944.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121400090#WRX01900"><p>The National Positive Ageing Strategy (NPAS), published on 24 April 2013, provides a framework for cooperation to address age-related policy and service delivery across Government and society in the years ahead.  The Strategy is intended to promote older people&rsquo;s health and well being so that older people can continue to contribute to social, economic, cultural and family life in their own communities for as long as possible, thereby representing a vision for an age-friendly society.  The Strategy highlights that ageing is not just a health issue, but rather requires a whole of Government approach to address a range of social, economic and environmental factors that affect the health and well-being of our ageing citizens.  </p><p>At the launch of the Strategy, a commitment was made to publish an Implementation Plan to facilitate the translation of the Goals and Objectives of the Strategy into action on the ground.  The approach to implementation originally included in the Strategy would have worked where a finite number of discrete and concrete steps could be taken after which the implementation could be deemed complete.  However, many of the objectives included in this Strategy are quite broad, and can be viewed as a set of principles to which Government has committed, and which will inform policies that affect older people on an indefinite basis into the future, rather than concrete objectives that can be delivered in the short term.</p><p>The Department has therefore formulated new arrangements to implement and monitor the  implementation of the National Positive Ageing Strategy.  The revised arrangements were approved by the Cabinet  Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform on 27 October, 2016.</p><p>The new arrangements establish mechanisms that will give stakeholder groups effective and on-going access to Government Departments and  State Agencies relevant to older people.  This includes  an annual Forum for stakeholders to identify what they consider to be their key priorities for Government for the coming year and the next three years; and establishing clear channels of communications between stakeholders and relevant Government Departments.  In this regard, stakeholder representatives will engage with a named senior official on  issues relevant to their remit, in order that the priorities identified  by the stakeholders at the Forum can be pursued.  </p><p>The inaugural stakeholder Forum took place on 30th March 2017, and was attended by civic society organisations who are representative of the needs and views of older people in Ireland.  Following on from this successful Forum, the Department of Health has opened a dialogue with each of the Government Departments identified as having responsibility for the priorities agreed by stakeholders, in order that they are aware of the issues for discussion prior to being contacted by a stakeholder representative group. The Department of Health  will meet with the stakeholder representative group in early 2018 to review the progress made and plan for the next stakeholder forum.</p><p>As part of the NPAS implementation process, a Healthy and Positive Ageing Initiative has been established in collaboration with the HSE&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing Programme and the Atlantic Philanthropies to measure the impact of the Strategy and establish an ongoing system for measuring and reporting on Positive Ageing.  The Initiative will monitor changes in older people&rsquo;s health and well-##being linked to the Goals and Objectives of the National Positive Ageing Strategy.  This will be done primarily through the development of Positive Ageing indicators to be published every two years.  The Initiative is intended to provide evidence of the factors contributing to positive ageing, including at local level and ultimately inform policy responses to population ageing in Ireland. The first national Positive Ageing Indicators report was published in 2016 and highlights many of the positive and negative aspects of growing old in Ireland.</p><p>The National Positive Ageing Strategy and the activities of the HaPAI are strongly embedded within the vision and actions set out for Healthy Ireland, the Government-led initiative which aims to create an Irish society where people of all ages can enjoy good physical and mental health<b>,</b>and where well-##being is<b></b>supported at every level of society.  The Healthy Ireland Framework was launched in 2013 and seeks to provide people and communities with<b></b>accurate information on how to improve their health and well-##being and to make the healthy choices easier choices.  Healthy Ireland takes a whole-of-Government and whole-of-society approach to improving health and well-being and the quality of people&rsquo;s lives and a number of new structures have been put in place to ensure that all sectors of society are given opportunities to participate. </p></reply>

Expenditure will be based on multi-year budgeting supported by a five year Health Service Plan based on realistic and verifiable projections.  The funding increases provided to the HSE since this Government came into office, and the enhanced performance and accountability framework introduced by the HSE, provide an important basis for planning multi-annual health expenditure and the operation of the health services within the limits determined by the Oireachtas.  These will be key to the sustainability of this approach.</p>  <p>  The development of such a multi-year service plan will have to align with the future implementation plan for the Sl&aacute;intecare report, which was published earlier this year.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently working on a response to the Sl&aacute;intecare report to bring to Government and a plan on how best to progress the many recommendations in the report.  This response is being developed with input from the HSE.  I expect to be in a position to bring this to Government very early in the new year.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, the HSE formally submitted their National Service Plan for 2018 to the Department on 8th December.  Following the submission of the National Service Plan, the legislation provides 21 days for me to examine the proposed Plan and where necessary to seek amendment to, or approve, the Plan.  The National Service Plan must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas within 21 days of its approval.  Once the Service Plan is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas the HSE will ensure it is published at the earliest possible time.</p></reply>

It recommended that interventions should be aimed at maximising recovery from mental illness, building on service user and social network resources to achieve meaningful integration and participation in community life.  In addition, it recommended that mental health services should be organised nationally in catchment areas for populations of between 250,000 and 400,000 and that specialist expertise should be provided by community mental health teams - expanded multidisciplinary teams of clinicians who work together to fulfil the needs of service users.</p><p>Progress, while slower than originally anticipated, continues to be made in implementing the Report&rsquo;s recommendations.  A number of service improvements have been implemented in parallel with the accelerated closure of old psychiatric hospitals and their replacement with bespoke new facilities, better suited to modern mental health care.  Service improvements include the development of adult and child &amp;amp; adolescent services, shorter episodes of in-patient care, the adoption of a recovery approach in the delivery of services, and the involvement of service users in service planning and delivery.</p><p>Other ongoing developments include the development of counselling services across both primary and secondary care, including early intervention at primary care level; a greater awareness of fostering mental health promotion in society through campaigns; the publication of the Expert Review Group Report on the Mental Health Act 2001 and the Suicide Prevention Strategy 'Connecting for Life'; and the commencement of work on the new National Forensic Hospital to replace the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.  In addition, funding has been made available to facilitate the transfer of some patients from the Forensic Mental Health Services to the community, investment in high observation in acute mental health units, the improvement of  24/7 services through additional liaison psychiatry services, new clinical programmes and provision of additional clinical space in community services.</p><p><i>'A Vision for Change'</i>came to the end of its 10-year term in 2016 and preparations for a review and updating of policy have been underway since early last year.  An external evidence and expert review was completed on 17 February 2017 which provides evidence to determine the policy direction for a revision of A Vision for Change, both in terms of international best practice and the experience of implementing A Vision for Change.  An Oversight Group has been established to produce a high-level policy framework which sets out future service priorities.  This Group will oversee the development of a refreshed policy for mental health based on the recommendations arising out of the Expert Review.  The policy review process will also involve consultation with key stakeholders.</p></reply>

The report recommends the phased increased access to buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone) for groups of patients in specific circumstances, subject to resourcing and the required legislation being enacted.</p>  <p>  Approximately 80 people currently receive suboxone for opioid dependence and are registered on the Central Treatment List (CTL) on an informal basis.  For the feasibility study, the CTL was required to set up, manage and maintain a separate national database for all clients in receipt of buprenorphine/naloxone treatment.  However, unlike the CTL for Methadone this did not have a statutory footing.</p>  <p>  New Regulations, the Misuse of Drugs (Supervision of Prescription and Supply of Methadone and Medicinal Products containing Buprenorphine authorised for Opioid Substitution Treatment) Regulations 2017 came into effect on 22 November 2017.  The purpose of these Regulations is to provide access to certain buprenorphine-based medicinal products for Opioid Substitution Treatment (including buprenorphine/naloxone and buprenorphine only) on the same statutory basis as methadone.</p></reply>

Consequently under the EU Directive on Patients&rsquo; Rights in Cross Border Healthcare each Member State is required to implement the Directive's provisions regarding access to healthcare in other Member States/EEA countries. </p>  <p>  The Directive on Patients' Rights in Cross Border Healthcare provides rules for the reimbursement of patients' of the cost of receiving treatment abroad, where the patient would be entitled to such treatment in their home Member State (Member State of Affiliation) and supplements the rights that patients already have at EU level through the legislation on the coordination of social security schemes (Regulation 883/04).  </p>  <p>  The Directive seeks to ensure a clear and transparent framework for the provision of cross-border healthcare within the EU, for those occasions where the care patients seek is provided in another Member State rather than in their home country. S.I. 203 of 2014 provides the legal basis for the Health Service Executive to operate the EU Directive on Patients' Rights in Cross Border Healthcare in Ireland.</p>  <p>  In transposing the terms of EU Directive 2011/24/EU the Irish State, in line with other Member States of the EU, put in place a reimbursement scheme for the costs of cross-border healthcare.  This decision reflects the situation that under the terms of the Directive it is the patient who makes the choice to receive their treatment outside of the State.  The patient decides the Member State they wish to go to, and the particular institution, or individual, from whom they receive the treatment (which may be in the public or private sector).  Given the choice the patient has of such a large and diverse range of providers across the EU\EEA, and their differing payment systems, it is not possible to set up a direct payment scheme.  There are no plans to amend this provision of the transposition. </p></reply>

The plan is being rolled out at a regional and local level and involves full consultation with stakeholders. </p><p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.  In May 2016, 2725 people lived in congregated settings and our objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.  A congregated setting is defined as a residential setting where people live with ten or more people. </p><p>The HSE has established a subgroup, under <i>&lsquo;Transforming Lives&rsquo;,</i>the Programme to implement the recommendations of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services, which is developing an implementation plan for moving people from institutions.  I welcome the fact that the needs of people moving from congregated settings will be fully taken into account during this process as the model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan. </p><p>At the end of December 2016, less than 2,600 people with a disability were living in congregated settings.  The HSE's 2017 National Service Plan has set a target of 223 to move from institutions in 2017.  This will  ensure that people are able to move out of congregated settings, and into their own homes in the community. I want to emphasise that the appropriate supports and resources are being put in place to ensure that people are supported as they move out of residential centres.</p><p>As the HSE is responsible for leading out on the recommendations on <i>&quot;Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion&quot;,</i>I have arranged for the Deputy's questions to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Following a consultation process in 2016, the HSE has reconstituted the National Steering Group, which is now comprised of representatives across the whole health system including Heads of Social Care and the National Clinical Programme for Rehabilitation Medicine, Acute Hospital services, Mental Health, Primary Care and Health &amp;amp; Wellbeing, Health &amp;amp; Social Care Professionals and the Neurological Alliance of Ireland. </p><p>The focus of the HSE National Steering Group is to develop a framework which is implementable across the country.  The Steering Group considers that a Managed Clinical Rehabilitation Network model represents best practice as a means of providing neuro-rehabilitation care and support/accommodation needs.  A Working Group has been established to support the Demonstration project pilot site.  The Working Group has drafted both Terms of Reference and an Implementation Framework. </p><p>The HSE's 2017 National Service Plan also contains a priority action to 'establish an innovative pilot day service aimed at supporting people with severe acquired brain injuries'.  Work is in progress to complete the requirements of the Service Arrangement with An Saol, to source a service location and recruit necessary staff.</p><p>With regard to the related service matters raised by the Deputy, I have arranged for the Deputy's questions to be referred out to the Health Service Executive, for a direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.  </p>  <p>  I am very much aware of the importance of access to planned respite, which ensures that people with disabilities receive opportunities to socialise and separately, facilitates families to receive a break from caring.  Respite services may vary, according to the assessed needs of the individuals and their carer.  The model of respite is changing and although some still require overnight respite, others prefer and benefit from day respite.  The number of respite nights has been reducing as persons with disabilities are seeking alternative models, such as day respite or extended day.</p>  <p>  In 2017, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has planned that 161,262 overnight respite sessions will be accessed and the number of day respite sessions planned is 42,552. </p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE will provide 128 new emergency residential placements and new home support and in-home respite for 75 additional people who require emergency supports. </p>  <p>  In the HSE's Social Care Operational Plan for 2017, 5,720 people with a Disability are expected to avail of centre based respite services.  Based on existing levels of service and in addition to the centre-based respite service, it is planned that between 2,000 and 2,500 persons will avail of respite services such as holiday respite or occasional respite with a host family. </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to work with agencies to explore various ways of responding to this need in line with the budget available</p>  <p>  As the level of data requested by the Deputy is not currently available, I have arranged for the questions to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for the inclusion of this data  in the reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The HSE's Primary Care Division has already appointed a National Clinical Lead for the Addiction Services to improve its response to drug and alcohol abuse at primary care level and this Clinical Lead will work with the Mental Health Clinical Lead to develop a cohesive programme for those with a dual diagnosis.</p>  <p>  The aims of this Programme are to develop a standardised evidence-based approach to the identification, assessment and treatment of comorbid mental illness and substance misuse.  An integral part of the Dual Diagnosis Programme will be to devise a model of care that will outline how all adolescents and adults suspected of having a moderate to severe mental illness coexisting with significant substance misuse have access to a timely mental health services nationally.  This is to be delivered on a CHO basis.  The aim will be for the service to be provided in an integrated manner across the HSE's Primary Care Division and the Mental Health Service and will ensure that there are close working relationships with the relevant specialities in the Acute Hospital Groups which will deal with any medical comorbidities that may occur, particularly in those with alcohol misuse.</p>  <p>  A National Working Group, made up of key stakeholders with clinical, service user and service provider expertise, has been appointed.  The Group had its first meeting in mid October 2017 and has initiated a work plan to develop a Model of Care based on a Programmatic approach to service improvement and development.</p></reply>

The publishing of this particular report is timely as my Department are currently considering the recommendations of the Sl&aacute;intecare report so as to provide a response and draft implementation plan to me by the end of the year. </p>  <p>  I welcome the details provided in Ireland&rsquo;s Country Health Profile which acknowledges that the health status of Irish people has improved and more rapidly than in many other EU countries.  It also notes the progress we have made in reductions in smoking and alcohol consumption &ndash; leading causes of chronic disease in Ireland.  It also lists details of our increasing life expectancy but notes that as our older population increases, prevalence of chronic disease among this age cohort will increase.</p>  <p>  The State of Health in the EU report also highlights the fact that a significant proportion of the population have voluntary private health insurance.  It further notes that this can give private patients access to diagnostics and hospital treatments in public hospitals faster that public patients.  As the Deputy is aware, in line with Sl&aacute;intecare recommendations, I have established an Independent Review Group to undertake an impact assessment of the removal of private practice in public hospitals.</p>  <p>  Sl&aacute;intecare also set out an ambitious vision for the future of healthcare in Ireland, including a shift to Primary and Community-based care.  The State of Health in the EU report echoes this vision by stating that with strengthened Primary and Community-based services, unnecessary hospitalisations could be avoided.  The report goes on to note that the absence of universal cover for Primary Care is a barrier to access for services.  The re-orientation of our health services and the expansion of access to community-based services will be an important component of the response to Sl&aacute;intecare.</p></reply>

This includes veterinary services, laboratory staff, inspectorate staff, Brexit/International Trade Division, Meat and Dairy Policy Division and others, in completing market access questionnaires, facilitating incoming inspection visits, participating in diplomatic meetings, agreeing export health certificates and so on.  All of this inter-connected work facilitates the accessing of new markets and the maintenance of existing markets.</p>  <p>  In relation to meat, this effort is co-ordinated by a dedicated meat market access unit in the Meat and Dairy Policy Division.  This unit&rsquo;s staffing complement has increased in line with my action plan on market access.  It currently comprises a team of seven people led by an Assistant Principal Officer.  The annual cost for staffing this unit, including salary, PRSI, pension and accommodation, is estimated at approximately &euro;500,000.</p>  <p>  The meat market access unit works on expanding market access for beef, sheepmeat, pigmeat, poultry and cooked meats across a range of markets and is also working to simplify certification procedures in a number of markets to which Ireland already has access.  The work of the unit supports a meat industry with exports of over &euro;3 billion.</p>  <p>  My Department has made significant progress in recent years in increasing market access opportunities for Irish meat exports.</p></reply>

The Programme&rsquo;s content and design was formulated in light of previous experience and performance and reflects the outcome of extensive stakeholder consultation and does not include support for anaerobic digestors on farms under the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme II (TAMS II).</p>  <p>  TAMS II has been very successful to date in terms of uptake with the number of approvals that have issued exceeding 11,600.  All of these approvals represent committed expenditure and until such time as these approvals are acted upon or expire the budget for TAMS must include provision for the potential expenditure involved.</p>  <p>  Of the applications approved just over 3,000 payment claims have been received to date.  Payment claims submitted continue to be paid on an ongoing basis.  All participants who have completed approved works have been urged to submit their payment claims immediately to facilitate early payment.  Until the approvals issued to applicants are acted upon and payment claims are submitted or expire without a payment claim being submitted the budgetary position is that additional investment items cannot be accommodated within the RDP budget.</p>  <p>  Under the Rural Development Programme 2000-2006 a Pilot Waste Processing Facilities Scheme provided funding of &euro;4 million in order to grant-aid the installation of anaerobic digestors on ten Irish farms (i.e. 10 x &euro;400,000).  Two projects were completed and a further two have been given extensions to undertake the work by mid 2018.  Both projects will be nationally funded if completed.</p>  <p>  On the broader issue of supporting renewable energy, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment leads in terms of Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy policy and oversees the Renewable Electricity Feed-in Tariff (REFIT) schemes.  These Schemes are the principal means of supporting renewable electricity generators for renewable energy exported to the grid.  The schemes operate by guaranteeing a minimum price for renewable energy generation over a 15 year period.  The technologies supported include onshore wind energy, hydroelectricity, landfill gas, waste-to-energy and biomass technologies, including anaerobic digestion.  Electricity and heat produced from anaerobic digestion (AD) are supported under the REFIT 3 scheme.</p>  <p>  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is currently developing a Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) which is being designed to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contributions out to 2030.  The economic analysis to underpin this scheme included an appraisal of a broad range of renewable electricity generating technologies including onshore and offshore wind, solar PV, ocean energy technologies and bioenergy technologies including Anaerobic Digestion.  This appraisal will ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply.</p>  <p>  A public consultation on the RESS closed last month and whilst all submissions are currently being considered in informing the final design of the RESS, no final decisions have been made at this point as regards the technologies that will be supported.</p></reply>

However, the poor weather resulted in cattle being housed earlier than normal in places, particularly on the heavier soils; it also affected late cut silage making operations.</p>  <p>  I have asked Teagasc to work locally in areas with fodder difficulties to support good budgeting of fodder supplies on farms for the winter.</p>  <p>  Following my request, the European Commission agreed to my request for an advance payment of the 2017 Basic Payment Scheme.  This has been prompted principally by the inclement weather conditions.  This meant an increase from 50% to 70% in the rate for the BPS to those applicants whose applications were confirmed fully clear and 85% payment of our main Agri-environment scheme, GLAS.  Issuing of these payments commenced after the 15th October.</p>  <p>  Over &euro;1.2 billion in payments has issued to farmers over recent weeks, something that has significantly improved cash flow on these farms.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure a co-ordinated approach to addressing the issue of fodder availability on farms in the West and North-West, I recently convened a fodder group which is made up of all the main stakeholders including feed merchants and co-ops, banking, farm bodies etc. and the first meeting took place on Monday 11th December, chaired by Teagasc.  The group's objective is to actively monitor the situation and to ensure co-ordinated expertise and guidance is available to all farmers impacted.</p>  <p>  Arising from the meeting, Teagasc will begin a survey of fodder availability in the east and south of the country to ascertain what supplies are still available for purchase.</p>  <p>  Exploring these avenues means my Department will be fully informed of the situation on the ground and the best possible advice will be provided to farmers re their options which may include sourcing alternative feed, reducing non breeding stock numbers and ensuring they carry out a fodder budget.</p>  <p>  I will continue to actively monitor the situation in the impacted areas over the coming period.</p></reply>

This analysis will identify areas deemed to be facing natural constraints, which will in parallel be subjected to a refinement process.</p>  <p>  It was originally intended that this new approach would be introduced from January 2018 but a proposal for a one year extension of this deadline is currently under consideration at EU level as part of a range of regulatory changes under what is termed the "Omnibus Proposal".</p></reply>

I intend to address progress on aspects relevant to my remit as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. </p>  <p>  A number of the recommendations have been superseded by initiatives which have taken place. </p>  <p>  In relation to representation structures for the industry for instance, the National Inshore Fisheries Forum (NIFF) and Regional Inshore Fisheries Forums (RIFFs) provide arenas for inshore fishermen to develop proposals on inshore fisheries management, including compliance and data gathering. The NIFF is representative of the fishing boats of less than 12m overall length in the fishing fleet.  The focus on the NIFF work programme is on fisheries management in the coastal waters within 6 nautical miles.  The NIFF is taking the lead in setting priorities for policy development including ongoing work in developing a dedicated strategy for the inshore sector. </p>  <p>  To date, the twelve NIFF meetings have led to very constructive two-way conversations on issues of mutual concern, industry priorities, emerging policies &amp;amp; initiatives.  NIFF members are now included on a number of fisheries consultative structures including the Quota Management Advisory Committee, the Industry Science Fisheries Partnership, the SFPA Consultative Committee, the EMFF Operational Programme Monitoring Committee and BIM/Bord Bia Market Advisory Group.  This gives the inshore sector a role in making recommendations on range of fisheries policy matters including on allocation of Ireland&rsquo;s quotas, on data collection and scientific research.  Perhaps most important of these is that the NIFF now has a say on how funding is utilised including through the Inshore Fisheries Conservation Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Sub-Committee&rsquo;s report refers to managing the lobster and shrimp fisheries.  Changes came into effect in 2014 regarding the management of these fisheries, following on from an extensive consultation process.  In more recent times lobster in particular has been a feature of the agenda of the meetings which I have had with the NIFF and I look forward to a discussion with NIFF on the review of the effectiveness of the current conservation measures in 2018. </p>  <p>  With regard to the mackerel quota, there has been a change to the way this is allocated.  For 2017 and future years, the 87% to 13% share out of the quota between the Refrigerated Sea Water (RSW) pelagic fleet and polyvalent segment of the fleet will remain unchanged.  Where Ireland&rsquo;s quota exceeds 90,000 tonnes, the quota shall be shared on a 80% to 20% basis between the pelagic and polyvalent fleet.  A minimum of 2% of the mackerel quota, or 1,000 tonnes, whichever is the greater will be deducted annually for demersal swaps before any share out between segments is undertaken.</p>  <p>  There is an open mackerel fishery for vessels under 18 metres in length.  An amount of 2.5% of the overall polyvalent Mackerel Quota has been set aside for this fishery and a monthly catch limit is used.  This catch limit is recommended each month by the Whitefish Quota Management Advisory Committee which consists of fishing industry representatives.  For 2017, under 18m Boats may fish 5 tonnes per month.  In the last number of years much of this quota has remained under-utilised.</p>  <p>  The sub-committee made a recommendation with regard to &ldquo;minor fishing infractions&rdquo;.  In November 2014, my Department published a public consultation document in the form of a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA)  of a proposal for a Bill to amend the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 to provide for, inter alia, a system of fixed penalty notices  (&ldquo;on the spot&rdquo; fines) for minor fisheries offences.    This provided the possibility of creating a subset of minor offences which are legally suitable to be dealt with by way of fixed penalty notices. </p>  <p>  In summary, the process suggested in the RIA involved giving a person who was alleged to have committed a minor offence an option to pay a fixed payment which would mean that a prosecution would not be taken in the Courts.   If the payment was not received within 28 days, the prosecution would be initiated in the courts and on conviction it was expected that a higher fine would be applied.</p>  <p>  A number of industry submissions received under the RIA on the implementation of fixed penalty notices raised concerns that these would be used in place of verbal or written warnings.  Other comments raised concerns regarding potential inequalities in the application of the system between different Sea Fisheries Protection Authority Port Officers and Naval Service personnel.  There were also comments regarding the constitutionality of applying sanctions in the absence of a Court decision and others seeking a fully administrative system.  In light of the comments submitted in respect of the above proposal on a fixed penalty system, it was decided not to proceed with the introduction such a system.</p>  <p>  With regard to fishing infrastructure, it is important to say that my Department owns, maintains and directly manages six Fishery Harbour Centres.   The network of Harbours, located at Killybegs, Ros an Mh&iacute;l , An Daingean, Castletownbere, Dunmore East and Howth, are a valuable and vital resource to the Irish fishing fleet. The Fishery Harbour Centres provide state of the art facilities and infrastructure for the increasingly mobile and large scale Irish and EU fishing industries.</p>  <p>  In 2017, I allocated a total of &euro;3.8 million to the Local Authority Programme.  This vital funding targeted 67 approved Local Authority projects with a wide geographical spread, 55 of which are harbour development requiring funding of &euro;2.94 million and 12 relate to marine leisure requiring funding of &euro;879,750.  The infrastructure supported will be of great benefit to many rural coastal and island communities.</p>  <p>  With regard to progress on aquaculture, in May 2017 I published the report of the Independent Review Group on aquaculture licensing which contained 30 key recommendations across a full range of activities.  Additional staff have been assigned to the Aquaculture licensing division of the Department so as to facilitate the implementation of the recommendations.</p>  <p>  My Department's &euro;240 million European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme is the vehicle for financial supports to the seafood sector up to 2021.  The Programme delivers a wide range of supports for aquaculture, fisheries and seafood processing through a suite of 15 schemes including specifically in relation to Fisheries Local Action Groups.  Individual schemes are administered by BIM and I will ask BIM to update the Deputy on recommendations relevant to its remit. </p>  <p>  In summary, there are a number of recommendations not relevant to the remit of my Department and I have endeavoured to give the Deputy an update on relevant matters, including policy developments, which have occurred since the report was published. I would like to assure the Deputy that this Government is fully commitment to the seafood sector and the coastal communities who are dependent on fisheries and aquaculture.</p></reply>

The Plan targets a 30% increase in production derived from onshore close containment recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). Considerable international developmental effort is being put into land based RAS systems. A number of technological challenges need to be overcome to make RAS economically viable. </p>  <p>  BIM funded a 2015 study by the Irish Salmon Growers Association &lsquo;Potential for Land Based Salmon Growout in Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS) in Ireland&rsquo;. The report describes in detail all technical aspects of RAS production and system design and operations. It also covers important biological aspects of land based salmon production. </p>  <p>  As part of my Department&rsquo;s &euro;240 million European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme, a new Aquaculture &lsquo;Knowledge Gateway Scheme&rsquo; was launched in 2016. I have provided BIM with a budget of &euro;8.2 million for that Scheme over the course of the Programme. In close collaboration with aquaculture enterprises and researchers, the Scheme aims to develop knowledge, innovation and technology in the aquaculture sector to ensure its sustainable development. An important part of the focus of the Scheme will be the applied research and development on RAS identified in the National Strategic Plan. This may take the form of applied research undertaken by BIM on behalf of the sector or initiatives from industry operators or research institutions.</p>  <p>  To further incentivise RAS developments, I increased grants rates in December 2016 under the EMFF Sustainable Aquaculture Scheme for RAS developments to the maximum possible rate of 50% for 2017 applications. In May 2017, I doubled the maximum grant amount from &euro;500,000 to &euro;1m per project (still at 50% of eligible expenditure).</p>  <p>  The Knowledge Gateway Scheme and the Sustainable Aquaculture Scheme remain open and BIM would welcome industry or research projects related to the development of RAS technology in Ireland.</p></reply>

The possibility of a voluntary all Island label has been previously raised with British retailers,  who have made clear that they have a longstanding policy to market British and Irish beef separately, with a simple, clear origin label. </p>  <p>  While voluntary labelling of this nature has been mooted as a mechanism to encourage a live export trade between the Republic and Northern Ireland, it must be noted that this trade is determined by a range of factors, including the Sterling exchange rate and the supply of cattle in each market, retailer preferences and production cycles. It should be noted that live exports to Northern Ireland have increased for the year to date by 11% since the corresponding period in 2016.</p>  <p>  The North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) is a forum that discusses a wide range of matters pertinent to the beef sectors in both jurisdictions, however this matter has not been the subject of discussions at this meeting in recent times. </p></reply>

However the poor weather resulted in cattle being housed earlier than normal in places, particularly on the heavier soils; it also affected late cut silage making operations.</p><p>I have asked Teagasc to work locally in areas with fodder difficulties, supporting good budgeting of fodder supplies on farms for the winter ahead. </p><p>The European Commission agreed to my request for an advance payment of the 2017 Basic Payment Scheme.  This meant an increase from 50% to 70% in the rate for the BPS to those applicants whose applications were confirmed fully clear and 85% payment of our main Agri-environment scheme, GLAS.  Issuing of these payments commenced after 15 October.</p><p>Over &euro;1.2 billion in payments has issued to farmers over recent weeks, something that has significantly improved cash flow on these farms.</p><p>In order to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the issue of fodder availability, I recently convened a fodder group which is made up of all the main stakeholders including feed merchants and co-ops, banking, farm bodies etc  and the first meeting took place on Monday 11th December chaired by Teagasc.  The group's objective is to actively monitor the situation and to ensure co-ordinated expertise and guidance is available to all farmers impacted.</p><p>Arising from the meeting, Teagasc will begin a survey of fodder availability in the east and south of the country to ascertain what supplies are still available for purchase, across the country.</p><p>Exploring these avenues means my Department will be fully informed of the situation on the ground and the best possible advice will be provided to farmers re their options which may include sourcing alternative feed, reducing non breeding stock numbers and ensuring they carry out a fodder budget.</p><p>I will continue to actively monitor the situation in the impacted areas over the coming period.</p></reply>

Research indicates, for example, that the ban has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths in Dublin alone.  Residential burning of coal is a key source of air pollution and the ban on the use of smoky coal will, therefore, be extended nationwide from Autumn 2018 as part of the national Clean Air Strategy which will be published early in 2018. </p>  <p>  I am disposed towards allowing limited exemptions for the use of vintage tractor and locomotive engines, and this will be considered in the context of the regulations currently being drafted to implement the ban. </p></reply>

It is expected that the process of developing the new strategy statement will commence in 2018, with the new statement therefore commencing in 2019.

The necessary regulatory steps have been put in place to give effect to this measure.</p><p>It is worth noting that this measure is not &lsquo;new&rsquo; for about half of kerbside household waste customers, who are already on an incentivised usage pricing plan, i.e., a plan which contains a per lift or weight related fee. </p><p>As announced in mid-2017, mandatory per kilogramme 'pay by weight' charging is not being introduced. Allowing for a range of charging options, which encourage householders to reduce and separate their waste, provides flexibility to waste collectors to develop various service-price offerings that suit different household circumstances.  Consequently, a pure per kilogramme charge for waste collection may not be selected by some households. Instead, some households may use a &lsquo;per lift&rsquo; type charge or a &lsquo;weight allowance&rsquo; collection service.  </p><p>An annual support of &euro;75 will be introduced next year and made available for persons with lifelong or long-term medical incontinence.

The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector so that today over 67% of the 2.3m premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband.  This is set to increase to 77% (1.8m premises) by the end of 2018 and to 90% (2.1m premises) by the end of 2020.  In April I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at <i><font color="#2F2F2F">www.broadband.gov.ie.</font></i>This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan (NBP). </p><p>The Map is colour coded and searchable by address/eircode:</p><p>- The  AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process.</p><p>- The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.</p><p>- The Light BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to roll out high speed broadband to 300,000 premises by the end of 2018 as part of an Agreement signed with me in April.</p><p>In the absence of a specific eircode for the premises referenced by the Deputy, my Department&rsquo;s High Speed Broadband Map shows that there are 65 premises in the townland of Crohane (Ed Aghadoe), Co Kerry of which 21 premises fall within the AMBER area and will require State Intervention.  The remaining 44 premises fall within the LIGHT BLUE area and are to be covered by eir's planned rural deployment.  Individuals can check whether their premises is in an AMBER, BLUE or LIGHT BLUE area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie. </i>Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available from eir at  <i>http://fibrerollout.ie/eircode-lookup/. </i></p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area.  That procurement process is now at an advanced stage.  The &ldquo;Detailed Solutions&rdquo; submitted by two bidders on 26 September are being evaluated by the NBP specialist team.  The next stage in the procurement process is the receipt of final tenders followed by the appointment of a preferred bidder(s) and contract signature.  I recognise the importance of availability of high speed connectivity for all premises in Ireland and the frustration for communities that do not currently have access to this level of connectivity.  Delivering connectivity to the 542,000 premises (including the 21 premises in Crohane (Ed Aghadoe))  that fall within the State led intervention under the NBP remains a Government priority and my Department will engage with the winning bidder(s) to ensure the most efficient deployment as part of the contract.</p><p>As part of this procurement process, the bidder(s) will be required to submit their strategies, including timescales, for the network build and roll-out.  My Department will engage with the winning bidder(s) to ensure the most efficient deployment as part of the contract. </p><p>Any customer across Ireland who experiences difficulties with  lack of phone service in their area including the townland of Crohane, should raise the matter with the service provider in the first instance.  If this fails to resolve matters, customers can and should refer a complaint to ComReg, which will investigate the service provider's compliance with its contractual obligations. </p><p>However, notwithstanding the independence of ComReg, I recognise the frustration experienced across Ireland where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect.  In July 2016, I established the Mobile phone and Broadband Task force to identify how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the State led intervention under the NBP.  The work of the Mobile and Phone Broadband Task force will continue to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services.</p><p>Under this Task force, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

During the first eleven months of this year, &euro;4.1 million has been provided to support the purchase of 879 new electric vehicles.</p>  <p>  The grant scheme will continue into 2018 with 6 million euro allocated in the Department&rsquo;s budget for this purpose.  The scheme will kept under review in relation to funding and grant amounts for future years.</p>  <p>  The purchase grant scheme is demand led and it is therefore difficult to predict exactly how many vehicles will be supported in future years.  In May this year, the Government approved and published the National Policy Framework on Alternative Fuels Infrastructure for Transport in Ireland 2017 to 2030.  This policy framework sets an ambitious target that by 2030 all new cars and vans sold in Ireland will be zero emissions, or zero emissions capable. </p></reply>

This figure includes funding provided by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) of &euro;48.8m in respect of free TV licences issued under the Household Benefits Scheme and receipts from An Post for direct licence sales of &euro;149.2m.  The total receipts for 2017 will not be known until Q1 2018 when final sales figures for the year are available.  I am very much aware of the challenges that face the existing TV Licence system including the current level of evasion which is estimated to be 14.6%.  A number of diverse sources are used in calculating the evasion rate, including household data from the 2016 Census, business data from the Revenue Commissioner's Annual Report 2016 and the numbers qualifying for free licences from DEASP.  While the rate has fallen from 15.3% at the end of 2013, it is still very high and equates to a loss of &euro;40m per annum to public service broadcasting. </p>  <p>  To address this issue, my Department has been working with An Post and RT&Eacute; on an on-going basis to ensure that the TV licence collection system is working as effectively as possible.  Measures such as marketing campaigns, more evening and weekend inspection and appointment of additional temporary inspectors are just some of the initiatives that have been utilised to enhance sales and improve compliance rates. </p>  <p>  While these measures are important steps, I believe that the current system needs to be reformed.  As the Deputy will be aware, I obtained Government approval earlier this year to draft a number of legislative amendments to the Broadcasting Act 2009, including amendments for the tendering of TV Licence fee collection.  The proposed amendments are currently under Pre-Legislative Scrutiny by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment and I look forward to receiving the Committee's Report on the matter.</p>  <p>  In addition, I requested the Committee to examine the longer term issue of the future funding of public service media.  The Committee recently published their report on this issue.  My Department is currently examining the recommendations.</p></reply>

This capital increase is complemented by an increased current expenditure allocation that will allow the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) to support the expansion of our highly successful energy efficiency schemes bringing the total allocation for energy efficiency schemes to &euro;117m.</p>  <p>  Of the &euro;107m in capital funding, at this point I expect to allocate approximately &euro;84m to domestic energy efficiency programmes.  A full breakdown of these figures is not yet available pending announcements on the operation of individual SEAI schemes in 2018.  I have already announced that &euro;28m worth of grants will be awarded under the Better Energy Communities scheme, and applications for this scheme are already open.</p>  <p>  These figures will be confirmed in the Revised Estimates for Public Services, which I understand will be published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform later this month.</p></reply>

It also commits that no measures will be taken to prevent the future reactivation of the Western Rail Corridor for rail use.</p>  <p>  The costing and review has not been undertaken but the Deputy will be aware that a number of wider processes underway that are being advanced first as they are highly relevant to the general rail environment.</p>  <p>  Firstly, around this time last year, the National Transport Authority (NTA) held a public consultation process to start a national debate on the current and future role of rail transport in Ireland.  The public consultation process was launched with the publication of the Rail Review Report 2016, which examined the funding required to support the heavy rail network now and into the future, together with a consultation document "The Role of Rail in Ireland and Funding its Delivery".  Over 300 submissions were received by the NTA in response to that consultation process which have now all been examined and the NTA has submitted a report of those submissions which - when updated to reflect the increased Exchequer funding now being made available for rail services and infrastructure - I intend to bring to Government, and expect to be published shortly thereafter.</p>  <p>  Secondly, on a broader front, the Government is at an advanced stage on the finalisation of the National Planning Framework which has been developed under the leadership of my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Once agreed by Government, the approach which that Framework adopts toward land-use planning and settlement patterns for the country will have significant impacts on the potential of rail and other transport infrastructure and services into the future.</p></reply>

A submission is being prepared for the European Commission for a revision of the TEN-T Core Network, which would seek to facilitate consideration of transport-related project proposals for funding under the Connecting Europe Facility for transport in the Western Arc region.  The submission will also take into account the implications of Brexit on western and northwest regions.</p>  <p>  My officials met the European Commissioner for Transport, Ms Violeta Bulc, and her officials in October 2017 in relation to transport issues, including the potential impacts of Brexit on Ireland&rsquo;s connectivity and increased geographical isolation in the EU.  In that context, my officials informed the Commissioner that a submission will be forthcoming.  My officials also separately met with the Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport (DG MOVE) last month and briefed DG Move on the Government&rsquo;s commitment and on the pending submission.  DG Move advised that the submission would be considered on receipt but did not see that the Western Arc would meet the criteria for the Core Network. However, it noted that under the Regulation, a review of the implementation of the core network will take place by end 2023.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the local authority's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  The Capital Plan published in September 2015 outlined proposed transport investment priorities to 2022.  The transport element of the plan was framed by the conclusions reached in my Department's Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport.  This report highlighted the importance of maintenance and renewal of transport infrastructure together with targeted investments to address particular bottlenecks and critical safety issues.  The bulk of the funding allocated under the Capital Plan and the increased funding allocated under the Capital Plan Review is earmarked for the maintenance and strengthening of the existing extensive network throughout the country together with some targeted road improvement projects. </p>  <p>  The Plan provides for the phased increase in capital funding and in this context 2018 will see a significant increase in funding for regional and local roads.  Capital expenditure for 2016 and the allocation for 2017 is included in the Regional and Local Road payment and allocation booklets which are available in the D&aacute;il Library.  The expenditure figure for 2016 of &euro;331.5 million includes the extra funding allocated by Government to assist local authorities with road repairs resulting from damage caused by severe weather in late 2015 and early 2016.  It is envisaged that the 2017 allocation of &euro;280.6 million will increase by about &euro;100 million (including &euro;10 million to assist Donegal County Council with road repairs caused by the severe weather in August 2017) in 2018.</p></reply>

Flowing from that review I am committed to enhancing interventions to address the main killer behaviours on our roads, with stricter penalties for non-compliance and targeted visible enforcement.</p>  <p>  In that context, I am delighted by the announcement that the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to roads policing will increase by 10% to the end of 2017, and a further 10% next year.  I believe that robust enforcement of the road traffic laws is key to reducing road deaths.</p>  <p>  However, every death is one too many, and we must continue our efforts to reduce the number of people killed on our roads.  Regrettably, the four main causes of road deaths remain speeding, drink driving, using a mobile phone and not wearing a seatbelt, so all road users must take personal responsibility for our behaviour in order to make the road safer for all users.</p></reply>

By the closing date, a record number of 2,320 applications seeking &euro;155 million in grants were received.  When the programme was launched, it was envisaged that &euro;30m would be available which would have made the allocation of grants particularly challenging.  Following the conclusion of the budget discussions and in order to allow as many worthwhile projects as possible to receive some funding, significant extra resources were secured to allocate under the round.</p>  <p>  The allocations in respect of all local applications were announced on Thursday 30th November and full details of these allocations are available on my Department's website.  The priority in the medium term will be on advancing these projects.  A decision on the timing of the next round of the programme will be taken next year and all clubs and sports organisations registered with my Department will be informed at the time.</p></reply>

No provision was made for LIS in 2012. Since 2013 local authorities have had the option of using a proportion of their Discretionary Grant for LIS should they wish to do so.  The decision on whether to allocate funding for LIS and the management of the allocation process has been a matter for each local authority.</p>  <p>  Details of LIS allocations before 2012 are included in the Regional and Local Road Grant Payment booklets which are available in the D&aacute;il Library.</p>  <p>  Minister Ring's Department is now taking the lead regarding the LIS having  launched a scheme in September 2017 and I understand further funding will be allocated by that Department in 2018.</p></reply>

CSIG includes senior officials from the Department of Education and Skills, National Council for Special Education, National Disability Authority, City/Community Childcare Committees, Pobal and representatives of parents of children with disabilities and Early Years providers.</p><p>I will publish details of the consultation when available and am committed to having it completed by mid 2018.</p><p>The decision on a pause in the change to the scheme as against a reversal will be made in the context of the outcome of the consultation exercise.  In this regard however I feel it is worthwhile to set out the original rationale for the decision.  Overage exemptions were introduced at the onset of the ECCE programme.  At that time only operated for a 38 week period, or one programme year.  For some children with special/additional needs, attending preschool five days a week was not feasible and so therefore an allowance was made.  Their ECCE place was split over 2 years, e.g. a child may have availed of 3 days ECCE provision in year one and 2 days in year 2.  In order to facilitate this, in the cases where the child would have been overage for ECCE in the latter year, an overage exemption was approved.  This provision of an overage exemption by the DCYA for the ECCE programme was never intended as a mechanism to delay a child&rsquo;s entry to primary education.  Given the extension of the ECCE programme in 2016/2017, the further extension of the Programme to two full years from September 2018, and the introduction of AIM in June 2016, it became clear that standard ECCE entitlement had surpassed the initial premise for provision of an overage exemption from the upper age limit.</p><p>AIM is a model of supports designed to ensure that children with disabilities can access the early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  The AIM Early Years Specialists will work with the parents (and guardians), providers, Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) and others (as appropriate) to support the child&rsquo;s transition to primary school.  Any concerns with regard to a child's transition to primary school should be referred to the Better Start Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) application process.  Parents, guardians and providers are advised to engage with the AIM process where a concern in relations to a child's transition to primary school is identified.  More detailed information on AIM can be found at <i>www.preschoolaccess.ie.</i>The Department of Education and Skill (DES) also provides for the education of children with special educational needs through a number of support mechanisms, depending on the child's assessed disability.</p><p>As regards long term plans for the ECCE scheme, the further enhancements announced as part of Budget 2018 meet the commitment in the Programme for Government to provide a full two year programme to all children.  Any further alterations to the scheme will be considered in the context of future Estimates processes and, critically, an assessment of what is in the best interests of children.  The consultation to take place around overage exemptions will, of course, form part of the ongoing assessment.</p></reply>

This is the responsibility of the Commissioner of Valuation.  The Valuation Office falls under the aegis of the Department of Justice and Equality. </p>  <p>  The Valuation Act, 2001 as amended by the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 provides that all buildings used or developed for any purpose, including constructions affixed thereto, are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the Act.  Under Schedule 4, paragraph 22, community childcare facilities are exempt from commercial rates, by virtue of the fact that they operate on a not-for-profit basis.  The Valuations Office have also advised that, under Schedule 4 paragraph 10, facilities who provide the Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme (ECCE) only are exempt from commercial rates.</p>  <p>  Officials from the Department met with officials from the Department of Justice and Equality to discuss the issue of commercial rates for childcare providers.  At this meeting it was reiterated that properties of occupiers that operate with the intention of making a profit are rateable, and that this applies to private childcare facilities.  </p>  <p>  It is my understanding that there are a number of avenues of redress for an occupier of rateable property who is dissatisfied with a determination of valuation made under the provisions of the Valuation Acts, 2001-2015.  However, as noted earlier any issues concerning commercial rates do not fall under the remit of this Department.  I would advise those with concerns to contact the Valuations Office who would be better placed to advise in this regard.</p></reply>

In 2017, Tusla allocated &euro;13.51m to the programme.  In addition, supplementary once off funding of &euro;2.120m has been allocated recently to centres for minor works, including the purchase of equipment.  In 2018, I am pleased to advise the Deputy that an additional &euro;3.0m is being allocated to the programme, increasing the base budget to approximately &euro;16.5m.</p><p>I understand that the Deputy is seeking additional information relating to the individual allocation provided to each Family Resource Centre in 2017, as well as the projected budget for each centre in 2018.</p><p>I have asked Tusla to supply such information to the Deputy, as soon as it is available.</p></reply>

This funding provides a contribution towards the running costs of centres. </p><p>In 2018, I am providing Tusla with additional funding of almost &euro;3.0m for the Family Resource Centre Programme.  This will allow for at least 11 new centres to be included in the Programme and also provides for increases in funding to existing centres next year.</p><p>I am doing this in recognition of the importance of early intervention and prevention in assisting vulnerable children and families in our local communities.</p><p>Tusla has put an application process in place for organisations seeking to join the Family Resource Centre programme.  The closing date for applications is 20 December 2017.  The application form is available on the Tusla website <i>www.tusla.ie .</i></p><p>Decisions by Tusla in relation to the funding of individual centres will have regard to the location, size and catchment area of each centre.  The process will be equitable and transparent.  All decisions will be made to ensure that available resources are applied to improving outcomes for children and families nationally in the most efficient, effective, equitable, proportionate and sustainable way.  Tusla will also consider Area Commissioning Plans, Children and Young People's Service Committee plans, and other available evidence, to ensure that the allocated funding targets those children and families that are most in need.</p><p>Tusla intends to announce the results of the process by the end of Quarter 1, 2018.</p><p>In conclusion, I would like to acknowledge the valuable work of Family Resource Centres.  I am pleased that I have secured additional resources to support them in their work with vulnerable children and families in our local communities.</p></reply>

An open case is one which is assessed as needing a dedicated (allocated) social work service.  There were 5,284 unallocated cases, of which  966 were high priority cases, 3,309 were medium priority, and 1,009 were low priority.  Cases awaiting allocation include new referrals, cases already in progress, and children in care.  </p><p>I am informed by Tusla that a case awaiting allocation may be listed as 'active' on a 'duty' system.  This means that there are actions being undertaken by a dedicated duty team, or rotating social workers on a duty roster to progress the protection and welfare of the child.  </p><p>Examples of actions being undertaken include telephone calls relating to the concern, visits to see the child, completing initial assessments and, where a child is in care, completing child in care reviews or plans.  There are 28% of unallocated cases categorised as 'active on duty'.  </p><p>Tusla has provided the information in Table 1 below on the number of cases awaiting allocation to a social worker in each administrative area.  Tusla has informed me that the average length of time cases are waiting is not collated nationally but rather by the number of cases waiting in time bands.  Information on waiting times is provided in bands of less than 3 months, and greater than 3 months.  In Table 2 the number of cases waiting less than 3 months and over 3 months for each priority level i.e., high, medium and low is given. </p><p>Addressing the number of children who are awaiting the allocation of a social worker is a priority for me.  The Deputy should note that all urgent and emergency cases notified to Tusla are dealt with immediately.  Urgent and emergency cases could involve cases of abandonment, allegations of physical or sexual abuse, parental ill-health leading to the need for an immediate placement, or threat to the safety or life of a child by a third party.  I have secured funds in Budget 2018 which will allow Tusla to carry out the third year of a 3 year plan to provide for the allocation of a dedicated social worker to all children who need one.  </p><p>My Department will continue to closely monitor progress in this regard, and I will continue to engage directly with the Tusla Board and Senior Management Team to review progress.  </p><p><b>Cases awaiting allocation to a social worker September 2017 - numbers and priority level (Child protection &amp;amp; welfare and children in care)</b><table><tr><th>Area</th><th>Total Cases awaiting allocation</th><th>High Priority awaiting allocation</th><th>High Priority awaiting allocation less than 3 months</th><th>High Priority awaiting allocation more than 3 months</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin South East/Wicklow</td><td>113</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin South West/Kildare/West Wicklow</td><td>934</td><td>260</td><td>32</td><td>228</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin South Central</td><td>281</td><td>190</td><td>190</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td>282</td><td>56</td><td>46</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin North City</td><td>360</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin North</td><td>384</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Louth/Meath</td><td>272</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan/Monaghan</td><td>245</td><td>10</td><td>0</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>82</td><td>11</td><td>11</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>494</td><td>80</td><td>77</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow/Kilkenny/South Tipperary</td><td>355</td><td>23</td><td>23</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford/Wexford</td><td>306</td><td>99</td><td>79</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>638</td><td>86</td><td>38</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo/Leitrim/West Cavan</td><td>43</td><td>7</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Galway/Roscommon</td><td>224</td><td>40</td><td>22</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Midwest</td><td>271</td><td>92</td><td>85</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Total Cases</td><td>5,284</td><td>966</td><td>609</td><td>357</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Cases awaiting allocation to a social worker September 2017 - waiting times by priority level (Child protection &amp;amp; welfare and children in care)</b><table><tr><th>Area</th><th>High Priority waiting &amp;lt;3 months</th><th>High Priority waiting &amp;gt;3 months</th><th>Medium Priority waiting &amp;lt;3 months</th><th>Medium Priority waiting &amp;gt;3 months</th><th>Low Priority waiting &amp;lt;3 months</th><th>Low Priority waiting &amp;gt;3 months</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin South East/Wicklow</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>60</td><td>36</td><td>6</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin South West/Kildare/West Wicklow</td><td>32</td><td>228</td><td>127</td><td>488</td><td>6</td><td>53</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin South Central</td><td>190</td><td>0</td><td>22</td><td>18</td><td>39</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td>46</td><td>10</td><td>118</td><td>74</td><td>26</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin North City</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>134</td><td>84</td><td>51</td><td>91</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin North</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>37</td><td>114</td><td>81</td><td>149</td></tr><tr><td>Louth/Meath</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>111</td><td>121</td><td>19</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan/Monaghan</td><td>0</td><td>10</td><td>44</td><td>130</td><td>29</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>11</td><td>0</td><td>7</td><td>31</td><td>26</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>77</td><td>3</td><td>270</td><td>81</td><td>35</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow/Kilkenny/South Tipperary</td><td>23</td><td>0</td><td>279</td><td>0</td><td>53</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford/Wexford</td><td>79</td><td>20</td><td>153</td><td>34</td><td>13</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>38</td><td>48</td><td>197</td><td>255</td><td>28</td><td>72</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo/Leitrim/West Cavan</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>27</td><td>2</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Galway/Roscommon</td><td>22</td><td>18</td><td>119</td><td>52</td><td>5</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Midwest</td><td>85</td><td>7</td><td>63</td><td>22</td><td>17</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>Total Cases</td><td>609</td><td>357</td><td>1,742</td><td>1,567</td><td>436</td><td>573 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

My Department has requested the carry-over of &euro;7.7 million in unspent Capital allocations from 2017 to 2018.  </p>  <p>  Capital underspends have arisen on some of my Department&rsquo;s rural development schemes, given that these schemes are relatively new, as in the case of the Town and Village Renewal scheme.  In the case of the LEADER programme, and in line with LEADER programmes in other EU Member States, there has been a lead-in period in the ramping up and implementation of the 2014-2020 programme as the LEADER Local Action Groups (LAGs) developed their Local Development Strategies, formalised their internal processes and procedures, and worked with potential project promoters to develop applications.  However, the level of LEADER activity in Ireland has increased substantially in recent months.  Over 550 LEADER projects, with a value of &euro;14.6 million, have now been approved by the LAGs and I expect the level of approvals and expenditure to grow rapidly in 2018.  </p></reply>

These include the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, the Outdoor/Rural Recreation Infrastructure Scheme, the CL&Aacute;R Programme and the Local Improvement Scheme (LIS).  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that apart from the LIS, the rural development schemes are expected to operate over a 12-15 month period.  Therefore, it was always anticipated that a portion of the funds allocated would be drawn-down in 2018, but only when the draw-down conditions are met, including the full completion of works which is required for final payments to be issued.  </p>  <p>  In the case of the LIS, funding can be drawn down on certification by a Local Authority that 50% of their works have been completed and that all works will be fully completed by 31st December 2017.  In addition to Local Authority certification and desk-based checks by my officials, my Department's Inspection Services have completed on-the-spot verification checks on LIS roads in a number of counties and were able to verify that works had been completed to the level certified.  Further inspection and audit will be carried out early in 2018 to ensure that all works are fully completed.  </p>  <p>  In the case of the Outdoor Rural Recreation Infrastructure scheme, the Town and Village Renewal scheme and the CL&Aacute;R programme, Local Authorities are required to spend at least 20% of the total project cost before the first tranche payment of 50% of their allocation under the respective scheme can be drawn-down.  The balance of funding will only be paid on full completion of the projects in question.  </p>  <p>  The release of the initial tranche of funding is also subject to satisfactory progress being demonstrated in respect of the 2016 schemes, where such funding was provided to the Local Authorities.  </p>  <p>  Aside from these schemes, I have allocated &euro;1.4 million this year to support TidyTown Committees throughout the country to mark the 60th anniversary of the competition in 2018; this funding is being distributed through Pobal.  I have also allocated &euro;812,000 to the Irish Shows Association by way of sponsorship of local agricultural shows in 2018.  </p>  <p>  Prior to the establishment of my Department, sanction was sought by the former Departments of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, to make advance payments in relation to a number of schemes operating under the community and/or voluntary sectors, and to fund Pobal in its management and oversight of programmes on behalf of the Department.  Advance payments of this nature are necessary to allow community-based projects to proceed, or for essential services to be provided.  They are, however, are subject to appropriate monitoring, reporting and control procedures.  </p></reply>

The concept was proposed in February 2016 by a group involving a number of Chambers of Commerce in the Western region and the American Chambers of Commerce of Ireland.  </p><p>The overarching objective of the Atlantic Economic Corridor concept is to maximise the assets of the western region, from Kerry to Donegal, and connect the economic hubs, clusters and catchments of the region to attract investment, support job creation and contribute to an improved quality of life for those who live in the region.  </p><p>I established an Atlantic Economic Corridor Taskforce in March 2017 to progress the proposal.  The Taskforce includes senior representatives from the business sector, key Government Departments and other public bodies, and third level institutions. </p><p>The role of the Taskforce, inter alia, is to:</p><p>- Develop a common understanding of the AEC concept.</p><p>- Provide a platform for engagement between stakeholders from the private sector, the public sector, third Level institutions and the wider community to consider how best an economic corridor can be created to maximise the potential of the region and to ensure a co-ordinated approach.</p><p>- Oversee and support an sub-group structure to progress specific objectives.  </p><p>- Conduct an analysis of the potential of the region and the issues that need to be addressed to maximise that potential.  </p><p>- Work with relevant bodies and agencies to identify infrastructural and other priorities which could help to support the economic development of the AEC region. </p><p>- Identify short-to-medium-term actions which can be taken to achieve the longer-term goals of the Atlantic Economic Corridor which will be consistent with the National Planning Framework.  </p><p>The Taskforce has met four times since it was established and will continue to meet on a regular basis.  A number of sub-groups of the Taskforce have also been established to progress specific aspects of the overall proposal.  </p><p>The Atlantic Economic Corridor has the potential to contribute to effective regional development in the context of the forthcoming National Planning Framework.  The development of the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies, which are provided for in the draft National Planning Framework, will also be important tools for further embedding the concept at both regional and national level.  </p></reply>

However, based on their stakeholder interviews, UL found that zero hour contracts within the meaning of Section 18 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 are not extensively used in Ireland.  Through the stakeholder interviews, UL also found evidence of &ldquo;if and when&rdquo; contracts and variations of such contracts, e.g. some contracts where all hours are on an &ldquo;if and when&rdquo; basis, while other hybrid contracts provide a minimum number of guaranteed hours with any additional hours provided on an &ldquo;if and when&rdquo; basis.  However, UL could not quantify the numbers of people employed on such contracts from existing data sources.

One of the exceptions to this is that PRSI is not chargeable on any social welfare payment.  Farm assist is a means tested social assistance payment available to farmers on low income.  Accordingly it is not subject to PRSI.   </p>  <p>  Farmers on low income may be required to pay PRSI on their self-employed income from farming.  Self-employed farmers in receipt of farm assist are liable to pay PRSI at the class S rate of 4% on their self-employed income from farming, provided that income exceeds &euro;5,000 in a contribution year.  </p>  <p>  Self-employed Class S contributors have access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, paternity benefit treatment benefits and, from December 2017, invalidity pension.  </p>  <p>  If income from self-employment, including income from farming, falls below &euro;5,000 in a contribution year, he or she may opt to pay voluntary contributions.  To become a voluntary contributor a person must:</p>  <p>  - have paid at least 520 weeks PRSI in either employment or self-employment;</p>  <p>  - apply within 60 months (5 years) after the end of the contribution year during which they last paid compulsory insurance or during which they were last awarded a credited contribution.  In very exceptional circumstances this period may be extended at the discretion of the Minister.</p>  <p>  The annual voluntary contribution charge for the self-employed is a special flat rate payment of &euro;500.  The payment of voluntary contributions allows the self-employed to maintain their PRSI record for the purposes of State pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s contributory pension and guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory).</p></reply>

This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit and paternity benefit.     </p>  <p>  Since March 2017, the self-employed have access to the treatment benefit scheme which includes free eye and dental examinations, and contributions towards the cost of hearing aids.  Treatment benefit entitlements were also extended from October 2017 so as to provide further dental and optical benefits. </p>  <p>  Even more significantly, self-employed contributors are now eligible for the invalidity pension from December 2017.  For the first time, this gives the self-employed access to the safety net of State income supports if they become permanently incapable of work as a result of an illness or disability without having to go through a means test.  </p>  <p>  Invalidity pension (IP) is a payment for people who are permanently incapable of work because of illness or incapacity and who satisfy the pay-related social insurance (PRSI) contribution conditions.  </p>  <p>  The PRSI contribution conditions are that the person must have at least 260 (5 years) paid contributions since entering social insurance and 48 contributions paid or credited in the last 2 complete contribution years before the date of their claim.  PRSI classes A, E H and, since December 2017, S contributions are reckonable for IP purposes. </p>  <p>  To date there is no record of receipt of a claim for IP from the person in question.  Entitlement to IP can only be definitively determined on receipt of a completed claim form.</p>  <p>  Persons who have an insufficient employment/PRSI record to qualify for a social insurance benefit/pension may apply for the appropriate means-tested social assistance scheme.  For example, persons between the ages of 16 and 66 who are suffering from an illness or disability may, subject to satisfying the qualifying conditions, qualify for disability allowance (DA). </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the deputy.</p></reply>

In determining eligibility, no means test is involved. </p>  <p>  For those who cannot earn a living because of sickness and/or disability, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) provides a range of income support payments.  These schemes also provide access to supports that encourage and assist people on long-term illness and disability payments to identify and take up available employment, training, educational and other self-development opportunities, where this is appropriate to their circumstances and wishes.  </p>  <p>  People with disabilities who are not in receipt of an income support payment can voluntarily avail of the Department&rsquo;s Intreo service, where they can obtain advice on job-search activities and the use of online job search tools.  In addition, those who are not in receipt of qualifying payments may be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities, for example, through Education and Training Boards&rsquo; (ETBs) training courses.  Moreover, Springboard and Skillnets courses for unemployed people, funded through the Department of Education and Skills, are also open to people regardless of their social welfare status.  I understand that Solas also funds customised training for people with disabilities provided by a range of specialist training providers.</p>  <p>  In addition to these options, the Department provides a range of supports to assist people with disabilities to get a job.  These include a job coaching service provided through EmployAbility, employment subsidies through the Wage Subsidy Scheme, workplace adaptation grants and specialist training courses that are specially designed for people with disabilities through the Reasonable Accommodation Fund.  People with disabilities do not need to be in receipt of a DEASP income support payment to avail of these supports but do require supporting evidence from a medical practitioner to determine eligibility.</p>  <p>  In summary, the Government is committed to supporting as many people as possible to participate more fully in employment and to become more self-sufficient by providing supports that address barriers they may encounter in finding and sustaining employment. </p></reply>

The Action Plan for Jobs supports continuing strong economic recovery and employment growth.  Policies and actions to ensure that unemployed people benefit from the increase in employment are set out in the strategy paper Pathways to Work 2016-2020. </p><p>To date, these policies have been effective in reducing long-term unemployment.  </p><p>For example, the most recent data show that the rate of long-term unemployment in Ireland has fallen from a peak of 9.5% in 2012 to 3.1%, Q2 2017.</p><p>Long-term unemployment can be expected to fall further this year and next in line with the continuing forecast fall in overall unemployment. </p><p>Policy continues to focus on support for the long-term unemployed.  For example, the Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy prioritises long-term unemployed people &ndash; most notably through the roll-out of JobPath to engage more systematically with this group; through targeted wage subsidies under JobsPlus; and through reserved places for long-term unemployed jobseekers on employment and training programmes.  </p><p>The out-turn for 2016 and the budget allocations for 2017 and 2018 for the main programmes impacting on the long-term unemployed, provided by the Department of Employment and Social Affairs, is given in Table 1.  While not all participants in these programmes are necessarily <i>long-term</i>unemployed prior to taking up places, this is the case for the vast majority of participants on Community Employment, T&uacute;s, Gateway, and JobsPlus, and for a significant proportion of the participants on the remaining schemes.</p><p>Table 1 Activation Measure Funding.<table><tr><th>Activation Measure</th><th>2016  <br /><br />&euro;000</th><th>2017 <br /><br /> &euro;000</th><th>2018 <br /><br /> &euro;000</th></tr><tr><td>COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMME </td><td><div>356,341</div></td><td><div>353,000</div></td><td><div>350,530</div></td></tr><tr><td>T&Uacute;S</td><td><div>118,604</div></td><td><div>124,820</div></td><td><div>100,100</div></td></tr><tr><td>BACK TO WORK ENTERPRISE ALLOWANCE </td><td><div>124,383</div></td><td><div>119,560</div></td><td><div>101,680</div></td></tr><tr><td>JOBBRIDGE </td><td><div>37,793</div></td><td><div>15,000</div></td><td><div>1,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>BACK TO EDUCATION ALLOWANCE</td><td><div>114,829</div></td><td><div>105,000</div></td><td><div>72,950</div></td></tr><tr><td>GATEWAY</td><td><div>21,183</div></td><td><div>7,250</div></td><td><div>470</div></td></tr><tr><td>JOBSPLUS</td><td><div>23,679</div></td><td><div>20,400</div></td><td><div>30,000</div></td></tr></table></p><p>The number of activation places on these programmes in 2016 and 2017 is given in Table 2: </p><p>Table 2<table><tr><th>Activation Measure Places</th><th><div>2016</div></th><th><div>2017</div></th></tr><tr><td>Community Employment (excluding supervisors) *</td><td><div>22040</div></td><td><div>21670</div></td></tr><tr><td>TUS - community work placement initiative *</td><td><div>7419</div></td><td><div>6359</div></td></tr><tr><td>Back to work enterprise allowance *</td><td><div>11077</div></td><td><div>10017</div></td></tr><tr><td>JobBridge *</td><td><div>3390</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Gateway *</td><td><div>839</div></td><td><div>67</div></td></tr><tr><td>Jobplus ~</td><td><div>8422</div></td><td><div>8624</div></td></tr><tr><td>* Number of participants November</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>~Number of persons for which a payment was made during the year 2016 and year-to-date 2017.</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The programme is targeted at young unemployed people aged 18-24 who face significant barriers in their efforts to gain employment &ndash; people who even during the Celtic Tiger period would have found it difficult to get a foothold on the career ladder.</p><p>Host organisations are encouraged to provide them with the opportunity to learn and develop basic work and social skills in a supportive environment while on a work placement. </p><p>The programme is entirely voluntary.  The standard duration of a placement is three months, with an option to extend to six or nine months.  Participants receive an allowance equivalent to their underlying social welfare payment plus an additional top-up allowance of &euro;52.50 per week as a contribution towards expenses arising from their participation on the programme. Participants are supported by a by a mentor assigned by the Host Organisation and dedicated case worker from the Department and. </p><p>The programme is open to organisations in private, public, and voluntary and community sectors.  There are currently 75 participants on the programme - 67 on placements in the private and community/voluntary sector, and 8 in the public sector.</p><p>Host Organisations are required to agree Terms and Conditions and agree a Standard Agreement with the participant outlining the intended learning outcomes and the terms and conditions of the placement.  Comprehensive guidelines are available on the Department&rsquo;s website at . </p><p>First Steps is now closed to new applications to facilitate an orderly wind down of the programme in preparation for the introduction of the new Youth Employment Support Scheme in Quarter 2, 2018.  Participants on the new programme will receive a payment equivalent to the net minimum wage for the hours of attendance.</p><p>The National Minimum Wage, currently &euro;9.25 per hour, will increase to &euro;9.55 per hour from 1 January 2018.  Figures released by the Central Statistics Office in April 2017, based on questions relating to the National Minimum Wage (NMW) included in the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) in Quarters 2, 3 and 4 2016, indicate that an average of approximately 155,100 employees reported earning NMW or less for each of the three quarters from Quarter 2 to Quarter 4 in 2016.  This represents approximately one in ten employees.  The CSO suggest that some caution is advised in comparing these results to data collected directly from business enterprises in that this is self-reported income.  ESRI research, based on 2014 and 2015 (latest available) Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) data, showed the incidence of employees on the NMW at 5.1 and 5.5 percent respectively (based on the then NMW of &euro;8.65).These figures represent approximately one in twenty employees.</p></reply>

This compares with the most recent available EU figure (from EUROSTAT) of 18.6% as at October 2017.</p>  <p>  Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, the rate of youth unemployment has fallen sharply from a peak of over 31.1% in 2012.  At that time, the EU youth unemployment rate was 23.1%. Irish youth unemployment has thus fallen from well above the EU average in 2012 to significantly below the average at the end of 2017.</p>  <p>  While this improvement is welcome, the Government recognises the importance of a continued focus on measures to facilitate young unemployed people find and sustain employment. </p>  <p>  The key objective of Ireland&rsquo;s policy response to the EU Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee is to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  In this regard there is monthly engagement by case officers with young people to assist them to prepare, review and, if appropriate, revise personal progression plans.  Where young people do not find work relatively quickly, additional supports may be offered, both through reserved places on existing employment and training schemes and through youth-specific measures.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s.  Pathways to Work 2016-2020 continues to prioritise these measures for the young unemployed and further commits to a number of additional measures.</p>  <p>  I am confident these measures, and continuing economic recovery, will support further reductions in youth unemployment and add to the substantial improvements that have already been seen over the last few years. </p></reply>

Subject to the provisions of social welfare legislation, the 26-week period of core statutory maternity leave attracts a social insurance payment of maternity benefit.  </p><p>On 3 October 2017 I, together with Minister Flanagan announced increased maternity leave and maternity benefit for mothers whose babies are born prematurely on or after 1 October.</p><p>The Government decided that the additional maternity leave and benefit would be available for mothers of premature babies born on or after 1 October 2017. There are no plans to extend the new arrangements to mothers of premature babies born before that date or to introduce an additional reduced rate payment in respect of premature babies born before that date.</p><p>The additional period will commence at the end of the standard 26 week period of paid maternity leave. The extended period to be added will be the number of weeks from the baby's actual date of birth up to two weeks before the expected date of confinement which would have been the 37th week of the pregnancy, at which point the current entitlement to 26 weeks leave and benefit would normally begin.</p><p>A mother can also take a further 16 weeks unpaid maternity leave which must be taken immediately after the end of her paid maternity leave.This period is not covered by maternity benefit but a mother is entitled to a credited social insurance contribution for each week of unpaid leave that is taken (up to the maximum of 16). </p><p>Legislation currently allows for the postponement of maternity leave and maternity benefit for up to six months with the employer&rsquo;s agreement in cases where the child is hospitalised. In these cases entitlement to maternity leave and benefit continues after the period of postponement for a maximum of twelve weeks. </p><p>Eligible parents can also avail of two weeks paid paternity leave at any time within the first 26 weeks following the birth or date of placement of the child.  Paternity benefit is available for employed and self-employed people who are on from work and covered by contributions.  Paternity leave and paternity benefit can also be postponed for up to six months in cases where the child is hospitalised. </p><p>Parents also have an entitlement to parental leave which is unpaid.  Since 8 March 2013 the amount of parental leave available for each child amounts to a total of 18 working weeks per child.  Both parents have an equal separate entitlement to parental leave.</p><p>I have no plans for further changes to the maternity benefit provisions at present.</p></reply>

All of the mapped sites can be viewed at the following link: .</p><p>In the context of his new role in driving and co-ordinating housing delivery, my colleague, Minister of State Damien English, will chair the State Land Management and Development Group, whose key role will be to drive delivery of housing from the local authority and broader State land bank.

Until such time as the Council secures ownership and control of the site, the question of its transfer to a third party does not arise. </p></reply>

This Section places a statutory duty on organisers of funfairs and owners of fairground equipment to take such care as is reasonable for ensuring that persons at a funfair do not suffer injury or damage by reason of dangers arising from the funfair or associated activities. </p>  <p>  For the purposes of Section 239 of the Act, "funfair&rdquo; means an entertainment where fairground equipment is used, while &lsquo;&lsquo;fairground equipment&rsquo;&rsquo; includes any fairground ride or any similar equipment which is designed to be in motion for entertainment purposes with members of the public on or inside it, any equipment which is designed to be used by members of the public for entertainment purposes either as a slide or for bouncing upon, and any swings, dodgems and other equipment which is designed to be in motion wholly or partly under the control of, or to be put in motion by, a member of the public or any equipment which may be prescribed, in the interests of public safety.  This legislation does not prescribe activity parks such as bike parks as falling within its definition.</p>  <p>  My Department commenced an internal review process on the issue of safety at funfairs/ fairground equipment earlier this year.  The review of the aspects of legislation relating to regulation of fairground equipment and funfairs in section 239 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, particularly in respect of the specific legislative provisions relating to fairground equipment, is on-going and includes an examination of international practice in the area of regulating public safety.  The drafting of the review report has commenced and further engagement with relevant stakeholders is on-going as part of the process of clarifying issues and preparing the report's conclusions and recommendations.

Considerable work has been carried out by the Department in developing a draft framework for a harmonisation of the approach to be taken by local authorities in regard to various aspects of rent schemes. This work is now being examined further in the light of the broader commitment given in the <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i> Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, to review the disparate systems of differential rent for social housing in place across local authorities. The review will be completed by the end of Q2 2017.

This was particularly relevant in the case of Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). However, amendments made to the Household Budget scheme have greatly assisted in the efficient collection of rents from such households, relieving the urgency of the requirement to introduce a direct deduction service.

Under the terms of the NTICI, which was underpinned by &euro;10m in funding, developments subject to valid taking-in-charge applications were eligible for inclusion in the call for funding proposals under Circular FPS3/2016 (available at the following link: <i>).</i></p><p>My Department established a Steering Group to oversee the initiative including funding allocations.  The Steering Group selected the following seven local authorities for demonstration projects - Cork, Clare, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Tipperary and Wexford - as these represented about 70% of problematic housing estates nationwide served by Developer Provided Infrastructure (DPI). </p><p>A total of &euro;7.7 million of the allocated funding was paid to local authorities in respect of 330 developments, containing some 13,400 units.  </p><p>While the NTICI was not intended as a rolling funding programme for taking estates in charge but provided instead a focused examination of the issues involved, building on the lessons learned through this programme, I expect that the Initiative will contribute to further streamlining of the taking-in-charge process, through for example synergies with capital works by Irish Water.  In addition, the outcome of the Mid-Term Review of the Capital Plan provides for an additional &euro;25m funding to be provided for addressing legacy issues in relation to lead pipe remediation and developer provided infrastructure, details of which will be announced in due course.</p><p>A report on the 2016 NTICI is currently being finalised by my Department which will help to inform future taking-in-charge plans.  It is envisaged that the report will be published in Q1 2018.</p><p>As Monaghan was not one of the local authorities selected to pilot new approaches to speed up the taking-in-charge process under the NTICI, funding was not available under the NTICI in this case. Nevertheless, publication of the NTICI report in Q1 2018 will be of value to local authorities and other stakeholders in applying the lessons from the pilot authorities in a more general roll-out of a streamlined approach to taking in charge.</p></reply>

The Review, available at the following link: , explored the impediments to participation in the scheme and recommended a number of actions to make the scheme work better for borrowers.  </p><p>The table below gives a breakdown of MTR applications received each month during the period 1 January to 30 November 2017.  The changes to the MTR eligibility criteria and other process changes came into effect on 27 March 2017 and therefore applications received from April onwards should be regarded as applications submitted under the revised MTR scheme.  One of the changes to the MTR process is that the borrower must be approved by their local authority for social housing support prior to the submission of a completed MTR application to the Housing Agency.  This process change may have impacted the number of MTR applications received by the Housing Agency in the initial months subsequent to the implementation of the process changes arising from the review recommendations.<table><tr><th>2017</th><th>Number of MTR applications received</th></tr><tr><td>January </td><td>47</td></tr><tr><td>February </td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>March </td><td>36</td></tr><tr><td>April </td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>May </td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>June </td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>July </td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>August </td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>September </td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>October </td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>November </td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>251</td></tr></table></p><p>My Department and the Housing Agency are working with all stakeholders to ensure that the actions set out in the Review are being effectively implemented to benefit a greater number of households.  I am providing an additional &euro;5m for the MTR scheme in 2018, which will support at least 250 additional MTR cases to be completed by AHBs working together with lenders using the existing MTR scheme.</p><p>The MTR Review also concluded that the current financial model of the MTR scheme may not, in its current configuration, be capable of delivering the scale of successful cases that could benefit from the scheme over time.  In order to test the operability of alternative funding models for the scheme, the Housing Agency has been working with a number of financial entities who have expressed an interest in working with the MTR scheme to progress a number of alternative long-term lease arrangements.  In advance of these pilots and to establish the operability of an alternative financing approach, a targeted market testing exercise has been undertaken by the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA), to test the suitability of the proposed enhanced leasing arrangements to ascertain if they would be viable for a MTR cohort, taking account of the necessity to provide a long-term stable solution for eligible households.  </p><p>The responses to the market testing exercise have been reviewed by the Housing Agency and my Department.  A call for Expressions of Interest from bodies interested in pursuing pilot operating models was initiated by the Housing Agency on 26 October 2017. Once the Expressions of Interest process is concluded - the extended deadline for receipt of submissions is 31 January 2018 -  the Housing Agency will make recommendations to my Department as to the make-up of the pilots, which can then be initiated.  </p></reply>

Under these provisions housing authorities&rsquo; powers to deal with homelessness are broad and flexible allowing them to respond quickly and effectively to the various needs of cases that may present to them.  I am satisfied that housing authorities are making every effort to provide the most suitable accommodation to homeless households seeking emergency accommodation.  </p>  <p>  As part of the response to the commitment contained in Rebuilding Ireland that commercial hotels and B&amp;B's should only be used as emergency accommodation for families in limited circumstances, housing authorities are delivering a number of family-focused, supported temporary accommodation facilities, also referred to as &lsquo;family hubs&rsquo;.  The long-term solution to the current homeless issue is to increase the supply of homes and accordingly Rebuilding Ireland is designed to accelerate all types of housing supply.  It is intended that the long-term housing needs of households in emergency accommodation will be met as soon as possible through a range of social housing supports, such as the enhanced Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme and general social housing allocations.  </p></reply>

In the context of social housing, this will involve a blended approach to delivery and providing local authorities with a range of mechanisms to achieve the best value for money within the financial resources available.  I have made it clear that there must be an increased focus on building new social housing homes, and it is in that context that I increased the targets for new social housing over the period to 2021 to 50,000 and have provided the necessary financial resources to achieve that.</p>  <p>  The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Scheme plays a vital role in housing eligible families and individuals.  There are currently more than 30,000 households having their housing needs met via HAP.  On average, 350 new households are supported by HAP each week in 2017, and the Rebuilding Ireland 2017 target of supporting 15,000 additional households with the scheme has been exceeded.  The increased HAP rent limits introduced by the Government last year, together with the additional discretion available to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limit where necessary, are allowing  HAP households to find suitable accommodation and willing landlords.  Particular additional targeted supports are available to homeless households in the Dublin and Cork City regions to assist them in finding accommodation in the private rental market, with the support of HAP. </p>  <p>  From available data, at the end of Q3 2017, approximately 20% of the total number of households being supported by HAP were benefiting from the additional flexibility that was provided to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limits.  When the additional discretion available to homeless households in the Dublin Region is removed, 14.4% of households nationally were benefiting from the additional flexibility.  In those cases, the average rate of discretionary payment being used was 14.9% above rent limits provided.</p>  <p>  The Strategy for the Rental Sector, published in December 2016, recommended the introduction of a Rent Predictability Measure to moderate rent increases in those parts of the country where rents are highest and rising - where households have greatest difficulties in finding accommodation they can afford.  The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 provided for the Rent Predictability Measure and for areas, called Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs), where rents can now only rise by a maximum of 4% annually for a period of three years.</p>  <p>  This measure was implemented immediately in the four Dublin local authority areas and in Cork City as these areas already met the criteria for a Rent Pressure Zone in December 2016. A further 12 Local Electoral Areas (LEAs) were designated in January 2017, with the measure further extended to Maynooth and Cobh LEAs in March 2017 and to Drogheda and Greystones LEAs in September 2017.</p>  <p>  My Department and I are constantly monitoring HAP data, as well as other key information relating to the private rental market.  Indications are that the current HAP rent limits and the flexibility to exceed those rent limits provide local authorities with sufficient capacity to assist households in securing rented accommodation that meets their needs.  Increasing the HAP rent limits in particular local authority areas could have further inflationary effects on the private rented sector, which could have a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support. Based on the data outlined above, I am currently satisfied that the maximum rent limits, together with the additional flexibility available to local authorities, are generally sufficient to meet the demand of the rental market in these areas.</p>  <p>  I continue to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review but I am currently satisfied with how the scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme committed to under Rebuilding Ireland.</p></reply>

As a long term housing support, an assessment of housing need must be completed in order for a household to qualify for HAP. Any household with an identified housing need is eligible for HAP.  The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 provide that subject to conditions, a housing authority shall deal with such an application within a period of 12 weeks. </p>  <p>  Local authorities will prioritise housing needs assessments for those in greatest need and average waiting times are significantly shorter that the statutory maximum in many areas. </p>  <p>  Under the HAP scheme, eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector.  My Department does not hold details on the processing times for HAP applications or payments.  The earliest date a HAP payment will issue to a landlord is the date a complete and valid HAP application has been received by the local authority.  Limerick City and County Council provide a highly effective transactional shared service on behalf of all HAP local authorities.  This HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord.  Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is then processed by the HAP SSC.  On average, HAP applications are processed by the HAP Shared Service Centre within 1 working day of receipt.  Any rental payment arising for a given month will then be made to a landlord on the last Wednesday of that month.</p>  <p>  More than 30,700 households are currently in receipt of HAP support.  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.  In general, I am satisfied with the operation of the HAP scheme and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.</p></reply>

This is reaffirmed in the Programme for a Partnership Government (2016) which provides that the Government recognises that domestic turf cutters have a traditional right to cut turf.  This right is balanced with the conservation objectives and legal obligations on the State.</p>  <p>  The cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme, administered by my Department, was established in 2011 in relation to turf cutting on raised bog designated sites.  A pilot scheme targeted at encouraging energy efficiency and low carbon heating solutions among those coming within the ambit of this scheme is being developed by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, working with my Department and Bord na M&oacute;na. </p>  <p>  Applicants under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme from six special area of conservation bogs, will receive an offer of a tailored package of energy efficiency improvements with significant State supports.  Irish Rural Link have been engaged to liaise with householders in the areas in question and public workshops on the pilot scheme will commence in January 2018. </p></reply>

In this capacity, he is working closely with his colleagues across Government to address the many challenges arising from the decision taken by the United Kingdom.  This cooperation also involves the relevant State Agencies.  </p>  <p>  Work at Cabinet level is being prepared through cross-Departmental coordination structures.  These represent a frequent and active channel through which all relevant Departments are providing their research, analysis and overall policy input to the Government&rsquo;s wider response to Brexit.   </p>  <p>  In relation to the work undertaken by my Department with regard to Brexit, I would refer the Deputy to the replies given to Parliamentary Questions No 923 of 20 June, No 257 of 12 July, No 741 of 11 September and  No 586 of 7 November.  </p>  <p>  The main forum for advancing North South cooperation is the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC), which was established under Strand Two of the Good Friday Agreement.  In the Council, the Government works with the Northern Ireland Executive to advance areas of practical co-operation which are to our mutual benefit, and the Council oversees co-operation in the agreed twelve Areas or Sectors.  The power-sharing Executive and the Assembly are responsible for representing the interests of all of the people of Northern Ireland, including in relation to how the issues arising with the UK exit from the EU should be addressed.  It is imperative that the devolved institutions can urgently operate again so that the North South Ministerial Council can resume its work and bring together the Government and the Executive to oversee and develop North/South cooperation, including that commenced last year to coordinate engagement by the Government and the Executive on dealing with the challenges raised on an all-island basis by the UK exit.  </p>  <p>  In six of these Sectors provided for under the Good Friday Agreement, co-operation is taken forward by means of the North South Implementation Bodies: Waterways Ireland, Food Safety Promotion Board, InterTradeIreland, Special EU Programmes Body, North/South Language Body, and the Loughs Agency, all of which operate on an all-island basis.  </p>  <p>  My Department co-sponsors two of the six North-South Implementation Bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement, Waterways Ireland and An Foras Teanga / the Language Body.   </p>  <p>  Prior to the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly, my predecessor Minister Heather Humphreys had discussed with the Northern Ireland Minister for Infrastructure, Mr Chris Hazard, MLA, whose Department co-sponsors Waterways Ireland, and with the Northern Ireland Minister for Communities, Mr. Paul Givan, MLA, whose Department co-sponsors the Language Body their readiness to further explore the scope for co-operation to achieve the best outcome for the two Implementation Bodies in light of the potential challenges they face.  My predecessor, along with her Northern counterparts, attended the last NSMC Plenary meeting in November 2016 at which Common Principles were agreed to coordinate engagement by the Government and the Executive to deal with the challenges that are raised on an all-island basis by the UK exit from the European Union.  I very much hope that these contacts can continue as soon as the NSMC is once again able to meet.  </p>  <p>  My Department continues to participate in inter-Departmental preparations for Brexit and has established an internal Working Group to address all Brexit related issues affecting the Department and the State Bodies it funds, including the two North South bodies referred to above. </p>  <p>  The arrangements which I have outlined are kept under constant review and will be enhanced as required in light of the ongoing preparations for Brexit.</p></reply>

The 702 personnel inducted encompass 567 General Service Recruits across the Army and Naval Service, along with 100 Cadets, 22Air Corps Apprentices and 13 Direct Entry Officers (11 Naval Service and 2 Military Medicine).Females represent 9.8% of those inducted in 2017. The gender breakdown of 2017 recruits across the Defence Forces is currently being compiled by the military authorities, and I will revert to the Deputy with this information when it is available.</p><p>The number of Officers, as at 31<sup>st</sup>October 2017, is 1,056 out of an establishment of 1,233. The number of Cadets in training has substantially increased recently with 100 Cadets having been recruited in each of the years 2016 and 2017. Approximately 70 Army Cadets will be commissioned in January 2018</p><p>As I have previously outlined there are particular challenges with vacancies in certain specialist posts such as Pilots, Air Traffic Controllers and certain Technicians. These specialists can prove difficult to retain where, as in the current economic circumstances, there are ongoing private sector and commercial semi-state sector job opportunities. </p><p>To address these difficulties, a range of recruitment methods are being employed including direct entry competitions for specialist positions. I have directed the civil and military management to develop proposals for expanding such direct entry recruitment of specialists and a scheme to faciliate former PDF personnel with appropriate skill-sets to re-enter the Defence Forces. The Public Service Pay Commission will further examine the issue of retention of specialist personnel in accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020</p><p>In tandem with these actions my Department is also engaged in planning on a longer term basis. Projects arising from the White Paper on Defence around topics such as medium term manpopwer planning and encouraging as wide a pool as possible for recruitment are already underway. Further projects, scheduled to begin in the New Year will address issues such as age profiles and a gap analysis of skill-sets within the PDF. The gap analysis will help to identify the frequency of such gaps and identify appropriate measures to address them. </p><p>I remain committed to maximising recruitment of capable personnel, developing serving personnel, and so achieving the best personnel and skills combination to ensure the Defence Forces retain the capacity to operate effectively across all roles. </p></reply>

The most recent recruitment campaign for the Army Reserve and Naval Service began in July 2017 and attracted 1,221 applications.

The gender breakdown of the 2017 recruits is currently being compiled by the military authorities, and I will revert to the Deputy with this information when it is available.</p><p>Given the competing recruitment demands at present, where PDF recruitment is and should remain a priority, recruitment to the Reserve is continuing. However, it should be noted that the same personnel and resources are utilised for both Permanent and Reserve Defence Force recruitment and the planned recruitment of up to 800 Permanent Defence Force personnel this year obviously impacted on resource allocation.</p><p>I would like to assure the Deputy that I remain committed to the ongoing development of the RDF within the framework set out in the White Paper on Defence and having regard to resource availability.</p></reply>
