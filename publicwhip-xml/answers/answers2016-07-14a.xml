Officials from my Department are members of the steering group that has oversight of the National Smart Metering Programme.    The most recent phase of consultation concluded in April this year with the publication of policy papers relating to customer information, customer protection and the wider transition from traditional to smart meters. </p>  <p>  Last month, ESB Networks commenced the procurement process for electricity smart meters and communications systems by issuing a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union. </p>  <p>  The key determinant of the scale, scope and timing of the roll-out is a cost benefit analysis that is currently being developed by the Commission for Energy Regulation. The cost information from the procurement process will be a key input into the cost benefit analysis, the results of which are due in the first quarter of 2017. </p>  <p>  The roll-out of smart meters would take a number of years and will commence in late 2018 at the earliest. In-home display would be available to all consumers to allow them to see their level of energy use. The &lsquo;go live&rsquo; date of smart services will follow once a significant number of smart meters have been rolled out. This will allow energy suppliers to provide detailed information to consumers on their energy use.</p></reply>

This commitment builds on the Energy White Paper published in December 2015 and recognises that solar <font color="#0D0D0D">photo voltaic </font>also has the potential to provide a community dividend, thereby enhancing citizen participation in Ireland's energy future.  It is widely recognised that solar photo voltaic technology has become more cost competitive for electricity generation over the last few years, not only compared with other renewables but also compared with conventional forms of generation. With these significant changes in the cost of the technology, the deployment of solar <font color="#0D0D0D">photo voltaic </font>in Ireland has only recently become a potential cost-effective option to increase energy security, contribute to our renewable energy targets, and support economic growth and jobs. It is also recognised, however, that while the cost competitiveness of solar <font color="#0D0D0D">photo voltaic </font>has improved, it would still require a subsidy in order to be developed on a commercial basis.</p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">In-depth economic analysis is now underway to inform the actual costings of a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme  scheme. While no decision has been taken on the precise renewable technologies to be supported, the cost and technical viability of a range of renewable technologies is being assessed, including solar photo voltaic. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">Designing and implementing a new scheme is a complex task and it is expected that the broad details of the new scheme will be available early next year. Before these details are announced, the Department will run a second public consultation, which will give all interested parties an opportunity to input into the development of the scheme. Ultimately, the introduction of any new scheme will be subject to Government and State aid approval from the European Commission. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">While there are no specific targets in relation to any individual renewable energy technology, any renewable energy technology that is built and connected before 2020 can contribute towards Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 renewable energy target. This may include solar photo voltaic.</font></p></reply>

This is reflected in the High Speed Broadband Map, at broadband.gov.ie.   The areas marked BLUE on the map are where commercial providers have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The areas marked AMBER represent the State Intervention area. Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by entering their address or Eircode. They can also email the Department, quoting their Eircode, to  broadband@dcenr.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  There are over 750,000 premises in the Intervention Area, including over 24,000  premises in Cavan and 19,500 in Monaghan. Last week, I announced that a further 170,000 premises will need to be covered by the State Intervention. Further analysis is being undertaken by my Department to identify the exact location of these premises and to adjust the High Speed Broadband Map.</p>  <p>  The Department has now moved to the next stage of  the procurement process and three qualifying bidders will commence dialogue with the Department next week. This will be followed by the issue of final tender documents and the current schedule envisages contract(s) award in June 2017. The timing of each stage of the procurement is dependent on a number of factors, including the complexities that may be encountered during the process. </p>  <p>  The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of  poor service, business needs and/or high demand. This will be balanced with the need to roll-out the network in an efficient manner. A prioritisation programme will be put in place and the detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p>  <p>  In parallel with the procurement, Minister Humphreys is establishing regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies. This will help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p></reply>

The Government has adopted a range of support measures designed to meet our binding target, and although good progress towards our target has been made to date, meeting the 16% target remains challenging. Provisional data from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland indicates we had reached 9.2% of the overall 16% target at the end of 2015. </p>  <p>  In the electricity sector, the primary support mechanisms introduced for renewable electricity are the Alternative Energy Requirement schemes and the Renewable Energy Feed-In-Tariff  schemes. These schemes have proved successful at incentivising the development of the renewable electricity generation capacity necessary to meet our 40% renewable electricity target, and provisional figures show that in 2015 some 25.3% of electricity demand was met by renewable sources.</p>  <p>  In the heating sector, my Department is working on the introduction of a new Renewable Heat Incentive to support the deployment of renewable energy in the sector. The primary aim of the RHI is to build on the progress already made in heating and to help reach our 12% target by 2020. In 2015 it is estimated that 6.8% of heat was derived from renewable sources.</p>  <p>  In the transport sector Ireland aims to meet our renewable target mainly through the increased use of sustainable biofuels, with electric vehicles also making a small contribution.  In 2015, provisional figures indicate 5.7% of our energy needs in the transport sector were met from renewable sources. </p>  <p>  The clear focus is on implementing the range of actions set out in the White Paper and Programme for Government that are aimed at meeting our energy and climate change targets. While my Department has not carried out any studies in regard to the potential costs of not meeting our overall renewable energy targets, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), has estimated that the cost to Ireland may be in the range of &euro;100 million to &euro;150 million for each percentage point Ireland falls short of the overall 16% renewable energy target.</p></reply>

Since its establishment in 1946, Bord na M&oacute;na has developed the country&rsquo;s extensive peat resources primarily for fuel, energy and horticultural growing media. As part of this development, the company has acquired extensive areas of peatland, together with other lands and properties. These lands extend in total to approximately 80,000 hectares.   I am advised that Bord na M&oacute;na owns approximately 1,450 hectares of peatland in the Cuil Na Mona Group of bogs, consisting of Cuil Na Mona, Coolnacartan and Cashel bogs.  There are 980 hectares in Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s ownership at Kilberry.  I understand that all of these areas are currently used for peat production for use in the energy and horticultural businesses. Bord na M&oacute;na has confirmed that it is expected that they will continue to be used for these purposes for at least another 10 years. </p>  <p>  I am informed that Bord na M&oacute;na operates in compliance with Integrated Pollution Control licences issued by the EPA and that these licences oblige the Company to, inter alia, prepare a plan for the rehabilitation of peat lands to be implemented when peat production ceases. I understand that a draft rehabilitation plan for each of the bogs mentioned has been submitted to the EPA. </p>  <p>  I am also advised that the Company has prepared a strategic framework for the future use of peatlands, setting out broad principles which will enable Bord na M&oacute;na to balance and optimise the commercial,  social and environmental value of the Company&rsquo;s lands. The lands at Cuil na Mona and Kilberry will be assessed in accordance with this framework when peat production ceases.</p></reply>

The Taskforce will involve a number of Government Departments and agencies, as well as engagement with ComReg and telecommunications operators. My Department has already conducted a number of meetings with vendors and mobile operators to help inform the process and identify what tangible measures can be taken. I expect that Minister Humphreys and I will bring proposals to Government by the end of 2016, on foot of the Taskforce's report. </p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government also commits also to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded. In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded. I expect that the work of the National Taskforce will assist in the development of regional digital strategies, by providing guidance, legislation if appropriate, and information on how Local Authorities can accelerate the roll-out of services in their areas. </p>  <p>  These new structures at national and local level, are designed to address as far as possible immediate frustrations about the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage. </p>  <p>  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in the last 4 years, in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of telecommunications services. These include the upgrading of 3G networks and investment in new 4G networks. It also includes significant investment in high speed broadband services. These investments are improving the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country, although I understand that some temporary disruptions to service have been encountered when upgrades are taking place. ComReg is also planning the further release of spectrum to assist in the roll-out of wireless services, particularly in rural areas. </p>  <p>My Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks and this will be a key focus for the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.</p></reply>

The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming. The formal procurement process for the State Intervention commenced in December 2015.The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the extent of the State Intervention area, which is the subject of procurement. The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services. The Department continues to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area to ensure that those services are delivered. The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention. The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county. The Department also has a dedicated mailbox and anyone with a query in relation to the Map should email the Department, quoting their Eircode, to  broadband@dcenr.gov.ie.</p><p>Over 750,000 premises are the focus for the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire ( 'PQQ') and Project Information Memorandum.  On 5<sup></sup>July 2016, I announced that my Department has also identified a further 170,000 premises which are currently market BLUE on the High Speed Broadband Map and which are unlikely to get access to services. My Department is currently in the process of identifying these additional premises with a view to including them in the formal procurement process. </p><p>On 5 July I also announced that the Department has now moved to the next stage in the procurement process. In this Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) phase, three qualifying bidders have been invited to meet with the Department to commence the formal dialogue process. The qualifying bidders will shortly be furnished with a draft contract, with detailed specifications for a quality and affordable high speed broadband network. </p><p>Following the ITPD stage, which will take a number of months, the Department will issue final tender documentation to bidders.  When final tenders have been submitted a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy. The Department will then enter into formal contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s), with a view to having contract(s) in place in June 2017.</p><p>The timing of each stage of the procurement is dependent on a number of factors including the number of bidders short-listed and the complexities that may be encountered during the dialogue process.  It must be noted that bidders will need several months to prepare their draft bids and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at these stages of the process.</p><p>As part of the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to roll-out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP. It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and / or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan. A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks. The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services. These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country. The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the establishment of a mobile phone and broadband Taskforce which will consider immediate measures to address telecommunications deficits in rural Ireland.  My Department is engaging with the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in relation to the terms of reference for the Taskforce to ensure delivery of the Programme for Government commitment.  The Taskforce will involve a number of Government Departments and agencies, as well as engagement with ComReg and telecommunications operators. My Department has already conducted a number of meetings with vendors and mobile operators to help inform the process and identify what tangible measures can be taken. I expect that Minister Humphreys and I will bring proposals to Government by the end of 2016, on foot of the Taskforce's report. </p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government commits also to measures to assist in the roll-out of the broadband network once a contract is awarded. In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of county or regional broadband taskforces, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>I fully accept that all citizens should have access to reliable and quality broadband services and I am acutely aware of the challenges faced by business and households alike due to poor quality broadband.  The provision of telecommunications services is of course primarily a matter for the service providers concerned who operate in a fully liberalised market.  These operators are regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  </p><p>Any regulatory issues surrounding quality of service are the responsibility of ComReg. If, after having exhausted the service provider&rsquo;s complaint handling procedures, a customer is not happy they may contact ComReg, on 1890 229 668; online at  or by email at Consumerline@comreg.ie, for further assistance and guidance.  As the body that issues licences to broadband service providers, ComReg will investigate such complaints to ensure that the company in question is delivering services in line with its licence obligations.</p></reply>

The two models are:   - Commercial Stimulus where the private sector finances, designs, builds, owns and operates the network, with contractual obligations to the Department.</p>  <p>  - Full Concession where the private sector finances, designs, builds and operates the network with contractual obligations to the Department.  In this model, those assets funded by the State are handed back to the State after 25 years; commercial assets that support the NBP infrastructure would however remain in private ownership.</p>  <p>  Both Models will deliver the same network, with the same service specifications and controls, for 25 years. In both models, the winning bidder(s) will be subject to stringent contract provisions to ensure that the network delivers quality, affordable high speed broadband to all parts of Ireland that cannot access services.</p>  <p>  The Department has completed detailed costings, down to every individual premise in the Intervention Area and, on that basis, has modelled the likely cost of each ownership model. It would not be appropriate to publish the expected cost of building the network or the likely cost to the State while a major public procurement process is underway. I do not intend therefore, to indicate the overall estimated Exchequer funding parameters. Ultimately, the costs will depend on the price that bidder(s) quote in the tender process.  I can however confirm the following based on the cost modelling completed to date:</p>  <p>  - The Full Concession Model is estimated to cost 50 &ndash; 70% more in nominal terms that the Commercial Stimulus Funding model;</p>  <p>  - In the Full Concession Model, the full cost of the project would be likely to go on the Government&rsquo;s Balance Sheet, and the commercial sector input would likely be regarded as Government debt;</p>  <p>  Having the entire project on the Government&rsquo;s Balance sheet would impact the general Government deficit by approximately &euro;1bn more than the Commercial Stimulus Model. This would also reduce the available capital spend for other key investment projects by up to &euro;600m over the next six years.</p>  <p>  In choosing the Commercial Stimulus Model, up to &euro;600m now can be potentially allocated for other priority projects over the next six years. It is a matter for Government to determine the appropriate use of additional capital funding that may be available having regard to the Programme for Government commitments, including those commitments in relation to climate action.</p></reply>

The Energy White Paper published last December sets out a high-level framework for Ireland&rsquo;s energy transition to a low carbon system and society and identifies a range of measures and actions to support this aim. The clear focus of my Department is on implementing the range of actions set out in the White Paper to meet our energy and climate change targets through cost efficient policies. Among the commitments to achieve the energy transition are to:</p>  <p>  - support community participation in renewable energy,</p>  <p>  - provide funding and supports for community-led projects in the initial stages of development, planning and construction,</p>  <p>  - develop a framework for agreeing how communities share in the benefits of substantial new energy infrastructure located in their area, and</p>  <p>  - support the emerging energy cooperative movement as one means of facilitating community participation.</p>  <p>  The authorisation of wind farms is a matter for the relevant planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as appropriate, and I have no function in the matter.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to updating the Wind Energy Planning Development Guidelines within 3 to 6 months of the formation of Government, to ensure an appropriate balance between the concerns of local communities in relation to matters such as noise and shadow flicker and the need to invest in indigenous renewable energy projects for the purpose of assisting in the achievement of our EU renewable energy targets. In accordance with the commitment in the Programme for Government, the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, as the lead Department in this process, in consultation with my Department and within the timeframe, will bring to Government revised Wind Energy Planning Development Guidelines. The issues of community benefit and participation will be further considered and developed as part of this on-going process. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently finalising a Renewable Electricity Policy and Development Framework, which is to be underpinned by a Strategic Environmental Assessment and an Appropriate Assessment.  The Renewable Electricity Policy and Development Framework is intended to provide guidance to citizens, industry, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, and other public authorities, for use in conjunction with the Wind Energy Development Guidelines. This work, along with a review of the Guidelines, will set a clear framework for the development of renewable energy infrastructure into the future.</p></reply>

The PSO levy consists of a set of support schemes designed to facilitate the achievement of national electricity policy objectives for renewables, indigenous fuels and security of supply. It also supports employment in the renewables industry and in the peat industry. The proceeds of the PSO levy are used to contribute to the additional relevant costs incurred by PSO-supported electricity generators which are not recovered in the electricity market.The PSO has supported the connection of more than 2,000 MW of renewable energy to the electricity grid and will continue to support the development of renewable energy so that the target for 40% renewable electricity penetration by 2020 is met.</p><p>Recent international studies have shown that Ireland has had one of the lowest per unit supports for renewable energy in the European Union.</p><p>I am conscious of the impact of energy costs on industry and households alike, but would point out that the falling wholesale price  of electricity is being passed on the consumers and more than outweighs the proposed levy increase in the current period. In that regard, I would remind the House of recent price reductions by electricity suppliers  Consumers can also avail of discounts either by contacting their suppliers directly or using the price comparison websites accredited by the CER, such as <i>bonkers.ie</i>and <i>switcher.ie</i>, to switch to discounted tariffs. A customer consuming the average amount of electricity could save over &euro;150 by switching suppliers.</p><p>The calculation of the level of the PSO is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). The CER has published a consultation on a proposed levy of &euro;441 million for 2016-2017,  for domestic consumers equating to just less than &euro;7 per month and representing an increase on 2015 of &euro;1.61 per month, or &euro;19.32 per year. The biggest drivers for the proposed levy increase are the lower predicted wholesale market electricity price and increased deployment of renewables.</p></reply>

The Government has adopted a range of support measures designed to meet our binding target, and although good progress towards our target has been made to date, meeting the 16% target remains challenging. Provisional data from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) indicates we had reached 9.2% of the overall 16% target at the end of 2015.    In the electricity sector, the primary support mechanisms introduced for renewable electricity are the Alternative Energy Requirement (AER) schemes and the Renewable Energy Feed-In-Tariff (REFIT) schemes. These schemes have proved successful at incentivising the development of the renewable electricity generation capacity necessary to meet our 40% renewable electricity target, and provisional figures show that in 2015 some 25.3% of electricity demand was met by renewable sources.</p>  <p>  In the heating sector, my Department is working on the introduction of a new Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) to support the deployment of renewable energy in the sector. The primary aim of the RHI is to build on the progress already made in heating and to help reach our 12% target by 2020. In 2015 it is estimated that 6.8% of heat was derived from renewable sources.</p>  <p>  In the transport sector Ireland aims to meet our renewable target mainly through the increased use of sustainable biofuels, with electric vehicles also making a small contribution.  In 2015, provisional figures indicate 5.7% of our energy needs in the transport sector were met from renewable sources. </p>  <p>  The Energy White Paper, Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future, published in December 2015, sets out a vision for transforming Ireland's fossil-fuel based energy sector into a clean, low carbon system by 2050, while the Programme for Government  includes a range of commitments on energy efficiency and renewable energy.

Ireland has always been highly dependent on imports of energy products. In 2014 Ireland had an import dependency of 85% with energy imports costing circa &euro;5.7 billion. Indigenous energy sources from renewable energy and natural gas supplies from Corrib will reduce this dependency in the coming years.</p>  <p>  Ireland holds a stock of  90 days of oil is in accordance with EU legislation and International Energy Agency rules.  This is held as a strategic reserve to be used in the event of a supply disruption. Over 60% of these stocks are held in Ireland with the rest held in other EU Member States, including the United Kingdom.  In the absence of available storage in Ireland, the continued holding of stocks in the UK, including in Northern Ireland, continues to be necessary. This need will be part of any discussions Ireland will have with the EU and the UK. </p>  <p>Ireland is connected with the UK by a number of gas and electricity interconnectors. Additional electricity interconnectors to Northern Ireland, Wales and France are at various stages of development.

The SSCS is a statutorily independent committee comprised of scientists from IFI, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Loughs Agency, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Marine Institute, the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (Northern Ireland), and other State bodies and third level institutions.  </p>  <p>  Three methods (rod catch, counter and electric fishing) are used by the SSCS to assess salmon stocks in Co. Wexford salmon rivers. </p>  <p>  The harvest of salmon is restricted to those stocks of rivers that are meeting their conservation limits.  The individual river management strategy is based on the fact that each of Ireland&rsquo;s salmon rivers has its own unique stock of salmon which migrates to sea as juveniles and returns to the same river in adulthood to spawn and create the next generation of fish exclusive to that river. Fisheries are only considered in rivers where the estimated returns are above the conservation limit for the river.</p>  <p>  The salmon assessment methodologies used in Ireland are considered internationally as best practice, with many other countries moving towards the development of similar scientific assessment models for salmon stock conservation.</p>  <p>  The Salmon Hardship Scheme was introduced following a Government decision in 2006 to cease, for conservation reasons, the commercial salmon mixed stock fishery.  Under the scheme, fishermen active in the commercial salmon fishery, could opt to voluntarily cease fishing and undertake not to seek a licence in the future.</p>  <p>  In excess of &euro;25m was allocated to the scheme to facilitate payments to fishermen, with a further &euro;5m provided for community development projects. The scheme closed for applications on 31 December 2007 and ceased in 2008. I understand that all funds were expended and there are currently no plans to revisit such a scheme. Public commercial fishing licences are issued annually on a prescribed application basis and, therefore, are not transferable or inheritable. There is no property right attaching to them.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Eel Management Plan (EMP) was reviewed in 2015 in line with EU requirements. IFI carried out a comprehensive public consultation process as part of the review. Based on management advice from IFI, and having considered all aspects of their report, the existing conservation measures in Ireland&rsquo;s EMP remains in place up to mid-2018. Conservation of Eel Fishing Bye-law No. C.S. 319, 2015 prohibits fishing for eel, or possessing or selling eel caught in a river in the State and ceases to have effect on 30 June 2018. </p>  <p>  The latest advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) for 2016 (published October 2015) is that &ldquo;the status of eel remains critical and that all anthropogenic mortality (e.g. recreational and commercial fishing, hydropower, pumping stations, and pollution) affecting production and escapement of silver eels should be reduced to &ndash; or kept as close to &ndash; zero as possible.&rdquo; There is no change in the perception of the status of the stock as being critically endangered.</p>  <p>  On 24 November 2015 the then Minister of State announced a new collaborative research initiative involving IFI scientists and a number of former eel fishermen to further develop national knowledge of the species and its medium to longer term potential for recovery. A scientific fishery is to be undertaken for three years commencing in 2016 to increase data and knowledge ahead of further review of eel management measures in 2018.</p>  <p>  There is no right attached to a public eel licence and therefore the issue of compensation does not arise.  </p>  <p>I am happy to arrange a more detailed briefing for the Deputy if required.</p></reply>

The Government has adopted a range of support measures designed to meet our binding target, and although good progress towards our target has been made to date, meeting the 16% target remains challenging. Provisional data from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) indicates we had reached 9.2% of the overall 16% target at the end of 2015.    The Renewable Energy Directive sets out arrangements to enable member states to meet  their targets, including the purchase of compliance through a a flexibility measure, known as a statistical transfer. The focus remains firmly on meeting our 2020 target and  a number of interventions have been taken to support  renewable energy, including  the Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff supports. New measures are also in development including a Renewable Electricity Support Scheme  and a Renewable Heat Incentive. In any event the cost of purchasing statistical transfers should any potential shortfall in Ireland's target arise has yet to be established and will depend on a number of factors, particularly available supply and market costs. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has estimated that the cost to Ireland may be in the range of &euro;100 million to &euro;150 million for each percentage point Ireland falls short of the overall 16% renewable energy target.</p>  <p>The Energy White Paper, Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon  Energy Future, published in December 2015, sets out a vision for  transforming Ireland's fossil-fuel based energy sector into a clean, low carbon system by 2050. The clear focus of my Department is  on implementing the range of actions set out in the White Paper and Programme for Government that are aimed at meeting our energy and climate change targets.</p></reply>

The legislation makes particular provision as to the competence of persons to be appointed to the Board of SEAI and provides that appointees must have experience or competence in areas specifically related to the functions of SEAI. Amongst the competencies listed at Section 10.(3) of the Act is "environmental matters".  I believe that the legislation as drafted adequately provides for appropriate representation on the Board to enable the remit of SEAI to be met.   The Deputy will be aware that the process for appointments to State boards has been strengthened with the introduction of Guidelines for Appointments to State Boards published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in November 2014. The objective of the Guidelines is to open up the process to the largest possible pool of suitable candidates. The Guidelines establish a new and transparent approach to Board appointments which is operated by the Public Appointments Service and ensures that a sufficient list of suitably qualified candidates is available to the appointing Minister for consideration. Under the system it is open to representatives from Non-Government Organisations with a track record of environmental campaigning in the area of sustainability and climate change to apply for a position on the Board of SEAI or indeed any other State Board provided there are no other statutory restrictions applying.</p>  <p>  In order to address concerns in relation to the continuity of membership on the Board of SEAI, section 22 of the Energy Bill 2016, which is currently before the House, provides for an amendment to section 10 of the Sustainable Energy Act 2002. The amendment proposes to remove the requirement that each year on 1 May the three longest serving members of the Board must retire. Instead, board members would be appointed for a period up to 5 years, subject to a maximum of ten years&rsquo; service.  I believe that the amendment will improve continuity of membership and give greater certainty to board members in relation to the duration of their appointment.</p></reply>

In addition, the Programme for Government sets out a range of priority climate actions and interventions, a number of which have a direct bearing on the energy efficiency and the renewable energy sector. In combination, these will help to increase and diversify Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy mix across the electricity, heating and transport sectors. The clear focus of my Department is on implementing the range of actions set out in the White Paper and Programme for Government that are aimed at meeting our energy and climate change targets. </font><font color="#0D0D0D">The EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy demand from renewable sources by 2020. The Government has a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy and although good progress towards the target has been made to date, meeting the 16% target remains challenging. The Renewable Energy Feed-in-Tariff (REFIT) schemes support the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies including hydro, biomass combustion, biomass combined heat and power, landfill gas and onshore wind. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">Work is now on-going in my Department on the development of a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) to encourage the development of Ireland&rsquo;s abundant and indigenous renewable energy resources.

The new RHI scheme is expected to become available in 2017. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">In the transport sector Ireland aims to meet our 10% renewable target mainly through the increased use of sustainable biofuels, with electric vehicles also making a small contribution out to 2020. In 2015, provisional figures indicate 5.7% of our energy needs in the transport sector were met from renewable sources.

Delivery of high speed broadband is a strategic priority under the Programme for a Partnership Government.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming.    The Government has chosen the Commercial Stimulus model as the optimum approach for the National Broadband Plan intervention.  The decision on ownership has allowed the procurement phase to move to the next stage, where three bidders have qualified and been invited to participate in formal dialogue with the Department. The Dialogue process with bidders will commence next week. </p>  <p>  Following this Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) stage, which will take a number of months, the Department will issue final tender documentation to bidders, when final tenders have been submitted a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy. The Department will then enter into formal contact negotiations with the winning bidder(s), prior to award of a contract. </p>  <p>  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and / or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan. A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p>  <p>  The contract(s) with the preferred bidder(s) will include robust governance provisions and an appropriate minimum set of risk management measures. Provisions will be in place for the State to claw-back a portion of any network build, or operating profits over and above those anticipated in the contract(s). There will also be mechanisms to deduct service credits from the contractor(s), where milestones or contract conditions are not met. </p>  <p>  In addition to contract provisions, if the winning bidder(s) is deemed by ComReg to have significant market dominance in the Intervention Area, regulation will provide an added layer of control over and above the contract with the State. Through regulation, ComReg has the statutory obligation to incentivise re-investment in a regulated network, to promote competition and to protect the interests of end users. It must also ensure that regulation in Ireland and the activities of regulated companies in Ireland are consistent with other comparable Member States. ComReg will play a key role in monitoring the activity of the winning bidder(s), and may, subject to whether the winning bidder(s) has significant market dominance or not, regulate the winning bidder(s) during and post-contract.   </p>  <p>  I am conscious of the need to put in place strong contract governance structures to manage the contract(s) over a 25 year period. To this end, I will bring forward proposals in the coming months, including legislation, to establish a dedicated entity to manage this and other State telecoms contracts or to assign this role to an existing State entity. </p>  <p>  I am also aware of the need to ensure continuity of service in 26 years, when the contract has expired.  My Department has already had discussions with ComReg with a view to putting in place legislation that could enhance ComReg's regulatory oversight. I have also discussed with ComReg, the possibility of a Universal Service Obligation as an effective mechanism to ensure continuity of services beyond 2042 when the contract expires. In anticipation of the need for such an arrangement, I have raised this issue at European level in advance of the review of the Telecommunications Regulatory Framework which is scheduled to commence later this year.</p></reply>

Ireland has some of the best offshore and ocean energy resources in Europe, and the development of this abundant resource will be an increasingly important element of Ireland's future energy policies.  </p>  <p>  This is particularly relevant in the context of the Energy White Paper &ldquo;Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future 2015-2030&rdquo; which defines the Government&rsquo;s vision of a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector by 80% to 95 % relative to 1990 levels by 2050.  </p>  <p>  The Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP) sets out the Government&rsquo;s policy in the ocean energy area.  The plan identifies the sustainable economic opportunity for Ireland in the period to 2030 of realising the potential of our indigenous offshore wind, wave and tidal energy resources.  The Strategic Environmental Assessment that underpinned the plan found that 4,500 MW of offshore wind and 1,500 MW of wave and tidal generation could be sustainably developed in Irish waters.</p>  <p>  The recent Programme for Government recognises that wave and tidal energy will have an important role in Ireland&rsquo;s future renewable energy mix and commits to supporting further research, development and demonstration of these technologies.</p>  <p>  Exchequer support in terms of research, development and demonstration was increased under the OREDP.  My Department&rsquo;s multi-annual ocean energy development budget covering the period 2013 - 2016, was increased by &euro;16.8 million, to bring total cumulative funding to &euro;26.3 million.  This funding supports Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to world class infrastructure including the Lir National Ocean Test Facility in Cork, the quarter scale Galway Bay test site, and the full scale Atlantic Marine Energy Test Site (AMETS), off the coast of Mayo.  Exchequer support also includes funding to support a grant scheme for ocean wave companies known as the Prototype Development Fund, operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  Eighty five projects have been awarded grants totalling &euro;13m since the programme commenced in 2009.</p></reply>

This process is additional to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission's role in assessing mergers in the State on competition grounds. There is no retrospective element to this legislation.   Attempting to intervene in the operation of a media business when no merger is planned would be difficult, and given that the purpose of the legislation is to safeguard media pluralism, is also likely to be counter-productive.</p>  <p>  Protection of media plurality and freedom of expressions are core tenets of a free press. Ensuring that this continues to be the case underpinned the change in the approach to the consideration of media mergers in the 2014 Act. Applying a retrospective element to the legislation would be substantially different to dealing with proposed mergers, both on a practical and legal level, and could, effectively, mean empowering a Government Minister to determine the fate of any media organisation at any given time. </p>  <p>  This would raise a number of difficult questions about preserving the freedom and independence of the press, even before one considers the legal and constitutional complexities associated with retrospective action of this kind.</p>  <p>In my view, the reforms introduced in the Competition and Consumer Protection Act, 2014 have struck the correct balance in this area and are working well.</p></reply>

The National Ambulance Service have also integrated Eircodes into their Computer Aided Dispatch System and this went live in February 2016. The National Ambulance Service consider Eircode to be very important information in responding to emergency calls, particularly rapid identification of the 35% non-unique addresses in the state. Previously this caused significant operational challenges in geographically locating these addresses as some are quite isolated and hard to find without a  unique identifier. When contacting the National Emergency Operations Centre, a caller in any part of the country can give the Eircode as part of their address. This Eircode and address will be validated by the Computer Aided Dispatch System and allow the National Emergency Operations Centre call taker to locate the position of the patient&rsquo;s property along with the location of the ambulance on digital mapping. The dispatcher will then direct the nearest available Ambulance to the correct location facilitating speedier access to care. </p>  <p>  In addition, the National Ambulance Aeromedical Service also use Eircodes. Eircode use has proved useful to quickly verify and locate an address / incident location on the shared secure digital mapping system used by the Air Corps, Coast Guard and the Ambulance Service. This is particularly the case in rural areas where many houses have no house number and use the same Locality name in their address. As time is critical, a suitable landing site close to the incident can be selected quickly to co-ordinate a rendezvous between the ambulance and helicopter for the quick transfer of the patient to an appropriate hospital.</p></reply>

The cattle in question were, at the time of the cull, in the ownership of the Official Assignee in Bankruptcy, who is an officer of the Court with specific statutory functions and duties to discharge. As the Deputy will be aware, the cattle  were from a herd that was restricted due to tuberculosis and the Official Assignee was legally responsible for compliance with the relevant Department of Agriculture regulations. </p>  <p>  In the case to which the Deputy refers, the Defence Forces carried out the humane cull of five cattle, following consultation between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the Official Assignee. The cull was carried out pursuant to the relevant protocol between the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Defence, and under veterinary supervision. The Deputy will also be aware that there is a long history to this particular case, and this decision to carry out a humane cull was taken in response to significant concerns, and in the public interest. </p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner is directly responsible for Garda operational matters, including the direction and control of Garda members.  I have no direct role in relation to these matters.  I am informed that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na attended at the farm in question in Co. Monaghan to deal with any possible breach of the peace.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may attend at such incidents in order to prevent a breach of the peace or a criminal offence occurring and in complying with the functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as provided at section 7(1), Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005, as amended.</p></reply>

The additional transparency requirements that will now apply with the forthcoming commencement of that Part of the 2015 Act are intended to complement those other measures being taken by the Government, with the support of the National Competitiveness Council and other key agencies, to keep legal and other transactional costs in the State at levels that can sustain or enhance our national competitiveness. It is also in the interests of legal service providers to maintain their cost attractiveness to clients at levels which will not place that sector at a competitive disadvantage. This is even more the case in an era when new business technologies and outsourcing are bypassing geographical location and other factors that would previously have sheltered some markets. At State level the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Office of Government Procurement have also taken systemic steps to manage the major annual expenditure of State bodies on legal services. </p>  <p>  All legal practitioners will be obliged, under the provisions of the new Legal Services Regulation Act, to provide more detailed information about legal costs from the outset of their dealings with clients. This will be in the form of a Notice, written in clear language, which must be provided when a legal practitioner takes instructions. Among other things, the Notice must disclose the costs that are involved, or, where this is not known, the basis upon which such costs are to be calculated. A cooling-off period is to be allowed for the consideration of costs by the client. When there are any significant developments in a case which give rise to further costs, the client must be duly updated and given the option of whether or not to proceed with proceedings. In addition, the Act sets out that it will not be permissible for legal practitioners to set fees as a specified percentage or proportion of damages payable to a client from contentious business and that it will no longer be permissible for barristers to charge junior counsel fees as a specified percentage or proportion of Senior Counsel fees.</p>  <p>  An aggrieved client will also have the option of applying for the adjudication of disputed legal costs by the reformed and modernised Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators, which is currently known as the Taxing-Masters' Office.  The Act sets out, for the first time in legislation, a series of Legal Costs Principles. There will also be a publicly accessible Register of Determinations which will disclose the outcomes and reasons for decisions made by the Legal Costs Adjudicators. The Act will also introduce a system for processing complaints about excessive costs weighted towards the less costly option of informal resolution. </p>  <p>  The 2015 Act sets out a clear path to new Legal Partnerships business models involving barrister/barrister partnerships and barrister/solicitor partnerships, which will allow for such partnerships to open for business in competition with the more traditional lawyer structures. The new Regulatory Authority will be carrying out public consultations and reporting with further legislative recommendations over its first four years in areas such as removing existing client money and direct access restrictions relating to barristers; examining entry and training requirements for the legal profession; unification of the two legal professions and the opening of the market to multi-disciplinary practices. </p>  <p>  Overall, the 2015 Act seeks to achieve greater flexibility in the legal-services market, more competition and improved access to justice. Its combined measures will enable those availing of legal services, be they private consumers or enterprise, to identify costs more clearly, including in competition with other possible legal service providers. Both the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the Consumers Association will have members on the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority whose appointment is shortly to be considered for approval, as required under the 2015 Act, by a motion of both Houses.</p>  <p>  The Mediation Bill, which is currently being drafted in the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, will also introduce an obligation on solicitors and barristers to advise any person intending to commence legal proceedings to give consideration to using mediation as an alternative means of resolving disputes. The Bill will also provide that a court may, following the commencement of any such proceedings, on its own initiative or at the request of a party to the proceedings, invite the parties to consider mediation as an alternative option and suspend the proceedings to facilitate that process.  It is intended that the Mediation Bill will help to reduce recourse to the courts, as well as the costs and delays which may arise during court proceedings.</p></reply>

The scheduling of court cases and the allocation of court business is a matter for the Presidents of the courts and the presiding judge who are under the Constitution independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. The Court of Appeal was established by order of the Government on 28 October 2014 and sat for the first time on 5 November 2014.</p>  <p>  Since the Court was established on 28 October 2014 to 30 June 2016, a total of 1,735 appeals were disposed of, comprising 1,065 civil appeals and 670 criminal appeals. The current waiting times (as at 30 June 2016) are as follows:</p>  <p>  Criminal appeals &ndash; 4 to 5 months from the date of lodgement of the written submissions of the appellant. This compares with 15 months waiting time in the Court of Criminal Appeal prior to the establishment of the Court of Appeal; and</p>  <p>  Civil appeals &ndash; 17 months from the date of lodgement of the appeal. This compares with an average of 48 months for non-priority cases to be heard in the Supreme Court prior to the establishment of the Court of Appeal.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Court of Appeal has had a significant impact on waiting times and this has greatly improved the overall efficiency of our courts system.</p></reply>

The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks. </p><p>The Central Bank of Ireland has a statutory responsibility to ensure firms assess risks appropriately and offer insurance at a price that adequately takes into account the conditions prevailing in the market such as increasing claims costs. This ensures firms have the ability to pay all policyholders' claims without recourse to public or consumer funds.  The Central Bank does not have a statutory role in relation to setting premium prices.</p><p>The Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code was introduced in 2006 and revised in 2012.  This Code applies to the regulated activities of regulated entities operating in the State.  It requires firms to act honestly fairly and professionally in the best interest of consumers, act with due care and diligence, and it prohibits firms from misleading customers.  </p><p>As previously advised, a task force has been established within my Department to undertake a Review of various aspects of Policy in the Insurance Sector.  To date, the task force has been working on three specific insurance policy reviews, as follows: </p><p>1.  A review of the framework for motor insurance compensation. This is a Joint Working Group involving the Department of Finance working closely with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p><p>2. A review of flood insurance options has been carried out by the Department of Finance and is now feeding into the final report of the Inter-Departmental Flood Policy Group, chaired by Se&aacute;n Canney TD.</p><p>3. A review of the cost of insurance. To date the Department of Finance has engaged in bilateral consultations with the main stakeholders. This initial work will now be built upon through a Working Group chaired by the Minister of State, Eoghan Murphy TD. Progress on these reviews is outlined below:</p><p><b>Review of the framework for motor insurance compensation</b></p><p>A Joint Working Group between my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has carried out a review of the framework for motor insurance compensation in Ireland, in the event of a failure of an insurance company.  The objective of the review is to identify the features of a motor insurance compensation framework that is comprehensive, effective, affordable and consumer-focused. </p><p>The Joint Working Group met on nine occasions in the period January to June 2016.  In addition to these meetings, the Joint Working Group also met and engaged with relevant stakeholders involved in the governance and administration of the motor insurance compensation system, including the Central Bank of Ireland, the Accountant of the Courts of Justice, the State Claims Agency and representatives of the insurance industry in Ireland.  The review also considered models in place in other jurisdictions.</p><p>The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and I are currently considering the Joint Working Group's report with a view to publication in the coming weeks.  The report includes recommendations aimed at providing certainty regarding the compensation framework in Ireland.  </p><p><b>Review of flood insurance</b></p><p>The Department of Finance has carried out a review of options for flood insurance with particular focus on the strategies that other jurisdictions have implemented to increase the availability of flood insurance cover.  This work examined a number of policy options and the completed report has been sent to the Office of Public Works to feed into the final report of the Inter-Departmental Group, chaired by Se&aacute;n Canney TD, Minister of State with special responsibility for the Office of Public Works and Flood Relief.</p><p><b>Review of the cost of insurance</b></p><p>An important element of the review of policy in the insurance sector is an assessment of the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance.  My officials have met bilaterally over recent months with the Central Bank, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, with representatives of the insurance industry in Ireland and with  other interested Government Departments and Offices. </p><p>Following the D&aacute;il Private Members' Motion on this matter on 8 and 9 June, the scope of the review has been broadened to include other matters raised in that debate.Progress will be overseen by a Working Group with representatives from all relevant Departments and Agencies and chaired by Minister of State Eoghan Murphy.  The Working Group will examine issues that can be addressed on a more immediate basis and also those that require more long-term policy solutions.  The first meeting of the Working Group will take place on 20 July with further meetings scheduled for early September and in the coming months.</p></reply>

However, I am not aware of any reason why the change described by the Deputy should impact on mortgage holders.</p>  <p>  I understand that the bank to which the Deputy refers engaged in the sale of loans.  The Deputy will be aware that the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2015 was enacted on 8 July 2015.  The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'.  This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes.  Under the Act, a firm must either be regulated themselves or the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm who is regulated by the Central Bank.  In addition, it should be noted that the transfer of a loan from one entity to another does not change the terms of the contract or the borrower's rights and obligations under the contract.</p></reply>

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that this relief, known as "agricultural relief" is provided for in Section 89 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act (CATCA) 2003.  The relief takes the form of a 90% reduction in the taxable market value of the gifted or inherited agricultural property where certain conditions are satisfied.  The key conditions are that the person receiving the gift or inheritance is a farmer and continues to use the property for farming purposes.</p>  <p>  For gifts or inheritances taken prior to 1 January 2015 agricultural relief is clawed back where there is a disposal of all or part of the agricultural property within 6 years of the date of the gift or inheritance.  A clawback will not arise, however, if the disposal is by way of a gift or if the proceeds of the disposal are reinvested in other agricultural property within one year of the sale.  The extent of any clawback depends on the amount of the proceeds from the disposal that are not appropriately reinvested.  If the full proceeds are so reinvested there is no clawback of relief; if only part of the proceeds are so reinvested, there is a partial clawback of the relief.</p>  <p>  From the information supplied it would appear that a clawback of agricultural relief may not apply to the proposed transfer, even if made within the 6 year clawback period, in certain circumstances.  These circumstances are if the nephew disposes of the land by way of sale to his son at an "arms length" price and re-invests the full proceeds of that sale in replacement agricultural property or if he disposes of it by way of a gift to his son. </p>  <p>  In this latter case, the son may be liable to CAT if the value of the gift, when aggregated with all other gifts and inheritances from a parent since 5 December 1991, exceeds the current relevant exemption threshold of &euro;280,000.</p></reply>

The work of the Teaching Council is grounded in the values of professionally led regulation, shared professional responsibility and collective professional confidence.</p>  <p>  The period between qualification and fully independent practice as a teacher is a vital stage of the newly qualified teacher's career.  During this phase the newly qualified teacher's development as a practising professional is facilitated by coherent and supportive induction and probation processes specified by the Teaching Council, which all teachers must successfully complete to achieve full registration.  The Teaching Council works closely with the Department to ensure appropriate supports for newly qualified teachers are in place and the Department funds the national induction programme for teachers, NIPT.</p>  <p>  A number of measures have been taken in recent years to facilitate newly qualified teachers in achieving full registration with the Teaching Council.  The minimum service requirement for probation for primary teachers has been reduced from 170 days to 100 days. </p>  <p>  Under Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act applicants for teaching posts in recognised schools are required to be registered with the Teaching Council.</p>  <p>  While the recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill teaching posts is a matter for the individual school or Education and Training Board, subject to procedures agreed under Section 24(3) of the Education Act 1998 (as amended by the Education (Amendment) Act 2012), Circular 31/2011 details a number of measures for recruitment of teachers.</p>  <p>  My Department has directed managerial authorities of schools to recruit unemployed teachers ahead of retired ones.  Each principal must report to his or her board of management on a regular basis that a list of unemployed registered teachers is being maintained, and the circumstances, where relevant, that a registered teacher in receipt of a public service pension or an unregistered person has been engaged.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should also note that this September 2,260 additional teaching posts are available in our primary and post primary schools due to additional funding secured in Budget 2016.  These posts, together with the measures outlined above, will enhance the opportunities for newly qualified teachers to obtain post qualification teaching experience to achieve full registration with the Teaching Council.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note also that a newly qualified teacher who is unable to complete a condition for registration within the specified period may apply to the Teaching Council for an extension to that period.</p></reply>

The report is comprehensive and clearly outlines the funding challenges in the sector and offers a number of approaches and recommendations for consideration. As committed to in the Programme for Government, I am referring the report to the Education Committee as part of the process for formulating a plan for the future of the sector. This will ensure that all views can be heard and considered.</p><p>It will be necessary to develop the wide consensus needed for increased resources and a more fundamental reform to the funding model &ndash; the more the goals of students, families, employers and the State are transparently being delivered, the more they will each see that their investment is worthwhile and the more compelling the case for investment. Funding must match national ambitions and the system should provide more comprehensive supports to a wider range of students.</p><p>We will require political and societal consensus to enable us to move forward with a realistic and achievable strategy for funding the system into the future. I do not want to in any way influence the Education Committee's work which must analyse all of the options put forward by the Expert Group and allow the voice of all stakeholders and all sides of the debate to be heard.</p><p>In addition, my Department will be working with the Higher Education Authority (HEA) over the summer on a revised System Performance Framework of strategic dialogue with higher education institutions which will establish clear goals for the system for the next 5 years across priority areas such as access, research and developing our pipeline of human capital. My Department, in co-operation with the HEA, will also undertake a review of current state funding mechanisms to ensure the right tools and incentives are in place to achieve these goals.</p></reply>

All statutory approvals have been obtained and the Stage 2b submission was recently approved by the Department.</p>  <p>  However, on 1st January 2016 there were 66 major projects under construction. Since the start of this year 14 more major projects have been progressed to construction and there are currently 36 projects authorised to progress through the tender process with a view to starting on site in the coming months. That represents a total of 116 major projects either under construction or progressing to commence construction in 2016. These projects were authorised to proceed under previous Minister O'Sullivan, and this means that the existing contractual commitments for 2016 now fully account for the funding which was allocated for 2016 by the previous Minister.</p>  <p>  While the project for the school in question was included on the 5 year Construction Programme 2012-2016 it was not at a sufficiently advanced stage to be considered for inclusion with those projects when they were authorised to proceed to tender earlier this year.</p>  <p>  The capital allocation to the primary and post-primary schools sector for 2016 is a total of &euro;527million. The construction costs of all major projects already on site and progressing through the tender process in 2016, the provision of classroom accommodation to schools under the Departments Additional Accommodation Scheme, the continued replacement of prefabs, an Emergency Works scheme, the purchase of sites and a Summer Works programme for 2016 more than account for the totality of this funding available.</p>  <p>  Officials of the Department will continue to closely monitor expenditure on existing contractual commitments over the coming months and, as funding allows, other projects, including the project for this school will be considered for progression through the tender process with a view to starting on site as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Accordingly, whereas I provide funding and policy direction for schools, neither I nor the Department have legal powers to instruct schools to follow a particular course of direction with regards to individual complaint cases, or to investigate individual complaints except where the complaint involves a refused enrolment, expulsion or suspension, in accordance with Section 29 of the 1998 Education Act.</p>  <p>  In dealing with parental complaints, my Department's role is to clarify for parents how their grievances and complaints against schools can be progressed. If a parent wishes to make a complaint against a teacher or school they should contact the relevant school authorities. The complaint procedures adopted by most schools are those that have been agreed between the teacher unions and school management bodies. Where a parent feels that the school's board of management has failed to investigate or adequately investigate their complaint, they should contact the Ombudsman for Children.</p>  <p>  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints about schools recognised with the Department of Education and Skills, provided the parent has firstly and fully followed the school's complaints procedures. The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the action of the school has had a negative affect on a child. The office can be contacted at Ombudsman for Children's Office, Millennium House, 52-56 Great Strand Street, Dublin1, (Ph) 1800 20 20 40 or (01) 8656800, E-mail oco@oco.ie"</p></reply>

The desire of parents for diversity in education is primarily being pursued by increasing the number of non-denominational and multi-denominational schools with a view to reaching 400 by 2030. The Government is committed to working with all stakeholders to facilitate this process and I am progressing these matters as a priority.</p>  <p>  In relation to the demographic analyses, my Department uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise. In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, the Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas.  The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own databases. With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.</p>  <p>  The 2015 demographic analysis indicated that, while the school planning areas in South Kildare are experiencing some demographic growth, the level of growth and the rate of year-on-year increase are not to such an extent that would currently warrant the provision of an additional new post-primary school at this point.  However, these areas are continuing to be kept under ongoing review by my Department to take account of updated child benefit data and updated enrolment data and the impact of existing and planned capacity increases in this area.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government targets enactment of this legislation before September 2017.</p>  <p>  The Admissions Bill will provide that where a school has places available it must admit all applicants. The Bill will also require all schools to publish their admissions policies, which will include details of the school's arrangements for students who do not wish to attend religious instruction.</p>  <p>  At present the Admissions Bill is silent in relation to any power to determine a limitation on priority for children of past pupils where a school is oversubscribed either by setting a percentage or otherwise. I consider that in bringing the Bill through the Oireachtas, there will be opportunities for members to raise and fully debate this matter, which I plan to deal with in primary legislation by way of an amendment to the Bill.</p>  <p>  The Bill provides the enabling power for the Minister to prescribe regulations, following consultation with the relevant education stakeholders, for the purpose of the preparation and publication by schools of admission policies and the admission of students to schools.</p>  <p>  The Bill provides that the Minister may make regulations in relation to the selection criteria which schools shall be permitted to apply and/or selection criteria that schools shall be prohibited from applying (such as the date on which an application for admission was received by the school) in cases where the number of students seeking admission to the school is greater than the number of places available at the school.</p>  <p>  Any determination in relation to an acceptable phasing out period for waiting lists will be made following stakeholder engagement. The draft regulations, which were published in September 2013, suggested five years as an appropriate phasing out period.</p>  <p>  Following enactment of the Admissions Bill, the draft regulations will be updated and circulated for consultation with the relevant stakeholders.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location. The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level. The staffing arrangements for schools for the  2016/17 school year are set out in Department Circular 0007/2016 which is available on the website.</p>  <p>  My Department publishes annual statistics on class size data for each school. The most recent statistics are for the 2015/16 school year. These statistics are available on the Department website. The national average class size is 24.9 pupils. However, with over 21,700 classes in over 3,100 primary schools throughout the country there will always be variations in class sizes at individual school level.

The staffing at the school is currently a Principal with 11 mainstream teachers and two special education teachers. The enrolments for 2015/16 school year were 295 pupils which reflects an incremental growth of 2% over the last five years. </p><p>The design team for this project was appointed in February 2012 when the project commenced architectural planning. However, the project was not included in the 5 year construction programme announced in 2012. The project was subsequently included in the 6 year construction programme announced in November 2015.</p><p>The building project for the school in question is now at an advanced stage of architectural planning. All statutory approvals have been obtained, tender documents have been prepared and the Stage 2b submission has been approved by my Department. </p><p>However, on 1st January 2016 there were 66 major projects under construction. Since the start of this year 14 more major projects have been progressed to construction and there are currently 36 projects authorised to progress through the tender process with a view to starting on site in the coming months. That represents a total of 116 major projects either under construction or progressing to commence construction in 2016. These projects were authorised to proceed under previous Minister O'Sullivan, and this means that the existing contractual commitments for 2016 now fully account for the funding which was allocated for 2016 by the previous Minister. The project for the school in question was not at a sufficiently advanced stage to be considered for inclusion with those projects when they were authorised to proceed to tender earlier this year.</p><p>This has meant that the progression of the major extension and refurbishment project for the school in question to tender stage is not possible at this time. Department officials wrote to the Board of Management on 28th April notifying them of this. </p><p>A meeting with senior officials in my Department's school building unit can be arranged and my Department will contact the school authorities directly in this regard.</p></reply>

It is now available to all qualified households in 19 local authority areas with over 11,000 households supported since the scheme commenced.</p><p>With regard to the number of persons receiving the Housing Assistant Payment (HAP) in each local authority, my Department has made available on its website information on the number of persons receiving HAP in each local authority area for Q1 2016 at:</p><p>. <font color="#FF0000"> </font><font color="#FF0000"> </font></p><p>The information requested on the number of persons receiving HAP in each local authority area for Q2 2016 is being compiled and will be made available on my Department&rsquo;s website as soon as possible.</p><p>Funding for the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme has increased year on year, since it commenced in September 2014, in order to meet the continuing costs of existing HAP households, and the costs of additional households being supported. In 2016 Exchequer funding allocated to HAP was &euro;47.7m. The majority of this funding is to support on-going rent payments to landlords in respect of existing HAP households and the cost of additional HAP tenancies as households find accommodation through the scheme during the year. Funding also includes the operational costs of the HAP Shared Service Centre and the costs of the HAP administrative payment made to local authorities operating the scheme.</p><p>The annualised cost of the average monthly rent paid to landlords in 2015 is estimated as &euro;6,804. This is not a representative cost given the scheme&rsquo;s distribution and phased introduction since September 2014. In the future, this average landlord payment cost will increase arising from the introduction of the revised maximum rent limits from 1 July 2016, as well as the additional flexibility in relation to the application of the rent limits that has been made available to local authorities to use when they deem necessary. </p><p>Under HAP, local authorities make payments, subject to rent limits, on behalf of the HAP recipient directly to the landlord in respect of rent. The HAP recipient will then pay a rent contribution to the local authority. The rent contribution is a differential rent &ndash; that is, a rent set by the local authority based on income and the ability to pay.</p><p>Under the HAP scheme, eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector; this accommodation must be within the HAP rent limits, which are based on the size of the household and the rental market in the relevant local authority area.</p><p>The Homelessness Pilot of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme has been operational since February 2015 across the four housing authorities in the Dublin Region, i.e. Dublin City Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, Fingal County Council and South Dublin County Council and is being implemented through the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE). The focus of the pilot scheme is to transition qualified households from emergency accommodation into private rented tenancies. </p><p>As of 11 July 2016, 475 homeless households, referred by the homeless units, including the Homeless HAP Pilot Scheme being managed by the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, are being supported by the HAP scheme in the following local authority areas:<table><tr><th><div>Local Authority </div></th><th><div>HAP Tenancies Referred from Homeless Units </div></th></tr><tr><td>Carlow County Council  </td><td><div>1 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Clare County Council  </td><td><div>2 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork City Council </td><td><div>1 </div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cork County Council </td><td><div>8 </div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Galway City Council  </td><td><div>1 </div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Galway County Council  </td><td><div>3 </div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Kildare County Council  </td><td><div>12 </div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County Council </td><td><div>16 </div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City &amp;amp; County Council </td><td><div>13 </div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Louth County Council </td><td><div>27 </div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo County Council  </td><td><div>2 </div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan County Council </td><td><div>15 </div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Offaly County Council  </td><td><div>4 </div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo County Council  </td><td><div>5 </div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary County Council  </td><td><div>10 </div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council </td><td><div>27 </div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin Regional Homeless Executive </td><td><div>328 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td><div>475 </div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

In accordance with section 4 of the 2015 Act, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government must submit a National Mitigation Plan (NMP) to Government for approval by June 2017.  The primary objective of the NMP is to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional actions in the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the transition agenda to 2050.  In line with the requirements of section 4(3)(a) of the 2015 Act, arrangements are currently being made to enable the formal statutory process required to facilitate the preparation of the first NMP.  Notwithstanding this statutory process, work has been underway for some time on the development of the NMP with a draft due to be published for consultation by end 2016.</p><p>While climate policy has been, and must continue to be, focussed on limiting greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with our national, EU and international obligations, taking steps to adjust human and natural systems in response to existing or expected climate change so as to prevent or moderate environmental damage or to take advantage of any opportunities that may arise, is also an urgent policy priority.  Accordingly, under section 5 of the 2015 Act, the Minister must submit to Government for approval not later than December 2017, a National Adaptation Framework (NAF). </p><p>The NAF will specify the national strategy for the application of adaptation measures in different sectors and by local authorities in their administrative areas in order to reduce the vulnerability of the State to the negative effects of climate change and to exploit any beneficial opportunities.  The 2015 Act also provides that relevant Ministers will be required to develop sectorial adaptation plans which will specify the adaptation policy measures the Minister in question proposes to adopt. </p><p>Given the important role of local government in contributing to this response, my Department is engaging closely with the sector, in collaboration with the EPA, to ensure appropriate guidance is provided and capacity is strengthened.  To this end, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources launched the <i>Local Authority Adaptation Strategy Development Guidelines</i>in May 2016 and a number of follow-up training sessions and workshops will be held over the coming months.</p><p>Finally, the Climate Change Advisory Council was established by order on 18 January 2016 under section 8 of the 2015 Act.  The Council, which is independent in the performance of its functions, provides advice to Ministers and the Government in respect of climate change matters and has met on several occasions, including during its interim period of operation, pending legal establishment, from June 2015 to January 2016.  The Council will in time prepare material to fulfil its annual and periodic reporting functions, as set out under the legislation.  To date, it has provided recommendations in relation to the proposal for Phase IV of the Emissions Trading Scheme for the period 2021 to 2030.</p><p>Overall, I am satisfied with progress under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, which provides the institutional framework necessary to allow for the development, approval and implementation of robust mitigation and adaptation policy measures.</p><p>I look forward to continuing progress being made under the 2015 Act and this work will be advanced on a whole-of-Government basis by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources under his newly configured and retitled Department, pending the making of the necessary Government Orders.</p></reply>

Planning permission is required for the operation of a new quarry and must include environmental impact assessment (EIA), where the surface area exceeds 25 hectares or where the area of extraction of stone, gravel, sand or clay exceeds 5 hectares.  These thresholds also apply in the case of a planning application for an extension of an existing quarry or where an extension would result in an increase in size greater than 25 per cent of the appropriate threshold.</p>  <p>  EIA is also required in the considerations of planning applications for new quarries or quarry extensions, other than those referred to above, where the quarry is likely to have significant effects on the environment.  In the case of all planning applications for new quarries or quarry extensions, screening for appropriate assessment relating to the Habitats Directive is also required, and the proposed development must be the subject of an appropriate assessment, where necessary. </p>  <p>  In response to the Judgment of the European Court of Justice in case C - 215/06, section 261A was inserted into the Planning and Development Act 2000 in 2010.  Under this provision, each planning authority was required to examine all existing quarries in its functional area to determine whether EIA, a screening for EIA or an appropriate assessment, should have been, but was not, carried out.  Where a planning authority determined that a quarry came within this category, the authority was required to make a further decision in relation to the planning status of the quarry, including registration status.  Following from this, the planning authority had to either take enforcement action, requiring the quarry to cease operations or direct the quarry operator to apply to An B&oacute;rd Plean&aacute;la for substitute consent, a process involving either EIA or appropriate assessment, or both, as appropriate.  The 2000 Act, and Regulations made thereunder, were amended in 2015 to address anomalies arising from the substitute consent provisions for quarries.  The most notable amendment permits quarry operators applying for substitute consent pursuant to section 261A, to apply to the Board at the same time for permission for prospective development.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.</p>  <p>  In terms of the delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation and associated funding, the approach to be followed will be guided by the Programme for Partnership Government commitment &lsquo;to establish a special working group to audit the current delivery and implementation of local authorities&rsquo; Traveller Accommodation Plans and consult with stakeholders on key areas of concern.  The group should report a plan for the delivery of safe, culturally appropriate accommodation.  I intend to further underpin this commitment in the forthcoming Action Plan for Housing.</p>  <p>  In order to progress this commitment, the Housing Agency is being asked, in the first instance, to commission an independent review of Traveller accommodation expenditure and delivery of units, having regard to the targets contained in the local authority Traveller Accommodation Programmes.  These are 5-year rolling programmes prepared and published by each local authority for the provision of Traveller accommodation in their areas.  These programmes are subject to comprehensive local stakeholder and public consultation, including members and representatives of the Traveller community.  In parallel, the composition and terms of reference of the working group to be established under the Programme for Government commitment will be scoped by the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee (NTACC), which comprises key stakeholders including representatives of the Traveller community, and submitted to me for consideration.  This is in accordance with the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 which provides, inter alia, that the NTACC may advise the Minister on general matters concerning the preparation, adequacy, implementation and co-ordination of traveller accommodation programmes.  The independent review commissioned by the Housing Agency will provide factual information and a key platform for the working group to progress its work effectively. </p>  <p>  While the timing of the finalisation of the work of the working group will be dependent upon its terms of reference and work programme, I will be mandating the group to complete their report in the earliest time possible.</p></reply>

Section 42 of the Act provides that, on application in that behalf, a planning authority shall, once and once only and provided specified conditions are met, extend the duration of a planning permission for a specified period not exceeding 5 years. These enactments provide considerable flexibility to accommodate the changed circumstances of individual developments. Nevertheless, I will keep under review whether provision might appropriately be made to allow for a second extension of the duration of planning permissions, which would enable dormant permissions to be activated more than 10 years after they were originally granted, having regard to the need to also take account of changes in national or local planning policies that may have taken place in the intervening period.</p></reply>

The average waiting time for new carer's allowance (CA) applications at the end of June was 20 weeks.  At the end of June, there were 6,375 CA applications awaiting decision.  The volume of CA claims on hands are a consequence of continued strong claim intake.

Human rights issues are discussed on a regular basis with the Chinese authorities during both bilateral and multilateral meetings, including during the visit of Premier Li Keqiang to Ireland in May 2015.</p>  <p>  Through the formal framework of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, which was established in 1995, the EU continues to share with China its experience in the field of human rights protection and promotion, and to urge China to take clear steps to improve the human rights situation.  The latest session of this dialogue took place on 30 November and 1 December 2015, and provided the EU with the opportunity to express its concerns about a wide range of human rights issues in China, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities, freedom of religion or belief, freedom of assembly and association, arbitrary detention, torture and the death penalty. The individual case of Gao Zhisheng, a human rights defender detained for denouncing the persecution of practitioners of Falun Gong, was also raised at the dialogue. Most recently, human rights issues were discussed at the 18th   EU-China Summit which was held in Beijing on 12-13 July 2016.</p>  <p>  In 2013, officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade held a series of meetings with representatives of the Irish Falun Dafa Association and human rights lawyers.  During these meetings the Irish Falun Dafa Association discussed the issue of organ harvesting and ways in which human rights issues are raised with Chinese authorities by both Ireland and the EU. However, it should be noted that the Chinese Government denies accusations of human rights abuses against those who practice Falun Gong.</p>  <p>  New laws on organ donation came into force in China at the beginning of 2015 with a view to ending the practice of forced organ transplants, including from prisoners. The Embassy of Ireland in Beijing, in cooperation with our EU partners, is monitoring the implementation of this new legislation.</p>  <p>  Ireland, together with our EU partners, will continue to address human rights issues with China, in frequent and regular dialogue, through our contacts in both Dublin and Beijing and through the relevant multilateral channels.</p></reply>

There are few western countries as consistently engaged on this issue as Ireland. I have worked continuously to try and maintain the problems of Palestine on the EU and international agenda, despite a wave of concurrent crises in the immediate neighbourhood, and have urged stronger international actions. We will continue to do so.</p>  <p>  I have myself recently returned from my second extensive visit to the area in just over a year, meeting the parties and trying to urge them to move forward.</p>  <p>  Ireland is also engaged on the ground in trying to combat the effects of the occupation, both through our own humanitarian work and through our support of local NGOs engaged on justice and human rights work, a number of whom are among the signatories of this letter.</p>  <p>  I fully share the frustration of the signatories, of Deputies in the House, and of others, that the process has been completely stalled in recent years, and that there is not a stronger international will to drive it forward. I have therefore given the Government&rsquo;s full support to the efforts by France in recent weeks to do just that.</p>  <p>  The letter, and the Questions posed by Deputies, make particular reference to the call for trade sanctions upon Israel. We have discussed this question on many occasions, with this NGO, here in the House, and elsewhere. The essential point remains unchanged: I am opposed to sanctions and, in any event, there is no possibility of obtaining any support for such sanctions at EU level, which is where they would have to be implemented.  I have, however, been an advocate of measures which differentiate clearly between Israel and the illegally occupied settlements.  These include the guidelines adopted on research co-operation which exclude entities based in the settlements from benefitting from funding under the EU-Israel research agreement, and on origin of products to ensure that consumers are not misled as to the provenance of any products emanating from the settlements.</p></reply>

There will be a particular focus on ensuring that the rights of marginalised communities such as peasants, indigenous groups and the Afro-Colombian community are respected and supported. </p>  <p>  Civil society organisations in Bogot&aacute; were briefed by the European Union Delegation on 28 June on how the mechanisms for engagement with the fund will work. This consultation with civil society will continue on a regular basis. In addition, it is planned to develop a consultation mechanism between national institutions and the regional and local level (including civil society) to promote a bottom up approach to local economic development.</p>  <p>  Regarding vigilance over Trust Fund expenditure, both the Fund and the actions financed by it will be subject to the monitoring and evaluation rules applicable to all EU external aid programmes with a view to ensuring economy, efficiency and effectiveness. The Constitutive Agreement of the Fund provides for strong audit and control oversight by the European Anti-Fraud Office, the European Commission&rsquo;s internal auditor and the Court of Auditors. The Fund&rsquo;s annual accounts will be submitted to the Operational Committee, on which Ireland will be represented, for its approval. </p>  <p>  Ireland has provided more than &euro;5 million since 2009 to international and local civil society organizations in Colombia and, through our Embassy in Mexico, maintains an ongoing dialogue with Colombian civil society on development and human rights priorities, as do many other EU Member States based in Bogot&aacute;.

The report adds to the large volume of information already available on the situation in Gaza, published by UN organisations and international NGOs.</p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently drawn attention over many years to the situation in Gaza, and the need to break the hopeless cycle of counterproductive restrictions on border movements of goods and people, punctuated by destructive episodes of serious violence. In particular, the EU has called consistently for the opening of Gaza&rsquo;s borders to the normal movement of people and goods. </p>  <p> I discussed the situation in Gaza with the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and with Palestinian Prime Minister, Rami Hamdallah, during my recent visit.  I also received a detailed briefing on the current situation from the UNRWA Deputy Commissioner General, Sandra Mitchell, who had that day returned from Gaza. </p>  <p>  It is also important to recognise that Israel has legitimate security concerns about attacks from Gaza, although we do not consider that the current regime of restrictions are necessitated by or contribute to meeting those security needs. Instead, the situation in Gaza does not provide security for either Palestinians or Israelis, and it is imperative on authorities on both sides to try to find a new way forward. It was hoped that such a process might follow the Cairo conference on Gaza reconstruction in October 2016, which I attended, but so far this has not happened.</p>  <p>  UN organisations have detailed a number of relaxations of the border controls in various ways in recent years. For example, UNRWA briefed me on the considerable progress that has been made in the reconstruction of schools and medical facilities. It would be unhelpful to deny such positive moves as there are. </p>  <p>  However, I have also been quite clear that these measures, welcome as they have been, are not enough, and that conditions in Gaza remain unacceptable.</p>  <p>  If Israel has been attempting to make the restrictions on Gaza &ldquo;acceptable at the international level&rdquo;, to use the Deputy&rsquo;s phrase, although the report does not really say anything about this, they have clearly not succeeded.</p></reply>

Regrettably, it was resumed on political direction in recent years, principally it would seem to demonstrate that the authorities were taking action . It is in most cases the families of the alleged attacker who are the victims of this punishment.  The same measures are not carried out against the families of Israelis who engage in violent attacks.</p>  <p>  The wave of violent attacks by some Palestinians in recent months clearly called for some security response, but as I and many other international leaders made clear, it was essential that such response be measured and discriminate.  Indiscriminate measures, such as punishing the families of dead attackers, have been shown to be not just unwarranted, but also ineffective and even counterproductive.</p></reply>

The commitment to this policy was reconfirmed last year in the Foreign Policy review &ldquo;The Global Island&rdquo; and in the White Paper on Defence.</p>  <p>  Although not a member of NATO, Ireland has long recognised the importance of practical cooperation between the EU and NATO in areas where this has added value, such as ensuring that Irish Defence Forces personnel can operate securely and effectively alongside contingents from other countries in UN-mandated peace support operations.</p>  <p>  This is on the basis that cooperation is between two separate and autonomous organisations, and that cooperation is consistent with and does not affect our longstanding policy of military neutrality.</p>  <p>  Co-operation between the EU and NATO takes place within the framework of the Lisbon Treaty.  The legally-binding Irish Protocol to the Lisbon Treaty expressly states that &ldquo;The Treaty of Lisbon does not affect or prejudice Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Last month the European Council agreed that there should be accelerated practical cooperation between the EU and NATO in selected areas.  The Council conclusions stated that cooperation will take place &ldquo;in full respect of the decision-making autonomy and procedures of both organisations&rdquo; and will be &ldquo;without prejudice to the specific character of the security and defence policy of any Member State.&rdquo;  These stipulations are also included in the text of the Declaration signed last week. </p>  <p>  These provisions make clear the distinction between the two organisations and underline that there are no implications for Ireland&rsquo;s military neutrality.</p></reply>

In particular, it aimed to discourage the victims of people smugglers from risking their lives crossing the Aegean Sea.  The very significant decline in the number of people attempting to cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to the Greek Islands since this agreement entered into force, suggests that it is achieving its aims.</p>  <p>  A critical element of EU engagement with Turkey is to assist in alleviating the suffering of those most affected by the migration crisis: those who have had to flee their homes.  The EU Facility for Refugees in Turkey with its &euro;3 billion budget is intended to ensure that the needs of refugees and host communities are addressed in a comprehensive and coordinated manner.  This Facility aims to support Syrians and other refugees by providing access to food, shelter, education, and healthcare.  The activities to be financed under the Facility are aimed at meeting immediate humanitarian needs, as well as long term sustainable improvements in the health, education and self-reliance of those forced to flee their homes.  The monies allocated to Turkey will be ring-fenced so that finances are channelled to measures to support the refugee crisis, including to enhance basic health services, access to clean water, housing and education.</p>  <p>  The implementation of the EU Facility for Turkey is guided by a strategic framework, agreed at the meeting of its Steering Committee on 12 May.  This framework is clear that any measures which may be funded through the Facility to support the Turkish authorities in the field of migration management, and combatting irregular migration, are primarily with a view to avoiding the terrible humanitarian tragedies which we have witnessed, notably in the Aegean Sea.  Ireland, as a member of the Steering Committee, will work to ensure that the Facility is used in a way which is fully compatible with this strategic framework and which respects the human rights of all concerned.</p></reply>

The legislative provision for this is Section 4 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act 1963.  It provides for the transfer of pensionable service in the case of staff transfers between the Civil Service and "approved organisations", and between one "approved organisation" and another.  The Act provides that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform may, by Statutory Instrument, designate an organisation as an "approved organisation" for the purpose of that Section.  Membership of the Transfer network is entirely voluntary and organisations may, if they wish, apply to join provided they have a pension scheme which would be considered compatible with Public Service pension arrangements and could comply with the rules of the Transfer Network.  Ability West is not currently a member of the Public Service Transfer Network.</p>  <p>  Where a person has preserved superannuation benefits with a non-member of the Transfer Network and that scheme is prepared to pay a Transfer Value to the person's current pension scheme, the individual may be credited with service equivalent to the converted service value of the amount received using the purchase of notional service tables.  This is a transfer of benefits rather than service so year-for-year credit does not apply.  If Ability West has a pension scheme and the individual in question has preserved benefits in the scheme, or indeed in a scheme with any other former employer(s), they might wish to consider pursuing this option.</p></reply>

There are a variety of pension schemes that operate in the public service depending on when and how an individual enters the public service.  In general, the majority of public servants are members of various public service &lsquo;pay as you go&rsquo; Defined Benefit (DB) schemes which may have different minimum pension age, accrual terms, contribution rates etc.  In addition, some employees of Section 38 agencies are members of funded Defined Benefit pension schemes which are administered by scheme trustees while others are members of Defined Contribution (DC) schemes. New entrants to the public service recruited on or after 1 January 2013 are generally members of the Single Public Service Pension Scheme (SPSPS) and have career average pension benefits. </p>  <p>  In relation to the 44 employees of the Central Remedial Clinic (CRC) who were members of a funded DB scheme, I am aware that the CRC has made a submission to the HSE which the HSE is currently evaluating.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment in advance of receipt of the HSE's recommendation. </p>  <p>  I am most concerned about this issue and once a detailed proposal is received by my Department, it will be examined as a matter of urgency.</p></reply>

These reports have been accepted by the Board which has acknowledged that appropriate standards and procedures were not always applied to operational and governance matters.  The reports have been submitted to the Department of health for consideration and were recently published on the NMBI website.  The Department of Health is working closely with the NMBI to ensure that enhanced governance procedures are implemented and that robust management and operational processes are introduced.  Notwithstanding the shortcomings raised in these reports the Board has confirmed that its regulatory functions, including all such functions relating to fitness to practice, have always been dealt with in accordance with statutory requirements.  The NMBI is already implementing the reports&rsquo; recommendations and is committed to ensuring that all necessary steps will be taken to ensure that these events to not re-occur.</p>  <p>  A new President and a new interim CEO have been appointed and the post of Director of Finance and Corporate Services has been advertised.  The actions being taken on foot of these reports will provide the framework for the Board to perform its functions efficiently and effectively, in an open and transparent manner while delivering on its core responsibilities of public protection and the promotion of the nursing and midwifery professions.</p>  <p>  While these problems should not have arisen, they are now being addressed.  It is important therefore that they should not undermine or overshadow the extensive work being undertaken by the NMBI as the regulator for the nursing and midwifery profession.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the change management programme currently underway in the NMBI will ensure that it delivers on its statutory requirements in an appropriate manner into the future.</p></reply>

The Bill is part of a suite of measures agreed on foot of the recommendations in the Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy.  The Government approved the publication of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill and the introduction of the Bill in the Houses of the Oireachtas on the 8 December 2015.  The Bill completed Second Stage in the Seanad on the 17 December 2015.  The Bill has been restored to the Seanad Order Paper and it is expected that it will commence Committee Stage early in the next term.</p>  <p>  The European Court of Justice ruled on 23 December 2015 on proposals by the Scottish Government to introduce Minimum Unit Pricing (MUP).  The Court judgment is broadly in line with the Advocate General&rsquo;s opinion in October last year when it states that the legislation may be justified on the grounds of the protection of health if it is proportionate to the objective pursued, and cannot be achieved by other measures such as taxation.</p>  <p>  My Department and the Office of the Attorney General are considering the implications of the judgement.  A strong and convincing case can be made in favour of MUP over other measures.  I believe that MUP is a proportionate measure and the only measure that would effectively target the widespread access to alcohol that is very cheap relative to its strength.  This was backed up by the research conducted by Sheffield University which showed that MUP changes behaviour in those most at risk.  On the other hand, the study found that a ban on below-cost selling (implemented as a ban on selling alcohol for below the cost of duty and Value Added Tax) would have a negligible impact on alcohol consumption or related harms.</p>  <p>  The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill also provides for the making of regulations to prohibit or restrict a person from engaging in certain promotion practices.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, which are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the Drugs Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange health services for themselves and their dependants.  In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.</p></reply>

Before a medicine can be placed on the Irish market the manufacturer has to seek an authorisation from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) or in the case of certain medicinal products, the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  In the case of Ampligen, because of the biotechnology nature of the active substance involved, any application for a marketing authorisation must be made to the EMA.

Under the Code summary details of how IPHA member companies engage with and support healthcare professionals and healthcare organisations through direct or indirect financial support, or &lsquo;Transfers of Value&rsquo;, will be made public on from that date.  This means that each IPHA member company and also some non-IPHA voluntary contributors will provide an annual report that includes details of supports provided to healthcare professionals and organisations related to research and development, events, donations and grants and fees for services and consultancy.  </p><p>Medical research and the collaborative work of industry, healthcare organisations and healthcare professionals have a profound and positive influence on the quality of patient treatment and the value of future research.  Joint research and co-operation has not only helped develop life-saving medicines but also led to advancements in patient care and medical science.</p><p>Regulation of the medical profession is undertaken by the Medical Council, the key objective of which is to ensure patient safety.  We all know doctors work in a challenging environment and make decisions affecting the health and well-being of others - some decisions are indeed a matter of life or death.  So at all times they have to guard against potential conflicts which would interfere with their clinical judgment.  The Medical Council updated its <i>Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners</i>in May this year.  While the Guide is not a legal code, it sets out the principles of professional practice and conduct that all doctors registered with the Medical Council are expected to follow. </p><p>The Guide advises that doctors &quot;should not accept gifts (including hospitality) from pharmaceutical, medical devices or other commercial enterprises&quot;.  However, it further states that &quot;This does not prevent you attending educational meetings or receiving payment of reasonable fees for professional services to commercial enterprises&quot;.  The Guide directs doctors to tell patients and any other relevant party about any professional relationship they may have with pharmaceutical companies in order to show that they are acting without influence from commercial enterprise.  It also gives advice on how any funding received should be channelled to avoid conflict of interest. </p><p>I view the publication of the details on funding through IPHA, which had to obtain the consent of doctors to publish their personal information, as a validation of the fact that doctors are adhering to the principles set in the Council's <i>Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Medical Practitioners</i>and that they are transparent about any supports received.  It should help to reassure patients that doctors consider that the clinical management of their patients is paramount.  </p><p>If a member of the public, employers or other healthcare professionals has concerns about a doctor's fitness to practice medicine they may make a complaint about a doctor to the Medical Council, which will investigate any such complaint. </p></reply>

The aim of developing national policy on trauma networks is to ensure that trauma patients are brought to the right place at the right time for the right care so they can make the best recovery possible.

The implementation of Hospital Groups provides an opportunity for hospitals to work together to enhance trauma services for patients.</p>  <p>  The need for a national trauma system has been recognised for many years.  In June 2015 the National Clinical Programme for Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery published the Model of Care for trauma and orthopaedic surgery and strongly recommended that a national approach to trauma services should be taken.  The RCSI (the professional body representing all surgeons and emergency medicine specialists) also called for its establishment at their annual scientific meeting last year.  </p>  <p>  Last year, the then Minister for Health appointed a National Steering Group to develop policy on a major trauma system for Ireland.

Its counsellors and therapists are experienced in addressing trauma, loss, crisis intervention and complicated grief.</p>  <p>  The HSE audit into Console was initiated in April 2015 by the National Office for Suicide Prevention following an examination of the 2013 returns from Console to the HSE, which were received in late 2014.  The HSE has confirmed that concerns arose in a number of areas, including in relation to the corporate governance and financial management of the agency.  It should be noted, however, that the HSE has informed the Department of Health that it has not uncovered any issues with the standard of the Console services funded by the Executive.  The audit process has been concluded and an audit report sent to the HSE&rsquo;s Mental Health Division. </p>  <p>  Ministers Harris &amp;amp; McEntee were briefed on 4 July 2016 by the HSE Mental Health Division on the HSE audit of Console.  At this meeting, both Ministers emphasised that the continuation of services was an over-riding priority. </p>  <p>  On 7 July 2016, a series of meetings were held involving the HSE, Department of Health, Ministerial Advisers, Charities Regulator, service providers and the Interim CEO of Console.  The purpose of the meetings was to clarify the current position with respect to  Console and to consider how arrangements could be put in place to ensure the seamless continuation of the three services funded by the HSE currently provided by Console; the 24/7 Suicide Helpline, the Suicide Bereavement Liaison Service, and the Suicide Bereavement Counselling Service. </p>  <p>  Ministers Harris &amp;amp; McEntee met with Console&rsquo;s Interim CEO on 8 July and since then work has continued to ensure that the services provided by Console are continued.</p>  <p>  HSE management has assured the Department of Health that its first priority will be to ensure continuity of the various services provided by Console, having equal regard to the financial controls and the guidelines around the funding of agencies by the HSE.</p></reply>

On receipt of this approval, the HSE advised the Directorates of their revised budget for the year.  The Directorates, including the Acute Directorate, will in turn prepare financial plans, with actions, to demonstrate budget compliance. Patient safety and access to services will continue to be priorities, and the targets and levels of service set out in the National Service Plan remain.  Over the last two weeks I have been meeting with the Chairs and CEOs of each of the Hospital Groups.  The purpose these meetings has been to discuss the process of appointment to the Hospital Group Boards, service delivery and patient safety, as well as to emphasise the importance of budgetary compliance by Hospital Groups and individual hospitals.</p>  <p>  The financial plans and profiles based on the Revised Estimates will be prepared from a bottom up basis at individual hospital level.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-14a.643.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071400066#WRY00300"><p>The decision of the UK to leave the EU is one that creates considerable challenges for the agrifood sector.  The UK is by far our largest trading partner.  Last year we exported almost &euro;5.1 billion worth of agricultural products.  This included more than &euro;1.1 billion in beef products and almost &euro;970 million in dairy products. Ireland is also the UK&rsquo;s largest destination for its food exports - worth &euro;3.8 billion last year.    This bilateral trade takes place on the basis of harmonised EU rules on animal and public health and labelling, without complex certification, quota limits or customs duties and tariffs.  And it is underpinned by the vital support of the CAP budget, to which the UK is a significant net contributor. </p>  <p>  Given these linkages, and as the UK is a net food importer, both countries have a strong interest in maintaining a close agrifood trading relationship.  In addition, the resilience of the Irish agrifood sector is well recognised, and this, together with the strong commercial relationships built up over years of trading, will help us to negotiate our way though the challenges ahead. </p>  <p>  It is important also to bear in mind that the precise implications of the referendum outcome will depend on the trade and other arrangements ultimately negotiated between the EU and the UK.  These negotiations may take up to two years, and perhaps longer, and over that period existing arrangements will continue to apply. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, my Department has engaged in detailed contingency planning for the possibility of this result, and has published a summary of the key actions we are taking to address the contingencies arising from the UK&rsquo;s decision. </p>  <p>The most immediate concerns for exporters centre on Euro-Sterling exchange rates.  It should be noted that the fall in the value of Sterling against the Euro, while significant, is not unprecedented.  Nevertheless, a sustained period of currency volatility could be of concern.  In that regard, the Central Bank of Ireland has pre-established contingency plans to deal with market volatility surrounding the referendum result.  The Bank will engage with the Department of Finance and individual financial institutions regarding potential risks.   Actions by ECB and other global actors will be monitored closely. </p>  <p>I have also asked the relevant agencies, including Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland, to provide practical guidance to SMEs.  Last week Bord Bia announced a number of measures to support food and drink businesses.  These measures cover areas such as managing volatility impacts, providing consumer and market insight, deepening customer engagement and extending market reach, with the aim of helping companies maintain their competitiveness. Similar support is also being provided by Enterprise Ireland.   </p>  <p>  Aside from currency fluctuations, the main areas in which potential impacts are foreseen are in relation to tariffs and trade, the EU budget, regulations and standards, and customs controls and certification, while complex issues also arise for the fisheries sector. </p>  <p>  However, we must remember that our trading relationship with the UK is not altered in any way until the negotiation process that will dictate the terms and conditions of the UK&rsquo;s departure is completed.  </p>  <p>  In the meantime, and as part of our overall contingency planning, I have taken a number of measures to ensure a sensible, coherent approach is adopted, namely:</p>  <p>  -  I have established a dedicated unit in my Department to work on all of the issues that I have mentioned;</p>  <p>  -  I have convened a Consultative Committee of stakeholders, which met for the first time last week, to ensure a full exchange of information as the negotiations proceed;</p>  <p>  -  I am also ensuring that the response of the relevant agencies is fully coordinated through a contact group established under the Food Wise 2025 High Level Implementation Committee, and</p>  <p>  -  The Department will continue to feed into the central Contingency Framework being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p></reply>

New secondary legislation is now in place with the result that any adverse analytical finding from a greyhound tested for prohibited substances after October 1st 2015 will be published and the greyhound immediately banned from racing until a further test is undertaken which yields negative results.  In addition the findings of all new cases initiated after the October 1st 2015 and coming before the Control Committee and the Control Appeals Committee which, adjudicate on any possible breaches of regulation, will be published as will the reasons for their decision.  A Scientific Committee on Doping and Medication Control has been established. Its task will be to advise Bord na gCon on an ongoing basis on scientific matters relating to doping and medication control in greyhounds.  In particular it will review the current list of substances which are prohibited or controlled and, where applicable, their associated thresholds or limits, and it will advise Bord na gCon on any changes considered necessary from a scientific point of view.   </p>  <p>Also an intelligence lead testing regime has been developed targeting its resources at the areas of greatest risk.  Targeted testing has included testing in competition, at trials and also at greyhound sales.  Bord na gCon has confirmed that it has also adopted an inter-agency cooperation strategy in their anti-doping and medication control policy, insofar as legislation permits, to ensure intelligence-led mechanisms with other enforcement agencies are in place to police this area of risk for the industry whilst making the best use of the limited resources available.   </p>  <p>As an indication of how seriously Bord na gCon take this mater they commissioned a report by Professor Tim Morris, who is currently the Independent Scientific Adviser to the Greyhound Board of Great Britain on Anti-doping and Medication Control, to examine the use of doping and medication in the greyhound sector in Ireland.  The Morris report will enable Bord na gCon to further develop its policy and regulation.  It is my understanding that the board expect to publish the report in the coming weeks.  Once the Morris report is published I will examine its recommendations to determine whether any further measures are required.   </p>  <p>Both the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 and Bord na gCon&rsquo;s Welfare Code of Practice provide a strong framework for regulation and enforcement.  I will also be bringing forward the heads of a Greyhound Amendment Bill shortly to deal with issues of governance, regulation and enforcement.  In this context, I will have an opportunity, through the pre legislative scrutiny process, to hear the views of stakeholders and take them into account in determining the final shape of the Bill.   </p>  <p>  It is my firm belief that the future of the greyhound industry is dependent on the stakeholders having trust and confidence in the industry and regulation is central to the reputation of the sector.  Indecon made a number of recommendations to strengthen regulatory processes and procedures.  As already outlined a number of firm actions have already taken place and I am determined that Indecon&rsquo;s recommendations in this area will be fully implemented.</p></reply>

This marks the culmination of over a year of intensive work between my Department and its US counterparts on a range of technical matters.</p>  <p>  The new US decision paves the way for industry to undertake the steps necessary to trade to commence.  In relation to market access for the USA, Ireland had initially received a major reputational boost in 2015 as the first EU Member State to gain access to the US market for beef and six plants are currently approved to export.  By the end of December 2015 approximately 1,800 tonnes of beef, with an estimated value of &euro;14 million, had been exported from Ireland to the US.  This represents an exceptionally strong start to this trade considering that the first exports only went in March 2015 and some of the plants were only approved for export in September.  That amount looks likely to be surpassed in 2016, as by the end of June, almost 1,200 tonnes had been exported.</p>  <p>  The recent announcement by the US on our enhanced access is a huge endorsement of Irish beef and our production and regulatory systems.  Ultimately the volume and value of trade will depend on a range of factors such as currency exchange rates, relative commodity prices and global supply and demand patterns.  However, this recent extension of our access in the US has the capability to be a significant boost to the sector over a period of time.   </p>  <p>  US consumption of beef is estimated at 11 million tonnes, approximately 1 million of which is imported.  The potential prize for Irish operators is therefore, subject to the variables already outlined, very significant, particularly in circumstances where grass fed hormone free beef is gaining traction in the market place.</p>  <p>  It complements the other market outlets we have secured in the last two years, the development of which is a key element of our Food Wise 2025 strategy.  There has also been significant progress in facilitating trade in other international markets for Irish beef.  My Department continues to push strongly for market access to other Third Countries and we are currently in the process of trying to secure beef access to other third countries including China, Korea, Israel, Ukraine and Vietnam.  It is my intention to continue to focus on developing as many third country markets as possible in order to provide exporters as many commercial opportunities as possible in a competitive global market place.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-14a.677.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071400067#WRZ00700"><p>The decision of the UK to leave the EU is one that creates considerable challenges for the agrifood sector.  The UK is by far our largest trading partner.  Last year we exported almost &euro;5.1 billion worth of agricultural products.  This included more than &euro;1.1 billion in beef products and almost &euro;970 million in dairy products.  Ireland is also the UK&rsquo;s largest destination for its food exports - worth &euro;3.8 billion last year.</p>  <p>  This bilateral trade takes place on the basis of harmonised EU rules on animal and public health and labelling, without complex certification, quota limits or customs duties and tariffs.  And it is underpinned by the vital support of the CAP budget, to which the UK is a significant net contributor. </p>  <p>  Given these linkages, and as the UK is a net food importer, both countries have a strong interest in maintaining a close agrifood trading relationship.  In addition, the resilience of the Irish agrifood sector is well recognised, and this, together with the strong commercial relationships built up over years of trading, will help us to negotiate our way though the challenges ahead. </p>  <p>  It is important also to bear in mind that the precise implications of the referendum outcome will depend on the trade and other arrangements ultimately negotiated between the EU and the UK.  These negotiations may take up to two years, and perhaps longer, and over that period existing arrangements will continue to apply. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, my Department has engaged in detailed contingency planning for the possibility of this result, and has published a summary of the key actions we are taking to address the contingencies arising from the UK&rsquo;s decision.</p>  <p>  The most immediate concerns for exporters centre on Euro-Sterling exchange rates.  It should be noted that the fall in the value of Sterling against the Euro, while significant, is not unprecedented.  Nevertheless, a sustained period of currency volatility could be of concern.  In that regard, the Central Bank of Ireland has pre-established contingency plans to deal with market volatility surrounding the referendum result.  The Bank will engage with the Department of Finance and individual financial institutions regarding potential risks.  Actions by ECB and other global actors will be monitored closely.</p>  <p>  I have also asked the relevant agencies, including Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland, to provide practical guidance to SMEs.  Last week Bord Bia announced a number of measures to support food and drink businesses.  These measures cover areas such as managing volatility impacts, providing consumer and market insight, deepening customer engagement and extending market reach, with the aim of helping companies maintain their competitiveness.  Similar support is also being provided by Enterprise Ireland.   </p>  <p>  Aside from currency fluctuations, the main areas in which potential impacts are foreseen are in relation to tariffs and trade, the EU budget, regulations and standards, and customs controls and certification, while complex issues also arise for the fisheries sector. </p>  <p>  However, we must remember that our trading relationship with the UK is not altered in any way until the negotiation process that will dictate the terms and conditions of the UK&rsquo;s departure is completed.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, and as part of our overall contingency planning, I have taken a number of measures to ensure a sensible, coherent approach is adopted, namely:   </p>  <p>  -  I have established a dedicated unit in my Department to work on all of the issues that I have mentioned;</p>  <p>  -  I have convened a Consultative Committee of stakeholders, which met for the first time last week, to ensure a full exchange of information as the negotiations proceed;</p>  <p>  -  I am also ensuring that the response of the relevant agencies is fully coordinated through a contact group established under the Food Wise 2025 High Level Implementation Committee, and</p>  <p>  -  The Department will continue to feed into the central Contingency Framework being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p></reply>

In 2015 Ireland exported an estimated &euro;2.2 billion, or approximately 500,000 tonnes of beef, to almost 80 countries around the globe.  Food Wise 2025 acknowledged that there is a rising global population together with the growing middle classes in a number of rapidly growing economies and changing dietary patterns to incorporate increased protein consumption.  Taken together these provide a great opportunity for increasing the exports of high quality, safe and sustainably produced Irish beef.</p>  <p>  As a member of the European Union, Ireland already has full market access to the 27 other EU Member States for beef and other commodities produced.  Therefore Ireland has ready market access to a population of over 500 million inhabitants, which indeed is one of the many benefits that comes with being a Member of the EU.  The majority of Irish beef exported is to other EU Member States.  According to Bord Bia, in 2015 some 52% of Irish beef exports went to the UK and 36% went to other EU markets.  Recent events in markets close to home have highlighted once again the importance of diversifying our international beef markets.  As an exporting country, accessing new markets is crucial to the long-term sustainability of our beef sector.</p>  <p>  The balance of our beef exports was to non EU markets including the USA, Middle East, Philippines, Hong Kong, Ghana and Switzerland amongst others.  These Third Country markets are increasingly an important alternative outlet for the industry.  My Department engages on an ongoing basis with many Third countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia, the meat industry, Department of Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade and the European Commission on various market access issues.  My Department continues to push strongly for market access to other Third Countries.</p>  <p>  In 2015 Ireland had some notable successes including becoming the first EU Member State to gain beef access to the USA, having a BSE ban lifted by the Chinese authorities and negotiating an extension to our market access to the Philippines, where we are now the second largest supplier of beef.  More recently beef markets in Canada, Oman and the Maldives have also been opened.  Significantly our access to the US market was recently further extended to incorporate manufacturing beef, as a testament to our beef production and regulatory systems.  It is expected that similar extended beef access to Saudi Arabia will be achieved shortly.  We are currently in the process of trying to secure beef access to other third countries including, inter alia, China, South Korea, Israel, Ukraine and Vietnam.  It is my intention to continue to focus on developing as many third country markets as possible in order to provide exporters as many commercial opportunities as possible in a competitive global marketplace.</p></reply>

Though Ireland aims to meet this target mainly through the use of sustainable biofuels, the increasing use of electric vehicles will also make a small contribution.</p>  <p>  Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory based regulator.  While I as minster have no function in the matter of charging infrastructure, I understand that the Electricity  Supply Board (ESB), through its ecars programme, is continuing to roll out both publicly accessible charging infrastructure and domestic charge points for electric vehicles.  I am advised that at 12 July 2016, 911 public charge-points have now been installed nationally.  These include 79 DC fast chargers, most of which have been installed mainly on the inter-urban roads.  The location of these charge-points is available on the &lsquo;ecars&rsquo; section of the ESB&rsquo;s website at www.esb.ie.  In addition, ESB ecars has installed 1,229 domestic chargers and 542 chargers in commercial premises.</p>  <p>  The Electric Vehicle Grant Scheme supports and incentivises, through grants of up to &euro;5,000, the deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) in Ireland.  These grants are in addition to the Vehicle Registration Tax reliefs of up to &euro;5,000 which apply to EV and where technically feasible, customers who qualify for support under the scheme also qualify for a free domestic charge point installed by the ESB.  The grant scheme commenced in 2011 and, to date the purchase of 1,438 new EVs has been supported. </p>  <p>  In addition, work is underway in my Department to establish a taskforce, as set out in the Programme for Government, involving relevant Government Departments, agencies, industry and representative groups, to further examine the potential for the take-up of electric and other low emission vehicles.</p></reply>

This commitment builds on the Energy White Paper published in December 2015 and recognises that solar <font color="#0D0D0D">photo voltaic (PV) </font>also has the potential to provide a community dividend, thereby enhancing citizen participation in Ireland's energy future.</p><p>It is widely recognised that solar photo voltaic (PV) technology has become more cost competitive for electricity generation over the last few years, not only compared with other renewable technologies but also compared with conventional forms of generation.  With these significant changes in the cost of the technology, the deployment of solar PV in Ireland has only recently become a potential cost-effective option to increase energy security, contribute to our renewable energy targets, and support economic growth and jobs.  It is also recognised, however, that while the cost competitiveness of solar PV has improved, it would still require a subsidy in order to be developed on a commercial basis.</p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">In-depth economic analysis is now underway to inform the actual costings of a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) scheme.  While no decision has been taken on the precise renewable technologies to be supported - and the appropriate level of tariffs are still under consideration - the cost and technical viability of a range of renewable technologies is being assessed, including  solar PV.  The new scheme will also examine how communities can have a greater involvement than in previous schemes.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  Designing and implementing a new scheme is a complex task and it is expected that the broad details of the new scheme will be available early next year.  Before these details are announced, the Department will run a second public consultation, which will give all interested parties an opportunity to input into the development of the proposed support scheme.  Ultimately, the introduction of any new scheme will be subject to Government and State aid approval from the European Commission.</font></p></reply>

The purpose of the review is to consider the appropriateness of the current list of designated events and to examine the  requirement to add any  events of major importance to society.</p>  <p>  The current review is ongoing.  It was launched in June 2014 with an initial consultation process with 44 submissions received from interested parties.  This was followed by a public consultation launched in May 2015 seeking submissions from interested parties on the current list and their views on the possible designation of additional events which are as follows:</p>  <p>- Ireland's Games in the Six Nations Rugby Football Championship on a live basis (currently designated on a deferred basis)</p>  <p>- The All Ireland Senior Ladies Football Final;</p>  <p>- The All Ireland Senior Camogie Final.</p>  <p>  Consultants were engaged in October 2015 to conduct a full review of the current list, those events proposed for designation and the 493 submissions received from interested parties.  The final Report is being considered by my Department in consultation with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. When this process is completed the proposed list will be notified to the European Commission in accordance with the Audio Visual Media Services Directive.  The Commission will then have three months to consider the list and indicate whether it complies with EU criteria.  If approved by the Commission, I will then sign an Order setting out the events to be designated. In the meantime, the existing Order  remains in force.

The Plan is being delivered through a combination of investment by telecommunications operators and a State Intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming. This is reflected in the High Speed Broadband Map, at<i>broadband.gov.ie.</i></p><p>The areas marked BLUE on the map are where commercial providers have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The areas marked AMBER represent the State Intervention area. Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by entering their address or Eircode. They can also email the Department, quoting their Eircode, to <i>broadband@dcenr.gov.ie.</i></p><p>There are over 750,000 premises in the Intervention Area. Last week, I announced that a further 170,000 premises may need to be covered by the State Intervention.  Further analysis is being undertaken by my Department to identify the exact location of these premises and to adjust the High Speed Broadband Map.</p><p>The Department has now moved to the next stage of  the procurement process and three qualifying bidders will commence dialogue with the Department next week.  This will be followed by the issue of final tender documents and the current schedule envisages contract(s) award in June 2017.  The timing of each stage of the procurement is dependent on a number of factors, including the complexities that may be encountered during the process.</p><p>The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of  poor service, business needs and/or high demand. This will be balanced with the efficient network rollout plan. A prioritisation programme will be put in place and a detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>The Programme for  Government recognises the on-going frustration of consumers with the quality of mobile phone and broadband services. It therefore commits to the establishment of a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce which will consider immediate measures to address telecommunications deficits in rural Ireland.  My Department is engaging with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in relation to the terms of reference for the Taskforce. </p><p>The Taskforce will involve a number of Government Departments and agencies, as well as engagement with ComReg and telecommunications operators and will be established over the coming weeks. I expect that the Taskforce will consider all of the factors contributing to coverage disruptions. Measures arising from the Taskforce will be implemented by Government as a matter of priority.  This will help alleviate the challenges facing consumers who may have poor mobile data coverage as well as poor broadband. </p><p>My Department has already conducted a number of meetings with vendors and mobile operators to help inform the process and identify what tangible measures can be taken.  I expect that Minister Humphreys and I will bring proposals to Government by the end of 2016, on foot of the Taskforce's report. </p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of county or regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p></reply>

Driving licences issued by one Member State are inter-exchangeable between EU States.  An Irish licence holder, living temporarily in another EU country can renew their existing licence by post, without returning to Ireland to appear in person at an office of the National Driver Licensing Service, or if taking up permanent residence may exchange their existing Irish licence for the local equivalent.</p>  <p>  Under EU law, Member States issue driving licences to persons 'normally resident' in their jurisdiction. When a person travels to a non-EU country and is resident there temporarily for work or study purposes, they are still considered to be normally resident in their national State and may therefore renew their licence. In such specific instances Irish regulations reflect this, and allow persons in non-EU countries, such as Australia, to renew their licence from abroad by post.</p>  <p>  For persons who have taken up residence in non-EU countries, EU Member States may reach bilateral agreements on the exchange of driving licences.  Ireland in fact has such an agreement in place with Australia.  An Irish licence holder taking up residence in Australia can therefore exchange their Irish licence for an Australian one. If they later move back to Ireland, they may exchange the Australian licence for an Irish one.​</p></reply>

A major objective for the new Government will be to prioritise new investment in local and regional road maintenance and improvements, and LIS funding will be promoted in that context.</p></reply>

As part of the Labour Relations Commission's brokered 'terms of settlement' in May 2015, my Department committed toward examining section 52 as regards some concerns expressed during these disputes by trade unions on perceived ambiguities in the text of the section.  These perceived ambiguities included, for example, a concern that the legislation might lead to compulsory tendering of all routes in the future.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that, in December 2015, my predecessor wrote to the trade unions providing the report that had been prepared by the Department (in accordance with the commitment arising from the LRC terms of settlement) considering the issues and taking account of advice received from the Attorney General.  The Department's consideration essentially concluded that there was merit in amending the legislation to address perceived ambiguities but that any such amendments would continue to reflect EU law and the current statutory powers of the NTA to determine the appropriate mix of directly awarded and competitively tendered bus services.</p>  <p>  I have recently received a briefing from my Department on the matter and I expect to decide shortly on the appropriate way forward.</p></reply>

PSO services are public transport services provided in the general interest that another commercial operator would not assume or would not assume to the same extent or under the same conditions without reward.</p>  <p>  Exchequer funding is made available to the NTA to allocate to the transport operators as it determines and in line with the public service contract it has in place with each operator.  These contracts specify the services to be provided by the operators.  In the context of the Deputy's question, it is important to note that the contracts are in regard to the provision of a network of PSO bus services.  This network requirement is a common feature of contracts of this nature across the EU.</p>  <p>  In that context the specific route level analysis sought by the Deputy is not readily available.  I have however directed your question to the NTA for direct reply in the context of any network level analysis that might be available.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p>  <p>  Of course, in addition to their PSO work, both bus companies also operate commercial services which are not funded by the Exchequer and which are subject to normal competitive pressure from other operators.  In the case of Dublin Bus these services primarily relate to airport express and tourist related services, while Bus &Eacute;ireann operates an extensive inter-urban Expressway service which is completely commercial and receives no Exchequer funding.  The performance of these routes is a commercial matter for the companies concerned.</p></reply>

Where employment occurs in breach of this requirement, such contracts of employment are illegal.</p>  <p>  However, the Employment Permits (Amendment Act) 2014 amended the Employment Permits Act 2003 to balance that requirement with measures to prevent an employer benefiting from a contract of employment that is unenforceable for the lack of an employment permit at the expense of a migrant worker.</p>  <p>  Redress for issues arising under contracts of employment which are illegal by reason of non-compliance with the Employment Permits legislation cannot be achieved by reference to employment rights legislation which is predicated on legal contracts of employment.  Thus the Act of 2014 addresses very precisely the consequences of those employers who breach the Employment Permits Acts with the intention of circumventing minimum wage requirements.</p>  <p>  Section 2B of the Act of 2003 as amended provides that a foreign national who can satisfy a court that he or she took all reasonable steps to comply with the requirement of having an employment permit may take a civil action for compensation against the employer for work done or services rendered, notwithstanding the illegality of the contract.  This is obviously in addition to potential criminal prosecution of the employer.  The compensation for such work or services is to be calculated by a court by reference to the national minimum hourly rate of pay or any other rate of pay which is fixed under or pursuant to any enactment.</p>  <p>  Additionally, I as Minister, in my absolute discretion, may take a civil action on the foreign national&rsquo;s behalf as well as the responsibility for the costs of such action.  This is in recognition of the fact that a foreign national may not have the wherewithal to take such action.  This is also in addition to and separate from the existing prosecutorial powers.</p>  <p>  Section 2B also imposes the following limitations on proceedings:</p>  <p>(a) Proceedings must be brought within 2 years of the date on which the foreign national ceased his or her employment or service with the employer; and</p>  <p>(b) Proceedings are limited to a claim for recompense for work done or services rendered during the period of 6 years prior to the cessation of the foreign national&rsquo;s employment.</p>  <p>  Section 2C of the Act of 2003 as amended provides that proceedings taken against an employer may be brought in the District Court for claims up to &euro;15,000 and in the Circuit Court for claims up to &euro;75,000.</p>  <p>  The Workplace Relations Commission under section 32(2) of the Workplace Relations Act 2015, may provide to an official body any information -</p>  <p>(a) obtained by it in the performance of its functions, and</p>  <p>(b) that causes the Commission to suspect that an offence has been committed by any person.</p></reply>

Ireland's labour market is part of a much greater EEA labour market which affords a considerable supply of skilled workers.  Where specific skills prove difficult to source within the EEA, an employment permit may be sought to hire a non-EEA national.</p><p>The Employment Permit Act 2006 as amended provides the flexibility to deal with changing labour market, work patterns and economic development needs which often require rapid response.  The Regulations, as provided for in the Act, are reviewed and adapted on a biannual basis to reflect the exigencies of a changing enterprise environment.  They, inter alia, stipulate two types of occupation for the purposes of the employment permits system:</p><p>- The Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations Lists (HSEOL) sets out the lists of eligible occupations deemed to be critically important to growing Ireland&rsquo;s economy, are highly demanded and highly skilled, and are in significant shortage of supply in our labour market.  This list is an integral part of the Critical Skills Employment Permit which is designed to attract highly skilled people into the labour market with the aim of encouraging them to take up permanent residence in the State.</p><p>- The Ineligible Categories of Employment List (ICEL) includes those occupations for which there is a clear surplus of adequately skilled Irish and EEA nationals in the wider labour force.</p><p>My Department has devised a process of reviewing and updating the HSEOL and ICEL for employment permits bi-annually.  This review is predicated on a formalised and evidence-based process.  Such a process involves obtaining and considering advice from the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) and Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU - SOLAS).  The process also includes a public consultation element and input from Government Departments, Agencies, and industry is welcomed.</p><p>  The EGFSN&rsquo;s Annual Skills Bulletin contributes principally to my Department&rsquo;s ongoing monitoring of the labour market.  This Bulletin draws on data on employment, vacancies, job announcements and immigration and other qualitative information held in the National Skills Database (in SOLAS), to identify imbalances in the Irish labour market at occupational level.</p><p>Brewers who have a food science qualification are on the HSEOL (SOC 2129 Material scientists) and thus are eligible for an employment permit, including a Critical Skills Employment Permit.  All other classes of brewers are in the ICEL and thus are not eligible for an employment permit.  The inclusion of elementary level brewers on the ICEL was informed by the formalised evidence-based process I have described above.</p><p>The next review of the lists is due to commence in the Autumn and there will be an opportunity for interested parties to make representations on the composition of the lists.</p></reply>

This process helped to identify significant policy areas that stood to be potentially impacted by a UK exit.  It also set out key actions to be taken forward, across Government, in the event of a decision by the British people to leave the EU.</p>  <p>  While it is well-known the Government&rsquo;s preference was for the UK to remain in the EU, we are already implementing the steps identified through that contingency planning.  This includes actions identified as immediate priorities in the areas of trade and investment.  I have, for example, instituted a coordination group comprising the Chief Executive Officers of both the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, as well as relevant senior officials, to oversee the management of my Department&rsquo;s response and our messaging to business.  Direct contact has also been made with the IDA&rsquo;s existing client base to assure them of Ireland&rsquo;s continued membership of the EU and our other continued strengths with regard to foreign direct investment (FDI).  I have met too with key stakeholders &ndash; including the American Chamber of Commerce, IBEC and the Irish Exporters&rsquo; Association &ndash; to discuss the challenges posed by the referendum result.</p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise, however, that the UK has not yet left the EU and will continue as a member for a considerable period.  The full impact of its departure on trade and investment into Ireland will also very much depend on the outcome of future negotiations in connection with the terms of Britain&rsquo;s post-membership relationship with the Union.  It will be therefore difficult to accurately assess implications for Ireland in these areas until those discussions conclude.</p>  <p>  I am, though, determined that minimising any potential disruption to trade and investment will remain a key priority, for both my Department and the Government as a whole, as the process ahead unfolds.  Another priority will be ensuring that Ireland is well-placed to take advantage of any FDI-related opportunities that may arise on account of the referendum result.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-14a.767.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071400070#WRCC01600"><p>In Budget 2016, my Department announced a significant expansion to pre-school provision under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  This measure, which will be introduced from September 2016, means that children will be eligible to start free pre-school when they reach the age of 3, and continue to avail of free pre-school until they start primary school (once the child is not older than 5 years and 6 months at the end of the pre-school year i.e. end June).  Following the introduction of the expanded programme there will be three opportunities each year - in September, January and April - for eligible children to enrol for the free pre-school provision.  This will ensure that children aged 3 or over have the opportunity to enrol as soon as possible after their third birthday.  The extension of ECCE and the rolling entry points was a recommendation of Right from the Start, the Report of the Expert Advisory Group on the Early Years Strategy, 2013.  The maximum number of free pre-school weeks to which a child is entitled will depend on their date of birth, and the age at which they start primary school.  Each pre-school provider is free to determine their own admission policies, once these are within the terms of the ECCE Programme.</p>  <p>  Any scheme funded by Government must have a strong governance regime in place to ensure taxpayers' money is spent appropriately.  From the inception of ECCE, services who chose to provide it were required to sign a contract.  This contract was recently updated with much of the original content remaining, for example, delivery of ECCE over a 38 week period, in keeping with the school year and traditional pre-school practice.</p>  <p>  With regards to payment for non-attendance of children availing of the ECCE Programme, the rules of the Programme make provision for payment to continue in instances where the child is absent for periods of 4 consecutive weeks or less.  It is only in instances where a child is absent for a period of more than 4 consecutive weeks that the pre-school provider is obliged to cease claiming payment.  If the child subsequently returns to the service, payment will be re-instated.  This has been a pre-requisite of the ECCE Programme since it began in 2010.  If there is good reason for absence beyond 4 weeks a service must contact their local City and County Childcare Committee (CCC) in writing to seek authorisation not to submit a PIP Leaver Form.  The CCC will submit a note on the PIP system for compliance purposes.  The service provider should keep any record of authorisation not to submit a PIP Leaver Form on file for compliance purposes.</p>  <p>  The objective of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to eligible children in the year before they commence primary school.  Approximately 96% of pre-school children have accessed the (ECCE) scheme over the last number of years, demonstrating both good supply and good take-up across the country.  The expansion of the ECCE Programme will see the number of children benefitting from the Programme rise from around 67,000 to around 127,000 in a given programme year.  Children&rsquo;s entitlement to ECCE will increase from 38 weeks currently for all children, to an average of 61 weeks (ranging from 51 to 88 weeks depending on date of birth and age starting school).  The expansion of ECCE enables services to increase income by 60% or more by increasing the number of places they provide in morning or afternoon sessions.  From September 2016 my Department is restoring the ECCE capitation rates to &euro;64.50 for basic capitation and &euro;75 for higher capitation for graduate led services, per child, per week.  My Department has also made amendments to the rules for higher capitation payments to allow services claim this higher rate per pre-school room.  Historically the higher payment was made only to services where every pre-school room was led by a graduate.  This reform of the rules, which the sector sought for some time, will enable this additional &euro;10.50 per child per week be availed of by more services and, at the same time, assists with our agenda to improve the quality of service through a more qualified workforce.</p>  <p>  A further opportunity for early years providers to increase their income arises from the investment in 8000 new CCS places in 2016, places which can, for the first time, be availed of through private childcare providers.  The CCS provides subsidisation of childcare costs of up to &euro;95 per week per child for eligible families.</p>  <p>  I am committed to continuing efforts to make high quality and affordable childcare available to all who need it and at the same time to dealing with challenges faced by thousands of early years providers around the country.</p></reply>

At present my Department has no budget available to reverse the reduction in the allocation to the CCCs that occurred a few years ago, but it is something which is likely to be reviewed in the future.  I recognise and appreciate the valuable work conducted by the CCCs in assisting my Department with the operation of the various childcare schemes, in supporting providers to develop and deliver high quality services and in providing advice to parents.  My Department has progressed a number of important initiatives in the last couple of years with essential assistance from the CCCs.</p>  <p>  There is a commitment by my Department to review the functions, structures and governance of the CCCs, as well as the National Voluntary Childcare Organisations (NVCOs).  This review has not been progressed to date due to the requirement to prioritise other important initiatives within the early years care and education area.  The review in question continues to feature in my Department's business plan, but my Department's main priority in 2016, to date, has been to deliver on the initiatives announced in Budget 2016.  The 30% increase in funding announced then brings the total investment in childcare to &euro;345m per annum enabling extension of free preschool, the further subsidisation of childcare for low income families and further advancement of our quality agenda.</p></reply>
