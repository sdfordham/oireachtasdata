The issue of road safety measures outside the vested site areas of schools on public roads, such as road signage, traffic calming measures etc., is a matter, for the relevant Local Authority. Local Authorities have the power to decide on road safety measures outside schools to ensure that measures are in place to protect the safety of local school children. My Department has no function in this matter.</p><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department's Technical Guidance Document &ndash; TGD-020 sets out the general principles of Universal Design in schools, which includes guidance on car parking, set-down/pick up areas. In the case of school building projects, parking provision should be as stated in the guidance documents, subject to the planning requirements of the relevant Local Authority.</p></reply>

This review is being undertaken over the course of the current school year and will consider all issues pertaining to educational disadvantage, including the methodology for identifying schools for inclusion in future programmes. While this process is underway, I do not intend to make any changes to the current programme, including the reclassification of any schools participating in DEIS.</p></reply>

The Design Team appointment was finalised in July 2015 and the project was authorised to proceed to Stage 2(a) which is the developed design stage. Prior to the appointment of the Design Team my Department had already secured planning permission for the project using in-house Architectural resources. The Design Team will work on the basis established under that planning permission to bring this project through the remaining stages of the architectural planning process.</p><p>Upon successful completion of Stage 2(a) and subject to no issues arising, the project will be authorised to complete Stage 2(b) which includes securing the Fire cert and Disability access Cert, the preparation of tender documents and prequalification of contractors.  </p><p>This project was included in the six year programme I announced on 17th November and is scheduled to proceed to construction in 2016.</p></reply>

In this context, the Government established a Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector.  The Forum advised on how the education system can provide a sufficiently diverse number and range of primary schools catering for all religions and none and on the practicalities of transferring patronage of primary schools where it is appropriate. </p><p>Following surveys of parents in 43 areas, there was sufficient parental demand supporting change in 28 of these areas.  To date, eight new primary schools have opened under the patronage divesting process.  </p><p>In order to reinvigorate the patronage divesting process, I recently met with the Catholic Bishops and yesterday met with representatives from Education and Training Boards Ireland (ETBI). I have also arranged to meet with representatives from Educate Together next week. My Department is continuing to work intensively with the main stakeholders to advance alternative choices for 2016 and beyond and to achieve greater diversity of school provision.</p></reply>

This is mainly done through the Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme, which has a specific module on the use and misuse of a range of substances.</p><p>SPHE is mandatory in all primary schools and in junior cycle. It will also form part of the new mandatory 'Wellbeing' component of junior cycle. Schools are also encouraged to deliver the SPHE programme in senior cycle. </p><p>Schools have access to a number of resources that support the delivery of the substance use module of SPHE. Examples include the &quot;Walk Tall&quot; Programme for primary pupils and a post-primary resource called &quot;On My Own Two Feet&quot;.</p></reply>

These measures were implemented at a time of very difficult financial and budgetary circumstances for the State. Since first entering Government, we have been committed to achieving such reductions through negotiation. The Haddington Road Agreement, to which teacher unions are parties, saw negotiated decreases to public sector pay. That Agreement also began the process of addressing the salary imbalance between new and longer-serving teachers. This process has continued under the Lansdowne Road Agreement. </p><p>The issue of equalised pay scales was not one which could be resolved in the talks. However, the Lansdowne Road Agreement will, through salary increases and a reduction in the Pension-Related Deduction, begin the process of restoring the reductions to public service pay which were implemented over recent years. These flat-rate increases will be proportionately more favourable to new entrants to teaching (who are lower on the pay scale) than to longer serving teachers.</p><p>We look forward to seeing the further restoration of public service pay levels as our economy continues to recover strongly.</p></reply>

The SEC has a scheme of Reasonable Accommodations designed to assist candidates with special needs at the examinations.Within the context of the RACE scheme the term 'special need' applies to candidates who have a physical disability, (including visual and hearing impairments; behavioural and emotional conditions and other disorders), or a specific learning difficulty.  Reasonable accommodations are intended to;</p><p>(a) remove, as far as possible, the impact of the disability on the candidate's performance and thus enable the candidate to demonstrate his or her level of attainment  AND(b) ensure that, whilst giving candidates every opportunity to demonstrate their level of attainment, the special arrangements will not give the candidate an unfair advantage over other candidates in the same examination.</p><p>Accommodations can only be provided in accordance with the principles and requirements of the scheme and in line with the eligibility criteria that apply. Even though examination candidates may have special educational needs, they may not require the provision of any special facilities provided that they can read the examination papers at the required level and write legibly. </p><p>There are differences in the operation of the scheme between the Junior and Leaving Certificate examinations. At Junior Certificate, school authorities determine eligibility in line with guidelines provided by the SEC and in general the SEC provides the accommodations as determined by the school. Accommodations approved for a Junior Certificate student will not automatically be granted at Leaving Certificate and this is clearly outlined to schools, candidates and their parents in the RACE documentation. </p><p>A centralised decision making process applies at Leaving Certificate which seeks to recognise the high stakes nature of this examination.  Leaving Certificate applications on grounds of specific learning difficulties are referred to the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), which is part of my Department. Each application must include information which supports the candidate's request for accommodations and which will inform the psychologist's recommendation to the SEC under the scheme's criteria.  Applications on physical grounds are decided upon by the SEC in consultation with the school authority. The overall focus of the Leaving Certificate process is to ensure consistency in the application of the scheme's criteria and fairness and objectivity in decision making. </p><p>The guidelines provided to schools by the SEC outline the criteria to be used in determining eligibility for the Scheme for Junior Certificate candidates. These criteria are the same as used by the SEC for applications from Leaving Certificate candidates.  The SEC recognises that the provision of reasonable accommodations at Junior Certificate does confer an expectation that the same supports should be provided at Leaving Certificate. The issues of consistency in the application process by schools and expectations about the provision of supports between the Junior and Leaving Certificate examinations is currently under review by the SEC.

Within the capitation grant schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs and the Department does not stipulate how these services are to be obtained. Where a school uses the grant funding to employ a secretary or caretaker, such staff are employees of individual schools.

The scheme was introduced to provide a pathway to appropriate employment, training and education opportunities for a specific cohort of jobseekers on the Live Register. Changes to the scheme are therefore a matter for the Department of Social Protection in the first instance. In this regard I understand that Department is currently undertaking a planned independent evaluation of the scheme to determine its suitability, effectiveness and relevance as an activation programme. The outcome of this evaluation will provide an evidential basis upon which they can determine how the scheme may be improved.</p><p>Recognised Schools and Education and Training Boards may participate in the scheme if they wish under Department of Education and Skills Circular 46/2011. An internship must not cause an existing member of staff to be displaced from the school or be used to fill a current vacancy in the school. Interns are in addition to any staffing allocation a school/ETB has. </p><p>In this regard it should be noted that Budget 2016 allows for an improvement in the staffing schedule in primary schools by one point, from 1 teacher for every 28 pupils to 1 teacher for every 27 pupils. At post-primary the schedule will improve by 0.3 points, from 19:1 to 18.7:1. It is estimated that this measure and some other budgetary improvements in primary and post-primary schedules will result in an additional 300 posts at primary and 550 posts at post-primary.</p></reply>

They also provide an opportunity to review the role of the principal so that our principals are leaders of learning, and to reconfigure the middle management structure to support principals in their role, ensuring ownership of responsibility rather than tasks, thereby building expertise and supporting a career path within the profession. The Department, in consultation with the representative management bodies has commenced an exploration of the opportunities to support and thereby advance our understanding of the needs of school leaders and how they might be addressed.  Last week, I formally launched the newly established Centre for School Leadership (CSL).  The Centre's responsibilities will cover the continuum of professional development for school leaders, from pre-appointment training and induction of newly appointed principals, to continuing professional development throughout careers. The Centre is operating on a partnership basis between the Department of Education and Skills, the Irish Primary Principals' Network (IPPN) and the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals (NAPD).  The partnership will have many benefits for the profession in terms of the quality of training programmes, coordination of provision, and increased accessibility.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that I have made provision in Budget 2016 for some 2,260 additional teaching posts for our primary and post primary schools next year. These posts will provide for an improvement in the staffing schedules at primary and post primary levels, enhance the leadership and management roles of deputy principals at post-primary level by reducing their teaching time, an improvement to the scheme of release time for principal teachers at primary level and additional resource posts to meet special education needs.</p></reply>

This is a cause for concern for both my Department and the HEA.  Accordingly my Department and the HEA have, since 2011, been working in partnership with key stakeholders and higher education institutions to broaden entry to undergraduate courses at level 8 of the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), while at the same time reducing the number of grading bands used in the Leaving Certificate examination and developing a new CAO points scale to correlate with these. Full details of this initiative to reform the transition from secondary to higher education, and the reports published on this, are available at . Under this on-going reform initiative, the seven universities have committed to achieving a significant reduction in the number of NFQ level 8 courses which they offer over the next 2 years.</p></reply>

Reforms introduced in the 2012/13 school year created a single simplified allocation process for both learning and language support. At primary level, learning/language support hours are allocated on the basis of mainstream classroom teaching posts in the school. At post-primary level, learning/language support is allocated on the basis of pupil numbers. Schools have autonomy to deploy this resource between learning support and language support depending on the specific needs of the school.</p><p>These arrangements also provided for additional permanent teaching posts to be given to schools with high concentration of pupils that require language support. </p><p>Further additional temporary support is also provided, as necessary, to schools that have high concentrations of pupils that require language (EAL) support. At primary level, these allocations are made on the basis of appeals by any of these schools to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board. Where at least 20% of the total enrolment of the school is made up of pupils that require EAL support, the school may lodge an appeal with the Appeals Board. Having considered the circumstances outlined by the school and having regard to the high number of pupils requiring EAL support, additional post(s) may be approved by the Appeals Board.</p><p>The Teaching Council's criteria for Initial Teacher Education (ITE) sets out the mandatory elements to be contained in all Initial Teacher Education Programmes. These include Inclusive Education, (Special Education, Multiculturalism, Disadvantage, etc) Literacy, Numeracy and Differentiation. The Council's criteria does not overly prescribe what should be covered in programmes, rather, the approach is that ITE is about the development of critical core skills, which can then be applied to any range of issues in the classroom, possibly with the benefit of further upskilling post-qualification.</p><p>The Professional Development Service for Teachers offer workshops and school support in the area of EAL to primary schools. The purpose of the workshops is to provide key information on EAL to both language support teachers and teachers supporting children with EAL under the general allocation model. At post-primary level, support is made available to schools on request in the area of EAL and work on literacy incorporates aspects of EAL in many cases.</p></reply>

More favourable ratios operate in DEIS Band 1 schools. Under an agreement reached with the Education Partners for the 2010/11 school year my Department provided 50 additional posts to the primary sector and 100 additional posts to the post-primary sector. At primary level as these posts were additional to those required to cater for demographic growth, some improvements were made to the staffing schedule for the 2010/11 school year. These improvements were targeted at medium-to-larger schools typically under the greatest pressure in relation to class sizes. At post-primary level, additional supports were targeted at co-educational schools in single post-primary catchment areas and at schools that join together with other local post primary schools to increase subject choice in a town.</p><p>The application of these additional posts to the primary staffing schedule resulted in the schedule operating on the basis of 1 classroom teacher for an average of every 27 pupils between the bands of 8 classroom teachers and 16 classroom teachers. The 37 pupil difference arises only at the point between 16 and 17 classroom teachers. However given that the standard size of a school is 16 classrooms this issue does not typically arise. An average of 28 to 1 applies for the bands of 18 classroom teachers upwards.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that I have announced a 1 point improvement to the primary staffing schedule in the context of Budget 2016. The improved staffing schedule which is available on the Department website will be implemented for the 2016/17 school year. </p><p>The application of this 1 point improvement to the primary staffing schedule will result in the schedule operating on the basis of 1 classroom teacher for an average of every 26 pupils between the bands of 8 classroom teachers and 16 classroom teachers.</p><p>The staffing arrangements for all schools for the 2016/17 school year will be published early in 2016.</p></reply>

In spite of a number of reminders issued by my Department, a completed survey form was not received at that time from the school in question and therefore it could not be assessed for participation in DEIS.  Furthermore, the school did not participate in a follow-up appeal process to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for DEIS status. </p><p>As the Deputy will no doubt be aware, a process for the review of the DEIS Programme which I announced earlier this year, is currently underway in my Department.

The provision for 2015 represents a transfer of funding in excess of &euro;20 million to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to support the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). Approximately 18,800 rent supplement tenancies have been awarded this year. A county breakdown of this information and current rent supplement recipients is provided in the attached tabular statement, however a breakdown by local authority is not maintained. </p><p>The Department&rsquo;s strategic direction is to transfer responsibility of persons with long term housing needs to the local authorities under HAP.  In local authority areas where HAP is in place, new applicants assessed as requiring social housing support will be considered for HAP rather than rent supplement. Rent supplement will continue to be paid to households who are already in the private rented sector but who, generally because of a loss of income through unemployment, require a short term income support to pay their rent. Progress is being made in transferring persons in receipt of rent supplement for periods in excess of 18 months to HAP, with almost 2,000 cases transferred to date. The complete transfer from rent supplement to HAP for those tenancies which require long term housing support will occur over time. Officials in the Department continue to work closely with those in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the local authorities to further roll out HAP and to ensure that customers are supported in the transition from rent supplement. Policy responsibility and reporting on HAP is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. </p><p>In view of the reduction of supply in the private rented market and increasing rents at this time, the Department of Social Protection has implemented a policy approach that allows for flexibility in assessing customers&rsquo; individual accommodation needs on a case by case basis. Departmental staff administering rent supplement have a statutory discretionary power to award or increase a supplement for rental purposes, for example, when dealing with applicants who are risk of losing their tenancy or in danger of homelessness. This flexible approach has already assisted approximately 5,500 rent supplement households throughout the country to retain their rented accommodation. A county breakdown of the number of payments made in excess of the current rent limits is also provided in the attached tabular statement. Statistics are not maintained on the number of applications requested and refused rent supplement increases. </p><p>These measures and the reforms to the private rental sector announced last month will provide increased certainty for both tenants and landlords in the current market. </p><p><b>Table 1: Rent Supplement Recipients by County, End November 2015</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Recipients</th></tr><tr><td>CARLOW</td><td>993</td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN</td><td>403</td></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td>1,074</td></tr><tr><td>CORK</td><td>6,955</td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL</td><td>1,316</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>23,920</td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY</td><td>3,337</td></tr><tr><td>KERRY</td><td>1,618</td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE</td><td>3,468</td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY</td><td>563</td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS</td><td>973</td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM</td><td>327</td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK</td><td>1,511</td></tr><tr><td>LONGFORD</td><td>381</td></tr><tr><td>LOUTH</td><td>1,508</td></tr><tr><td>MAYO</td><td>1,535</td></tr><tr><td>MEATH</td><td>1,538</td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN</td><td>276</td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY</td><td>847</td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON</td><td>604</td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO</td><td>476</td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY</td><td>1,704</td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD</td><td>974</td></tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH</td><td>1,421</td></tr><tr><td>WEXFORD</td><td>2,283</td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW</td><td>2,004</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>62,009</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 2: New Rent Supplement Recipients in 2015</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Recipients</th></tr><tr><td>CARLOW</td><td>263</td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN</td><td>198</td></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td>382</td></tr><tr><td>CORK</td><td>2,343</td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL</td><td>414</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>6,117</td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY</td><td>1,045</td></tr><tr><td>KERRY</td><td>718</td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE</td><td>854</td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY</td><td>139</td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS</td><td>378</td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM</td><td>151</td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK</td><td>335</td></tr><tr><td>LONGFORD</td><td>209</td></tr><tr><td>LOUTH</td><td>377</td></tr><tr><td>MAYO</td><td>573</td></tr><tr><td>MEATH</td><td>588</td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN</td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY</td><td>218</td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON</td><td>261</td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO</td><td>276</td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY</td><td>784</td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD</td><td>202</td></tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH</td><td>561</td></tr><tr><td>WEXFORD</td><td>874</td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW</td><td>460</td></tr><tr><td>Total:</td><td>18,793</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 3: Total Increased Rental Payments by County at 07/12//2015</b><table><tr><th bgcolor="#C6D9F1">County</th><th bgcolor="#C6D9F1">Awards under National Tenancy Sustainment Framework</th><th bgcolor="#C6D9F1">Awards under protocol with Threshold</th><th bgcolor="#C6D9F1">Total no. of increased payments by County</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>21</td><td></td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>13</td><td></td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>60</td><td></td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>204</td><td>68</td><td>272</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>-</td><td></td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>2,058</td><td>1,588</td><td>3,646</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>101</td><td></td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>18</td><td></td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>189</td><td></td><td>189</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>110</td><td></td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>97</td><td></td><td>97</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>44</td><td></td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>7</td><td></td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>90</td><td></td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>71</td><td></td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>3</td><td></td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>235</td><td></td><td>235</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>49</td><td></td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>12</td><td></td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>-</td><td></td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>165</td><td></td><td>165</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>26</td><td></td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>89</td><td></td><td>89</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>7</td><td></td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>82</td><td></td><td>82</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>3,752</td><td>1,656</td><td>5,408</td></tr></table></p></reply>

EU citizens and their families have the right to move and reside freely within the territories of the Member States.  Following a ruling of the European Court of Justice in the Metock case in 2008, the right of EU citizens and their families to move and reside freely within the territories of the Member States was extended to non-EU national spouses of non-Irish EU nationals. However, these rights are being abused by unscrupulous individuals who are using marriage laws in Ireland to gain an automatic right of residency in the EU. There is concern that a potential link exists to the trafficking of women, particularly young women, where they are coerced into taking part in marriages of convenience.</p>  <p>  The Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014 includes provisions that make it more difficult to broker a marriage of convenience in the State.  This is achieved by making a marriage of convenience an impediment to marriage and allowing a registrar the right to investigate.  The Act also provides for increased sharing of information in relation to suspected marriages of convenience between the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Justice and Equality with regard to marriages of convenience. </p>  <p>  The provisions related to preventing marriages of convenience taking place in the State were commenced on 18 August 2015.  </p>  <p>  However, due to industrial action by staff of the Civil Registration Service in the Health Service Executive (HSE), the scheduling of interviews, where one or more of the parties to the proposed marriage is a non-EU national, is being delayed.</p>  <p>  Staffing and resolution of industrial relations issues in the Civil Registration Service are a matter for the HSE. However I am concerned about the matter and my officials, while not directly involved in the dispute, have made the HSE aware of these concerns.

The river has been the subject of a number of investigations, and of most significance were those carried out in 1955 and 1986. Severe flooding from the Tolka River and its tributaries occurred in the Dublin City, Meath and Fingal areas in November 2000 and November 2002.</p>  <p>  In July 2001 Dublin City Council commissioned the Greater Dublin Strategic Drainage Study (GDSDS), a multi-million euro engineering study of the strategic drainage requirements of the Greater Dublin area.  A full study of the Tolka was not included in the GDSDS.  In view of the November 2000 flood the OPW requested that it be included.</p>  <p>  The Tolka River Flooding Study was underway when the November 2002 flood occurred.  The consultants were asked to produce Interim Reports for all three local authorities concerned (Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council and Meath County Council) to identify works that could be undertaken straight away to reduce the risk of flooding in the worst affected areas.  The Final Report on the Tolka was completed in November 2003 and this brought together many of the recommendations contained in the Interim Reports and also much additional information, which provided the basis for further decisions in relation to the catchment as a whole.  As a result of the Interim Reports, works began in the Dublin City and County Meath areas in 2003 and were largely finished by 2009. </p>  <p>  Works carried out in the Dublin City Council area included: new walls and embankments, replacement footbridge, widening of banks, lowering of Distillery Weir, scour damage repair and general channel maintenance. Responsibility for the maintenance of this scheme rests with Dublin City Council.</p></reply>

While the Director of Corporate Enforcement is statutorily independent in the exercise of his or her functions, staffing of the ODCE, as with any business unit of my Department is made in line with Government policy.  In recent years that policy was governed by the recruitment Moratorium aimed at reducing staff numbers in the Civil and Public Service as part of reducing the Exchequer pay bill.  During the lifetime of the Moratorium, sanction of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was required for any recruitment and the Employment Control Framework (ECF) set maximum numbers in the Department&rsquo;s employment (including the Agencies under our aegis) year-on-year. In that context, my Department engaged with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on sanctioning the filling of key vacancies within the ECF/Moratorium framework, including in respect of the ODCE. Nonetheless, the respective managements of each Office, including the ODCE, have had to reconfigure their organisations and adapt to a constrained-resources environment in continuing to deliver their mandates. </p>  <p>  There are always competing demands on limited Exchequer resources.  Strategic deployment of limited resources in response to Workforce Planning reviews, ongoing prioritising and reprioritising of work and advocating for key or mission-critical posts to be filled to enable my Department meet its current mission were, and remain the key tools at my Department&rsquo;s disposal regarding staffing resources.  However, the level of resources available to my Department and/or any Office or Agency is only one element of its capacity to deliver.  How those resources are managed, deployed and developed is as important as the level of resources available. </p>  <p>  The request for the seven additional posts for the ODCE was first registered in my Department&rsquo;s HR Unit in late 2013 as identified in my Reply to the earlier Question from Deputy Shortall. Sanction was received in late 2014 to allow the filling of certain mission-critical posts across my Department, including the seven posts for the ODCE on foot of my Department&rsquo;s efforts to meet its ECF obligations.</p>  <p>In the context of the ODCE staffing requirements being a subset of my Department&rsquo;s overall Workforce Planning considerations and the Department securing its delegated sanction on staffing matters as of June 2015, my Department has been working diligently to fill mission-critical vacancies, including the 7 posts for the ODCE.  In that regard my Department has worked with the ODCE and subsequently with the Public Appointments Service (PAS) to identify the requirements of the respective ODCE posts in order for PAS to initiate the appropriate open recruitment competition which culminated in the public advertisement placed recently in the media and on publicjobs.ie. As the deadline for applications to fill the Professional Accountants/Investigator posts is 17   December, we will soon thereafter be able to move to the selection and appointment process such that the additional staff would be in post early in 2016.</p></reply>

The Scheme has been used to assist forestry owners who have been affected by Ash dieback disease. The objective of the Scheme is to eradicate/contain ash dieback in forests by supporting the removal and destruction of trees and leaf litter and to reconstitute the forest by replanting with alternative species. The Scheme provides funding in respect of costs necessarily incurred in clearing the site and reconstituting the forest, subject to the maximum limits laid down.    The Scheme is restricted to forestry and currently there are no plans to either broaden the scope of the Scheme or to introduce any other Scheme for individuals or nurseries that have been affected by outbreaks of plant diseases including ash dieback. </p>  <p>My Department continues to provide funding for the development of the horticultural industry including commercial nurseries through the Horticultural Grant scheme. In the recent budget I allocated &euro;4.5 million for the Scheme in 2016 and the Scheme is currently open for applications until the 18 December of this year.</p></reply>

The essential point is that the upper age limit was negotiated and agreed by employers and Trade Union representatives at EU level and their agreement was then given force of law by the Directive.  There are no plans at present to extend this limit.  However, I should refer the Deputy to the announcement in the recent Budget of a new entitlement to two weeks paternity leave from work for fathers together with a social welfare payment to take effect from September 2016.</p></reply>

Applicants wishing to apply in person for a re-entry visa now make an appointment on-line, and are seen at the confirmed date and time.  There is no need for people to queue for this service. </p><p>As has been stressed on previous occasions, the simplest and easiest way to apply for a re-entry visa is by<b></b>registered post.<b></b>There is no necessity to attend at the Public Office and INIS urges all applicants to make full use of the postal service insofar as possible.  Postal applications are normally processed within 10 working days and should always be the first option.  Special arrangements are made for emergency cases through the new on-line system. </p><p>In relation to the persons seeking to register their permission with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to D&aacute;il Question No. 180 of 13th October, 2015 which sets out in detail the arrangements that were put in place with effect from 30 September, 2015 by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), with the assistance of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS).</p><p>These measures addressed the queues at the GNIB Registration Office in Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 during the peak autumn period and worked very effectively by improving throughput and relieving the congestion in the public office that occurs in this period as demand for registration increases from students returning to their studies.  I also arranged for additional staff resources from INIS to be made available to assist GNIB in this period.  </p><p>Another of the measures taken was the implementation of separate arrangements for students from certain colleges. I would like to acknowledge the support of and cooperation of the Colleges in making these arrangements work successfully. </p><p>The measures taken at the GNIB public Office means that the peak demand has been met ahead of schedule compared to previous years with demand now restored to normal levels.  Accordingly, there is no need for anyone using the service to queue outside the building in advance of opening hours.  For example, I am advised that at 1pm yesterday there were still 100 tickets available for that day with the office open until 9:30 p.m.  </p><p>I would like to commend the staff of both INIS and the GNIB for their work in dealing with such a large volume of registrations and re-entry visa applications, including working over weekends to ensure these demands were met in the shortest possible timeframe.</p></reply>

Garda management keep this distribution under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of resources.</p><p>This Government is committed to the ongoing recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute;, and to this end the first intake since 2009 of new recruits commenced training at the Garda College, Templemore, in September of last year.  To date there have been six intakes of Garda Trainees to the Garda College, giving a total intake of 550.  So far 295 of the new Garda Trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  On attestation, new probationer Garda&iacute; are assigned to stations throughout the country by the Garda Commissioner, where they are assigned to mainstream uniform policing duties.  I am assured by Garda management that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of new probationer Garda&iacute;.  I have been inform that this year 19 new Probationer Garda&iacute; were allocated to the DMR South Division, 4 and 5 of which  have been assigned to Crumlin and  Sundrive Road Garda Stations respectively.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that I announced the opening of a recruitment campaign for new members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 27 November last.  This new campaign is necessary to fulfil the Government&rsquo;s commitment to recruit 600 Garda&iacute; in 2016.  The 600 new Garda&iacute; to be recruited next year will bring to 1,150 the total number of new recruits since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  This ramped-up recruitment underscores the determination of this Government to deliver an effective, responsive police service to protect our communities and respond to emerging crime trends.  The Public Appointments Service (PAS) is organising the recruitment competition on behalf of the Garda Commissioner and applications may be made through the PAS website at<i></i><i></i>.  The closing date for applications is Tuesday 5 January 2016.</p><p>A key part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na strategy in the fight against crime is to work in partnership with the community.  As of 31 October  the latest date for which figures are available there were 53  dedicated Community Garda&iacute; working in the  DMR South Division.  It  is, of course, the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises.  In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a point highlighted by the Garda Inspectorate in their third report entitled &quot;Policing in Ireland&mdash;Looking Forward&quot; in which they stated that community policing is a fundamental policing philosophy and that there is a strong foundation for it in Ireland.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operates a model of Community Policing which aims to build upon, and enhance, progress made so far.  I fully support this renewed emphasis on Community Policing, particularly in light of the priority given to this in the Programme for Government.  The model is about renewing, reinvigorating and restructuring the community policing function within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deliver a consistent national structure to the community policing function, a more co-ordinated and efficient Garda service to the community and a spread of good practice and quality of service in community policing on a national basis.</p></reply>

The Bill provides for two new offences of purchasing sexual services in the context of prostitution.  The purpose of these offences is to target the demand for prostitution.  These proposals have been developed following extensive consultation, and implement the recommendation of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence which called for the introduction of an offence criminalising the purchase of sexual services.  This  Bill builds on already strong legislative, administrative and operational measures that have been put in place in Ireland to combat and prevent trafficking in human beings.  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, with penalties of up to life imprisonment for human trafficking.</p><p>A key focus of Garda actions in this area is the link that exists between the organisation of prostitution and organised crime, including the trafficking of persons for the purpose of prostitution.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a dedicated unit established to target individuals engaged in organised prostitution.  This unit works directly with the Human Trafficking Investigation and Coordination Unit in coordinating a response to tackle trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation.  Gardai have had considerable success with these operations, disrupting criminal networks, including where prostitution was being organised.  Gardai have also worked in partnership with police forces in other jurisdictions to target those involved in the sexual exploitation of women and girls, including the international trafficking of persons for the purpose of prostitution.  There are a number of operations ongoing in the area of organised prostitution.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works with both Government and Non-Government agencies in tackling crimes of this nature, through a strategy of prevention, protection, prosecution and partnership.  A coordinated and holistic approach is taken to training and joint training takes place twice yearly, between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Ruhama, for frontline members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI.  This training provides members with an insight into the complex needs of individuals engaged in prostitution.  The Human Trafficking and Co-Ordination Unit also run a course &lsquo;<i>Tackling Trafficking in Human Beings, Prevention, Protection and Prosecution&quot;</i>twice a year, for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>A draft Second National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Trafficking of Persons was issued for public consultation during the summer of this year; this consultation process was recently completed and it is anticipated that the new National Action Plan will be published in the coming months.  The new National Action Plan will outline both the Government&rsquo;s strategic approach to this issue as well as setting out a clear work programme for the relevant state authorities to collaborate with civil society and agencies in other jurisdictions in advancing the fight against trafficking and enhancing the protection of victims.</p></reply>

There were a further 7,013 children (open cases) who had been assessed as needing a dedicated social worker, and were waiting for one to be allocated. Some of these cases may have had an allocated social worker, but due to a social worker leaving, they are reclassified as awaiting a social worker.  I wish to assure the Deputy that all urgent and emergency cases are dealt with immediately.  This could involve cases of abandonment, allegations of physical and sexual abuse, parental ill health and the need to find an immediate placement, or threat to the safety or life of a child by a third party. </p><p>The priority (or category) of high, medium or low given to the case after a preliminary enquiry, is based on the information known at that time. It is important to note that &quot;high priority&quot; should not simply be equated with risk.  Social work duty teams keep high priority cases under review with regular checks to ascertain risk to the child, and where necessary, will reprioritise the case. Duty teams manage the cases awaiting allocation on a risk management basis by checking on the circumstances, and observing any changes that would increase or decrease risk.  An example could be the presence or absence of a stable grandparent where a parent has a mental health problem which could impact on the priority associated with the case.</p><p>This Department continues to monitor the number of cases that are reported as awaiting the allocation of a social worker. The additional funding of &euro;38 million which has been secured for Tusla in 2016 will provide increased resources to meet identified risks and service demands.  The additional resources are intended to alleviate service pressures in child welfare and protection services, in particular pressures being faced in the areas of unallocated cases, private residential and foster care and domestic, sexual and gender based violence services.

There are variations across the country in how services are currently configured, variations which have often not arisen not out a consideration of  the evidence of effectiveness.</p>  <p>  With that in mind, the HSE is currently involved in reviewing the evidence for improving outcomes in child health, and will be making recommendations about the best way to deliver services when the review is completed next year.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-12-09a.311.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015120900061#WRF02600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112, 113, 128 and 137 together.</p>  <p>Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the HSE, unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants.  In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant's means exceed the prescribed threshold.  Where a person does not qualify for a medical card, they may be provided with a GP Visit Card, appropriate therapy or other community supports or drugs.</p>  <p>  The Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) payment is made by the Minister for Social Protection to carers in respect of a child at home under 16 years of age with a severe disability, where it has been determined that the child requires ongoing care and attention, substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age.  Eligibility for the DCA is not based primarily on the medical or psychological condition, but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating the degree of extra care and attention required.  As such it is not possible to say if a particular child or any particular medical condition or disability will qualify for a payment under the DCA scheme. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility, known as the Keane Report, recommended that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card and that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions for medical card eligibility.  Nonetheless, it is clear that there are people &ndash; including children - with medical needs and it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner. </p>  <p>  Consequently, the Clinical Advisory Group on medical card eligibility was established by the HSE to develop a framework for assessment and measurement of the burden of disease and appropriate operational guidelines for the medical card scheme.  However, the Clinical Advisory Group has not recommended that children in receipt of the Domiciliary Care Allowance should automatically qualify for a medical card. In advance of the Group completing its work, there are no proposals to issue automatic medical cards to one particular group.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to making the medical card system as responsive as possible to the circumstances of people with significant medical needs.  As a result of a range of improvements, the HSE is exercising greater discretion. Consequently, the number of discretionary medical cards has increased by about 84% - from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to nearly 96,000 at the beginning of November this year. </p>  <p>  As the DCA payment is not an element of the assessment for a medical card, data on the payment is not routinely collated by the HSE. However, analysis undertaken in 2015 shows that out of an approximate population of 1 million people under the age of 16 years, almost 450,000 held a medical card or a GP visit card.  Approximately 29,000 children qualified for the DCA payment in 2014.  It is estimated that about two-thirds of children qualifying for a DCA payment also hold a medical card.  In addition, from 1 July 2015, all children under the age of 6 years are entitled to access a GP service free of charge, as part of the first phase of introducing a universal GP service in Ireland.  It has been estimated that the average expenditure per medical card was &euro;973 in 2013, however, it is not possible to provide the actual cost of extending a medical card to all children in receipt of DCA as it would depend on the variable nature of the individuals&rsquo; requirements as well as the number of individuals and the quantum and cost of health services that would be used. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, the proper way to address this issue is to develop a system of universal health care, which is at the centre of Government health policy.  Otherwise, whenever there are qualifying rules, there will always be a person who is above the means test, does not have the selected disease, or is not in receipt of the specific social welfare payment.</p></reply>

Regardless of the delivery mechanism, all potential primary care infrastructure is subject to suitable locations being offered/provided/available, to successful planning processes and GP commitment to sharing accommodation and delivering health care services with HSE staff. In addition the operational lease mechanism is subject to market pressures such as the developers' access to adequate financing.  Delivery of primary care infrastructure is a dynamic process, constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances including the feasibility of implementation.  Some of these factors are outside the control of the Health Service Executive.  It is not possible to accurately predict completion dates in advance of the award of planning permission and start of construction.  However expected operational dates are given for the PPP locations and Kells.  Supporting infrastructure, procured through a combination of public and private investment, will facilitate the delivery of  multi-disciplinary primary health care.  <table><tr><th>Primary Care Infrastructure</th><th>Primary Care Infrastructure</th><th>Primary Care Infrastructure</th><th>July 2012 - 35 locations</th><th>PQ 44306/15</th><th>answer - 08/12/2015</th></tr><tr><td>Count</td><td>HSE Region</td><td>County</td><td>Location/PCT Name</td><td>Delivery Mechanism</td><td>Status at 30 September 2015</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>DML</td><td>Dublin </td><td>Rowlagh/North Clondalkin</td><td>Direct/own build</td><td>Finalising site purchase.  Purchase will be subject to planning permission.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>DML</td><td>Dublin </td><td>Crumlin/Drimnagh</td><td></td><td>Planning not completed in timeframe for PPP</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>DML</td><td>Dublin </td><td>Knocklyon/Rathfarnham</td><td></td><td>Planning not completed in timeframe for PPP</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>DML</td><td>Wicklow</td><td>Rathdrum </td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>Construction scheduled 2016 Q1</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>DML</td><td>Kildare</td><td>Kilcock</td><td>PPP</td><td>2017 Q1</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>DNE</td><td>Dublin </td><td>Coolock/Darndale</td><td>PPP</td><td>2017 Q2</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>DNE</td><td>Dublin </td><td>Summerhill, north inner city Dublin</td><td>PPP</td><td>2017 Q2</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>DNE</td><td>Dublin </td><td>Balbriggan</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>In construction</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>DNE</td><td>Dublin </td><td>Swords</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>In discussions with a potential developer</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>DNE</td><td>Louth</td><td>Drogheda north</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>HSE has issued an LoI.  Please see ** at table end.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>DNE</td><td>Meath</td><td>Laytown and Bettystown</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>Identified property has new owners.

The title of physiotherapist will, as a consequence, be protected for the exclusive use of the board's registrants when the register's 2 year transitional period ends in 2018.  </p>  <p>  I am currently examining the issue of also protecting the title of physical therapist under the Act.   In the rest of the English speaking world the titles of physical therapist and physiotherapist are interchangeable and their users are qualified physiotherapists.  In Ireland, however, the title is used by a number of practitioners who are not physiotherapists but who are competing with physiotherapists in the private sector in the provision of musculoskeletal therapies.   </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, having consulted with the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, I wrote to a number of relevant organisations regarding my proposal to protect the title of physical therapist as a variant of the title of physiotherapist and invited them to submit their views. The submissions are now being examined and I expect that I will make a decision on the matter before the end of the year that ensures public protection and appropriately addresses the legitimate concerns of all parties.</p></reply>

This was not in accordance with the policy conditions which apply to the landing of foreign military aircraft in Ireland.   The Government views breaches of the conditions attached to permission for such landings with the utmost concern and the case in question was subsequently raised at the highest possible level with the US Embassy. </p>  <p>  The Embassy official expressed regret at this incident, explained that it was due to an administrative error and provided assurances that steps have been taken by the US authorities to ensure that there is no recurrence.</p>  <p>  My reply of 3 November stated that permission would not be granted by my Department for the landing of the aircraft of the type specified by the Deputy.

The Joint Action Plan contains short- and medium-term measures to be undertaken by the EU and Turkey to assist Turkey in managing the influx of refugees and to prevent uncontrolled migratory flows from Turkey to the EU. As part of this, the EU has agreed to provide a financial package worth an additional &euro;3 billion, with the establishment of a &lsquo;Refugee Facility for Turkey&rsquo; to coordinate and streamline actions financed by this package. Turkey, for its part, has committed to implement immediately actions to stem the flow of irregular refugees and migrants to the EU and to improve the situation of refugees and migrants under temporary protection in Turkey.  The EU and Turkey have also agreed to further steps on re-admission agreements and visa-liberalisation. In addition, the EU has agreed to re-energise Turkey&rsquo;s accession process, and it is expected that Chapter 17 of the <i>acquis communautaire</i>,<font color="#4F4F4F"> </font>covering economic and monetary policies, will be opened this month. Turkey and the EU also agreed to explore further the great potential of EU-Turkey relations  and to maintain regular and enhanced dialogue through more frequent summits and high-level political meetings. For example, the Turkish Foreign Minister has been invited to participate in a working lunch with EU Foreign Ministers at the next Foreign Affairs Council. </p><p>Ireland has supported the renewed and intensified engagement between the EU and Turkey in recent months, including the outcomes of the 29 November meeting, and the Joint Action Plan. The relationship between the EU and Turkey is important, not only in the context of the migration crisis and because of Turkey&rsquo;s status as an EU candidate country: increased cooperation with Turkey will also be critical in any political and diplomatic resolution to the crisis in Syria, a primary root cause of the current migration crisis, as well as in the fight against terrorism. </p><p>At the same time, the EU and Member States will continue our dialogue with Turkey in relation to ongoing concerns at the internal situation in Turkey, including with regard to freedom of expression and the media.</p></reply>

The Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly have already taken measures to implement what was agreed on welfare reform and finance matters. Contacts have begun at official level on delivering the financial commitments agreed by the Irish Government under the Agreement. There will also be a trilateral ministerial meeting later this month between the justice ministers of Ireland and Northern Ireland and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland that Minister Fitzgerald will attend. This meeting will discuss further enhanced law enforcement co-operation and the setting up of a Joint Agency Task Force on cross border organised crime.</p>  <p>  The forthcoming plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council, in Armagh on 11 December 2015, will also provide a timely opportunity for the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive to review progress on the implementation of the all-island aspects of the Stormont House Agreement.</p>  <p>  I very much regret that the Fresh Start Agreement did not in the end include agreement on the implementation of provisions of the Stormont House Agreement dealing with the legacy of the past. I share the deep disappointment of the victims and survivors of the Troubles and their families. </p>  <p>  I would stress again that it was not the Irish Government who pressed for an agreement that completely left aside the legacy of the past. However, when it became clear that the choice was between having an agreement which uncoupled the past and having no agreement at all, the Government most reluctantly agreed to have a less comprehensive deal that would at least ensure that the devolved institutions would be protected and placed on a stable and sustainable footing. </p>  <p>  What is important now is that we find a way forward that banks the good progress already achieved during the talks and secures a solution to outstanding matters, including the key issue of striking the right balance between the onward disclosure needs of families and the national security requirements being sought by the British Government.</p>  <p>  To this end, contacts are continuing at official level with the British Government, the five main political parties in Northern Ireland and most importantly with various Victims&rsquo; Groups. I met with Northern Ireland&rsquo;s Victims&rsquo; Commissioner on 26 November to discuss the concerns of victims and possible ways to take the issue forward in a way that satisfies these concerns. I also hope to meet the Northern Minister for Justice, David Ford, in the coming days and with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, later this month in order to take stock of the implementation of the Fresh Start Agreement and to explore potential options aimed at resolving the outstanding issues on dealing with the past. </p>  <p>  The provisions of the Stormont House Agreement for dealing with the legacy of the past offer the best possible way of bringing whatever healing is possible to those affected by the Troubles. For this to be achieved it is vitally important that these new institutions have the trust and confidence of the victims and survivors and their families. Their needs will therefore remain central to the Government&rsquo;s work in this area. </p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to finding a way forward so that the establishment of the new institutional framework on the past can take place on an agreed basis as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement. We are determined to achieve the establishment of these institutions so that we can in a fundamental way deal with the past, foster reconciliation and build a society for future generations that is free from hurt and suspicion. This is essential if the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement is to be realised.</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p><p>NEPS does not keep waiting lists for assessments of children but in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. </p><p>Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention. This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p></reply>

These posts will provide for an improvement in the staffing schedules at primary and post primary levels, enhance the leadership and management roles of deputy principals at post-primary level by reducing their teaching time, an improvement to the scheme of release time for principal teachers at primary level and additional resource posts to meet special education needs.</p><p>At primary level there will be a one point improvement to the primary staffing schedule to be implemented for the 2016/17 school year.  This will see the primary staffing schedule operate on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 27 pupils. At primary level lower thresholds apply for DEIS Band 1 schools. </p><p>At post-primary level the schedule will improve by .3 points, from 19:1 to 18.7:1 for the 2016/17 school year. When the allocation for guidance was brought within quota under Budget 2012 measures, DEIS schools were protected from the change by providing for a 18.25:1 allocation compared to the general 19:1 allocation.

SOLAS, with the assistance of relevant experts such as the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), employers and local and national organisations, have published a five year strategy for the further education and training sector which provides us with a strategic roadmap for this crucial element of the education and training system. The strategy includes a vision of a flexible, quality-driven, labour market-relevant, integrated and responsive sector that supports learner progression, transitions into employment and personal development. The higher education system is also going through a process of transformation through structural change arising from the Higher Education Strategy.</p><p>The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), which is funded by my Department, advises the Government on current and future skills needs of the economy. It has a central role in ensuring that labour market needs for skilled workers are anticipated and met. The expert group's membership is broad and specifically includes representation from enterprise. Its research provides an input to the development of course curricula and informs the selection of new targeted programmes designed to tackle the skills shortages in particular elements of the economy, such as Momentum, Springboard and the ICT skills conversion programme.</p><p>As part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2015, my Department has committed to review the National Skills Strategy. The review will provide an opportunity to determine the volume, type and mix of skills required to meet the Government's goal of full employment by 2018 and the challenges to be addressed to achieve this.</p><p>Direct engagement between employers and education and training providers is also critical to ensuring that programmes are aligned to changing skills needs. As well as the actions that are being implemented across the education and training system as part of the Further Education and Training and Higher Education reform programmes to enhance links with enterprise and prepare learners for the different roles they will have over their working lives, work is also underway in the context of the Skills Strategy review to develop the regional and national infrastructure for engagement between education providers, employers and other enterprise stakeholders, in communicating and addressing skills needs. My Department is leading a project to establish a network of regional skills fora to foster better engagement between the public education and training system, employers and other regional stakeholders so as to identify and address the skills needs of each region.</p><p>Apprenticeship has a major contribution to make to meeting the skills demands of the workplace.  In apprenticeship, employers are engaged in the definition of occupational profiles, contribute to curriculum development and ensure the required skills are developed on the job.  The expansion of the apprenticeship system is one of my key priorities and I am encouraged by the increase in apprenticeship registrations in existing trades and the progress being made in introducing new apprenticeships, focusing initially on the 25 priority proposals identified by the Apprenticeship Council through their public call.</p></reply>

The number of special classes at post primary level has risen by approximately 70 classes in the last 3 years.</p><p>The NCSE have advised that there are 56 ASD classes in Co. Kildare. 5 of these are Early Intervention classes for children with ASD who are not yet school going age, 40 ASD classes are at primary school level and there are 11 ASD classes at post primary level. A full list of special classes is available at www.ncse.ie. </p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has recently submitted their Policy Advice on Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.

The Bill will also enshrine in law a ban on schools charging parents to apply for a place in school.</p><p>The Bill, while including provision for single sex schools and denominational schools to reflect in their admission policy the exemptions applicable to such schools under equality legislation, provides for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion. The Bill also requires schools to publish an enrolment policy which will include details of the school's arrangements for students who do not want to attend religious instruction.</p><p>The Bill seeks to strike an appropriate balance between school autonomy and the interests of parents in our education system. This can be achieved through regulations that foster greater transparency and consistency in terms of how schools communicate and interact with parents. To that end the Bill sets out clearly matters relating to enrolment that regulations may address. The regulations have not been finalised; following enactment of the Bill, the draft regulations will be updated and published for consultation with the relevant education partners.</p></reply>

This commitment is being progressed on a number of fronts. Firstly, the government established a Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector. The Forum advised on how the education system can provide a sufficiently diverse number and range of primary schools catering for all religions and none and also advised on the practicalities of transferring/divesting patronage for individual primary schools where it is appropriate and necessary. Arising from the work of the Forum, eight new primary schools have opened under the patronage divesting process and work is continuing to advance choices in other identified areas.  Secondly, in 2011 the Government announced the establishment of new arrangements for the recognition of new primary and second-level schools.  New schools are generally established to meet demographic need. The new  arrangements give an opportunity to patrons to seek to apply for patronage of new  schools. The criteria used in deciding on patronage of  new schools place a particular emphasis on parental demand for plurality and diversity of patronage.    Since 2011, 42 new schools have opened (24 primary and 18 post-primary). 39 of these schools have a multi-denominational ethos.  The Department is  continuing to work intensively with the main stakeholders to advance alternative choices for 2016 and beyond to achieve greater diversity of school provision.</p></reply>

The second measure is an improved teacher allocation threshold for isolated 1-teacher schools that are more than 8km distant from the next nearest school of the same type of patronage and language of instruction.

I have introduced two immediate actions to begin this work. </p><p>Firstly, the awarding of a grant of &euro;30,000, which will be provided by the HEA to the Union of Students' (USI) in Ireland to progress short-term solutions for students in need of accommodation. This funding will allow USI to develop their homes.usi.ie website, to communicate more effectively to student and homeowners, and to carry out research into this important issue.</p><p>Secondly, the establishment of an inter-departmental steering group to oversee this work, the first meeting of which took place on 1 October 2015. This group will provide a coordinating mechanism to ensure that the higher education institutions have access to information on new potential funding and delivery models. A significant number of Action points have been identified for follow up arising from the first meeting.</p><p>Finally, the Government is committed to addressing the housing shortage through the Construction 2020 strategy. This will not resolve all of our problems immediately, but I am confident that the implementation of Construction 2020 will provide us with a sustainable housing stock in the medium to longer term.</p><p>The full report can be accessed at<i></i></p></reply>

The only such cases to date number 13 in total. In each such case, the State has accepted partial liability and accordingly paid a specific proportion of the settlement amount with the relevant religious congregation paying the remaining proportion. </p><p>Separate to the above cases, in its response to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) judgment, the Government agreed in December 2014 that out of court settlements be offered in those extant cases of school child sexual abuse being brought against the State where the cases come within the terms of the ECtHR judgment and satisfy the Statute of Limitations. In this regard, the State Claims Agency (SCA) has made settlement offers which have been accepted in 6 cases and the SCA has written to the other 28 litigants advising that the circumstances do not appear to come within the parameters of the judgement and inviting them to revert with any contrary evidence. Where a litigant does not accept the offer in settlement of his/her case or where the SCA is not satisfied that the case comes within the terms of the judgment, the case will proceed before the domestic Courts. </p><p>Subsequently, in July of this year, the Government approved proposals to offer ex-gratia payments up to a maximum of &euro;84,000 to those who initiated legal proceedings in cases of school child sexual abuse against the State but who subsequently discontinued their claims against the State where, similarly, the circumstances of the claims come within the terms of the ECtHR judgment and where the claims were not statute barred prior to the proceedings being discontinued. It is not possible to assess at this stage how many cases in this category will satisfy these criteria. Persons who believe that their cases come within the criteria can contact the SCA and provide supporting evidence. Where there is a disagreement between the SCA and the individual as to whether their circumstances come within the terms of the ECtHR judgment, provision will be made for the application to be reviewed by an independent assessor. In offering these settlements, the State will not be covering the liabilities of the perpetrators, school managers or patrons or other co-defendants.</p><p>To be eligible for the above settlement or payment arrangements, cases must involve sexual abuse of a school child by a primary or second level school employee in respect of whom there was a prior complaint of sexual abuse to a school authority (including an authority of a school in which the teacher had previously taught), prior to the issue of the Department of Education guidelines to primary and post-primary schools in 1991 and 1992 respectively. This rationale has been adopted as it is the basis of the ECtHR judgment. </p><p>To date over 140 new claims of school child sexual abuse have been notified to the SCA.</p></reply>

Within that, a target of just over 2,500 units is to delivered through the capital-funded programmes of building/acquiring new social housing units by local authorities, and new sheltered housing by approved housing bodies, and the returning of vacant properties to productive use. Current data shows that over 2,500 units have already been delivered through the capital programmes as follows:<table><tr><th>Local Authority Housing &ndash; construction and acquisition </th><th>569 </th></tr><tr><td>Capital Assistance Scheme </td><td>199 </td></tr><tr><td>Regeneration </td><td>109 </td></tr><tr><td>Vacant Units returned </td><td>1,630 </td></tr></table></p><p>Local authorities have advised me that they are advancing the purchase of some 750 new units this year, many of which will be finalised between now and the end of the year, which is traditionally the time of greatest funding drawdown by local authorities. Combined with the further numbers of vacant housing units that I expect will be returned by the end of this year, this should mean that the capital target set for 2015 will be further exceeded. All 31 local authorities are actively engaged in the delivery of these units in 2015, so the impact will be felt across all areas in terms of new social housing provision. However as some of these units may not be finalised until early 2016, the end-2015 final outcome cannot be predicted with certainty at this stage. Data on the full year breakdown across the different categories of delivery across all the local authorities will be compiled in early 2016.</p><p>We now have a strong pipeline of new social housing construction projects in place following from my announcement in May of the first major social housing build programme under the Social Housing Strategy, with a further substantial announcement in July of approvals for local authorities and approved housing bodies.  The outcome has been half a billion euro allocated for 2,900 social housing new builds and acquisitions to end 2017. I also propose to make further announcements in this regard in the New Year. Coupled with new housing acquisitions and tackling vacant units, this means that progress towards achievement of the overall capital targets for the period out to 2017 is well advanced.</p><p>Information on social housing units constructed and acquired in respect of all local authorities and approved housing bodies is published on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:<i>.</i></p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s <i>Construction 2020 Strategy</i>, published last year, is aimed at addressing issues in the property and construction sectors and ensuring that any bottlenecks that might impede the sector in meeting the estimated residential demand of 25,000 units per annum are resolved. My Department and other relevant Government Departments and agencies are actively implementing the range of commitments set out therein. In addition, NAMA is aiming to deliver a target of 20,000 residential units before the end of 2020. 90% of these units will be in the greater Dublin area, with approximately 75% of the units being starter homes. </p><p>With regard to social housing delivery, the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>sets out clear, measureable actions to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the social housing list. The Strategy has been supported by two successive budgets with &euro;1.7 billion allocated to housing, with associated delivery targets of over 33,000 units across both Capital and Current programmes. Given the pressing need to recommence a house building programme almost &euro;3 billion in capital funding will be provided in support of the <i>Social Housing Strategy</i>under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan - <i>Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021</i>.</p><p>The unprecedented support and funding being allocated to bring vacant and boarded-up social housing units back into use is a notable example of the <i>Social Housing Strategy</i>&rsquo;s focused and realistic approach. Over 2,300 units were delivered in 2014, and I expect 2,500 units to be completed in 2015. </p><p>The implementation of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme is a key Government priority and a major pillar of the <i>Social Housing Strategy</i>. There are currently more than 5,400 households in receipt of HAP and the scheme has been rolled out to all categories of household in 18 local authority areas. </p><p>The maximum rent limits for different household classes that apply in each local authority where HAP has been commenced are set out in regulations and are generally based on the Rent Supplement limits as set out by the Department of Social Protection (DSP). In prescribing these limits, household size and prevailing rents in the relevant areas are taken into consideration. My Department works closely with the Department of Social Protection and monitors data which it gathers, along with PRTB data, and data gathered through HAP pilot authorities, in relation to the rent limits applying. This matter will be kept under active review in all HAP pilot authority areas.</p><p>On 10 November 2015, Government approval was given to a package of measures to address rent stability and housing supply. The measures will act to stabilise rents in the short to medium term while the additional supply of housing comes on stream. In relation to rent stability, the measures were given effect by the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015, enacted on 4 December 2015. This Act provides, inter alia, that the minimum period between rent reviews for tenancies is being increased from 12 to 24 months and this new provision will apply for a 4 year period. In addition, the minimum period of notice of new rent is increased from 28 days to 90 days and longer notice periods for the termination of long-term tenancies have been introduced. Each of these new provisions commenced on enactment.</p><p>Further amendments in the Act regarding rent and tenancies will be the subject of commencement orders. Details of the full package of new rent stability and housing supply measures are available at the following link:</p><p>With regard to modular housing provision, this programme of 500 units is being implemented to mitigate the issues associated with an increasing volume of homeless families accommodated in inappropriate commercial hotel arrangements. These units will provide emergency accommodation in the first instance, with each unit providing accommodation for a single household at a given time. While the placement of individual households in these units is intended to be on a short term basis, such placements will offer a greater level of stability than is possible in hotel accommodation, while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured. Furthermore, such arrangements will facilitate more coordinated needs assessment and support planning for access to all required services, including welfare, health and housing services.</p><p>Cognisant of the difficulty faced by households in accessing the housing market, Budget 2016 provided for an affordable rental pilot scheme, with &euro;10 million being made available from the proceeds of the sale of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to fund a pilot in 2016. The Scheme will be an on-going annual commitment to secure a long term increase in the supply of affordable properties to meet the needs of those households that would struggle to make rental payments under present market conditions. Details of the Scheme are currently being finalised in my Department and will be completed by end-year, for rollout in early 2016.</p></reply>

Local authorities receive income from a variety of sources including grants from Central Government, Local Property Tax (LPT) proceeds, commercial rates and other locally-raised charges.    It is a matter for each local authority to determine its own spending priorities , including funding towards the provision and maintenance of public lighting , in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources. Those local authorities that voted to reduce LPT rates locally must accept the effect of that reduction on local service provision. I note that Monaghan County Council (MCC) has decided to reduce the local rate of LPT by 7.5% for 2016, which will have the effect of reducing the funds available to the Council by &euro;278,664 in 2016.</p></reply>

However, Minister of State Coffey and I jointly wrote to the Chief Executives of the four Dublin Local Authorities on 10 June 2015 in the context of their role in preparing and finalising the development plans for their areas. </p><p>At that time my Department&rsquo;s analysis and that of the Dublin Housing Supply and Co-ordination Task Force was that there was sufficient supply of land to meet immediate housing requirements and that proposals to zone any additional residential land would have to be strongly evidentially grounded and consistent with core strategies. We also strongly encouraged the four Dublin local authority Chief Executives and Councils to focus around practical measures that can be adopted in their development plan preparation and implementation processes to boost housing supply and ensure that good quality housing in suitable locations is available at affordable prices. </p><p>I firmly believe that increasing supply is key to addressing the range of housing issues we face today. The First Report of the Dublin Housing Supply and Coordination Task Force concluded that across the four Dublin authorities there is land immediately available with planning permission for development of 12,785 houses and 7,925 apartments, equating to circa. 3 years supply. A further 25,507 units were deemed permissible in the immediate to short term. A further study of additional zoned residential lands that could be brought on stream by the Task Force has identified specific infrastructural interventions to facilitate additional housing supply in the Dublin Region.</p><p>Therefore, a considerable array of work has been undertaken in identifying and profiling the availability of key sites and their current activity status across Dublin, all of which is accessible to the public on my Department&rsquo;s website<i></i></p><p>In addition, and in the context of the Government&rsquo;s &ldquo;Stabilising Rents &ndash; Boosting Supply&rdquo; interim package on housing, I have recently announced a range of initiatives to be implemented from January, including a targeted rebate of development contributions in Dublin and Cork for housing supplied under certain price levels, and revised statutory planning guidelines on apartment standards, to be issued under Section 28 of the Planning Act and given legal effect through the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2015, which will reduce the cost of apartment building in Dublin City by approximately &euro;20,000 per unit, on average.</p><p>These measures combined with previous announcements, including streamlined Part V arrangements under the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 and the commitment by NAMA to fund 20,000 mainly starter homes in the greater Dublin area are visible demonstration of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to, and investment in, measures that will enhance supply.</p><p>However, if in the near future a sufficient supply response is not forthcoming from a construction sector that has seen its development contributions substantially reduced or rebated altogether for starter homes, its Part V commitments streamlined and costs of construction reduced as part of new apartment standards, then I will be requesting local authorities to vigorously implement the Vacant Site Levy, which will come into force from 2019 and to take what further steps are possible to ensure the clear housing needs of citizens are met.</p><p>However, I am confident that as key loan portfolios are divested by financial institutions and receivers and major land banks such as in some of the Strategic Development Zones move into the control of new developers who are suitably financed and attuned to today&rsquo;s market realities in terms of affordability, supply will recover. </p><p>The Government will remain vigilant in closely monitoring the market response.</p></reply>

In relation to the bus stop in question (on the kerbside opposite Connolly Station), I recognise that this  bus stop can be very busy with a considerable number of passengers waiting at peak points throughout the day and that the available kerb space is limited.  The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of bus stops and bus shelters so I have referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for a more detailed reply in relation to the issues raised in relation to this particular bus stop.</p>  <p>  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.</p></reply>

My Department will build on the already positive engagement with the Arts Council to ensure that the recommendations are delivered.This will be done in close consultation with the Arts Council using the normal governance arrangements, including regular liaison meetings and the annual service level agreement, while respecting the statutory independence of the Council in making its funding decisions.  Indeed the Arts Council has already taken on board some of the key recommendations of the report in its recently published strategy &quot;Making Great Art Work&quot;, which sets out its plans for leading the development of the arts in Ireland over the next decade.  Further information on the strategy is available on the website of the Council at <i>.</i></p><p>This 10 year strategy will be followed by a series of 3-year implementation plans in which the Arts Council has committed to incorporating many of the detailed recommendations of the value for money review.</p></reply>
