Expenditure cuts of &euro;1.6 billion were central to this adjustment and difficult decisions were required across all Departmental budgets. As the Deputy is aware, a decision was taken by Government as part of this process, on the proposal of the Department of Social Protection, to reduce by &euro;5m the amount required to be paid to my Department by the Department of Social Protection, for free television licences. This measure resulted in RT&Eacute;'s licence fee income being cut by over &euro;4.6m from the start of 2014, as well as a reduction of around &euro;350,000 in the amount available to the independent production sector through the BAI's Sound &amp;amp; Vision Fund. </p><p>  The BAI's Five Year Review of the Funding of the Public Service Broadcasters was published in July 2013 and made a number of recommendations in relation to the future funding of the Public Service Broadcasters. It is my intention that the recommendations made in this Review will serve as the basis for future decisions on the funding of the Public Service Broadcasters. </p><p>  RT&Eacute; continues to make considerable efforts to achieve its targets. While the prevailing challenging financial circumstances and this reduction in its licence fee revenue will have an impact on the provision of some RT&Eacute; services this year, I am hopeful that RT&Eacute; can continue to protect and promote its core public service output in 2014. </p><p>  I launched a consultation on the proposed Public Service Broadcasting Charge on 27 August last, which ran until the 8 October. Almost 400 responses were received from members of the public, industry and stakeholder groups. The consultation paper was based on the key findings of a Value for Money Policy Review completed by my Department earlier last year. Views were sought on a series of questions based on each of the Value for Money recommendations, which can be generally categorised as pertaining to the Basis for the Charge; Eligible Households; Applicable Businesses; Payments; Collection; and Compliance and Enforcement. </p><p>  I am considering the responses received during the Consultation and will use them to inform proposals on the Charge, which I will bring to Government in due course.</p><p>The only costs to date generated by work on the proposed charge, other than staff costs in my Department, relate to the expenses of the Value for Money Review on the proposal to introduce such a charge. The independently chaired Review Group considered a range of issues in relation to the proposal, including the efficiency and effectiveness of the current licensing system. The total cost of this process was &euro;1,880.  </p></reply>

In 2012, 19.6% Ireland&rsquo;s electricity demand was met by renewables, of which 15.3% of was met by wind generation. </p><p>  Deployment of wind generation to meet our domestic targets has already begun to realise economic benefits and a recent Irish Wind Energy Association member survey indicated that 3,400 people are currently employed in the sector. Employment creation will be further strengthened in the sector as we continue to deploy renewable energy and related technologies for the domestic and, potentially, the export market. </p><p>  Additionally, biomass can replace imports of fossil fuels and can therefore contribute to job creation in Ireland. The availability of competitively priced locally-sourced biomass has the potential to further enhance the opportunities for local employment in the sector. A report commissioned by the Irish Bioenergy Association in 2012 indicated that, in the context of achieving our 2020 targets, 3,600 permanent jobs could be created in the bioenergy sector with 8,300 work years available during construction and installation of biomass facilities. The report also indicated that energy imports could be reduced by 7.5%. The Government recognises the enterprise potential of the sector and additional policies brought forward in the context of the bioenergy strategy will have the capacity to further enhance the employment potential of the sector.</p><p>  All relevant State agencies, particularly in the enterprise area, are co-ordinating their activities to ensure they maximise the employment potential of renewable energy projects. This opportunity has already been identified by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland in their clean technology growth strategies.  </p></reply>

Ireland's NREAP assumes Ireland's 16% target will be met incrementally at around 1% per annum. It also provides that 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heating and 10% of transport power be produced from renewable sources.</p><p>  The first progress report on Ireland's NREAP was submitted in January 2012 and the second progress report, covering the years 2011 and 2012, is due and its completion is being prioritised to be submitted to the European Commission very shortly. Figures for 2012 compiled by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, and which will be included in the report, indicate that 7.1% of our overall energy requirements were met from renewable sources which is up from 6.5% in 2011. In 2012, renewable energy sources made up 19.6% in electricity, 5.2% in heat and 3.8% in transport. </p><p>  It has been found that renewable electricity generation from large scale wind farms is the most cost effective way to reach Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 renewable electricity target and it is estimated that a total of between 3,500 and 4,000 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required for 2020. </p><p>In this regard, there continues to be significant progress in increasing the amount of electricity generated from renewable energy. To date, wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target and, by September 2013, 16.3% of Ireland's electricity demand was met by wind generation. At the end of 2013, the total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid was approximately 2,300 MW and indicative figures from Eirgrid suggest that 240MW of wind electricity connected to the grid in 2013.  </p></reply>

Renewable energy has a critical role to play with regard to each element of this objective. Prior to the publication of the Commission's 2030 proposals, I supported, along with seven other European Energy Ministers, a renewable energy target for 2030. Given the long lead in time for energy developments, clear investment signals are critical for the renewable energy sector if it is to be in a position to make a contribution to achieving 2030 goals. Not only is the renewable energy sector of key importance in the context of 2030, it also provides a real, and sustainable, economic opportunity for Ireland, both in terms of providing a secure, indigenous source of energy, and potentially as a clean export. </p><p>  My Department will, over the coming months, work closely with European partners to establish the scale of the contribution Ireland should make to the acheivement of this proposed EU target. Considerable analysis of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals will be required to ensure that the framework allows for action that is cost effective and does not place a disproportionate burden on EU energy consumers.</p><p>  The Government is fully committed to delivery of the existing target of 16% of energy coming from renewable sources by 2020. In 2012, 19.6% of electricity demand was met by renewable generation, with 5.2% of heat and 2.4% of transport energy requirements coming from renewable sources. Overall, at the end of 2012, 7.1% of our energy was provided from renewable sources. It is critical that that every effort is maintained if we are to reach the 16% target for 2020, as it will provide the basis for reaching our 2030 objectives. </p><p>  Further increasing the share of renewable energy in our generation portfolio will reduce our dependency on expensive imported fossil fuels. Given the variability of some renewable energy sources, however, fossil fuels will remain an important part of the fuel mix as we transition to a low carbon economy. Having said that, subsidies are already in place to incentivise the market to deliver the necessary generation capacity to meet our renewable electricity target; market mechanisms for the reduction of fossil fuel generation are, therefore, already in place. That this action is delivering displacement of fossil fuel generation is evidenced by analysis undertaken by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, which shows renewable electricity has displaced over &euro;1 billion worth of fossil fuel imports - mainly gas - since 2006.</p></reply>

This Group met for the first time on 18th December 2013, and has met on two subsequent occasions since. </p><p>  At it's first meeting the Group agreed to an ambitious and detailed Terms of Reference which requires them to make recommendations across three defined areas, namely whether existing national regulatory and legislative frameworks around online governance remain relevant, whether other existing policy responses by the State remain sufficient and finally what the &quot;most appropriate relationship should be between ISPs, online service providers, the State and citizens in relation to internet content that may be age-inappropriate and to bullying and harassment online.&quot; In making these recommendations, the Group has been asked to have regard to a range of factors, including the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee titled &lsquo;Addressing the Growth of Social Media and tackling Cyberbullying&rsquo;.</p><p>  The Group launched a public consultation on Friday 24th of January aimed at engaging key stakeholders, including parents and young people on issues of internet content governance. The consulation focuses on regulation, governance and internet safety; bullying and harassment; and accessing age inappropriate content. It is the intention of the Group to use the outcome of this public consultation to inform their report which they will submit to me by the end of May. </p><p>  I look forward to the receiving the report which I will bring it to the attention of the Joint Oireachtas Committee and would be happy to discuss the outcome with them also.</p></reply>

Prior to formally entering the telecommunications market, either alone or in partnership with another operator, the ESB would also be required to separately secure shareholder consent and any other required statutory permissions.</p><p>  The electronic communications networks and services markets, which the ESB is proposing to enter, are fully liberalised markets in accordance with EU legislative requirements. Service providers participating in those markets must act in accordance with the EU market economy investor principles which require, among other things, that capital investment should only occur in circumstances which would be acceptable to a rational private investor operating in normal market economy conditions. It is therefore the case, that the ESB's entry into this market would be on a commercial basis. I understand that ESB is considering a joint venture partnership with a telecommunications partner, with a view to rolling out high speed broadband utilising its extensive distribution network. I await with interest a formal proposal from ESB in this regard. </p><p>  I have advised the House previously on progress in rolling out customers access to high speed broadband services. As of September last there were over 1.67 million broadband subscribers in Ireland, an increase of 1% on 2012. In the same period broadband subscriptions equal to or greater than 10 megabits per second increased to 42% from 31% of fixed line subscriptions and broadband subscriptions equal to or greater than 30 megabits per second increased to 33% from 20%. </p><p>The National Broadband Plan which I published in August 2012 commits to the delivery of high speed broadband across the country. The Plan acknowledges that its targets will be achieved by a combination of investment by the commercial market and a State intervention to serve areas that commercial criteria alone would not serve. Intensive work is underway to deliver on the various elements of the plan.</p></reply>

This is equivalent to 31,925 Gigawatt hours (GWh) or a reduction in annual CO2 emissions of around 7.7 Mega tonnes (Mt). Recognising that Government must lead by example, we are committed to achieving a 33% reduction in public sector energy use by 2020. At end 2012 we have already achieved or banked 11,419 GWh which represents 36% of our national target. Nevertheless, the bulk of our target remains to be delivered over the 7 years to 2020. </p><p>  Earlier this month the European Commission published a progress report on energy efficiency referring to historical data based mainly on what Member States reported in their second NEEAPs. It does acknowledge that Ireland&rsquo;s existing Action Plan presents a clear and cohesive medium term strategy to improve energy efficiency and in particular contains a strong commitment to improve efficiency in the public sector. However, the Commission&rsquo;s analysis points out that given the different approaches used by member states to calculate savings under the framework of the 2006 Energy Services Directive, it is difficult to quantify overall savings achieved to this point. It therefore concludes that the savings reported by different Member States are not comparable. </p><p>  Under the 2012 Energy Efficiency Directive, all Member States are required to submit a revised Energy Efficiency Action Plan by 30 April 2014 and every three years thereafter. The drafting of our next Action Plan is underway and our intention is to submit it to the Commission by the required deadline.

However, only around 1 in 5 Irish small businesses employing between 10 and 49 employees are currently selling online. </p><p>  A recent international study by McKinsey indicated that businesses that use the internet to operate their business and sell to their customers can grow up to twice as fast, employ twice as many people, and are twice as likely to export as those that don't. They have also found that use of digital technology can displace jobs, but that for every job replaced 1.6 new jobs are created. </p><p>  In the development of our National Digital Strategy, published in July 2013, my Department engaged Indecon to conduct research on the digital economy and its contribution and value to overall macro-economic activity in the country. That study found that Irish consumers spent almost &euro;4bn online in 2012. However, 70% of this online business is going out of Ireland. The amount of online purchasing continues to increase. </p><p>  In formulating a policy response to this issue, the Government's National Digital Strategy and 2013 Action Plan for Jobs commits to a trading online voucher scheme targeted at small and micro businesses. This scheme will see Irish businesses apply, through a competitive process, to receive a grant in the form of a voucher of up to &euro;2,500 to support them to transition to trading online. The vouchers are designed to help small Irish business to take advantage of the enormous opportunity the internet can bring. Trading online will enable small Irish companies to access wider markets, to survive, grow and create jobs. </p><p>  I secured additional funding of &euro;5m in 2014 to enable the national rollout of the voucher scheme. The scheme is being piloted in Dublin at present. Working with Dublin City Enterprise Board, 25 companies have been supported by the scheme to date. A second pilot identifying another 25 businesses in Dublin will start in February followed by a full national roll out of this scheme later this year. I have set a target of distributing up to 1000 vouchers in 2014.</p><p>  More information on this issue can be found on the Department's website, which has a dedicated section on the Government's National Digital Strategy. </p></reply>

The plan outlined the following main management actions aimed at reducing eel mortality and increasing silver eel escapement to the sea:</p><p>- a cessation of the commercial eel fishery and closure of the market;</p><p>- mitigation of the impact of hydropower installations;</p><p>- ensure upstream migration of juvenile eel at barriers;</p><p>- improvement of water quality.</p><p>  Based on comprehensive scientific assessment of eel stocks nationally and a review of Ireland&rsquo;s EMP in 2012 it was recommended that the closure of both the commercial and recreational eel fisheries be continued in line with the conservation imperative. Similar reviews were carried out across the EU as the eel stock is endangered throughout Europe.</p><p>  The International Council for Exploration of the Sea (ICES) advised in 2011, that glass eel recruitment had fallen to 5% of their 1960-1979 level in the Atlantic region and precariously less than 1% in the North Sea area. The very latest ICES advice (2013) indicates that the annual recruitment of glass eel to European waters has increased marginally over the last two years to 1.5% of 1960-79 levels in the North Sea area, and to 10% in the Atlantic area. The overall ICES advice is that the indices remain at very low levels compared with historical catches. In Ireland, scientific studies also show that recruitment has been declining since the mid-1980s, for example in the 2000-2011 period, the glass eel catch in the Shannon was at 2% of the pre-1980 level. </p><p>  This points to a situation where the recruitment of glass eels and elvers remains perilously low and sustainable availability of juveniles is a significant challenge. To stock home rivers with eels would mean obtaining elvers from some other European source and re-introducing these eels to rivers in Ireland. There are very considerable challenges to this:</p><p>-  the potential for the transmission of disease and parasites when introducing eels from other catchments;</p><p>- any estuaries where elvers are in adequate numbers will be targeted in the first instance by the nation in whose waters the elvers are to ensure that their rivers are adequately populated;</p><p>- Elvers are extremely costly and it would be prohibitively expensive to source these elvers competing with both the host nation and any other countries for the opportunity to obtain wild elvers;</p><p>- stocking of elvers is a long term conservation measure with no short or even medium term benefit as regards fisheries. In Ireland on average it takes up to two decades for eels to reach maturity.</p><p>  The current ICES advice for 2013 states &lsquo;The efficacy of restocking for recovering the stock remains uncertain while evidence of net benefit is lacking.&rsquo; </p><p>  Stocking is not included as a management action in Ireland&rsquo;s EMP and surplus elver recruits were not identified for the 2012-2015 period to facilitate a stocking programme. The EMP will be reviewed again in 2015 and all elements, including the potential for stocking, can be considered at that stage based on an additional three years of scientific and management advice . </p></reply>

The closing date for the receipt of responses to the revised request for tenders is 3 February 2014.</p><p>  The revised terms of reference for the assignment are as follows:</p><p>  Having regard to the fact that Ireland&rsquo;s indigenous oil and gas resources belong to the people and to the policy goal of maximising the benefits to the State from exploration for and extraction of those resources, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is seeking expert advice as to:</p><p>  (i) The &ldquo;fitness for purpose&rdquo; of Ireland&rsquo;s current fiscal regime for oil and gas exploration, development and production having regard to:</p><p>- The petroleum prospectivity of the Irish offshore; </p><p>- Ireland&rsquo;s relative attractiveness as a location for mobile international exploration investment;</p><p>- The findings of the May 2012 report of the former Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture, together with the debate of that report by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann;</p><p>- Issues raised through the wider public debate on the fitness for purpose of Ireland&rsquo;s fiscal regime;</p><p>- Comparative international experience; and</p><p>- Other relevant reports.</p><p>  (ii) Supported by analysis, whether revisions should be made to the fiscal licensing regime, in particular having regard to:</p><p>- The level at which the terms are set;</p><p>- The nature of the instruments used; and</p><p>- The tax reliefs available, including both the nature and timing of tax reliefs.</p><p>-  It is intended to bring consideration of this matter to a conclusion in the coming months. This will ensure that the next licensing round can be launched against a backdrop of regulatory certainty and encourage new investment in exploration.</p><p>  The Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960 provides the legislative underpinning to the regulatory framework applying to oil and gas exploration in Ireland. The Act is important in setting out the high-level exploration licensing regime and the rights conferred by the various authorisations. Since it was enacted, a broad body of legislation at national and European Union level that is directly relevant to petroleum exploration and production activities, including planning, safety and environmental legislation, has been passed. Against that background, my Department is currently engaged in a review of the 1960 Act.</p></reply>

Phase 1 of the Strategy focuses on actions in 3 key areas &ndash; citizen engagement, small business, and digital in learning and significant progress is being made in implementing actions in these areas:</p><p>- The Government provided funding of &euro;5m this year for the implementation of an Online Trading Voucher Scheme for small businesses and this scheme is being piloted in the Dublin area at present involving 25 companies. A second Dublin based pilot, comprising a further 25 companies, will start in February followed by a full national roll out of this scheme during 2014. </p><p>- Digital training for citizens is ongoing. The individual grants available as part of the BenefIT 4 scheme were announced in July last and training began in early Autumn. Training is currently available at over 570 locations nationwide and it is expected this will grow to about 700 locations.</p><p>- My Department in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills are in the process of rolling out high speed broadband to post-primary schools and have commenced the roll out of phase III of the 100Mbps schools project. This will cover 272 schools in 9 counties: Carlow, Cork, Kerry, Kilkenny, Limerick, Tipperary, Waterford, Wicklow and Wexford. This will complete the national rollout to some 516 post-primary schools. The final 272 schools will have a 100Mbps connection by the beginning of the new academic year in September 2014. In addition, my Department has commissioned the Economic and Social Research Institute to research the learning outcomes as a consequence of enhanced broadband connectivity.</p><p>- A suite of &ldquo;Switch On&rdquo; workshops will target schools to promote the use of digital and to assist them to overcome barriers to use of high-speed broadband. These workshops are under development and are targeted to be rolled out in March</p><p>- In December 2012, Lord David Puttnam was appointed as Ireland&rsquo;s first Digital Champion. In addition to his engagements with the European Commission and other Digital Champions, he is undertaking a number of strategic engagements with key stakeholders on the National Digital Strategy throughout 2014. </p><p>  Macro-economic research on the value of digital to the economy of Ireland was published as part of the National Digital Strategy. It indicated that digital contributed 4.4% to Ireland&rsquo;s GDP in 2012 and is supporting up to 95,000 jobs. The digital part of the economy in Ireland is growing at 16% per year.</p><p>  In tandem with measures to stimulate uptake and use of technology in society, the Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and </p><p>- a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. In the fixed line segment of the market, eircom has announced plans to pass 1.4m premises with its next generation broadband service, with speeds of up to 100Mbps, while UPC has increased its entry level and maximum speeds to 120Mbps and 200Mbps respectively. Mobile operators have also made announcements regarding network upgrades and are rolling out enhanced product offerings. Last week, I introduced legislation in the D&aacute;il, to allow the ESB to utilise its electricity network to install a new high speed broadband communications network. </p><p>  These developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. </p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector over the coming years, the results of which will inform the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

This Recommendation was included as part of a set of proposals published by the Commission on 22 January, 2014 and is available on the Commission's website. </p><p>The Recommendation contains eighteen provisions, including <i>inter alia</i>   strategic planning and assessment of environmental impacts, baseline studies, operational requirements, use of chemicals, monitoring requirements, environmental liability and financial guarantees, sanctions and administrative capacity </p><p>  My priority for now is the research programme to be overseen by the EPA in Ireland. That research programme will consider all stages of unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects and operations, including construction, commissioning, operating, decommissioning and aftercare, as well as off-site and other developments.</p><p>  Detailed information on the regulatory approaches of other countries that have experience with this activity will also be considered. The research programme is expected to consider a minimum of five countries including at least one country where a moratorium on unconventional gas exploration has been introduced.The EPA research will consider the specific potential environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing in Ireland.</p><p>It is my view that guidance to ensure consistency of environmental assessment for developments proposing the use of hydraulic fracking throughout Member States is to be welcomed. It is anticipated that such guidance will continue to develop in accordance with both scientific research and technological progress throughout Europe.  </p></reply>

As shareholder, however, I have a strong concern in relation to the ongoing commercial position of the Company and I regularly liaise with the Company in this regard. </p><p>  The Post Office Network has many strengths and has the largest retail presence in the country. I have been supportive of its attempts to diversify its income streams and to win a wider range of commercial contracts offering higher margins. </p><p>I have welcomed the selection of An Post as the provider of over the counter cash services for social welfare customers. The social welfare contract is the largest contract held by the post office division of An Post. The Department of Social Protection intends to implement a strategy whereby the bulk of social welfare payments will be made electronically and has recently published a Request For Information on ePayment Solutions for welfare clients and associated business processes. I understand that the post office network will pitch strongly for the social welfare e-payment business when it is put out to tender by the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>  Having invested in the computerisation of all post offices, the post office network is well positioned to become the front office provider of choice for Government and financial services sector. Progress towards diversification within the financial services sector is already underway with the enhanced arrangement with AIB and the agreement with Aviva for the transfer of their branch offices personal insurance business to One Direct.</p><p>  In the context of the public sector transformation agenda I will continue to engage with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to consideration, as appropriate, of the post office network for transactional elements of the business of Government Departments and Agencies and have stressed to my Government colleagues that the network is ideally configured for over the counter transactions. Any such developments would, of course, need to be subject to public procurement requirements as appropriate.</p><p>  Overall, I see a strong future for the network by using its existing strengths to remain a significant player as a front office for Government services. In this connection, The post office network has secured over the counter Local Property Tax payments. Garda fixed fines, TV licences and passports can all be paid or purchased at the post office as well as dog licences and toll fees. I also see a strong role for the post office network in the next phase of the standard bank account project as the target segment for this project are already comfortable in using post offices for financial transactions.</p></reply>

Ireland is currently heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels to meet our energy needs. While it is acknowledged that fossil fuels will remain part of the energy mix for some time to come, progress is being made towards increasing the share of renewable energy in our generation porfolio. The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources. Figures for 2012 show that 19.6% of electricity demand was met from renewables.</p><p>  To date wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. In 2012 15.3% of electricity demand was met by wind generation. At the end of 2013, the total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid was 2,300 MW. It is estimated that a total of between 3,500 and 4,000 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target. Currently, around 3,000 MW of renewable generation has taken up connection offers under the Gate 3 grid connection programme. </p><p>  EirGrid's most recent Generation Capacity Statement, covering the period 2013 - 2022, deals with both renewable and conventional sources. It shows a positive outlook for power generation adequacy over the next decade for Ireland. However, EirGrid has also stated the need for reinforcment and upgrading of the high voltage transmission grid to ensure that reliable electricity supplies can be maintained to all regions, and allow Ireland to attract and retain investment and create jobs. This work is being carried out by EirGrid through their Grid 25 programme and is also essential if we are to leverage our abundant, indigenous, renewable energy resources and realise the potential they offer for reducing our dependence on imported fossil fuels. The renewable energy sector has also been identified by both the IDA and Enterprise Ireland as a key growth area in their clean technology strategies. Therefore, increasing the renewable element of our energy mix will contribute to improving our energy security and our economic development. </p><p>  As we look towards a new EU energy and climate change framework for 2030, the need to expand the renewable generation portfolio becomes apparent. This presents the opportunity to facilitate the development of additional technologies such as offshore renewable energy, which is the subject of an Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan, which I will be publishing shortly.</p></reply>

The research will consider baseline characterisation with regard to water, seismic and air quality, potential impacts and mitigations and best practice regulatory framework. </p><p>  I have also made it clear that should the EPA research conclude that this technology can be used in a manner that protects the environment, that any application for an exploration licence that proposed the use of hydraulic fracturing as part of an unconventional gas exploration programme would be subject to a full environmental impact assessment. An environmental impact assessment entails consideration of the potential impacts of a project on population, fauna, flora, soil, water, air, climatic factors, material assets, including the architectural and archaeological heritage, landscape and the inter-relationship between the above factors. Under the EIA Directive, it is not possible to permit a project unless it can be determined following assessment that it would not have an unacceptable environmental or social impact.  </p></reply>

However, the same consumer protection framework applies to retail credit lenders as to other regulated lenders including the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears ( CCMA ) and the Central Bank engages with these firms in relation to their treatment of borrowers under the mortgage arrears resolution process. In particular, the CCMA sets out requirements for all mortgage lenders, including retail credit firms, dealing with borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears on a mortgage secured on a primary home.  It provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their co-operating borrowers.</p><p>  The Central Bank has advised that for the sub-prime category of lender, there are 17,807 PDH accounts of which 4,341 have been restructured.  In addition, out of the 659 BTL mortgage accounts, the Central Bank has advised that 68 have been restructured.</p><p>  The Central Bank has informed me that the number of orders of repossession for this category is not available at the moment but I will send this data to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available.</p></reply>

I have however, introduced an additional levy on pension funds at 0.15% to, among other things, continue to help fund the Jobs Initiative. The additional levy, within the existing legal framework, will apply to pension fund assets in 2014 and 2015. </p><p>  The chargeable persons for the pension fund levy are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) with responsibility for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans. </p><p>  There are two exceptions to the requirement to pay the levy provided for in the governing legislation (section 125B of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999). </p><p>  The first exception provides that the levy will not apply to the assets of occupational pension schemes in respect of employees whose employment is, or was, wholly exercised outside the State. In other words, the levy does not apply to the extent that a pension scheme is intended to provide retirement benefits to scheme members employed outside the State. </p><p>  The second exception provides that the levy will not apply where the trustees of a scheme have passed a resolution to wind-up the scheme and where the business in respect of which the scheme was established is insolvent in accordance with the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984.</p><p>  The fact that there are very limited situations where the levy does not have to be paid explains, in part at least, why it was possible to introduce it at a relatively low rate of 0.6% in the first place and to have a rate of additional levy as low as 0.15% for the years 2014 and 2015. Making an exception for pension funds with a value of less than &euro;300,000 will inevitably give rise to demands for exceptions to be granted in other situations that would be viewed by those seeking them as being equally deserving.  The inevitable result of this course of action would be a narrowing of the levy base which would result in a greater imposition on the non-exempt schemes and I am not prepared to go down that road.</p></reply>

I am informed by Revenue that 8,421 bodies currently hold charitable tax exemptions and that a full list of such bodies is available on the Revenue website at .</p><p>  I am also informed that the relevant information available as to Exchequer cost is in respect of the exemption from Income Tax of charities, colleges, hospitals, schools, friendly societies, etc in the years 2007 to 2011 inclusive, the latest year for which the necessary information is available. The relevant information is as follows:<table><tr><th>Tax Year </th><th>Cost  &euro;m  </th></tr><tr><td>2007 </td><td>30.7 </td></tr><tr><td>2008 </td><td>35.8 </td></tr><tr><td>2009 </td><td>40.7 </td></tr><tr><td>2010 </td><td>35.5 </td></tr><tr><td>2011 </td><td>31.1 </td></tr></table></p><p>  The income on which these costs are based includes dividend income on which Income Tax deducted at source has been repaid, other investment income, payments received under covenant, donations by the PAYE sector to approved bodies, together with the associated tax relief and donations by the self-employed and corporate sectors to approved bodies and approved sports bodies.  Information is not available about other income received gross of tax. In the absence of other information, tax has been assumed at the standard rate of income tax even though a different rate might be more appropriate.</p><p>  Revenue has no regulatory role in relation to charities and its function is rightly confined to responding to applications from bodies claiming exemption from tax on the basis that they are charities and ensuring that once they have been granted an exemption they continue to comply with the terms of that exemption. With regard to the allocation of charitable tax exemptions to individual organisations, Revenue is independent in the performance of its day-to-day functions and is also obliged to maintain confidentiality in respect of taxpayer affairs. Therefore it is not in a position to provide information to any third party regarding the granting of charitable tax exemptions to individual organisations.</p><p>  Revenue has pointed out, however, that the procedures in relation to the granting of charitable tax exemptions are set out in detail on the Revenue Website and implementation of these procedures is subject to controls including oversight by officers at various levels within Revenue to ensure that conditions are adhered to.</p><p>  Before making a decision to refuse a charitable tax exemption or to withdraw an existing exemption, Revenue is obliged to apply fair procedures and to afford the parties concerned an opportunity to state their arguments fully. Once a decision is made it can be appealed to the independent Appeal Commissioners. I have been assured by Revenue that that the procedures currently in place for granting Charitable Tax exemptions and reviewing the continued entitlement of bodies to those exemptions are appropriate.</p><p>  I am satisfied with these assurances and with the arrangements that are in place for Revenue to fulfil its role in relation to the tax exemption. I am strongly of the view that Revenue's role is in ensuring the proper operation of the tax system and in the context of charities this means the proper operation of the exemption. Revenue is not and, in my opinion should not be seen as, the quasi-regulator of the charity sector. The Deputy is no doubt aware that the charitable sector is subject to a separate regulatory framework. </p></reply>

It was originally intended that this exemption would only apply to first-time buyers, which is clear from the heading to the section: "Exemption for first-time buyers". The Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill (prior to enactment) also states that the exemption applies to first-time buyers. The Deputy may recall that mortgage interest relief was phased out on mortgages taken out after 31 December 2012 and this measure was a transitional provision to help first-time buyers in the first year after the abolition of mortgage interest relief. However, as written, the exemption benefits any buyer, not just a first-time buyer. The result is that a person who purchased a second hand house in 2013 and occupies it as a sole or main residence is entitled to the exemption regardless of whether s/he is a first-time buyer.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that this exemption applies to a clearly defined group of property owners, who are being identified using Stamp Duty records. These fall into three broad groups:</p><p>  - those who purchased a residential property between 1 January 2013 and 1 May 2013 and paid the LPT for 2013 -  they may be entitled to a refund of the 2013 payment and subject to certain conditions may be exempt for 2014 to 2016 LPT,</p><p>  - those who purchased a property between 1 May 2013 and 1 November   the vendor was liable to the 2013 liability, if the purchaser paid the 2014 liability they may be entitled to a refund and may be entitled to an exemption for 2015 and 2016 LPT, and</p><p>  - those who bought between 2 November and 31 December 2013 - the vendor once he or she owned the property on 1 May and 1 November is liable for the 2013 and 2014 liability and the purchaser may be entitled to an exemption for 2015 and 2016 LPT.</p><p>  - There is a significant amount of work involved in identifying individuals who bought in 2013 and who are entitled to the exemption. When this work is completed Revenue will write to these individuals and will provide advice on what action should be taken where the individual confirms that s/he qualifies for the exemption and wishes to claim it, so that s/he may receive a refund of any LPT already paid for 2013 or 2014. Good progress is being made on identifying those that may be eligible and the letter from Revenue will clearly indicate what they need to do to claim the exemption. Once the exemption is properly claimed refunds will issue promptly to the claimants, subject to their tax affairs being up to date. </p><p>  There are other circumstances in which a refund of LPT may be considered. If the Deputy has a particular case or set of circumstances in mind, he may wish to contact the Revenue Commissioners with the details and they will advise him of the procedures to be followed.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-01-30a.112.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1035" speakername="Ruairi Quinn" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014013000038#WRC01400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47, 48 and 56 together.</p><p>  The allocation of SNA resources is not a matter for this Department but is instead an independent function carried out by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), who are responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports including resource teaching and SNA support as well as the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required. The number of SNAs employed in a school depends on the allocation given to the school by the NCSE, based on its assessment of the special educational needs of pupils in the school. If the Deputy requires further information regarding the methodology around the allocation of SNA resources to schools then her query should more appropriately be directed to the NCSE.</p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) does not have a role in setting the contractual hours of work of SNAs. The contractual position in respect of SNAs is outlined in their contract of employment. Links to the SNA Contracts of Employment are as follows:Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 12/05 (Post-Primary)  Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 15/05 (Primary) </p><p>  This contract of employment is augmented by all of the relevant Departmental Circulars governing Special Needs Assistants which detail the standardised terms and conditions of employment for SNAs. These Circulars are amended and new Circulars are issued by the Minister for Education and Skills from time to time. The position regarding the working hours of full-time SNAs is as outlined in the standard SNA contract of employment, which was agreed by this Department, the Trade Unions (IMPACT and SIPTU) representing SNAs and the Management Bodies in 2005. In that context, the standard SNA contract has been designed to be flexible to cater for the different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools including primary, post-primary and special schools. No set hours were agreed but instead full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school in order to help with reception and dispersal of children and preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc. These times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school. </p><p>  In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total. Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days. These 12 days now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and/or the normal school year. SNAs who are employed in a part-time capacity are paid a pro-rata amount dependent upon their level of hours of employment. Part-time SNAs are paid on the agreed divisor rate for pay purposes for part-time SNAs which is 32 hours.  I should point out that this divisor was agreed with both of the Trade Unions (IMPACT and SIPTU) that represent SNAs. Furthermore, the issue of appropriate working hours for all public servants was one of the key aspects of the set of proposals for a public service agreement which were put forward by the Labour Relations Commission and which now form the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2016 (the Haddington Road Agreement). The specific text of the Haddington Road Agreement relating to working hours for SNAs is as follows:</p><p>&quot;SPECIAL NEEDS ASSISTANTS</p><p>Hours</p><p>Under the terms of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, discussions took place that led to agreement on changed attendance arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) that give schools the option of an additional two hours working time per week from each Special Needs Assistant. Under the terms of this Agreement on increased working hours in the Public Service, the available requirements in schools for additional hours for SNAs is quite limited. Given issues such as the duration of the school day and operation hours, and the specific availability of individual SNAs the details of the utilisation of any additional requirements should be the subject of further discussions.</p><p>  These new attendance arrangements, allied to the provisions outlined in the above paragraph should be the subject of a review by the LRC in advance of the 2013/2014 school year, involving the Department of Education and Skills and IMPACT/SIPTU, in order to assess if the additional hours are being utilised in the most effective and appropriate manner and in order to achieve agreement on any changes deemed necessary in terms of the arrangement agreed for teachers. This will constitute the liability on Special Needs Assistants in respect of working hours for the purposes of this extension to the Public Service Agreement.&quot;</p><p>  Finally, I note that you have requested a detailed breakdown of the working hours' patterns for all full-time SNAs in the country. This information is not available in the Department and it would be wholly impractical, and a waste of administrative time and resources, to seek such information given that there are over 4,000 schools in the country.</p></reply>

Applications for patronage of the proposed school in the Galway area were received from 3 patron bodies, Educate Together, Lifeways Ireland Limited and the Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board (formerly the VEC).  On 26 September 2013,   Educate Together were announced by my Department as the patron of an 8-classroom school for the Knocknacarra area in Galway. My Department also announced that consideration is to be given to the establishment of a further 8-classroom school for the Knocknacarra area in 2015 under the patronage of Lifeways Ireland Limited.  This will be subject to further prior confirmation that parental demand will support this model and size of school adequately at that time.  All of the relevant information, including the full assessment report is available on my Department's website.</p><p>  In relation to the recognition of the other schools referred to by the Deputy, the Deputy may be aware that a process is in place under which the issue of permanent recognition, for the schools in question, is being assessed. This process is based on the school's progress in fulfilling the undertakings supplied by the school's patron to meet permanent recognition criteria in accordance with the requirements of the Education Act 1998 and the Rules for National Schools. All recognised schools, regardless of their philosophy or ethos, are required to comply with the Education Act 1998 and the Rules for National Schools. My Department met with the schools concerned in September/October 2012 at which it was agreed that a number of issues had to be addressed by the schools so as to satisfy the requirements for permanent recognition. Both the Department and schools concerned have committed to ongoing engagement, and the Department's inspectorate agreed to provide a number of advisory/support visits to the schools to assist them in making progress to fulfil the requirements. The first set of the advisory visits occurred in the last academic year and further visits are scheduled. </p><p>  It was also agreed that the schools would have their period of provisional recognition extended by three years to allow them adequate time to reach the requirements. This extension will not impede the schools receiving permanent recognition in the interim if the criteria for recognition are satisfactorily met. The extension of provisional recognition recognises the shared commitment between the school community and the Department to further ongoing engagement with the objective of enabling the schools concerned to meet the permanent recognition criteria as soon as possible. </p></reply>

I want to alleviate some of the pressure on these schools by adding a bit of flexibility to the developing schools criteria.  In this regard the staffing appeals process has been extended to include a new appeals criterion for those schools that make a significant contribution to the provision of school places which assists the response to demographic growth within their area and as a result are under significant pressure on their class sizes at infants level. Each application to the Appeals Board will be considered on its merits.  The Appeals Board will assess whether, in its opinion, the school is deploying all its mainstream classroom teachers in an appropriate manner. The Appeals Board will prioritise those schools that, in its opinion, are under greatest pressure on their class sizes at infants level as a result of their increasing enrolments of junior infants.  Any posts granted by the Appeals Board will be allocated on a provisional basis pending confirmation of actual enrolments on 30 September 2014. </p><p>The operation of this new appeals criteria will be reviewed in Autumn 2014 as part of the Department's regular consultations with the relevant education partners.</p><p>The staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 2014/15 school year, including the details on the aforementioned new appeals criterion, are set out in Department Circular 0007/2014 that was published on Friday 24 January. </p></reply>

This means the occupational pension paid is based on the assumption that the pensioner also receives the State Pension.</p><p>  Where the State Pension is not payable, a discretionary supplementary pension may be payable under the relevant public sector pension scheme to bring the pension up to the same amount as would be paid to an equivalent public servant on modified PRSI.  In such cases, a supplementary pension is only payable where the individual, through no fault of their own, does not qualify for social welfare benefit or qualifies at less than the maximum personal rate. It is therefore necessary to claim any available social welfare benefits in order to receive a supplementary pension. This situation is not new and already applies to public sector workers who have a retirement age below 65. Accordingly, there are no plans to introduce additional arrangements for public sector workers arising from the changes to the State Pension (transition).</p></reply>

The OPW has no responsibility for any embankments at Ballymacprior, Killorglin, County Kerry. Following the abolition of the Land Commission, a Public Trustee administers a fund that was intended to provide for maintenance of the former Land Commission embankments. In practice, however, there is little, if any, funds remaining for maintenance of any of these structures. Maintenance works have been carried out in some places on these embankments by the relevant landowners. The investigation and addressing of coastal protection problems at these locations are matters for Kerry County Council in the first instance. It is open to the Council to apply for funding to deal with coastal protection under the Office of Public Works (OPW) Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme. Any application received will be assessed under the eligibility criteria, which include a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of funding. </p><p>  The Office of Public Works wrote on 10th January, 2014 to City and County Managers in coastal areas indicating that it will accept applications under its Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme for funding to assist with repairs to built flood defences and coastal protection structures which have been damaged by the recent storms. This is a once-off measure to reinstate built coastal defences to their pre storm condition. The specific application form for this entitled Coastal Storm Damage Flooding Questionnaire 2014 is available on OPW's website www.opw.ie under Flood Risk Management. Any work for which funding is sought will be carried out by the Local Authorities. It is also open to Local Authorities to carry out flood mitigation and coastal protection works using their own resources.</p></reply>

In relation to being unable to access bank funding, the enterprise can seek support from the Credit Review Office who accept applications from SMEs, sole traders and small and medium-sized farm enterprises that have had their application for credit refused or reduced or have had credit facilities withdrawn, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition and feel that the bank&rsquo;s decision is unjustified.</p><p>  Depending on the type of activity proposed, the enterprise may be eligible to access credit through either Microfinance Ireland or the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme, two schemes introduced by my Department. Microfinance Ireland provide loans for up to &euro;25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises, with viable business propositions, that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks. The SME Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS) supports SMEs who, because of lack of collateral or because of the sector they operate in, face difficulties in accessing traditional bank credit. The assistance provided through both of these initiatives, like many Government-backed business support activities, are regarded as State Aid and are governed according to the European Commission's De Minimis State Aid rules. Therefore primary agricultural production (i.e. farming) is excluded from both Schemes. However, investment for the purpose of value-adding downstream processing and marketing activities are regarded as being &ldquo;industrial&rdquo; and so are eligible for the Microfinance and SME Credit Guarantee Schemes. </p><p>  We continue to have a very strong focus on delivering new and innovative ways to tackle access to finance issues, in recognition of the huge importance that it plays for enterprise growth and overall economic recovery.   The Action Plan for Jobs 2014 will continue the work undertaken by the Government since taking office to support and improve access to finance for SMEs.  I will soon be launching the Action Plan for Jobs 2014 which will set out in detail the actions we will be taking this year to address challenges in this arena.  </p></reply>

National Radio Cabs (NRC) was the only company that responded to the Invitation to Tender - (ITT) at that time and subsequently a 2&frac12; year contract was put in place with NRC. The contract encompassed the 3 Dublin based Department buildings and the Dublin based Offices of my Department (e.g. the Companies Registration Office). That contract expired in September 2011. In the context of the development of a National Procurement Service, my Department did not issue a further tender for taxi services since late 2011 as we propose accessing the centrally procured taxi service in due course. In the interim the existing contract has continued in operation.</p><p>  As I have alluded to, my Department is aware that the newly established Office of Government Procurement (OGP) has begun work to develop a Taxi Services procurement strategy for use across the public service and my Department and its Offices intend to avail ourselves of this contract. While we await the results of the OGP public procurement process it is the intention of my Department to put a short-term contract in place.

The primary opportunity for regional locations is in respect of the existing client base and potential further investment opportunities from same.  Approximately 70% of all FDI investments won by IDA Ireland is from the existing client base.  I should also point out that 72,500 people, roughly 44% of the total employment in IDA Ireland&rsquo;s base of companies including those that were former clients of Shannon Development, are located outside of Dublin and Cork. </p><p>  As I have said in this House on more than one occasion, I am, of course, concerned at the lack of investment in certain regional locations and I have, accordingly, requested IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to work with my Department so that we can explore what further initiatives we can take to ensure we have a better approach to enterprise development in regional locations.  This exercise will complement the in-depth analysis of our FDI strategy which is currently being undertaken by Forf&aacute;s and which will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI and any changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid Rules, which will come into effect on 1 July 2014. The results of these two exercises will form the basis of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy from 2015 onwards.</p><p><b>Table showing the number of IDA sponsored site visits on a county by county basis in each of the years 2011 to 2013 inclusive</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th><div>2011</div></th><th><div>2012</div></th><th><div>2013</div></th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>4</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td><div>15</div></td><td><div>14</div></td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork </td><td><div>27</div></td><td><div>38</div></td><td><div>31</div></td></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>7</div></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td><div>150</div></td><td><div>196</div></td><td><div>180</div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway </td><td><div>35</div></td><td><div>18</div></td><td><div>15</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim </td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td><div>40</div></td><td><div>30</div></td><td><div>23</div></td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td><div>26</div></td><td><div>12</div></td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo </td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>6</div></td><td><div>10</div></td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>5</div></td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td><div>11</div></td><td><div>26</div></td><td><div>14</div></td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td><div>15</div></td><td><div>7</div></td><td><div>9</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>6</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

This Group included representatives from the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Pensions Board.  A Working and Retirement Forum was held in Croke Park in December 2012, at which a range of stakeholder groups, including employer and employee representative organisations, discussed a wide range of issues linked to working and retirement including the ending of the State Pension (Transition) from January 2014. The Group has prepared a number of proposals detailing measures which may encourage participation and retention in the labour market of older workers and these are currently being considered.</p><p>  Statutory law permits private sector workers to work past the age of 65, as there is no statutory retirement age for such employees in Ireland.  However, a contract of employment may contain a retirement age.  The existence of a clause in the employment contract setting out a maximum retirement age is a matter of contract between the employer and employee.  </p><p>  As matters currently stand for those employees who are obliged by their contract of employment to retire at 65 years but will not receive the State pension until 66 years, the Department of Social Protection has indicated that, in terms of financial supports, social welfare benefits will continue to be available to the age of 66 for those who are contractually obliged to leave employment.  Also, existing legislation provides that jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66, subject to the person having paid 156 or more qualifying contributions and satisfying the general scheme conditions.  </p><p>  The Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2011, which aim to protect against discrimination in relation to access to employment on a number of grounds including age and give effect in national law to the EU Directive 2000/78/EC, come within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Justice, Mr Alan Shatter T.D.  The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has made rulings in a series of age-discrimination cases concerning Directive 2000/78/EC which prohibit discrimination in employment and occupation on various grounds, including age.  The CJEU has clarified that, under Directive 2000/78/EC, mandatory retirement ages may be set down if, within the context of national law, they are objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate social policy aim.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-01-30a.212.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014013000041#WRF01500"><p>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that 129 appeals relating to Scope Section decisions on the insurability of employment are currently registered with that office.  The average time taken to process Scope/ insurability of employment appeals in 2013 was 78.4 weeks for those requiring an oral hearing and 35.8 weeks for a summary decision. This compares to 83.3 weeks and 45.6 weeks respectively in 2012.  </p><p>The average processing time for all appeals peaked in 2011 at 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.1 weeks for a summary decision.  In 2012, processing times improved by 10.3 weeks when the average time for an oral hearing was 39.5 weeks while there was a slight increase to 27.8 weeks for a summary decision.  This improvement continued in 2013 to 33.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.8 weeks for a summary decision.   </p><p>  Insurability of employment appeals are particularly protracted, because of the complex nature of insurability questions, the number of parties that might be involved in a case, and, where an oral hearing is required, the logistics required in the process.  </p><p>  Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system. By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.</p><p>  There has been a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2009 which has placed extraordinary pressure on the office.  Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the number of appeals received peaked at 35,484, reducing to 32,777 appeals in 2013. In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office.  A major programme of process redesign and modernisation is also underway in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.</p><p>  In addition to the improvements in processing times mentioned above, these measures have also led to a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised in the appeals office from 17,787 in 2009 to 38,421 in 2013.  An additional 5,863 appeals were finalised in 2013 compared to 2012.  Good progress has also been made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 14,884 at 27 January 2014.</p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.</p></reply>

The scheme operates on the basis of non-statutory rules and guidance.  A person wishing to pursue BTEA will have to satisfy a number of conditions such as being a certain age, in receipt of a prescribed social welfare payment for a specified time period, pursuing a full time course of study leading to a recognised qualification in a recognised college and progressing in the level of education held by the client with reference to the national framework of qualifications among others.  The BTEA is designed to support the person for study for the full academic year rather than on a modular or semester basis.  Given the nature of BTEA, no provision is made to allow a person to complete an individual semester of a full-time course.  </p><p>  The person in question was approved for the BTEA for the academic years 2010/11, 2011/12 and 2012/13.  My understanding is that the person did not complete the academic year 2012/13 and BTEA was discontinued.    </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-01-30a.254.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014013000044#WRJ00500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 to 99, inclusive, together.</p><p>  Compliance by Bus &Eacute;ireann with the European Communities (Financial Transparency) Regulations 2004 (S.I. No. 693 of 2004) is a matter for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. I understand O.J.E.U. of 15.9.2007 dealt with a complaint by The Irish Coach Tourism and Transport Council concerning alleged unlawful State aid granted to the C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann (CI&Eacute;) bus companies, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus by the Irish Government in form of grants under the National Development Plan. It concerned the financing of the public bus transport services (annual operating compensation payments, upgrading and replacement of buses), and furthermore, the financing of the transport infrastructure (passenger activities and bus garage at Harristown) and disability awareness training in Ireland for the period 2000 to 2006.</p><p>  The complainant alleged that the financing of the measures detailed therein by the Irish authorities may have involved unlawful State aid.<b><i></i></b>  The findings were inconclusive and did not make any recommendations regarding the operation of the free travel scheme operated by the Department. </p><p>  The Free Travel scheme was introduced in 1967. It is not operated as a public service obligation (PSO) and it does not confer any real financial advantage on participating transport undertakings or place participating transport undertakings in a more favourable competitive position as regards non-participants. The scheme operates in an objective and transparent manner and on the basic premise that participants should be left no better or worse off as a result of the existence of the scheme. To this end, compensation under the scheme is calculated on the basis of fares foregone at a reduced rate to take account of travel generated by the free travel scheme. Those operators which participate in the scheme receive a payment<b><i></i></b>from the Department significantly below the standard fare whereas those operators which do not participate in the scheme are free to charge full fare for all passengers. Operators and routes<b><i></i></b>  have to be commercially viable in their own right and cannot rely on payment from the free travel scheme as some form of subvention.</p><p>  The free travel scheme permits free travel on most CIE public transport services, Luas and a range of services offered by over 80 private operators in various parts of the country at an annual cost to the exchequer of some &euro;76  million in 2013. This Department also provides limited funding of &euro;1.5 million for the Rural Transport Programme (RTP) but organisation and development of the service is a matter for the National Transport Authority. </p><p>  The Department pays the CIE Group centrally in respect of transport services provided nationwide by the Group for pensioners and other categories of eligible customers under the free travel scheme.  The apportionment of payment between the three constituent companies, Bus Eireann, Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath and Iarnr&oacute;d Eireann is a matter for the CIE Group to determine. Under the Programme for National Recovery 2011-2014, expenditure on the free travel scheme was capped at 2010 levels.  Prior to the imposition of the cap the rate of payment was reviewed regularly having regard to authorised fare increases and services provided. </p><p>  Information on payments to CIE from 2003 is set out below. The additional data requested will require further work and will be forwarded separately when it is to hand. Payments are made monthly to the CIE Group on receipt of invoices. The monthly amount varies only slightly; accordingly, the total amount paid each year since 2003 is set out below:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Annual<br /><br />&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>2003</td><td>45.6m</td></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td>46.7m</td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>48.8m</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>50.6m</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>52.6m</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>56.4m</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>61.2m</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>61.4m</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>61.4m</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>61.2m</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This means that, in the future, the task of financing increased pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the working population as demographic projections indicate the ratio of working age to older people will decrease from 5.3 to 1 at present to 2.1 to 1 by 2060. Life expectancy in Ireland is also increasing and whilst this is very welcome development, this also has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.  The fundamental principle involved here is that people need to participate in the workforce for longer and they need to contribute more towards their pensions if they are to achieve the income they expect or would like to have in retirement.  </p><p>  The Interdepartmental Group was chaired by the Department of Social Protection and included representatives from the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Pensions Board.  Further engagement was also undertaken with the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health and Children. </p><p>  The Group met on four occasions which included a &lsquo;Forum on Working and Retirement&rsquo; which was held in Croke Park in December 2012.  The purpose of this forum was to obtain views from representative bodies and stakeholders and identify the wide ranging issues linked to working and retirement prior to the development of any possible policy proposals.  Attendees included employer and employee representative groups, older people&rsquo;s representative groups, representatives from the pensions industry, academic commentators and representatives from the legal profession. </p><p>  The agenda for the Group&rsquo;s meetings included consideration of the broad range of issues impacting on the labour market participation of older workers; enterprise issues, employment and equality law issues; proposals regarding deferral of the state pension, consideration of occupational pension issues. Several other meetings were held within the Department of Social Protection in furthering the work on this topic.</p><p>  The Group has examined a number of proposals which may encourage participation and retention in the labour market of older workers and these are currently being considered. </p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 80,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Department has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.  </p><p>  Budget 2014 introduced changes to the weekly minimum contribution towards rent supplement for couples from &euro;35 to &euro;40 for new and existing recipients. This further aligns the minimum contribution payable under these schemes with the local authority differential rents structures. The measure equates to a rent supplement reduction of &euro;21.60 per calendar month in respect of the customer referred to by the Deputy.  I have no plans to revise the minimum contribution at this time. </p><p>  Policy in relation to the differential rents scheme is a matter for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. </p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of a short-term income support.  Approximately 50,000 recipients, representing some 63% of the total rent supplement customer base, are in receipt of the supplement for over 18 months. In July 2013 the Government approved the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  Under HAP, responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from the Department of Social Protection to local authorities using HAP.

It is not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently over 82,500 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million funding in 2013. </p><p>  The Department completed a review of the maximum rent limits for rent supplement last year and revised rent limits came into effect from 17 June 2013.  The emphasis of the review was to ensure that value for money is achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation. The review broadly reflects the new market trends showing a rise in rent limits in Counties Dublin and Galway and a fall in the majority of rural counties.  Special provisions are made in exceptional circumstances including, for example, people with disabilities in specially adapted accommodation. </p><p>  In general a client who has been reviewed and is required to bring their rents within the required statutory limits is afforded 12 weeks to do this as this may require a renegotiation of rent or a need to source alternative accommodation. The client referred to received notification regarding their rent limit in September 2013. As there has been no rent reduction or alternative accommodation notified to the Department a second notification issued on 14th January 2014 and the Department awaits a response.</p></reply>

These responses definitively addressed the issue raised by the Deputy, making it absolutely clear that a the issue does not arise.  The legislative framework governing inland fisheries is extensive, but quite dated.  While the principal instrument is the 1959 Inland Fisheries Act, there are a myriad of other provisions, and the whole array is a patchwork.  I made clear some time ago my intention to work to bring forward a legislative code fit for the Twenty-first Century and have been working on this with my Department.  This is an extensive project, and an opportunity to modernise a range of measures, including decriminalising minor offences, create a new and better way to clarify fisheries title and overall to better manage the resource.  As part of this review, I organised a series of public information and consultation meetings (Drogheda, Carrick-on-Shannon, Tuam, Clonmel and Dublin), where proposals and options were transparently outlined.  There were of course a range of views, but overall the process was engaged with positively.  I have undertaken to carefully consider points made before developing specific legislative proposals and the submissions received in the course of the public consultation sessions are available on the Department's website, .</p><p>  A question of how funding could be mobilised for the development of the sector was posed as part of this consultation, and it was made clear that any such funding would have to be carefully ring-fenced and returned to individual sub-sectors in proportion to funding raised (coarse angling, Salmon angling, etc.).  Not surprisingly there were diverse views on this, some in support, others disagreeing.  Some have sought to characterise such an approach as a &lsquo;Rod Licence&rsquo; &ndash; I want to make it absolutely clear that no rod licence was proposed, nor is it intended to introduce such a licence.  A funding instrument will only really work if it has very broad support across the angling sector and equally must not be divisive as between the different associations.  I have undertaken to have further stakeholder engagement and will not finalise legislative proposals before this is concluded, I want to repeat, no rod licence has been proposed and neither will such be brought forward by me.  I would reiterate that I am undertaking further stakeholder engagement and will not finalise any legislative proposals before this is concluded.</p></reply>

It is estimated that construction of the onshore section of the pipeline, including the construction of a 5km tunnel, will be completed later this year, with first gas expected in the first half of 2015.  The Corrib gas project will make a significant contribution to the island's security of supply situation.  It is estimated that the project will have an operating life span of between 15 to 20 years and gas production will on average meet 42% of all island gas demand over the first 2 years of operation declining thereafter.  I understand that the bulk of the gas produced from the Corrib field will be supplied to the national grid via the 149km pipeline constructed by Bord G&aacute;is Networks and which runs from the Gas terminal in Bellanaboy Co Mayo to Ballymoneen outside of Galway.</p></reply>

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses.  This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and</p><p>- a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector have continued and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  In the fixed line segment of the market, eircom has announced plans to pass 1.4m premises with its next generation broadband service, with speeds of up to 100Mbps, while UPC has increased its entry level and maximum speeds to 120Mbps and 200Mbps respectively.  Mobile operators have also made announcements regarding network upgrades and are rolling out enhanced product offerings, following the successful multiband spectrum auction last year.  Last week, I introduced legislation in the D&aacute;il, to allow the ESB to utilise its electricity network to install a new high speed broadband communications network.</p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector over the coming years, the results of which will inform the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing.  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched later this year.  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

However, Ireland now has the highest number of petroleum exploration authorisations in place since exploration began in our offshore more than four decades ago.  With new company entrants in 2013 including large independent oil companies such as Cairn Energy, Kosmos Energy and Woodside Energy, together with existing companies such as Eni, ExxonMobil, Petronas, RPS, and Shell, it is evident that there is significant and growing capacity in the sector.  This demonstrates that exploration in the Irish offshore is moving in the right direction.</p><p>  In a similar manner, while the number of active minerals prospecting licences indicate the buoyant state of mineral exploration in Ireland, no new commercially viable deposits of minerals have been discovered in the last five years although there have been some encouraging results, particularly in Counties Limerick and Clare.  However, it is too early to determine whether these results will lead to identification of commercially viable deposits or to estimate the economic benefits that might accrue.</p></reply>

The objective of the Regulations is to protect ground and surface waters, including drinking water sources, primarily through the management of livestock manures and other fertilisers. In accordance with the requirements of the Nitrates Directive, the Regulations include provisions regarding periods when the land application of certain types of fertilisers is prohibited. In addition, the Regulations prohibit such application at any time of the year when the ground is frozen, waterlogged or when heavy rain is forecast. The closed periods in Ireland were decided following extensive consultation and were discussed with farming bodies and the European Commission when Ireland&rsquo;s Nitrates Action Programme was being introduced. They extend from 15 October to 12, 15 or 31 January depending on location in the country.</p><p>  These provisions are underpinned by scientific advice and good agricultural practice. Scientific research carried out on a diverse range of farm and soil types as part of Teagasc&rsquo;s on-going Agricultural Catchments Programme has provided further evidence in support of the efficacy of the land spreading closed season in reducing nutrient losses to waters. Good agricultural practice involves the application of fertilisers at a time when grass and other plants are growing actively in order to maximise the uptake of nutrients by crops and to minimise pollution to water. In this regard, the application of fertilisers at time of limited growth is not considered good farming practice and this has been the case long before the Regulations came into force in Ireland.   </p></reply>

The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group and assigned the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake the metering programme.  The current water meter installation programme commenced in August 2013 and the approved budget for the programme is &euro;539 million (excluding VAT) which includes the supply of materials and the installation work by contractors operating in eight regions.   </p><p>Regional main contractors were appointed by Irish Water following a public tendering process.

The organisation needs to be appropriately resourced to fulfil this task and will not be over-staffed. Irish Water is currently recruiting to build up the required internal capabilities and the number of staff employed is an operational matter for the organisation. It was agreed by the Steering Group for the Water Sector Reform programme that, to ensure skills within the sector were fully availed of in building up the new organisation, competitions for positions in asset management, capital delivery and operations would be restricted to staff in the partner organisations i.e. Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, local authorities and my Department in the first instance. Open competitions are held for all other positions and details of these are available on Irish Water&rsquo;s website.</p><p>  Data supplied by Irish Water indicate that at present 310 staff appointments have been made in Irish Water. In total 107 staff from the local authority sector have been employed and are based in the following area offices: <table><tr><th>Region </th><th>Office </th><th>No. </th></tr><tr><td>HQ Dublin </td><td>HQ </td><td>47 </td></tr><tr><td>East &amp;amp; Midlands </td><td>Foley St. </td><td>12 </td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>Mullingar </td><td>7 </td></tr><tr><td>South </td><td>Limerick </td><td>7 </td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>Kilkenny </td><td>3 </td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>Mallow </td><td>10 </td></tr><tr><td>North &amp;amp; West </td><td>Cavan </td><td>4 </td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>Castlebar </td><td>13 </td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>Donegal </td><td>4 </td></tr></table>My Department is currently finalising the Budget for operational costs for 2014 with Irish Water which will determine the overall staffing costs. The final number of staff employed directly by Irish Water will be determined having regard to the agreed funding model and the regulation process which takes full account of comparators with other similar utilities. </p><p>  Irish Water has entered into service level agreements (SLA) with each of the 34 authorities for the provision of water services. Staff in local authorities conducting work under these arrangements will remain local authority employees. The SLA reflects the transformation agenda required for the sector, with provision for annual service plans which will set out required performance, budgets and headcount. The length of the service level agreement and the fact that the agreement will include a programme of change are reflected in a Framework document, agreed with the Trade Unions under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, and which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. This agreement, and the Water Services No.2 Act, 2013 provides that, in the event of a SLA coming to an end, the staff covered by that agreement will become Irish Water employees and their terms and conditions and superannuation arrangements will be protected by legislation. </p></reply>

However the headcount provided for Water Services under the SLAs for 2014 is 4319.6 full time equivalents subject to alignment with the budgets notified by Irish Water to each local authority. A table detailing this headcount by authority is set out below. This headcount will be reviewed each year as part of the preparation and approval of the following year's Annual Service Plan.

Section 21 <i>(Retrospective Vetting)</i>  of the Act provides that the Minister may make regulations to prescribe periods of time within which certain classes of existing employees who have not already been vetted will have to be vetted. </p><p>  Where persons return from long term leave-of-absence, the employer will have to consider whether or not they have a vetting disclosure and whether or not any vetting disclosure is sufficiently up to date, before re-employing the person.  Where persons already vetted have been absent for a short period such as a few weeks, there is no re-vetting requirement other than that contained in section 20 (<i>Re-vetting) </i>of the 2012 Act.  That section provides that the Minister may make regulations to prescribe intervals of time within which certain classes of employee will have to be re-vetted.</p></reply>

In general, prisoners may be granted  temporary release to assess a person's ability to reintegrate into society, to prepare him or her for release, to assist the Garda&iacute;, on grounds of health, on other humanitarian grounds, and to ensure the good government and management of prisons.</p><p>  A prisoner may apply through the Prison Governor for consideration for temporary release.  Their family or legal representative can also apply for consideration of such a concession.  It does not necessarily follow however that a prisoner will receive temporary release even if the recommendation made by the prison authorities and/or therapeutic services is to that effect.  Each application is considered on its individual merits and evaluated using the criteria outlined in the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act, 2003.</p><p>  All prisoners on temporary release are subject to conditions and are returned to prison if their behaviour gives rise to concern.  Public safety is the paramount consideration in any decision on granting temporary release.</p></reply>

Local authorities were informed last Autumn that the maximum contribution payable from my Department with effect from 1 October 2013 is &euro;450 per horse seized.

Since this date the staff of the former NEWB, including its Education Welfare Officers, have transferred to the new Agency. The three service strands formerly under the remit of NEWB &ndash; the statutory Educational Welfare Service and the School Support programme services (Home-School Community Liaison Scheme and the School Completion Programme) under the DEIS strategy &ndash; collectively form the Educational Welfare Services of the new Agency.</p><p>  Within the Child and Family Agency, the statutory Education Welfare Service (EWS) has specific responsibility for the Agency&rsquo;s general function to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. The EWS has a current staffing complement of 74 officers delivering front line services, 2 of whom have duties in relation to the assessment of education in places other than recognised schools. </p><p>  The Agency has advised me that nationally there are 70.86 whole time equivalent Educational Welfare Officers employed in the Educational Welfare Service (12 of whom are Senior Educational Welfare Officers and 3 are Regional Managers), while there are 21.88 whole time equivalent Educational Welfare Officers employed within the Greater Dublin Area (3 of whom are Senior Educational Welfare Officers and 1 is a Regional Manager).  Vacancies that arise in staffing front line services for children and young people at risk of early school leaving will be prioritised by the Agency, in consultation with my Department, in so far as possible working within Government policy on public service numbers and the moratorium on recruitment. </p><p>  I am advised by the Agency that the EWS worked with over 20,000 children in 2012, of which 2,420 were intensive interventions which required sustained support from an Education Welfare Officer and a multidisciplinary approach in order to address the complex barriers to school attendance. </p><p>  The Child and Family Agency will deliver an integrated approach to educational welfare services through the continued reform of work practices in its three service strands, namely; the Education Welfare Service (EWS); Home School Community Liaison Programme (HSCL &ndash; 402 school-based co-ordinators); and School Completion Programme (SCP &ndash; &euro;26.456m in funding provided to support 124 school cluster projects and related initiatives). This integrated model of service will provide an enhanced response to the needs of children, families and schools. Education welfare interventions will also be aligned with the overall assessment processes under the National Service Delivery Framework. As part of this process the Agency is also reviewing the basis on which the EWS is configured and a consultation process is underway with staff to reconfigure services based on the needs of children and young people. This strategic national approach is a crucial reform in our efforts to improve school attendance, participation and retention. </p><p>The decision by Government to amalgamate the NEWB and its services into the new Child and Family Agency broadens the focus of the Agency and tackles educational welfare as a key outcome for children in its own right and as a positive contributor to other outcomes. It will provide opportunities for more effective working amongst the range of professionals involved in directly supporting children and their families.</p></reply>

It is also an uncertain time for patients.  I know that the HSE is working with the hospital to ensure that patients&rsquo; needs are met in the short term and they will also endeavour to support staff in their efforts to secure alternative employment. </p><p>  In terms of the capacity of the HSE to deal with the additional service demands arising from the closure of the hospital, it is noted that birth rates have fallen significantly in recent years and the CSO projects that they will continue to fall at least until the early 2020s.  Furthermore, following detailed consideration, the Department of Health and the HSE agreed that to buy the hospital as a going concern would unnecessarily expose the HSE and the State to very obvious and significant financial risks and would not be in line with current Government policy on maternity services.</p><p>  During 2013, the HSE secured additional treatment capacity where necessary in both public and private hospitals, including Mount Carmel.  It should be noted, however, that the projected number of treatments outsourced in all of these facilities represented less than 1% of the total number of annual scheduled out-patients appointments and 0.47% of the total number of inpatient and day-case appointments undertaken nationally. </p><p>  Currently, arrangements are being made with alternative hospitals so as to ensure as seamless a transition as possible for patients in accordance with their choice. </p></reply>

Because of the case-by-case nature of the process, it is time-consuming and administratively burdensome.  </p><p>  The <i><font color="#212100">Code of Conduct on National Administrative Practices falling under Directive 2005/36/EC </font></i><font color="#212100">provides for the charging of fees for the application process once, inter alia, such fees do not exceed the </font>real cost of the service provided, or are not set at a level which would make it impossible in practice to exercise the rights provided for under the Directive.  As the ISCP has been designated competent authority under S.I. 166 of 2008, it is a matter for the Society to set its own fee for qualification recognition having regard to the Code of Conduct.  I am advised by the ISCP that the fee has been set at &euro;500 since 1 August  2007. </p></reply>

The Directive seeks to ensure a clear and transparent framework for the provision of cross-border healthcare within the EU, for those occasions where the care patients seek is provided in another Member State rather than in their home country.  However, it should be emphasised that the vast majority of EU patients receive healthcare in their own country and prefer to do so.  The Department of Health is continuing to work on the necessary statutory provisions to fully implement the Directive.  Nevertheless, there are arrangements in place in respect of the key provision of the Directive in relation to a national contact point (NCP), which has been set up within the HSE &ndash; the email address is crossborderdirective@hse.ie.</p><p>  The principle function of the NCP is to facilitate exchange of information for patients concerning their rights and entitlements relating to receiving healthcare in another Member State, in particular the terms and conditions for reimbursement of cost, the procedures for accessing and determining those entitlements.  The NCP also has a responsibility to ensure that all enquirers are informed of the rights, if any, that they may have through the legislation on the coordination of social security schemes (regulation 883/04) and which may be more beneficial to them.   The NCP will be able to inform patients what the cost of their treatments would be in Ireland to allow them make a comparison with the costs they are being quoted for comparable treatment in another Member State.</p><p>  While it has been possible to have these aspects of the NCP up and running by the 25<sup>th</sup>   October on an administrative basis, it has not been possible to have prior authorisation or reimbursement operating on a statutory basis. The Department is working on the legal arrangements to put in place the statutory provisions for these systems and will be implementing them as soon as possible.  Further information on the Ireland's implementation of the Directive is available on the NCP's webpage: .</p></reply>

There were an additional 143 consultants (WTE's) employed at the end of December 2013 compared with the end of December 2010. </p><p>  The HSE advised my Department at the start of this week that 104 posts had been advertised at the reduced rates and that, to-date, 36 posts had been filled under these rates. Other posts are at various stages of the recruitment process. It has not been possible to recruit candidates for 15 posts. </p><p>  It is appreciated that the 30% reduction decided in September 2012 for future &lsquo;new entrant&rsquo; appointments represented a substantial reduction in the rate of pay for consultants. However, it was a necessary measure, given the challenging economic circumstances. If the health services are to continue to provide consultant-level opportunities for doctors this can only happen on the basis of a lower-cost model.</p><p>  It should be noted that there are some specialities in which there is an international shortage of consultants and which have traditionally been difficult to fill, regardless of the salary scale. There are also some hospitals to which it has been difficult to attract applicants &ndash; in particular smaller hospitals that have onerous rosters due to the limited number of consultants. The establishment of the Hospital Groups will assist in addressing this difficulty.</p><p>  I have already stated that consultants who move posts and consultants coming from abroad should have their experience and specialist training recognised. The HSE has submitted initial views to my Department in relation to recognising such experience and training.</p></reply>

This report also outlined the NAS  review of the call, setting out that it was triaged correctly, that the nearest available resources were dispatched and that the call was handled appropriately. </p><p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority, as part of its Business Plan for 2014, and in line with its programme for the monitoring of the National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare, will review governance and management arrangements for pre-hospital emergency care services. This review will include call-handling, response, assessment, diagnosis, care and transportation of the acutely ill patient to the appropriate healthcare facility.  The review had been due to commence in the 2nd quarter of 2014.  However, in light of a number of recent incidents, I requested that the Authority bring this review forward and it was agreed to commence the review in quarter 1.  I understand that the review will focus initially on the governance arrangements for the service and how those arrangements translate into the safety, quality and effectiveness of services for patients. </p><p>  I would also like to inform the Deputy that the NAS is undertaking its own capacity review to determine current and future service delivery needs.  This process will examine a number of areas, including staff numbers and skill mix, as well as resource distribution.</p></reply>

Of this, Cavan County Council has been allocated &euro;8.975 million and Monaghan County Council has been allocated &euro;6.9 million.</p><p>  With regard to national roads, details of the allocations to each local authority is a matter for the National Roads Authority.</p><p>  Noting the above position, I have referred the Deputy&rsquo;s question to the NRA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you don&rsquo;t receive a reply within 10 working days.</p></reply>
